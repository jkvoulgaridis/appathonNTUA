  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall aim of this research is to investigate the acute effects of resistance exercise
      (REx) on the hormonal and behavioral indices of energy balance regulation in breast cancer
      survivors. This pilot study is designed to provide preliminary data to support future
      exercise interventions with more comprehensive energy balance profiling.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After screening, eligible and consented participants will complete baseline evaluations of
      REE, body composition, and subjective questionnaires to assess energy balance. Eligible and
      interested individuals will attend an exercise familiarization session in the two weeks
      before the initial study visit. Individuals will then be randomized to either sedentary
      control/REx or REx/sedentary control in a 1:1. A washout period of approximately 7-14 days
      will separate testing sessions.

      A randomized cross-over short-term study design was chosen to assessment to profile appetite,
      energy intake, and physical activity in controlled and free-living settings while also
      reducing participant burden (as opposed to a long-term intervention). Participants will serve
      as their own controls, thereby circumventing inter-individual variation in physiology that
      may confound results. It is anticipated that responses to acute exercise will be amplified in
      chronic interventions and may therefore be used as a basis for generating hypotheses on the
      regulation of certain energy balance components. The study will end after the completion of 3
      days of dietary intake recall and physical activity measurement for the last participant.

    <description>REx condition: Participants will complete a whole-body REx workout consisting of 1-set to failure (e.g. RPE of 9-10 on 10-point scale on final reps) on 12 exercises in the Exercise Research Laboratory (located in the CTRC), with a 3-minute rest between exercises. Participants will complete the following exercises: leg press; leg extension; leg curl; hip abduction; hip adduction; chest press; overhead press; seated row; overheard pulldowns and assisted triceps dips on Cybex resistance equipment; barbell calf raises on a Smith machine; and dumbbell biceps curls. Resistance for the REx trial will be determined based on the exercise familiarization session. Specifically, we will target a resistance level needed for each participant to complete ~12-15 repetitions per exercise, using proper form, with an RPE of 9-10 on a 10-point scale on final reps. This protocol eliminates the need for max testing in order to set an exercise protocol off of a specific intensity based on % of 1RM.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Female sex

          -  Age: 18 - 45 years, since older age may impact appetite regulation45-47 and women &gt;45
             are more likely to have begun the menopausal transition (estrogen relates to appetite
             and eating behavior)

          -  Body mass index [BMI]: 25 - 35 kg/m2. Since body composition and body mass relate to
             appetite regulation and energy intake, a narrow BMI range should decrease
             heterogeneity within the results. The BMI range was chosen to represent a population
             at risk for developing obesity and associated comorbidities, while also excluding
             individuals with severe obesity (which may plausibly significantly impact energy
             intake regulation).

          -  Pre-menopausal before cancer diagnosis and treatment

          -  &lt;1 hour/week of planned physical activity by self-report in the previous 12 months,

             participants seated quietly), untreated/uncontrolled thyroid disease, or any other
             medical condition affecting weight or energy metabolism. Participants who are deemed
             ineligible based upon uncontrolled hypertension criteria will be referred to their

          -  Corticosteroid use within the last two weeks

          -  History of surgical procedure for weight loss at any time (e.g. gastroplasty, gastric

             history of extensive bowel resection for other reasons

          -  Currently pregnant, lactating or less than 6 months post-partum.

             include drug use

          -  Score of &gt; 20 on the Eating Attitude Test - 26 (EATS-26), indicative of disordered
             eating. Participants with a score &gt;20 on the EATS-26 will be referred to their primary
             care physician for further evaluation.

          -  Significant food intolerances/allergies that cannot be accommodated by the University
             of Colorado Hospital Clinical Translational Research Center (CTRC) Metabolic Kitchen.

          -  Currently participating in any formal weight loss or physical activity programs or
             clinical trials for weight loss.
