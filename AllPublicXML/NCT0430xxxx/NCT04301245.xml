  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) has proven its efficacy to improve dyspnea, health status,
      exercise tolerance and quality of life for patients with stable Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary
      Disease (COPD). Exercise training has previously been thoroughly studied but education has
      been less studied in PR. Furthermore, only few studies have investigated the added value of
      an educational program (EP) to exercise training on clinical and physical factors.
      Characterizing those patients who refuse EP is therefore a first step to better target them
      and potentially improve their adherence and outcome following PR.

      The aim of this study was to determine the characteristics of the COPD patients referred to
      PR who refused EP compare to those who accepted and to identify the independent predictive
      factors of refusal. The investigators also sought to compare the change in clinical outcomes
      and number and length of hospitalization at six months following PR among those patients who
      accepted or not to participate in EP.
