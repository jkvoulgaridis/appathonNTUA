    <masking_description>The treatment in this study was open. Optical density turbidimetric platelet aggregation (LTA) and thromboelastography (TEG) were used to detect the platelet aggregation rate induced by AA and ADP, and the metabolites were measured by ELISA. All were done by the laboratory personnel, and they were unaware of the setting of treatment medication (blind method).</masking_description>
