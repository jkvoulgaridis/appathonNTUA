  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a systemic autoimmune disease in which inflammation and fibrosis
      play a crucial role and lead to severe damage and failure of multiple organs such as the
      skin, joints, tendons, gastrointestinal tract, lungs, heart, blood vessels, and kidneys. It
      primarily affects women but disease is often more severe in males

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a multisystem life-threatening fibrosing disorder that lacks
      effective treatment. The link between the inflammation observed in organs such as the skin
      and profibrotic mechanisms is not well understood.

      Dendritic cells (DCs) are antigen-presenting cells that sense pathogens and present
      pathogen-derived peptides to T and B cells, thus triggering and influencing adaptive immune
      responses. In humans, dendritic cells are most commonly divided into two classes:
      plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) and conventional dendritic cells (cDCs).

      Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) are type of immune cell that are known to secrete large
      quantities of type 1 interferon (IFNs) in response to a viral infection). However, pDCs are
      also responsible for participating in and exacerbating certain autoimmune diseases. Activated
      pDCs have been observed to accumulate in the skin of SSc patients , contributing to skin
      fibrosis in systemic sclerosis, largely through activation of Toll-like receptor 8 (TLR8),
      which is not normally expressed in these cells.

      TLR8 transgenic mice have more skin fibrosis, thicker skin, higher levels of infiltrating
      pDCs and higher mRNA expression of inflammatory genes, suggesting an important function of
      TLR8 in promoting inflammatory responses and fibrosis.
