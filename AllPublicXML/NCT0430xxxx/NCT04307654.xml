      Background. Cytoreduction surgery has been developed as a treatment of peritoneal
      carcinomatosis. However, this surgery is associated with important complications. The present
      study attempts to assess the relationship between lactacidemia levels and the rate of
      associated complications in patients undergoing cytoreduction surgery during the immediate
      postoperative period in a critical unit.

      Methods. Retrospective observational study. 57 patients underwent cytoreduction surgery
      during the years 2014 and 2015 at the General University Hospital of Castellón. All patients
      were admitted to the critical unit immediately after surgery. Lactacidemia levels at the time
      of admission and discharge from the critical unit were collected. Post-surgical complications
      that appeared during the stay in the critical unit were recorded and classified according to
      the Clavien-Dindo classification.

      Lactacidemia levels were still significantly higher in this group at the time of discharge.
