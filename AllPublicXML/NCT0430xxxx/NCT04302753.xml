  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Research highlights strong links between self-compassion and mental health, but there is very
      limited research specifically exploring autistic individual's experiences of self-compassion.
      The process of receiving a diagnosis on the autism spectrum can be complex and autistic women
      tend to experience several barriers to diagnosis. This study adds to the growing area of
      research exploring autistic women's experiences of receiving a diagnosis in adulthood. This
      study employs Interpretative phenomenological analysis to explore if receiving a diagnosis of
      Autism influences women's perceptions of self-compassion. The findings may inform
      client-centred practices in health care settings and potentially present positive aspects of
      autism diagnosis.
