    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to explore the correlation between postoperative recovery of
      liver function and gut microbiota in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Liver
      resection patients were divided into the recovery group and the recovery delay group
      according to the recovery level of liver function on the fifth day after the operation.
      Benign liver disease was used as a control. Statistical analysis was performed to compare the
      differences in gut microbiota between the three groups. Then, fecal microbiota
      transplantation was performed in a mouse hepatectomy model. Through this study, we hope to
      understand the relationship between gut microbiota and postoperative recovery of liver
      function in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, so as to provide a new therapeutic
      direction for patients in the aspect of perioperative liver function recovery.

    <textblock>
      Primary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common malignant tumors in the
      world. At present, surgery is the first choice and the most effective way to treat it. Based
      on the case review, we found that the recovery rate of perioperative liver function was
      correlated with survival. Therefore, it is of great clinical significance to improve the
      recovery rate of postoperative liver function. Gut microbiota participate in many
      physiological activities of human body, such as metabolic regulation, immune homeostasis and
      hormone regulation. However, gut microbiota imbalance, excessive growth of pathogenic
      microorganisms and changes in intestinal mucosal permeability lead to intestinal bacterial
      ectopia and bacterial metabolites entering the liver through enterohepatic circulation. The
      continuous inflammatory stimulation aggravate the progress of liver disease. Therefore, it is
      helpful to explore the influence of gut microbiota on postoperative liver function recovery
      and find out the different microbiota, in order to improve the postoperative liver function
      recovery rate, shorten the perioperative hospital stay and prolong the survival of patients.

      According to the recovery level of liver function on the fifth day after the operation, liver
      resection patients on HCC were divided into the recovery group and the recovery delay group
      which comparing on the time point of before the surgery and five days after the surgery. The
      patients on benign liver disease were used as a control. We attempt to identify the
      differential microbiota and validate this finding in a mouse hepatectomy model.
