      This study aims at estimating the proportion of patients diagnosed with locoregional renal
      cell carcinoma who are at high risk for recurrence following nephrectomy, describe referral
      patterns, and characterize treatment in this population. Outcomes including estimation of the
      incidence of recurrence and disease-free interval following nephrectomy will be reported
      overall and among the subgroup off patients receiving adjuvant systemic therapy with
      sunitinib following nephrectomy.
