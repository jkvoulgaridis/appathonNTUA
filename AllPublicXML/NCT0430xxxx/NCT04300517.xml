  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Protein intake in spinal fusion surgery can prevent paraspinal muscle atrophy by maintaining
      muscle mass, regeneration, and growth. Also, by reducing the amount of pseudarthrosis, pain
      and disability can have a positive effect on recovery.

      The high prevalence of this type of surgery, the instability and degeneration of adjacent
      surfaces of fused sections, lumbar muscle atrophy, increased muscle tissue fat, and negative
      impact on patient recovery, also with regard to the fact that research has so far aimed to
      determine The effect of protein supplementation on para-spinal muscles has not been studied
      in patients undergoing posterior lumbar spine fusion surgery, therefore clinical trials are
      necessary. In this trial patients undergoing elective posterior spine fusion surgery are
      divided into two groups of intervention or control.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A randomized, double blind, controlled trial will be conducted in patients undergoing
      elective posterior spine fusion surgery in Tehran, Iran. After a full review of the inclusion
      and exclusion criteria and explanation of the risks and benefits of the study, written
      consent form will be completed. The participants are 80 eligible posterior spine fusion
      surgery patients, aged ≥ 18 years. Intervention patients will be received 36 grams of protein
      supplement along with diet containing 1.2 g/kg/day of protein for 30 days after surgery and
      control patients will be received maltodextrin along with diet containing 1.2 g/kg/day of
      protein 30 days after surgery. Patients will be evaluated for occurrence of paraspinal
      muscles after 3 months surgery
