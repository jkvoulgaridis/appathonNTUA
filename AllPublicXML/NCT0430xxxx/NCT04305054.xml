  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Substudy 02B is part of a larger research study that is testing experimental treatments for
      melanoma, a type of skin cancer. The larger study is the umbrella study.

      The goal of substudy 02B is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of investigational treatment
      arms in participants with 1L advanced melanoma and to identify the investigational agent(s)
      that, when used in combination, are superior to the current treatment options/pembrolizumab
      monotherapy.

    <measure>Objective Response Rate (ORR) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 1.1 (RECIST 1.1)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to ~30 months</time_frame>
    <description>ORR is defined as the percentage of participants in the analysis population who have a complete response (CR: disappearance of all target lesions) or partial response (PR: at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters). Responses are according to RECIST 1.1 as assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR). RECIST 1.1 has been modified for this study to include a maximum of 10 target lesions and a maximum of 5 target lesions per organ.</description>

    <description>For participants in the analysis population who demonstrate a confirmed CR (disappearance of all target lesions) or confirmed PR (at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters), DOR is defined as the time from first documented evidence of CR or PR until progressive disease (PD) or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. Responses are according to RECIST 1.1 as assessed by BICR. RECIST 1.1 has been modified for this study to include a maximum of 10 target lesions and a maximum of 5 target lesions per organ.</description>
