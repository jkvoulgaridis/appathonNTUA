             therapy that could affect drug absorption or metabolism, or any other disorder or
             history of a condition that could interfere with drug absorption, distribution,
             metabolism, or excretion

         10. Known family history of congenital prolongation of the QTc interval or sudden death or
             with any other clinical condition known to be associated with prolongation of the QTc
             interval such as history of symptomatic cardiac arrhythmias, with clinically relevant
             bradycardia or with severe cardiac disease

         11. Disturbances of electrolyte balance (e.g. hypokalaemia or hypomagnesaemia)

         12. Presence of any age-adjusted clinically or hematologically relevant laboratory and
             blood chemistry abnormalities

         13. Patients who received any antimalarial drug, including antibiotics with antimalarial
             activity, within 14 days of trial start, or any other prohibited drug (see Table 6-2)

         14. Patients who received an investigational drug within 5 half-lives of enrollment or
             participated in an investigational study or within 30 days, whichever is longer
