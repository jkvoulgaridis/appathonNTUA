  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The human foot is a complex structure, which serves functions such as support and mobility.
      These functions are accomplished through the deformation of the arch, which is controlled by
      intrinsic and extrinsic foot muscles. The intrinsic muscles have an important role in dynamic
      stabilization of the foot due to their structurally short force levers and small diameters.
      There are many studies reporting that foot intrinsic muscle weakness is directly related to
      pathologies such as structural or functional toe deformities, pes planus, hallux valgus,
      plantar fasciitis .Therefore it is essential to evaluate the strength of these muscles in an
      objective and reliable way.

    <textblock>
      Two different methods are used in measuring muscle strength via a Hand Held Dynamometer; the
      &quot;break test&quot; and the &quot;make test&quot; . During these tests, the examiner and subject play opposite
      roles. During the make test, the subject applies maximal force against the examiner and the
      position is maintained by the examiner. During the break test, the subject holds the position
      of the muscle being evaluated and the examiner pushes until the subject's maximal force is
      overcome. In the two tests, force is applied differently; the dynamometer receives different
      amounts of force, and different results may be generated. Therefore, the aim of this study
      was to compare the reliability of intrinsic foot muscle strength assessment with break and
      make test in healthy young subjects.

    <description>Healthy subjects aged 18-35 years were enrolled in this study. The muscle strength assessment of the foot intrinsic muscles was assessed with the make test and the break test. The tests were performed with the hip and knee semiflexed in prone position with a hand-held dynamometer. The experimental protocols and methods were explained in detail to all subjects. All participants provided written informed consent in keeping with the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki.</description>

    <description>For the make test, the examiner applies resistance in a fixed position and the person being tested exerts a maximum effort against the dynamometer and examiner. The examiner is only required to sustain an isometric contraction and read the highest value on an Hand Held Dynamometer.</description>

    <description>For the break test, the examiner applies resistance sufficient to overcome the maximum effort of the person being tested and cause the subject's joint to move in the opposite direction, which results in an eccentric contraction. During this test the limb must move at a constant velocity while the person being tested is asked to achieve a maximum contraction. In addition, the examiner must read the force output reading at the exact time the subject's limb begins to move from the Hand Held Dynamometer.</description>
