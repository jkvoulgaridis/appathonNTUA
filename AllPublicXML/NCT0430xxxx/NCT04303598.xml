  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Azvudine,(FNC)， new nuclear nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, FNC make itself a
      better candidate to be co-formulated in other anti-HIV therapies, thus to improve patient's
      compliance, approved by state drug administration (NMPA) for clinical research. FNC has
      completed its phase I、II clinical studies with desirable results.This is a multi-center,
      randomized, double-blind,double-placebo,active-control clinical trial. Subjects in
      experimental arm receives FNC+TDF+EFV+3TC placebo, while the subjected in active control arm
      receives 3TC+TDF+EFV+FNC placebo. The background drugs in both arms are conducted in
      open-label design while FNC and 3TC are conducted in double-blinded design.

    <masking_description>The experiment was conducted under a randomized method, each center disputed into the group via competition. Treatment assignment was carried out in accordance with a central randomization schedule generated with SAS (version 9.4). Randomization was done by a computer-generated system (IWRS). The randomization table (1st blind code) and second blind code were sealed and stored in triplicate offices of the sponsor, investigator and the independent statistician.</masking_description>
