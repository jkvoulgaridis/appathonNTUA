  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Guidelines development, their implementation and the physicians' adherence may have an impact
      on the occurrence of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) exacerbations and patient's
      quality of life. We have developed an educational program based on a checklist to assist
      general practitioners in managing COPD patients. The results of this trial based on
      electronic health records from BIG DATA databases, such as the electronic health record (EHR)
      of patients from the National Health Found, associated with checklist, will be directly
      applicable to primary care in Poland and add new data to the growing body of evidence on
      interventions to improve chronic illness care and patient's quality of life.

      This study is the three-arm cluster controlled randomized trial (CRT) with the patients
      nested within practices. The effectiveness of Checklist in reduction of COPD exacerbations
      health outcomes in COPD patients after 2 interventions will be evaluated and compared to that
      of usual care. The results of this trial will be directly applicable to primary care in
      Poland and add new data to the growing body of evidence on interventions to improve chronic
      illness care.
