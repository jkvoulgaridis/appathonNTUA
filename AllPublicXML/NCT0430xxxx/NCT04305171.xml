  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The research question was to investigate whether non-surgical periodontal therapy could
      reduce cardiovascular risk markers in Coronary heart disease (CHD) patients.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CHD patients or non-CHD with or without periodontitis were included. They were provided with
      non-surgical periodontal therapy (NSPT). Periodontal parameters and cardiovascular risk
      markers were measured at baseline and 3 months and 6 months after NSPT.
