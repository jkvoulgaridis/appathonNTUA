  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      ach year, it is estimated that an average of approximately 219,000 women in France suffer
      physical and/or sexual violence at the hands of their partner or ex-partner. These figures do
      not take into account other types of violence such as psychological or economic violence.
      Domestic violence has a major impact on the physical, sexual and psychological health of
      women victims. For example, the prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder in these women
      varies between 33 and 84%, with an average prevalence of 61%, compared with only 2.2% in the
      French population as a whole. Multidisciplinary medical, social and legal support for these
      women is essential. In France, there are major territorial disparities in terms of the
      distribution of facilities for victims of domestoc violence, and not all women victims have
      the same access to care depending on their place of residence.

      The Maison des Femmes in St Denis has been open since 2016. It offers a unique range of
      sanitary, social and judicial services through cooperation with police and justice
      departments, for women who have been subjected to any type of violence.

      This facility is unique in France, and the number of consultations continues to increase, and
      was more than 8,500 in 2018. The Maison des Femmes model is intended to be exported to other
      departments, but first the model needs to be validated, beyond its obvious attractiveness
      (illustrated by the number of consultations and the fact that it attracts women from
      throughout the Ile de France region) by comparing it to other facilities in terms of its
      effect on the management of the women.

      This is a cross-sectional prevalence study that estimates the frequency of post-traumatic
      stress disorder among women who are victims of domestic violence who used the services
      offered at the Maison des Femmes or other dedicated structures, at the initial consultation
      and 6 months later.
