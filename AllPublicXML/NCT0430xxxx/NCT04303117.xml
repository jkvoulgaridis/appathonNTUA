  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      Kaposi sarcoma (KS) tumors grow on the skin, lymph nodes, lungs, bone, and gastrointestinal
      tract. KS often affects people with immune deficiencies, such as among people living with HIV
      or those with prior history of transplant. Researchers want to see if 2 non-chemotherapy
      drugs can help people with KS. NHS-IL12 triggers the immune system to fight tumors. M7824
      blocks the pathways that cancer cells use to stop the immune system from fighting tumors.

      Objective:

      To learn if giving NHS-IL12 alone or with M7824 could help the immune system fight KS tumors.

      Eligibility:

      People 18 and older with KS that has been treated with chemotherapy or immunotherapy

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with some or all of the following:

      medical history

      physical exam

      chest X-ray

      computed tomography scan

      blood and urine tests

      electrocardiogram and echocardiogram

      skin KS lesion biopsy

      lung exam

      gastrointestinal exam

      All participants will get NHS-IL12 every 4 weeks for 24 weeks. It is injected under the skin.

      Some participants will also get M7824 every 2 weeks for 24 weeks. It is given through a
      plastic tube that is put in an arm vein.

      Participants will complete questionnaires about how KS affects their quality of life. Their
      KS lesions will be measured and photographed. They will repeat some of the screening tests.
      They will give saliva samples or additional tissue samples. They will have a lung function
      test. Their ability to perform their normal activities will be assessed. The treatment
      duration is 24 weeks with an option to take NHS-IL12 and/or M7824 for an extra 24 weeks.

      Participants will have follow-up visits 7 and 30 days after treatment ends, then every 3 to 6
      months for the next 18 months, then once a year for 3 years....

      Background:

        -  Kaposi Sarcoma (KS) is a multicentric angioproliferative tumor, caused by Kaposi
           sarcoma-associated herpesvirus, that most frequently involves the skin, but may also
           involve lymph nodes, lungs, bone and gastrointestinal tract. It is most common in people
           with HIV but may also occur in patients without a diagnosis of HIV. Patients with
           HIVassociated KS have worse survival than HIV-infected patients without KS.

        -  As it is a relapsing and remitting condition, patients with KS often require prolonged
           courses of cytotoxic chemotherapy.

        -  KS is an immune responsive tumor as interferon-alpha, pomalidomide, and restoring Tcell
           function in HIV + patients treated with antiretroviral drugs can result in clinical
           benefit and remission of KS.

        -  Published Phase I/II studies by our group demonstrated that IL-12 alone and in
           combination with liposomal doxorubicin led to clinical responses in patients with
           advanced KS.

        -  NHS-IL12 (M9241) is an immunocytokine with affinity to both single and double stranded
           DNA allowing for targeting of exposed DNA, which is commonly seen in necrotic tumors.
           This agent is able to deliver IL-12 to the tumor microenvironment promoting local
           immunomodulation, that results in less systemic toxicity than IL-12 systemic
           administration.

        -  M7824 is a novel bifunctional fusion protein composed of a monoclonal antibody against
           human PD-L1 (avelumab) fused with the extracellular domain of human TGF-beta receptor II
           (TGF- RII), which functions as a TGF-beta trap .

        -  Anti-PD-L1 and anti-PD-1 agents have been found to be active in certain virus-induced
           cancers, including Kaposi sarcoma, and to be safe and active in patients with HIV
           infection.

        -  Currently, no clinical data exists for the combination of NHS-IL12 and M7824.
           Preclinical data suggest synergy between these agents from existing ongoing studies and
           the available clinical data both in KS and other tumor subtypes suggest that the
           combination of NHSIL12 with M7824 is likely to be well-tolerated and has scientific
           rationale. This combination offers a new treatment approach for patients with advanced
           KS who have received prior therapies.

      Objectives:

      -Evaluate the safety and tolerability of single agent NHS-IL12 and the combination of NHSIL12
      with M7824 in patients with advanced KS.

      Eligibility:

        -  Age &gt;18 years

        -  Histologically confirmed Kaposi sarcoma (KS)

        -  KS requiring systemic therapy, with a history of prior systemic therapy:

             -  2 weeks from last chemotherapy

             -  4 weeks from last immunotherapy

        -  At least five measurable cutaneous KS lesions with no previous local radiation, surgical
           or intralesional cytotoxic therapy to these measurable lesions.

        -  ECOG Performance Status (PS) less than or equal to 2

        -  Patient must be willing to give informed consent.

        -  Patients can be HIV positive or negative.

        -  Antiretroviral therapy (ART) for HIV+ patients for 8 or more weeks prior to entry with
           an HIV viral load of &lt;400 copies/ml and CD4+ T-cell count &gt;50 cells/microliter.

        -  Patients with bleeding from visceral sites of KS or requiring blood transfusions in the
           2 weeks prior to study entry will not be eligible.

      Design:

        -  This is a Phase I/II study assessing the safety and efficacy of NHS-IL12 alone or in
           combination with M7824 in patients with advanced KS. Patients will receive therapy until
           optimal tumor response, unacceptable toxicity, the patient s request to discontinue
           therapy, PI decision, or 24 weeks of treatment. Patients on both arms will have the
           option of an additional 24 weeks of treatment, if they are deriving clinical benefit

        -  Monotherapy: Patients will receive NHS-IL12 alone with a 3+3 design applicable to the
           first 3-6 patients at a starting dose of 16.8 microgram/kg on day 1 of a 28-day cycle.
           Two dose de-escalation levels (Dose Level -1: 12 microgram/kg or Dose Level -2: 8
           microgram/kg) will be permitted if there is evidence of 2 or more dose limiting
           toxicities within the first 6 weeks of therapy.

        -  Combination Therapy: The combination arm will open following accrual and completion of
           the the DLT period for patients in the monotherapy arm. Up to 28 patients will be
           treated with M7824 (1200 mg IV, every 2 weeks) and NHS-IL12 (MTD dose from the
           monotherapy arm). The DLT period for this arm will be 6 weeks.
