  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Type 2 diabetes is associated with diabetic cognopathy, the prevalence of Alzheimer's
      Disease(AD) in T2DM patients is 1.5 to 2.5 times higher than the general population.
      Cognitive impairment seriously affects the health and quality of life of the elderly.
      Prevention and treatment measures for cognitive decline in persons with T2DM has not been
      well studied.

      Sodium-glucose transporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors, which lower serum glucose by inhibiting
      SGLT2-mediated glucose reabsorption in renal proximal tubules, could be neuroprotective. It
      was recently reported that the SGLT-2 inhibitor improved cognitive function and ameliorated
      oxidative stress via attenuating mitochondrial dysfunction, insulin resistance, inflammation,
      and apoptosis in mice or HFD-induced obese rats, that means SGLT-2 inhibitor may provide
      neuroprotection in the diabetic brain. Hence, Invokana (Canagliflozin) might act as a potent
      dual inhibitor of AChE and SGLT2. Since the development of diabetes is associated with AD,
      the design of new AChE inhibitors based on antidiabetic drug scaffolds would be particularly
      beneficial. Moreover, the present computational study reveals that Invokana (Canagliflozin)
      is expected to form the basis of a future dual therapy against diabetes associated
      neurological disorders.

      The overall goal of this study is to explore the effects of SGLT2 inhibitor on the cognitive
      function in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and make further contribution to the
      improvement of cognitive function.
