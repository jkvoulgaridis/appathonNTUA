  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hospital patients usually experience anxiety caused by physiological, psychological and
      environmental stimuli. This emotional state corresponds to the psychophysiological response
      to a perceived threat.

      The investigator's goal is to use a non-drug approach to these problems which would help
      improve the quality of life of patients, prevent the consumption of anti-anxiety drugs /
      antidepressants; and thus to reduce the direct cost in terms of treatment, but also to reduce
      the indirect costs linked to work stoppages and the consumption of the care offer.

      Working hypothesis: Local magnetic muscle stimulation improves people's well-being and
      relaxation
