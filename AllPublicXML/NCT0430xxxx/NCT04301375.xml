      This is a prospective, single arm, open-label, exploratory study in women with primary
      operable HER2-positive, HER2-enriched(HER2-E)/ERBB2-high breast cancer according to PAM50
      intrinsic subtype and a ERBB2 pre-defined cutoff (high vs low ERBB2 expression), to evaluate
      the omission of surgery and sentinel lymph node dissection in patients with HER2-E and ERBB2
      high breast cancer who achieving a complete response following standard anti-HER2-based
      neoadjuvant therapy with paclitaxel/trastuzumab/pertuzumab.
