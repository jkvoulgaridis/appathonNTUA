  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vascular parkinsonism (VP) is defined as the presence of parkinsonian syndrome, evidence of
      cerebrovascular disease by brain imaging and an established relationship between the two
      disorders.

      However, the diagnosis of VP is problematic. This study aims to distinguish VP from
      Parkinson's disease (PD) in multiple aspects including clinical features as motor ,non motor
      symptoms

      ,response to treatment ,cognitive assessments by using multiple scales, neuro-radiological
      features of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and transcranial color-coded duplex (TCCD)
      findings. This differentiation will have therapeutic and prognostic implications .

      Type of Study : case -control comparative study.

      â€¢ Study Setting: Patients with VP and patients with PD from movement disorders and stroke
      outpatient clinics in Ain shams University Hospitals.

      Sampling Method study of consecutive patients in Ain Shams University clinic, who had been
      regularly followed up in the clinic and already had a diagnosis either VP or PD at the time
      of data collection.

      Sample Size: 30 patients diagnosed as VP, 50 patients diagnosed as PD, and 30 healthy age and
      sex matched controls. The difference in selected quantitative variables used to evaluate the
      participants is used to estimate the sample size.

      This study aims to distinguish VP from Parkinson's disease(PD) in multiple aspects including
      clinical features as motor ,non-motor symptoms, response to treatment ,cognitive assessments
      by using multiple scales, neuro-radiological features of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and
      transcranial color-coded duplex(TCCD)findings.

The presence of lower limb parkinsonism will be determined by a two-point difference between upper limb and lower limb scores of bradykinesia, rigidity or postural instability from part III of the MDS-UPDRS. Patients will be examined in the early morning, in 'OFF' state, with MDS-UPDRS, Hoehn and Yahr and freezing of gait questionnaire(FOG-Q) scales. Immediately afterwards, they will take their regular first dose of levodopa. After 1 hour, patients will be examined again with the same tests and scales.
Response to levodopa will be determined as patients who reached a percentage reduction exceeding 25% in part III of the MDS-UPDRS</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients diagnosed with PD or VP, and healthy controls will be included in the study.

          -  PD diagnosis will be based on the Queen Square Brain Bank for Neurological Disorders
             clinical criteria and MDS criteria.

          -  The VP patients will be included if they fulfill the following criteria (Zijlman's
             diagnostic criteria)Parkinsonism presentation (at least two of the cardinal features:
             tremors, bradykinesia, rigidity and postural instability).

        Cerebrovascular disease, defined as evidence of relevant cerebrovascular disease by brain
        imaging or the presence of focal signs or symptoms consistent with stroke.

        A relationship between (1) and (2): acute or delayed progressive onset of parkinsonism.

        Based on the above criteria, two forms of VP are suggested: one with acute onset, and
        another one with insidious progression. The diagnosis will be confirmed by assigning a
        vascular score. Two points or more are essential to diagnose VP. The points will be
        assigned as follows:

          -  Two points: Pathologically or angiographically proven diffuse vascular disease.

          -  One point: Onset of parkinsonism within 1 month of clinical stroke.

          -  One point: History of two or more strokes.

          -  One point: Neuroimaging evidence of vascular disease in two or more vascular
             territories.

          -  One point: History of two or more risk factors for stroke (hypertension, smoking,
             diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidaemia, presence of heart disease associated with stroke
             [coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, valvular
             heart disease, mitral valve prolapse, and other arrhythmias], family history of
             stroke, history of gout, and peripheral vascular disease)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  PD patients with age at onset less than 40 years.

          -  Any alternative cause that significantly impair gait.

          -  Inability of the patient to undergo neuroimaging.

          -  Patients couldn't perform the test or severely demented.

          -  Atypical and other secondary parkinsonism as patients who had a history of toxin
             exposure.or antipsychotic drugs treatment by history ,neurological examination and
             brain MRI .

          -  Family or patient's refusal to give written consent.
