      To use the molecular probe18F-WL12 to detect the expression of PD-L1 in the primary and
      metastatic lesions in patients with solid tumor; to detect the expression heterogeneity of
      PD-L1 in the lesion and inter-lesions; to observe the change of PD-L1 expression in the
      course of treatment. To provide an approach for screening patients with high expression of
      PD-L1, efficacy monitoring, drug resistance and early warning of recurrence and metastasis to
      achieve the Individualized antitumor treatment of targeted drugs.

    <textblock>
      In many clinical trials, Anti-PD-1/PD-L1 mAbs have achieved great success than expected in a
      variety of refractory and recurrent tumor patients. The latest research shows that it is not
      all cancer patients would respond to Anti-PD-1/PD-L1 mAbs. At present, immunohistochemistry
      (IHC) is still a common method to screen patients that will benefit from this therapy by
      detecting the expression level of PD-1 and PD-L1. However, the results of IHC were not very
      exact because of limitations of IHC such as the heterogeneity of expression, the influence of
      host cell PD-L1 expression and the changes in the course of the disease. Moreover, the tumor
      tissue used in IHC must obtained through the invasive method. It is difficult to dynamically
      monitor the expression level of PD-1 / PD-L1 during the treatment. Immuno-PET molecular
      imaging By radiolabeling Anti-PD-1/PD-L1 mAbs with radionuclides can be used to noninvasive
      assessment of biodistribution of monoclonal antibodies and provide a new strategy for patient
      screening.

      In this study, 18F-WL12 PET / CT imaging will be performed in patients with solid tumors to
      access the potential of 18F-WL12 PET / CT to screen patients who can benefit from JS001
      treatment
