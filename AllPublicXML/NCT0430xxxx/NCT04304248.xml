      This is an open-label, single-arm, phase II, multi-center clinical trial. Thirty patients
      will be enrolled in this trial to investigate the pathological complete response rate defined
      as the absence of residual tumor in lung and lymph nodes treated by chemo-immunotherapy.

    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single-arm, phase II, multi-center clinical trial. Eligible patients
      will receive Toripalimab 240mg + Albumin-bound paclitaxel 260mg/m2 + Carboplatin AUC5 for 3
      cycles every 21 days (+/-3 days) as neoadjuvant treatment followed by surgery 3-4 weeks after
      the last dose of chemo-immunotherapy.

      The primary objective is pathological complete response (pCR) defined as the absence of
      residual tumor in lung and lymph nodes after neoadjuvant treatment. Patient accrual is
      expected to be completed within 18 months excluding a run-in-phase of 3 months. Patients will
      be followed 3 years after surgery. The study will end once survival follow-up has concluded.

Surgery: Surgery must be done within the 3rd to 4th week (+7 days) from day 21 cycle 3 of neoadjuvant treatment.</description>
