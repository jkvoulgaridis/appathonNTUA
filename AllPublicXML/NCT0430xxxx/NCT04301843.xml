      Difluoromethylornithine (DFMO) will be used in an open label, multicenter, study in
      combination with etoposide for subjects with relapsed/refractory neuroblastoma.

      In this study subjects will receive six 21-day cycles of Etoposide and DFMO followed by an
      additional 630 days of DFMO alone.

      Subjects will be evaluated in 3 arms:

      • Arm 1: Subjects who show no active disease after receiving any additional therapy for
      neuroblastoma that was refractory to standard induction/consolidation therapy.

      Refractory: Subjects with progressive disease on upfront therapy OR did not have at least PR
      on induction OR required additional second line therapy to achieve remission who are now in
      first remission.

        -  Arm 2: Subjects who have previously relapsed and currently show no active disease (in
           CR2 or greater).

        -  Arm 3: Subjects who are relapsed or refractory with active disease.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All patients must have a pathologically confirmed diagnosis of neuroblastoma, ≤ 30.99
             years of age with history of relapsed/refractory neuroblastoma.

          -  All patients must have completed upfront therapy with at least 4 cycles of aggressive
             multi-drug chemotherapy.

          -  Specific Criteria by Arm:

        Arms 1 and 2:

        Subjects with no active disease:

        i. No evidence of residual disease by CT/MRI and MIBG scan (or PET for patients who have a
        history of MIBG non-avid disease).

        o Note: Patients with residual masses detected by CT/MRI may be considered in CR if their
        MIBG is negative or if MIBG positive and evaluated by PET and found to have negative PET
        scans; biopsy confirmation may be considered if there is still reasonable concern for
        persistent disease but is not required.

        ii. No evidence of disease metastatic to bone marrow.

        Arm 3:

        Measurable or evaluable disease, including at least one of the following:

        Measurable tumor by CT or MRI; or a positive MIBG and PET; or positive bone marrow
        biopsy/aspirate in at least one site.

          -  Timing from prior therapy: Enrollment (first dose of DFMO) no later than 60 days from
             last dose of the most recent therapy.

          -  Subjects must have fully recovered from the acute toxic effects of all prior anti-
             cancer chemotherapy and be within the following timelines:

               1. Myelosuppressive chemotherapy: Must not have received within 2 weeks of
                  enrollment onto this study (6 weeks if prior nitrosourea).

               2. Hematopoietic growth factors: At least 5 days since the completion of therapy
                  with a growth factor.

               3. Biologic (anti-neoplastic agent): At least 7 days since the completion of therapy
                  with a biologic agent. For agents that have known adverse events occurring beyond
                  7 days after administration, this period must be extended beyond the time during
                  which adverse events are known to occur. The duration of this interval must be
                  discussed with the Study Chair.

               4. Immunotherapy: At least 6 weeks since the completion of any type of
                  immunotherapy, e.g. tumor vaccines, CAR-T cells.

               5. Anti-GD2 Monoclonal antibodies: At least 2 weeks must have elapsed since prior
                  treatment with a monoclonal antibody.

               6. XRT: At least 14 days since the last treatment except for radiation delivered

                    1. Allogeneic: No evidence of active graft vs. host disease

                    2. Allo/Auto: ≥ 2 months must have elapsed since transplant.

               8. MIBG Therapy: At least 8 weeks since treatment with MIBG therapy

          -  Subjects must have a Lansky or Karnofsky Performance Scale score of 60% or higher.

          -  Life expectancy &gt; 2 months

          -  All clinical and laboratory studies for organ functions to determine eligibility must

          -  Females of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test. Patients of
             childbearing potential must agree to use an effective birth control method. Female
             patients who are lactating must agree to stop breast-feeding.
