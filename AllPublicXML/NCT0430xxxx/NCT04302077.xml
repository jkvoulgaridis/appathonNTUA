  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized study designed to evaluate the effects of different initial
      postoperative follow-up modalities. Given the nature of the study, it is not possible for
      either the surgeons or the subjects to be blinded. Patients will be assigned to either group
      based on the last digit of their medical record number (MRN). Patients with an even-ending
      medical record number will be randomized to virtual visit/telemedicine, while patients with
      an odd-ending medical record number will be randomized to the office visit.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate the differences between two forms of postoperative follow-up with
      respect to patient satisfaction. The primary outcome will be patient satisfaction with their
      surgeon and with their overall experience. Following their second postoperative visit, the
      subjects will complete one electronic survey. The survey is designed to assess subject's
      overall satisfaction and satisfaction with their surgery. This survey is standardized and
      will be used by both groups.
