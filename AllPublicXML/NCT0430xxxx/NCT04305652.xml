      Today, with the prolongation of human life, the elderly population has increased and the
      frequency of diseases seen in old age has increased due to this situation. The most common of
      these diseases is Alzheimer's disease. The Progressively Lowered Stress Threshold (PLST) is a
      conceptual model for reducing behavioral symptoms in individuals with dementia. In this
      study, it is aimed to determine the effect of interventions according to Decreased Stress
      Threshold Model on the level of neuropsychiatric symptoms and agitation of Alzheimer's
      patient and caregivers care satisfaction and life satisfaction.

      Today, with the prolongation of human life, the elderly population has increased and the
      frequency of diseases seen in old age has increased due to this situation. The most common of
      these diseases is Alzheimer's disease. Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative
      disease which causes cognitive decline and various neuropsychiatric behavioral disorders and
      disorders in daily living activities. The emergence of these symptoms of Alzheimer's disease
      leads to an increase in the costs of care provided and a great distress for caregivers. In
      the literature, it is recommended to use nonpharmacological approaches as the first choice in
      the treatment of behavioral and psychological symptoms. One of the non-pharmacological
      approaches is the interventions according to the Progressively Lowered Stress Threshold
      Model. In this method, taking into account the individuality of the patient, focusing on the
      interaction of the Alzheimer's patient with the environment and the rearranging of the
      environment for the reduction of cognitive abilities, focuses on creating a less stressful
      environment. Since this model uses the steps of the nursing process, home visits are made.
      This study will be carried out with Alzheimer's patients and caregivers from Aksaray
      University Education and Research Hospital's Home Health Services unit. In this study, it is
      aimed to determine the effect of interventions according to Decreased Stress Threshold Model
      on the level of neuropsychiatric symptoms and agitation of Alzheimer's patient and caregivers
      care satisfaction and life satisfaction.

    <description>PLST is a conceptual model for reducing behavioral symptoms in individuals with dementia. The PLST model provides the foundation for a psychoeducational intervention that assists formal and informal caregivers in understanding behaviors and planning care for individuals with dementia. If the model is to be applied at home, at least three home visits are made in line with the listed principles. While making a diagnosis during the first home visit, a maintenance plan for the problems is created in other home visits and the caregiver is trained to implement the care plan. After the home visits, the process is carried out by providing counseling through telephone calls or face-to-face interviews when necessary.</description>
