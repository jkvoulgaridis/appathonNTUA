  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The I-FILE study is a prospective multicenter, multinational observational study where the
      feasibility of a patient-led registry using home monitoring in patients with pulmonary
      fibrosis will be evaluated. The aim of the study is to gain more insights in disease behavior
      in patients with pulmonary fibrosis, so in future patients with progressive disease can be
      better identified.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nowadays, identifying disease progression will have direct treatment implications in patients
      with fibrotic Interstitial lung diseases (F-ILDs). eHealth could be a possible solution for
      close monitoring and detecting disease progression, at a low burden for patients and
      healthcare providers. The main aim of the I-FILE study will be to evaluate feasibility of a
      patient-led registry using home spirometry to monitor disease progression in patients with
      F-ILD. The secondary aim will be to better validate existing health-related quality of life
      questionnaires to assess the impact of disease and treatment in these patients.

      In total 500 patients with newly diagnosed F-ILD will be included. Patients will perform
      daily home spirometry in the first three months followed by once weekly measurements with a
      follow up period of 2 years. In addition, patient-reported outcomes (PROMs) will be completed
      online every 6 months. Results are encrypted and directly sent to a secured server through
      the online I-FILE application.
