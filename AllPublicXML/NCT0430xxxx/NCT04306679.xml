  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Treating pain, just as treating other medical conditions, depends on accurate assessment of
      patient's condition. When assessing pain, as other subjective symptoms, the challenge is
      twofold because the assessment is dependent on patient's understanding and use of the scale,
      all the more so in children

      So far, attempts to improve pain assessments have been focused on the development and
      refining pain scales. No emphasis has been placed on improving patient's ability to report
      their pain. Our purpose is to evaluate a training program designed to improve the quality of
      children's post-surgical pain intensity reports.

      After receiving Helsinki approval, eligible children and their parents will signed
      informed-consent. After surgery, the children, their parents, and the department nurses will
      assess children's pain intensity. Immediately after the nurse assessment, parents will assess
      their child's pain (blindly and independently) and the children will report their pain on
      four different pain scales.

      Children aged 8-17, hospitalized in Rambam medical-center for elective surgery will be
      invited to participate. Children in the experimental group will be exposed to a training
      program, developed for this study, aimed to teach and train how to report pain. The control
      group will receive the standard pre-surgical instructions.

    <description>The average difference between scores reported on the different scales was calculated as follows: The difference between to pain scores reported on each possible pairs of two scales was calculated in absolute values. The average difference of the 6 pairs was calculated. The 5-point CAT was transformed into a 0-10 scale by multiplying its values by 2.5.</description>
