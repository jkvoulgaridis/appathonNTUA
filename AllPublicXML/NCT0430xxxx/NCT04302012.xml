        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  A diagnosis of diabetes mellitus;

          -  Understanding of study and provision of written informed consent; and

          -  22 years of age or older.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Persistent visual impairment in one or both eyes;

          -  History of macular edema, severe non-proliferative retinopathy, proliferative
             retinopathy, or retinal vascular (vein or artery) occlusion;

          -  History of ocular injections, laser treatment of the retina, or intraocular surgery
             other than cataract surgery without complications;

          -  Subject is contraindicated for fundus photography (for example, has light
             sensitivity);

          -  Subject has contraindications for mydriatic medications or is unwilling or unable to
             dilate;

          -  Subject is currently enrolled in an interventional study of an investigational device
             or drug; or

          -  Subject has a condition or is in a situation which in the opinion of the Investigator,
             might confound study results, may interfere significantly with the subject's
             participation in the study, or may result in ungradable dilated fundus photographs.
