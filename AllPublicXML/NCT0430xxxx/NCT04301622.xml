    <textblock>
      MicroPort (MPO) is conducting this PMCF study to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of its
      EVOLUTION® BIOFOAM® Tibia and EVOLUTION® Cruciate Sacrificing/Cruciate Retaining (CS/CR)
      Porous Femur components, including EVOLUTION® CS tibial inserts. This type of study is
      required by regulatory authorities for all devices that have been approved in Europe to
      evaluate the medium and long-term clinical evidence.

      The objectives of this study are:

        1. To estimate the individual component survivorship of EVOLUTION® BIOFOAM® Tibia and
           EVOLUTION® CS/CR Porous Femur components, including EVOLUTION® CS tibial inserts

        2. To find out the cumulative incidence of component revision of each component in this
           combination.

        3. To find out the functional outcome scores at early, midterm, and long term follow-up.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Has previously undergone or currently has determined to undergo a primary TKA with the
             specified combination of components: EVOLUTION® CS/CR Porous Femur, EVOLUTION® CS
             Tibial Insert, and EVOLUTION® BIOFOAM® Tibia and modular keel

          2. Has previously undergone or currently has determined to undergo a primary TKA for any
             of the following:

               -  non-inflammatory degenerative joint disease including osteoarthritis, traumatic
                  arthritis, or avascular necrosis;

               -  inflammatory degenerative joint disease including rheumatoid arthritis;

               -  correction of functional deformity;

               -  willing and able to complete required study visits and assessments through the 10
                  year postoperative follow-up visit.

          3. Previously implanted subjects must be enrolled within 3 years of their primary TKA
             implantation

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Skeletally immature (less than 21 years of age) at time of implantation

          2. Has or had an overt infection at the time of implantation

          3. Has or had a distant foci of infections (which may cause hematogenous spread to the
             implant site) at the time of implantation

          4. Has or had a rapid disease progression as manifested by joint destruction or bone
             absorption apparent on roentgenogram at the time of implantation

          5. Has or had inadequate neuromuscular status (e.g., prior paralysis, fusion, and/or
             inadequate abductor strength), poor bone stock, poor skin coverage around the joint
             which would make the procedure unjustifiable

          6. Has had a revision procedure(s) where other treatments or devices have failed; and
             treatment of fractures that are unmanageable using other techniques

          7. Currently enrolled in another clinical investigation which could affect the endpoints
             of this protocol

          8. Unwilling or unable to sign the Informed Consent document

          9. Has documented substance abuse issues

         10. Has an emotional or neurological condition that would pre-empt their ability or
             willingness to participate in the study

         11. Currently incarcerated or has impending incarceration

         12. Has a medical condition, as judged by the Investigator, that would interfere with the
             subject's ability to comply with the requirements of the protocol

         13. At the time of screening, subject is scheduled to have a contralateral TKA less than 1
             year after the TKA on the enrolled knee. Two scheduled knee implants cannot occur
             within one year of each.
