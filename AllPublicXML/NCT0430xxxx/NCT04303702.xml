  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Oxytocin is widely used on Labor and Delivery units throughout the world.Laboring patients
      are most likely to initiate oxytocin in the first stage of labor. Among those who receive
      oxytocin, first stage initiation is far more common than second stage initiation. The goal of
      first stage administration is to increase uterine contractility and cause cervical dilation,
      particularly in patients who have epidural analgesia. Once complete cervical dilation has
      been achieved, most providers choose to continue oxytocin in the second stage of labor for
      the theoretic benefit of increased expulsion &quot;power&quot; while pushing. This practice is
      currently not evidence-based as the limited data thus far suggests no difference in operative
      deliveries with the use of oxytocin augmentation in general. The benefits and risk of
      oxytocin continuation in the second stage of labor is unknown. Oxytocin administration is
      associated with the risk of uterine tachysystole, postpartum hemorrhage,and maternal
      hyponatremia. These risks call for a closer look at prolonged oxytocin use past the first
      stage of labor. This is a randomized controlled trial investigating the utility of oxytocin
      administration in the second stage of labor.

    <description>The administration and titration of oxytocin for labor augmentation is per a hospital based protocol. To summarize, oxytocin is initiated intravenously at 2 milliunits/minute and increased by 2 milliunits/minute every 20 minutes until an adequate contraction pattern is attained or a maximum of 40 millunits/minute has been achieved. This protocol for titration and administration will be applied in this study to the oxytocin group. The intravenous pumps on Labor and Delivery have automated functions for intravenous administration of oxytocin that is milliunit-based and the same routine pumps will be used in this study. The study bag will be administered per current oxytocin protocol. Since patients will already be on oxytocin at time of randomization, their current bag of oxytocin will be replaced by a masked study bag of either placebo or oxytocin until delivery.</description>
