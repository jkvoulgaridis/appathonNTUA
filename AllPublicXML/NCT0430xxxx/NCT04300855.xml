    <textblock>
      This randomized double-blinded Phase II clinical trial will evaluate the bioavailability,
      safety, effectiveness and validate the mechanism by which a standardized formulation of whole
      Green Tea Catechin, (Sunphenon® 90D) containing 405 mgs vs. Placebo, administered for 24
      months in a cohort of men with low to intermediate grade prostate managed on active
      surveillance

    <description>Participants will be administered a standardized formulation of whole Green Tea Catechin for 24 months. The daily dose of Green Tea Catechin will be taken in divided doses, three capsules in the morning and 3 capsules in the evening, with food (within one hour of eating a substantial meal). On the day of monthly follow-up visit, capsules should be taken within 4 hours of visit and blood draw for required lab work. If the participant is scheduled to come in the afternoon, dose should be taken with lunch that day instead of with dinner for that day.</description>
