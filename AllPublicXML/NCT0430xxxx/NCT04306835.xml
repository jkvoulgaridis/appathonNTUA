  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients follow the fully standard sleep test according to the normal procedure. This means
      that they undergo a polysomnography and fill in a questionnaire. If according to the
      questionnaire, there is insomnia, the patient also receives an intake interview to check
      whether this is indeed the case. If the patient has both disorders and meets the inclusion
      and exclusion criteria, they will be asked to sign the informed consent. If the patient
      agrees, the CPAP-therapy will be started as usual, simultaneously with CGT-i. The latter will
      last 7 weeks and will cover the following points: psycho-education, sleep restriction and
      sleep hygiene, cognition, relaxation and relapse prevention. Because of the design of this
      study (starting CGT-I as soon as possible after the diagnosis of OSAS) and the groups already
      planned for CBT-I, it is not possible for all participants to participate in group cognitive
      behavioral therapy, therefore individual sessions were provided for these participants. The
      patient comes for monitoring at set times.
