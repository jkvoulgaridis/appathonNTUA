  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial that will be conducted in
      healthcare settings and other facilities directly involved in COVID-19 case management. We
      will recruit healthcare workers and other staff working in a facility where there are cases
      of either proven, or suspected, COVID-19, who can be followed reliably for 5 months. 40,000
      participants will be recruited and we predict an average of 400-800 participants per site in
      50-100 sites.

      The participant will be randomised to receive either chloroquine or placebo (1:1
      randomisation), or to hydroxychloroquine or placebo (1:1 randomisation). A loading dose of
      10mg base/kg (four 155mg tablets for a 60kg subject), followed by 155 mg daily (250mg
      chloroquine phosphate salt/ 200mg hydroxychloroquine sulphate) will be taken for 3 months.

      If the participant is diagnosed with COVID-19, they will take continue to take the study
      medication until:

        -  90 days after enrolment (i.e., completion of kit)

        -  hospitalised due to COVID-19 disease (i.e., not for quarantine purposes) in which case
           they will stop, or

        -  advised to stop by their healthcare professional for other reasons

      Episodes of symptomatic respiratory illness, including symptomatic COVID-19, and clinical
      outcomes will be recorded in the Case Record Form during the follow-up period.
