    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness of Functional training versus
      resistance training in improving functional capacity, muscle strength, quality of life and
      disease activity in patients with PSA.

      The Functional Training Group (FT) used elastic bands and the Resistance Exercise Group (RE)
      used weight training machines. The FT patients performed functional training and RE performed
      resistance exercises for the following muscles group: upper limbs, lower limbs and trunk. It
      was used a machine &quot;leg extension&quot; for the training on the lower limbs. For upper limbs the
      investigators used a pulley triceps machine and front pull in addition to free weights
      (dumbbells).

      In order to perform the exercise program, the study followed all the recommendations
      established by the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) (Ratamess et al., 2009). It was
      carried out two exercises for major muscle groups and one exercise for small muscles. The
      exercises were divided in 3 sets of 12 repetitions for each muscle group. The intensity of
      the exercises was 60% of one-maximum repetition (1RM).

      The exercise program involved pectoral exercises: crucifix and seat supine; biceps:
      alternated screw; triceps: triceps pulley; back: standing handsaw and pulled ahead;
      quadriceps: leg extensor and finally gluteus: standing hips extension.

      The patients were instructed to maintain their daily activities and to avoid any other
      nonpharmacological treatment.
