    <textblock>
      Our group has developed a device called &quot;Velocidad Onda de Pulso Indice Tobillo Brazo
      (VOPITB)&quot; . In this device the oscillometric method is used for easily and accurately measure
      the pulse wave velocity PWV in the arms and legs separately, allowing new arterial stiffness
      indices to be studied (sum, difference, ratio, baPWV and CAVI). The aim of our study will be
      to validate the PWV measures by VOPITB with other references devices that measures arterial
      stiffness. Moreover we will perform a clinical study to assess the clinical utility of
      VOPITB.

        The sample size has been calculated in order to provide that a difference between the CAVI
        values obtained from measurement of both devices, VOPITB and VaSera, shall be up to of 0.8
        points in comparison with the CAVI reference values for Spanish adults population [21]. the
        base parameters used to calculate the sample size were as follows: standard deviation (sd)
        of CAVI measured by VaSera VS-1500 and VOPITB (1.44), mean difference between CAVI
        measurements (0.8), confidence level (95%), and power (80%). Thus, the estimated sample
        size was found as 102 patients. In addition, for compensating possible incomplete data sets
        from patients who could withdraw or fail to complete the study, 20% were added. Finally, a
        total of 120 subjects (a minimum of 40% of subjects for each gender group) will be
        evaluated according to the following criteria:

          -  &lt; 30 years (40 subjects)

          -  30 - 60 years (40 subjects)

          -  &gt; 60 years (40 subjects)
