  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Over-testing and over-treatment costs the US healthcare system hundreds of billions of
      dollars a year, and has measurable negative impacts on patients' physical, emotional, and
      financial health making it a significant public health concern. The proposed research will
      advance &quot;de-implementation&quot; science by identifying processes and strategies to stop or reduce
      over-testing and over-treatment that can be broadly adapted to varied contexts and disease
      processes to improve the delivery of guideline concordant, evidence-based care and improve
      patient outcomes.

      The overarching goal of this proposal is to use bronchiolitis as a case study to advance the
      science of de-implementation by identifying strategies and processes for reducing
      over-testing and over-treatment in bronchiolitis that can later be broadly adapted to varied
      contexts and disease processes. The challenge in bronchiolitis is that providing
      high-quality, evidenced-based care requires a &quot;less is more&quot; approach as the non-
      recommended, outdated, and potentially harmful tests and treatments that most admitted
      patients receive do not have replacements. Therefore, bronchiolitis which is the most common
      cause of hospitalization among infants, is an ideal condition to study de-implementation.

      In her set of projects, Dr. Tyler proposes the innovative application of dissemination and
      implementation (D&amp;I) science to the unique problem of de-implementation. Within a learning
      health system called PEDSnet, Dr. Tyler will use the PRISM D&amp;I model as a guide to: 1) use
      qualitative methods to define contextual factors influencing over-utilization in
      bronchiolitis from the perspective of healthcare providers, parents, and healthcare
      organizations, 2) develop a set of pragmatic, feasible, and effective de-implementation
      strategies for bronchiolitis that includes guidance on how to adapt the strategies to local
      contexts, and 3) conduct a pilot study to determine the feasibility, acceptability, and
      de-implementation effectiveness of the de-implementation strategies. As one of the first
      explorations of contextual factors fostering overuse or enabling successful
      de-implementation, this study is expected to generate valuable knowledge relevant to de-
      implementation across diseases and healthcare settings. The results will provide pilot data
      for a large-scale, pragmatic, randomized-controlled trial of the de-implementation strategies
      so that ineffective and potentially harmful medical practices are reduced.
