  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hip arthroplasty surgery can be associated with significant pain. A regional anesthesia
      technique, the femoral articular branch block (FAB), has recently been proposed to
      collectively block terminal femoral and accessory obturator nerve branches to the hip joint
      with a single injection, theoretically blocking most of the innervation relevant to hip
      arthroscopy while sparing the main femoral nerve branches to the quadriceps muscles. The
      investigators aim to demonstrate the analgesic benefits of FAB. The investigators hypothesize
      that FAB will reduce opioid consumption and improve postoperative quality of recovery in
      patients having hip arthroplasty. This is a randomized, controlled, double-blind study and
      half the patients will be randomized to receive the femoral articular branch block and the
      other half of patients will be randomized to receive a placebo block. A comparison of pain
      will be made between both groups.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hip arthroplasty procedure is frequently associated with severe post-operative pain despite
      the practice of injecting the hip joint with local anesthetics at the end of the procedure
      and the use of intraoperative opioids. These patients usually receive a spinal anesthetic as
      well. The ideal analgesic technique that provides adequate pain relief following this
      procedure has not been established yet.
