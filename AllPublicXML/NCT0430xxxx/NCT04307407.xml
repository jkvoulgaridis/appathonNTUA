    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>The aim is for participants to complete three weekly sessions of supervised aerobic treadmill based exercise for five months. Session duration varies from 20-60 minutes, with exercise intensity ranging from 55-95% of peak heart rate. Maximal exercise capacity (VO2peak and peak heart rate), will be determined by the CPET performed by certified exercise physiologists at baseline.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Standard care</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>No Intervention</arm_group_type>
    <description>Participants in this arm will not receive any follow-up on exercise during the intervention period.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Other</arm_group_type>
    <description>Participants in this arm are age-matched women with no history of any malignant disease, which will undergo similar assessments at baseline and post-intervention and also follow similar exercise intervention as the breast cancer survivors randomized to the Aerobic exercise arm</description>

    <intervention_type>Behavioral</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>Aerobic Exercise</intervention_name>
    <description>Participants will be randomized to supervised aerobic exercise or standard care. Women with no current or past malignant disease will comprise the reference group and will be matched for age to participants in the Aerobic Exercise arm</description>
