  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall aim of this feasibility study is to develop new technologies for improved
      detection of cholangiocarcinoma using the SFE-based molecular-imaging mini-cholangioscope
      (MC) system. This study will combine the use of a fluorescent-labeled peptide dimer that
      binds specifically to know biomarkers of cholangiocarcinoma for use as a novel imaging agent
      to guide endoscopic biopsies. This Phase 1B study will be used to provide early evidence of
      efficacy for the topical application of a peptide dimer that binds to molecular targets that
      are specific for biliary intra-epithelial neoplasia. A dimer is needed because cancer in the
      biliary tract is genetically heterogeneous. QRH binds specifically to Epidermal Growth Factor
      Receptor (EGFR), and KSP binds specifically to Human Epithelial Growth Factor Receptor
      (HER2). The study will look at peptide binding in subjects having a medical condition
      requiring an ERCP to diagnose a potential biliary disorder. The Phase 1A first-in-human
      studies of safety with topical administration by ingestion of KSP/QRH dimer (HUM00141420) has
      been completed.

    <description>The fluorescence intensity will be measured by the target/background (T/B) ratio from suspicious regions of bile duct where the fluorescent-labeled peptide is administered. The intensity of the fluorescence of the abnormal tissue compared to the background tissue intensity will be analyzed using statistical analysis for significance comparing the tissue groups' mean T/B ratios.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Subject meets all of the following criteria:

          -  Scheduled for an outpatient ERCP to diagnose a potential biliary disorder (such as an
             indeterminate biliary stricture)

          -  Subject is medically cleared for the procedure (e.g. washout for anticoagulants,
             co-morbidities)

          -  Age 18 to 100 years

          -  Willing and able to sign informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with known allergy or negative reaction to any components of the study drug
             (list these)

          -  Subjects on active chemotherapy or radiation treatment

          -  Pregnant or trying to conceive

          -  Anything that, in the opinion of the investigator, would place the individual at
             increased risk or preclude the individual's full compliance with or completion of the
             study
