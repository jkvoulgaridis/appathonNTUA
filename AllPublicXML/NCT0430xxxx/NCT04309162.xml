      Effect of Soft tissue Therapy in managing Procedural Pain among neonates admitted in neonatal
      intensive care unit. This study focuses on the Procedural pain management with the help of
      Soft tissue manipulation which includes various techniques like stroking, petrissage
      manipulations.

      Background: Neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) is a specialized unit created for sick and
      premature newborns. There are various painful procedures through which neonates have to
      undergo during the NICU stay. The most common procedure is the blood tests for the laboratory
      investigations which include the heel lancing and venipuncture. Pain is the one of the cause
      of the development of the acute stress in neonates soft tissue therapy has considered as the
      major contributory factor of in reducing the procedural pain among neonates admitted NICU.
      There is no documentation on soft tissue therapy in managing procedural pain in neonates.

      Purpose: To determine the effects of soft tissue therapy in managing procedural pain among
      neonates admitted in NICU.

      Methods and materials: The study will recruit neonates who underwent for various painful
      procedures in NICU such as venous and arterial puncture, capillary puncture, pulmonary
      mechanical ventilation, tracheal intubation, removal of adhesive tapes, the introduction of
      various drains etc. Preterm, Term, Full terms Neonates Stable Neonates. The samples will be
      taken via stratified random sampling technique. Neonates with unstable vitals are to be
      excluded from the study.

      Discussion: To best of our knowledge, this will be the first study determining the effects of
      soft tissue therapy in procedural pain on neonates admitted in NICU. The role of neonatal
      physiotherapist in NICU is to provide diagnosis and treatment to admitted newborns. Massage
      therapy is considered as an effective management technique in pain management. In this study
      soft tissue therapy will be applied to neonates especially in context with procedural pain.
      There are various painful procedures performed to check the prognosis of neonates.

    <description>Neonatal Infant Pain Scale is basically a behavioral tool and can be used in preterm and full term infants. The total score is 7. NIPS score is divided into 3 categories. 0-2 indicates no pain, 3-4 mild to moderate pain, &gt;4 indicates severe pain.</description>

    <measure>Change in Neonatal Pain Agitation and sedation scale(N-PASS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 4 days after the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>N-PASS is scale which is used to assess Procedural, postoperative mechanically . ventilated patients. It includes variables like crying, irritability, facial expression, extremity tone and vital signs. It is 0 to 10 scale high level of score indicates more aggression and intense behavior and low levels indicates decreased level of stimulation and deeper sedation.</description>

    <description>Soft tissue therapy includes various techniques which is usually done by manipulating the soft tissues. The techques like stroking, petrissage, percussing maniulations are proved helpful in managing various painful conditions. The main effect of the soft tissue therapy is enhanced blood circulation to the area. When the techniques of soft tissue therapy are applied they will results in stretching and rubbing the muscular tissue which results in increased venous flow to heart and removal of the lactic acid accumulation occurs as the fresh supply of blood to the area will increased. Endorphins the natural pain relievers are released as there is improved oxygenation and perfusion of oxygen in tissues.</description>
