      The purpose of this research is to determine the blood signals that promote health and
      well-being in response to exercise at different intensities.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Most studies find a dose-response relationship between exercise participation and all-cause
      mortality. In contrast, physical inactivity and consequent overweight or obese status is
      associated with a cadre of health consequences. Frequently, comorbidities of obesity are
      mechanistically linked via chronic low grade inflammation stemming from increases in
      adiposity. Although exercise is known to combat obesity and obesity related disease states,
      the mechanisms of action are not fully understood. Therefore, the investigators propose the
      following study in an attempt to elucidate anti- and pro-inflammatory endocrine responses to
      exercise. Initial studies in animal models have provided evidence that exercise induces
      long-term anti-inflammatory effects, potentially via myokine signaling following skeletal
      muscle activation. Humans are an ideal study population as the investigators can prescribe
      multiple exercise protocols that mimic human behavior, and control exercise intensity to meet
      recommendations. Also, humans allow the investigators to collect larger plasma samples and
      therefore measure more circulating proteins of interest over multiple time-points. Finally,
      the investigators can select individuals that exercise at different frequencies, allowing the
      investigators to analyze the differences in endocrine responses to exercise over differing
      levels of fitness. In summary, a human model will allow for a much better understanding of
      the human condition.

    <description>Blood samples collected during exercise will be analyzed for the concentration of plasma myokines including Brain Derived Neurotropic Factor (BDNF), Secreted Protein Acidic and Rich in Cysteine (SPARC), Leukemia Inhibitory Factor (LIF), Interleukin (IL) 15, IL-6, Myostatin, Irisin, Follistatin-like 1 (FSTL-1), Fibroblast Growth Factor 21 (FGF-21), IL-4, IL-7 receptor agonist (ra), IL-7, beta-aminoisobutyric acid (BAIBA), IL-1ra, Growth Differentiation Factor (GDF) 8, Insulin-Like Growth Factor-1 (IGF1).</description>

    <measure>Relative reinforcing value (RRV) of exercise</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0</time_frame>
    <description>RRV of exercise will be assessed by evaluating the number of responses (mouse button presses) a participant is willing to complete to gain access to exercise or an alternative (magazines, word games, puzzles).</description>

    <measure>Minutes of physical activity, as assessed by activity tracker</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0</time_frame>
    <description>Minutes of physical activity will be assessed by having participants wear an Actigraph accelerometer for 7 days (minimum 10 hours per day) on the right hip.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Usual modes of sedentary behavior</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0</time_frame>
    <description>Usual modes of sedentary behavior will be determined via the validated International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ). The IPAQ measures habitual physical activity for the past 7 days and consists of four domains of physical activity: job-related (7 items), transportation (6 items), household/gardening (6 items), and leisure-time activities (6 items). To show sedentary behavior, two questions regarding time spent sitting are also included. The number of minutes for each activity class is multiplied by the MET score for that activity to convert the IPAQ data into metabolic equivalent scores (MET-min-week−1). Physical activity levels are then classified as being inactive, minimally active, and health-enhancing physically active.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Preference for intense physical activity and tolerance for exercise discomfort</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0</time_frame>
    <description>Preference for intense physical activity and tolerance for exercise discomfort will be assessed by self-report questionnaire responses to the Preference for and Tolerance of the Intensity of Exercise Questionnaire (PRETIE-Q). The PRETIE-Q measures preference for high intensity vs. low intensity exercise and ability to persist or tolerate the discomfort associated with intense exercise. The PRETIE-Q consists of two subscales: Preference for Exercise Intensity and Tolerance of Exercise Intensity. Each subscale has 8 items rated on a 5-point response scale (range 8 - 40). Higher scores indicate greater preference for intense exercise and/or greater tolerance for exercise discomfort. Total scale scores are not used. Scale averages will be used.</description>
