      Open-label Study using ASP-1929 Photoimmunotherapy in Combination with anti-PD1 Therapy in
      patients with recurrent or metastatic head and neck and squamous cell cancer or advanced
      cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cohorts of patients with recurrent or metastatic (R/M) squamous cell cancer of the head and
      neck (HNSCC) or advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma will receive standard of care
      anti-PD1 therapy in combination with anti EGFR antibody-dye conjugate, ASP-1929
      Photoimmunotherapy (PIT). HNSCC patients are required to have Programmed Cell Death Ligand 1
      (PD-L1) positive expression defined by Combined Positive Score (CPS) ≥1. Primary endpoints
      are to determine the safety, tolerability and tumor response of ASP-1929 PIT in combination
      with anti-PD1 treatment.

        • Cancers as follows:

        Cohort 1 : Histologically or cytologically confirmed recurrent locally and/or metastatic
        head and neck squamous cell carcinoma with Combined Positive Score (CPS) ≥ 1 as determined
        by an FDA approved test

        Note: Patients may not have a primary tumor site of nasopharynx (any histology)

        Cohort 2 : Histologically or cytologically confirmed locally advanced or metastatic
        cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma not amenable to definitive surgery or radiation.
