  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis is that patients with structural heart disease who are treated by STructural
      heARt nurses obtain better results in indicators of quality of care, compared with the usual
      practice (or not assisted) by this type of new interventional cardiology's nursing role.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Valvular disease is the future epidemic structural heart disease of developed countries. To
      slow or alter the course of the disease, cardiac valve repair or replacement is necessary.
      Transcatheter treatment has become a safe alternative to surgery. The United States and
      Canada developed the TAVI (Transcather Aortic Valve Implantation) program and TAVI Nurse is
      strongly supported by scientific societies as a key leadership role in the aortic stenosis
      care process. This nursing role is not implemented in Spain.

      The objective of this study is to develop a new nursing role in interventional cardiology,
      similar to TAVI Nurse but including all the structural heart diseases, through conceptual
      definition and competencies, and evaluate its impact on the quality of care after of its
      implementation.

      The new nursing role of a hemodynamics and interventional cardiology unit in Spain will be
      based on the model existing in other countries.

      This study consists of three phases:

      Phase I) Integrative review to explore and identify the definition and competencies of TAVI
      Nurse or another similar figure outside Spain, as well as identify quality of care
      indicators.

      Phase II) The competences of these nurses will be contextualized in Spain, and indicators of
      quality of care will be defined through the consensus of experts using a Delphi methodology.

      Phase III) Quasi-experimental pre / post study to assess the quality of care, through the
      indicators developed, of the implementation of the new nursing role.

    <description>Structural quality indicators developed through phase 1 (Integrative Review) and phase 2 (Delphi Methodology) results. However, it is expected that the main STAR nurse's structural quality indicators could be some like:
- Percutaneous/transcatheter treatment waiting time (days). Data will be collected by medical history review.</description>

    <description>Process quality indicators developed through phase 1 (Integrative Review) and phase 2 (Delphi Methodology) results. However, it is expected that the main STAR nurse's process quality indicators could be some like:
- Evaluation of procedural risk (points). The Society of Thoracic Surgery (STS) risk score will be used.
The classification of the results is:
Less than or equal to 2 points means low surgical risk.
From 3 to 5 points means intermediate surgical risk.
Upper than or equal to 6 means high surgical risk.</description>

    <description>This intervention will consist in that the nurse who is in the hemodynamic nurse's office will do the STAR Nurse's tasks and competences.
Although the intervention will be detailed through phase 1 (integrative review) and 2 (Delphy methodology).
It is expected that the main STAR nurse's competencies and tasks in the nurse's office will be:
To guarantee a comprehensive evaluation and appropriate triage to candidates for an interventional procedure of structural heart disease, coordinating the request for complementary tests and previous visits.
Make education to the patient and family.
Make communication bridge with cardiologists.
Establish specific patient-centered care processes.
Promote continuity of care after discharge, follow up after discharge, and reevaluate quality of life and fragility.</description>
