      The aim of the conducted research is to evaluate the protective effect of rivaroxaban (trade
      name of the Xarelto medicinal product), administered together with acetylsalicylic acid
      (ASA), in comparison with the effectiveness of using ASA alone, in relation to the distance
      of claudication and exercise tolerance in patients with PAD over a period of 3 months. At
      present, COMPASS results show that rivaroxaban vascular dose (2.5 mg twice daily) in
      combination with ASA (75-100 mg once daily) provides more effective cardiovascular protection
      (defined as cardiovascular death, vascular, myocardial infarction and stroke) compared to ASA
      alone. So far, however, no scientific studies have been carried out into account the effect
      of the drug on the progress of PAD and exercise tolerance in patients.

      EXISTING KNOWLEDGE AND MAIN ASSUMPTIONS OF THE PROJECT.

      Atherosclerosis is the most common cause of peripheral artery disease (PAD). The first
      symptom of PAD is intermittent claudication (IC), which is characterized by the occurrence of
      pain, cramps, numbness, and discomfort in the lower limb muscles. They gradually intensify
      while walking, forcing the patient to stop. The symptoms are caused by continuous, specific
      physical effort and quickly disappear when it is stopped. The reduction of the possibility of
      walking leads to a decrease in the quality of life of patients and adds to other dangerous
      consequences of atherosclerosis, increased risk of cardiovascular incidents (myocardial
      infarction, stroke, acute lower limb ischemia, Micker M et al. 2006).

      Pharmacological treatment of patients with IC is aimed at modifying cardiovascular risk
      factors and improving the quality of life by alleviating pain and prolonging the claudication
      distance (Goszcz et al., 2009).

      1. New possibilities for the pharmacotherapy of patients with symptomatic PAD.

      According to the adopted TASC (The Trans Atlantic Inter-Society Consensus), and its TASC II
      supplement concerning aspects of management and treatment of patients with chronic limb
      ischemia, drugs used in PAD patients were divided into several groups because of their
      justified and documented therapeutic efficacy in multicenter clinical trials. These include
      drugs with documented clinical effect used in IC (cilostazol and naphthydrofuryl), drugs with
      probable clinical effect used in IC (carnitine and propyl-L-carnitine), lipid-lowering drugs
      (statins), drugs with insufficiently proven clinical effects (penthoxyphilin),
      anticoagulants, L-arginine, 5-hydroxytryptamine (ketanserin) antagonism, buflomedil, and
      defibrotide.

      Antiplatelet drugs are used to prevent thrombotic complications in the course of myocardial
      infarction, stroke, and thrombi in peripheral arteries. Acetylsalicylic acid (ASA, aspirin)
      at doses of 75-325 mg per day, ticlopidine at doses of 250 mg 2x/day and clopidogrel at doses
      of 75 mg 1x/day (CAPRIE, 1996) are proven to be effective in PAD patients. Recently there
      have been reports of beneficial effects of policosanol in patients with peripheral
      circulation disorders. This drug lowers cholesterol levels but also has an antiplatelet
      effect, demonstrating in clinical trials a significant prolongation of the claudication
      distance after 10 weeks of treatment (10 mg 1x/day), while the results after ASA (100 mg
      daily) were inconclusive (Illnait et al., 2008).

      The group of new antiplatelet drugs, used in PAD patients, also includes rivaroxaban (trade
      name of the medicinal product Xarelto). Currently, the results of the COMPASS study have
      shown that rivaroxaban in a vascular dose (2.5 mg 2x/day) combined with ASA (75-100 mg
      1x/day) provides more effective cardiovascular protection (defined together as cardiovascular
      death, myocardial infarction and stroke) compared to ASA alone (Anand SS et al. 2018; Olinic
      DM et al. 2018; Connolly SJ, 2018). Other studies with the acronyms MACE and MALE, conducted
      in the PAD patients of nearly 5,000 cases in total, confirm that the use of rivaroxaban
      provides comprehensive vascular protection in this group of patients. The former showed a 28%
      reduction in the risk of cardiovascular death/myocardial infarction/brain stroke, the latter
      a 44% reduction in the risk of acute lower limb ischemia and a 46% reduction in the risk of
      acute/chronic limb ischemia and a 70% reduction in the risk of large amputations. This is the
      only anticoagulant that, in combination with ASA, reduces mortality in patients with coronary
      artery disease (CAD) and PAD. At the same time, Xarelto, in a vascular dose, in combination
      with ASA, does not cause a significant increase in the risk of major bleedings compared to
      ASA itself. So far, this drug has not been tested in the context of prolongation of the
      claudication distance.

      Rivaroxaban inhibits the formation of thrombin and clots by directly inhibiting factor Xa
      (activated factor X), thus preventing the transformation of prothrombin into thrombin and
      interrupting the final common path of the blood clotting cascade. This drug competitively
      inhibits factor Xa with 10,000 times the selectivity of related serine proteases such as
      thrombin and factors VIIa, IXa, and XIa. Numerous experimental data suggest the role of
      clotting system components in regulating atherosclerosis progression (Borensztajn K et al.,
      2008; Borissoff et al., 2009; Platek and Szymanski, 2019). Various factors of the coagulation
      cascade mediate these activities, and the broadest spectrum of action concerns the effect of
      the complex of factor Xa and thrombin precisely.

      Scientific research confirms the pleiotropic effects of rivaroxaban on the cardiovascular
      system. However, most of the currently available observations come from basic research whose
      results need to be confirmed in clinical trials. Among the planned clinical trials that may
      establish pleiotropic rivaroxaban actions, the PRE -FER-AF study (PREvention oF
      thromboembolic events - European Registry in Atrial Fibrillation) is mentioned as the most
      important. This study aims to determine the efficacy of oral anticoagulants other than
      vitamin K antagonists (NOAC) in preventing endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerosis
      progression in patients with atrial fibrillation. However, it will not provide information on
      the effect of the drug on the progress of PAD or exercise tolerance.

      3. The objective

      The aim of the study is to assess the protective efficacy of rivaroxaban, administered
      together with ASA, in comparison with the efficacy of ASA alone, with respect to intermittent
      claudication and exercise tolerance in patients with PAD over a 3-month period.

      4. Type of study

      Prospective, observational, unblinded (open), randomized, case-control, single-centre.

      5. Description of the study group (age, gender, health status, size of the group).

      The study will include PAD patients in Fountaine stage II, hospitalized in the Clinical
      Hospital of Transfiguration (Department of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery, Angiology and
      Phlebology of the Poznan University of Medical Sciences), monitored in the adjacent
      Outpatient Clinic or referred by cooperating physicians who will use a different protocol of
      anticoagulation pharmacotherapy to prevent thrombotic events. The recommended pharmacotherapy
      does not exceed the standard of treatment in patients with PAD.

      5.1 Size of the study group. At least 60 PAD patients will be included. The collection and
      observation of the study group will take place until the scientific goal of the study is
      achieved. Therefore the possibility of increasing the recruitment of patients for the study
      is assumed up to 100 patients.

      5.2 Characteristics of the study group. The inclusion/exclusion criteria, medical history,
      and cardiovascular risk factors will be examined. Then patients will be subjected to
      objective assessment of exercise tolerance, assessment of claudication distance,
      implementation of anticoagulation pharmacotherapy protocol and prospective study protocol.
      Venous blood samples (9-18 ml), and capillary blood for diagnostic, biochemical, and
      molecular analysis will be collected. Costs will be shared between cooperating centers.

      5.3 Pharmacotherapy. Vascular doses of drugs will be used in one group: 1 x/day ASA 75-100 mg
      and in the other: 1 x/day ASA 75-100 mg + 2 x/day 2.5 mg Xarelto.

      6. Methods The general study plan assumes up to 5 visits of the patient to the cooperating
      centers during the study. First visit to the Hospital-Outpatient Clinic for recruitment
      (interview with the patient, obtaining written consent, patient registration, the appointment
      of the next visit, and optionally USG-Doppler of arteries). Second visit to the hospital's
      blood collection point for fasting blood tests (blood collection for tests and optionally
      USG-Doppler of arteries). During the third and fourth visits at University of Physical
      Education treadmill tests with additional tests (ECG, ABI, TCPO2 measurements before and
      after treadmill test, as well as biochemical evaluation of effort tolerance and subjective
      assessment of effort using Borg scale) will be performed. During third visit, randomization
      will also be done. The fourth visit will be scheduled after three months. Then data will be
      collected and analyzed. During the fifth visit, USG-Doppler of arteries will be performed,
      and a patient recommendation will be issued.

      6.1 Clinical characteristics of the studied population. The following clinical data will be
      collected for the study: a) results of aortic and lower limb arteries imaging, b) results of
      heart function tests, c) assessment of the occurrence and severity of atherosclerotic lesions
      in blood vessels (including: ABI, IMT,TcPO2 value), d) results of fasting venous blood
      laboratory tests including blood lipid parameters, glucose metabolism, liver and renal
      function, homocysteine, folic acid, peripheral blood morphology, blood coagulation
      parameters, e) blood pressure parameters, f) results of virological and bacteriological
      tests, g) anthropometric data, h) smoking status, i) pharmacotherapy j) coexisting diseases,
      k) pain, l) family history of cardiovascular disease and cancer.

      6.2 Treadmill test. The effect of pharmacotherapy will be assessed based on the treadmill
      test that will be carried out according to Gardner protocol (Gardner et al., 1991). Patients
      will march on a treadmill at a constant speed of 3.2 km/h. The initial angle of the slope
      will be 0% and will be raised by 2% every 2 minutes. The test will be carried out in the
      Laboratory of Functional Testing of the Department of Physiology and Biochemistry of the
      University of Physical Education in Poznan, with no contraindications (based on the result of
      an ECG). The subjects will be tested at each of the test dates to assess the claudication
      distance on the Katana S30p medical treadmill (Lode BV, Netherlands) (Mika et al. 2009). The
      total time of each test will not exceed 16 minutes 40 seconds, and the regeneration time will
      be at least 5 minutes. When the patient reports pain (i.e., grade 2 on a subjective pain
      assessment scale), the time of occurrence of the claudication will be recorded, from which
      the claudication distance (DGCH) will be estimated. The test will be interrupted when very
      severe pain occurs that prevents further walking (step 5 corresponding to maximum walking
      time), and the maximum walking time will then be recorded. The maximum walking time will be
      used to estimate the maximum walking distance (DGMAX). Once the treadmill tests have been
      completed, patients will undergo a control ECG examination to exclude ischemic changes in the
      heart muscle and cardiac arrhythmias.

      6.3. Evaluation of exercise tolerance. The assessment of exercise tolerance will be carried
      out based on the duration of the effort and questionnaires (Borg scale; Smarż et al. 2015),
      and biochemical exponents (metabolic equivalent MET-s will be estimated; Bires AM et al.,
      2013). At rest and 3 minutes after the exercise, the intensity of metabolic exercise acidosis
      will be assessed based on lactate concentration in capillary blood taken from the fingertip.
      At the same time, venous blood will also be collected for other biochemical tests, including
      gasometry.

      6.4 Length of observation. The effects of the treatment will be assessed within three months,
      but the observation period can be extended to a maximum of 12 months.

      6.5 End points of the study. The main endpoints of this study and the complications have been
      developed in accordance with the results adopted in the COMPASS study. Parameters related to
      the effects of the treadmill test were added.

      6.6 Biological material and its use. Blood samples will be collected for further analysis and
      DNA extraction. The concentration of lactate will be tested using EDGE Blood Lactate Test
      Strip, ApexBio, (Taiwan). The level of selected blood biomarkers will be assessed by the
      immunoenzymatic method (ELISA) for proteins, and TaqMan tests or corresponding methods for
      circulating miRNAs and DNA.

        The primary selection criterion for all respondents is the presence of PAD and the
        Caucasian ancestry. PAD patients with intermittent claudication and no clinical
        contraindications to the treadmill test will be enrolled in the study. Patients with PAD in
        Stage II Fountaine will be qualified for the study. The disease will be confirmed with an
        ankle-brachial index (ABI), with a result of less than 0.90. For all participants, ABI will
        be measured at the beginning of the study; the result will be calculated from the ratio of
        the highest systolic blood pressure on the limb to the highest systolic blood pressure on
        the shoulder.
