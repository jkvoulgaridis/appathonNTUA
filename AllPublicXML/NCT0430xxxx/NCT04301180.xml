  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Childhood obesity is a problem of high prevalence and repercussions in adulthood. It is
      mostly due to inadequate life habits, modifiable through preventive strategies. The objective
      was to evaluate in the medium term the effectiveness of an intervention on adherence to the
      Mediterranean diet pattern in preschoolers.

      Method: Community trial with two groups, in children between 3-5 years. The experimental
      group conducted a school garden and the usual contents on human body and health were taught
      in the control. Two schools were selected by cluster sampling, whose first unit of
      randomization were the educational areas followed by schools. The adaptation to the
      Mediterranean diet pattern was evaluated using the KIDMED questionnaire and weight, height,
      BMI and sociodemographic variables were controlled.

    <intervention_model_description>The experimental group conducted 10 weekly sessions, with an approximate duration of 45 minutes per session, which consisted of the presentation of food education content while conducting an orchard with seasonal vegetables. Simple recipes were also described in which these vegetables were included to be made at home, along with information from children's books that dealt with the topic of food and were available in the public library.
The control group received the usual training corresponding to the contents of the &quot;human body&quot; module that is currently taught in each center.
All children in the experimental groups were given written instructions so that they could perform at their home, together with their parents, the manipulative activities suggested each week. All these contents were common for all the participants in the study.</intervention_model_description>
