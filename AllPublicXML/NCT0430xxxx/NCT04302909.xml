  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is the most common entrapment neuropathy in the general
      population.The focus extracorporeal shock wave (fEWST) is a non invasive treatment for
      various diseases. FESWT is new and potential treatment for peripheral nerve entrapment/
      peripheral neuropathy . But there is still little known about the effects and long term
      effects of fESWT in the treatment of CTS.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to determine the effectiveness of fESWT in patients with carpal
      tunnel syndrome compared to participants receiving only night splint. Therefore 40 patients
      with mild to moderate CTS (verified by nerve conduction velocity) will be randomized to
      receive either fESWT (1-session a week for 3 weeks) or sham fESWT(1-session a week for 3
      weeks). All subjects will be asked to wear night splints.

      Evaluation will be performed at baseline (VAS, hand grip, electrodiagnostic parameters,
      questionnaires), 3 weeks (VAS, hand grip, questionnaires), 12 and 24 weeks (VAS, hand grip,
      electrodiagnostic parameters, questionnaires) after treatment.
