      FINOMAIN is a community-based, cluster randomized controlled trial (cRCT) of dance
      intervention INDAK and standardized vascular care. The study aims to develop and assess
      effectiveness of a cost-effective and culturally - fit intervention for Filipino older adults
      at higher risks of developing dementia.

      The first objective of the study is to assess the efficacy of dance intervention INDAK on
      cognitive function as assessed by the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale - Cognitive
      (ADAS-Cog), Mnemonic Similarity Task (MST), and Executive Function Composites (EFC) among
      older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). To increase the sensitivity of primary
      outcome for various composites of cognition, aside from ADAS-Cog that assesses core cognitive
      deficits of dementia, investigators will develop an executive function composite that will
      combine measures of executive control using performance outcomes on tests including Trail
      Making Test (TMT), Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST), Verbal Fluency Test (VFT), and
      Number Cancellation Task (NCT). Executive function composite scores have been used to track
      aging populations at risk for dementia and are shown to be sensitive in capturing
      cerebrovascular benefits and used as instruments in studies with similar non-pharmacological
      intervention (i.e. aerobic exercise, dance). Additionally, we will add MST which is a measure
      for episodic memory, memory representations and pattern discrimination which are all
      cognitive domains highly correlated with hippocampal function.

      The second objective of the study is to determine effect of dance on neuroplasticity as
      measured by brain volumetry and functional connectivity demonstrated through Magnetic
      Resonance Imaging (MRI) and change in other behavioral and functional outcomes of
      participants with MCI.

      FINOMAIN is a single-blind (assessor blinded), community-based, cluster randomized controlled
      trial (cRCT) of a multicomponent intervention with two arms. The intervention arm will
      receive 12 months (1 hour, 2 times per week) of training on the ballroom dance modules called
      INDAK (Improving Neurocognition through Dance and Kinesthetics), nutrition counseling and
      vascular risks management. The control group will receive the same nutrition counseling and
      vascular risks management except dance (INDAK).

      Study population: In this pilot trial of FINOMAIN, the study aim to enroll at least 72 (pilot
      size approximately 20% of computed 328 total sample size) community-dwelling Filipino older
      adult participants aged 60 years and above with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) based on
      Petersen criteria and documented by cognitive symptoms and cognitive performance on
      standardized cognitive test (ADAS-Cog) which is ≥ 1.5 standard deviation (SD) below Filipino
      norms for ADAS-Cog and has a Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) of 0.5. Participants should not
      fulfill DSM-V criteria for major neurocognitive disorders. Absence of dementia is further
      confirmed when there is no functional impairment based on the Lawton's Instrumental
      Activities of Daily Living (IADL) scale and no significant neuropsychiatric symptoms as
      detected by the Neuropsychiatric Inventory - Questionnaire (NPI-Q). Exclusion to study are
      major sensory impairment (i.e. hearing and visual impairment) that limit testing, dance
      participation and a pre-existing illness that in the judgment of the study physician
      precludes engagement in moderate physical activity such as INDAK.

      The study duration will be 24 months, but the study intervention will last for 12 months. The
      intervention arm will receive 12 months (1 hour, 2 times per week) of training on the dance
      modules called INDAK, nutrition counseling and vascular risks management. The control group
      will receive the same nutrition counseling and vascular risks management except dance
      (INDAK).

      The intervention team consists of research nurses, nutritionists, physicians and dance
      teachers. The dance intervention INDAK is a structured modular dance consisting of 8 types of
      ballroom dances with increasing complexity. The INDAK intervention will be done two times a
      week, one hour each time, for 12 months. The nurse will use a log book to register the
      frequency and duration of participation for each participant. From our previous experience,
      adverse events were infrequent limited to musculoskeletal pains in the first two weeks of
      study. However, to ensure safety, a trained nurse will always be present at each dance
      session and liaise with local hospitals in case of unexpected events such as fall, dizziness,
      or general exhaustion occur. The nurse records vital signs of all participants before and
      after the dance.

      The nutrition counseling is based on &quot;Pinggang Pinoy&quot; or Filipino plate recommendation of the
      Filipino Nutrition Research Institute (FNRI) and standardized vascular care for hypertension,
      diabetes and dyslipidemia based on Filipino standard guidelines. The nurses will monitor the
      participants every month and use a log book to record their compliance and advise
      participants on a continuing basis. The community physicians and nurses will meet with the
      participants at 3, 6, and 9 months to monitor their cardiovascular and metabolic conditions
      and revise their management plan if necessary. If the nurses detect an urgent problem during
      the monthly monitoring, nurses must alert participants to see the community physicians on an
      ad-hoc basis. The participants will also be provided with a diary to log their implementation
      of risk management plan and issues that need to be discuss with the nurses and physicians.

      Follow-up visits will be conducted by the assessment team (i.e. neurologists, psychologists
      and nurse) on the 6th and 12th month of the intervention period. To ensure blinding,
      participants are asked not to discuss any intervention with anyone. At each meeting, the same
      clinical data as from the baseline assessments and laboratory tests will be collected as
      mentioned above. Neuroimaging will be done after 12-month from baseline study period. After
      all data were collected and encoded, data cleaning, processing and analysis will be done. The
      following are the methods for data acquisition, processing and analysis:

      MRI acquisition, processing and analysis: Participants will be scanned in a 3T MRI scanner
      (Philips Achieva) using an 8-channel head coil. The ADNI-3 (http://adni.loni.usc.edu/adni-3/)
      recommended imaging protocols will be used to allow data to be comparable with the ADNI
      centers and good potential for data sharing on open access platforms. For resting-state fMRI,
      participants will be asked to keep their eyes open and fixate on a cross (10 minutes). The
      fMRI task: Participants will undergo 2 runs (6 -7 minutes each) of the visual working memory
      task. Each cycle consists of 1 block of high-load and 1 block of low-load that had 2 trials
      each. Each block is interleaved by a 1.6 seconds interval and block duration of 20 seconds.
      There will be 10 cycles in each run adding up to a total of 20 high-load and 20 low-load
      trials. Each run lasts 400 seconds.

      The Voxel Based Morphometry (VBM8) will be applied for overall brain volumetric analysis with
      the high resolution MPRAGE T1-weighted image acquired. FMRIB Software Library (FSL) and Tract
      Based Spatial Statistics (TBSS) will be applied for diffusion MRI to understand changes in
      structural connectivity. The high-resolution MPRAGE scan will also be applied for automated
      hippocampal volumetric studies using NeuroQuant. The axial thin T2-weighted and FLAIR will be
      coronal scans are used for detecting subcortical and deep white mater hyperintensities (WMH).
      The fMRI data will be pre-processed and analyzed using the Statistical Parametric Mapping
      (SPM12) software package. All structural and functional images will be re-oriented before the
      EPI data is pre-processed using the conventional procedure in three phases.

      Statistical analysis (neurocognitive and behavioral measures): Primary (ADAS-Cog, MST, EFC
      consisting of Verbal Fluency Test (VFT), Number Cancellation Task (NCT), Digit Symbol
      Substitution Task (DSST) and Trail Making Test (TMT) and secondary outcomes (neuroimaging:
      MRI, GDS, EQVAS, NPI-Q, DAD, BBS and Lawton's IADL) will be analyzed in the intent-to-treat
      population as well as in the per-protocol population (complete at least 80% of INDAK modules
      and participate in at least 30 minutes of dance each time). The study will employ univariate,
      bivariate, and multivariate statistics. For univariate, descriptive statistics (mean/SD;
      frequencies/percentages) will be used to summarize socio-demographics and other baseline
      characteristics. The bivariate analyses that examine underlying relationships between the
      outcomes and other clinical characteristics are the following: t-test for continuous
      variables and Chi square test (or Fisher Exact Test when 20 of the cells have the expected
      count less than five) for categorical variables to compare baseline data and outcome measures
      at baseline between the intervention and control groups. For multivariate analyses, the study
      would estimate the effect from baseline to follow-up at 12 months between randomization
      groups. Since the participants will be measured 3 times (baseline, 6 months, 12 months), the
      study will be using the repeated measures analysis of covariance (RM ANCOVA) to test the
      significance between group means but controlling for possible confounders. To analyze for the
      secondary outcomes, the power will be calculated retrospectively to see if the sample size is
      big enough to prove statistical significance. Assuming that enough power is yielded, repeated
      measures ANCOVA will also be used.

      The end of study analysis will be done for three months and final report will be prepared for
      two months to answer the aims of the study on how multicomponent intervention significantly
      maintains or improve cognition of older adults with MCI as measured by primary outcomes and
      how the intervention affects neural plasticity and functional connectivity as measured by MRI
      after 12 months of study period.
