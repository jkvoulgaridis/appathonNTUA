  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study investigates if an increased dose of brodalumab will give improved efficacy in
      psoriasis in patients with a body weight of over 120 kg. The increased dose will be compared
      to the standard dose of brodalumab plus placebo.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Brodalumab is an anti-IL-17 receptor antibody and blocks the inflammatory effects of IL-17 in
      the skin. Some psoriasis patients with a higher body weight experienced a lower treatment
      effect of brodalumab in clinical studies. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to
      investigate if increasing the dose of brodalumab will increase the effect of treatment for
      patients with a higher body weight. The study will run over 60-62 weeks, including screening,
      treatment period and safety follow-up, with the primary endpoint measurement at Week 40.
      Patients will receive subcutaneous injections of brodalumab at Week 0, 1, and 2, followed by
      injections every 2 weeks. Participants not fulfilling a predefined response at any time after
      Week 16 will receive a dose adjustment to 280 mg brodalumab or 210 mg brodalumab plus placebo
      every 2 weeks.

The packaging and labelling of the pre-filled syringes with 70 mg (0.5 mL) brodalumab or placebo will contain no evidence to distinguish brodalumab from placebo. It is not considered possible to distinguish between brodalumab and placebo visually; both solutions are colourless.</masking_description>

    <measure>Having at least 90% lower Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 40</time_frame>
    <description>The PASI score is the most widely used tool in clinical practice and clinical trials to assess the severity and extent of psoriasis. The assessment is done based on the condition of the disease at the time of evaluation and not in relation to the condition at a previous visit. The investigator will assess the severity of 3 psoriasis disease characteristics (redness, thickness, and scaliness) on each of the 4 body regions, head/neck, trunk, upper extremities, and lower extremities, according to a severity scale. The investigator will also assess the extent of psoriasis within each of the 4 body regions. This gives a composite score ranging from 0-72, with higher values indicating a more severe and/or more extensive condition.</description>

    <time_frame>Week 40</time_frame>
    <description>The Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) is a validated questionnaire with content specific to those with dermatology conditions. The DLQI consists of 10 items addressing the participant's perception of the impact of their skin disease on different aspects of their HQoL over the last week such as dermatology-related symptoms and feelings, daily activities, leisure, work or school, personal relationships, and the treatment. Each item is scored on a 4-point Likert scale (0 = 'not at all ⁄not relevant'; 1 = 'a little'; 2 = 'a lot'; 3 = 'very much'). The total score is the sum of the 10 items (0 to 30); a high score is indicative of a poor HQoL.</description>
