  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Guillain-barre syndrome (GBS) is an acute immune-mediated polyneuropathy. Intravenous Gamma
      globulin is an effective therapy.Although high doses of gamma globulin are clinically
      effective, the patient's recovery and clinical prognosis vary. The establishment of a cohort
      study on the therapeutic effect of gamma globulin in Guillain-barre Syndrome is beneficial to
      the diagnosis of the disease and to the understanding of the natural course of the disease
      and the efficacy of drug treatment.
