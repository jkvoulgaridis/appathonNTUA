  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test whether the addition of certain bioactive ingredients to
      a new infant formula (HMOs, osteopontin and probiotics) can have a favorable impact on the
      development of the infant's immune system in the first months of life.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nowadays, almost all commercial infant formulas resemble the &quot;gold standard&quot; of breast milk
      in terms of composition of essential nutrients, but it is still a challenge to identify and
      incorporate certain bioactive components capable of replicating those stimuli typical of
      breast milk that can program growth, infant development and maturation of the immune system.

      The purpose of this study is to test whether the addition of certain bioactive ingredients to
      a new infant formula (HMOs, osteopontin and probiotics) can have a favorable impact on the
      development of the infant's immune system in the first months of life.

      In addition, considering that the quality of feeding at these early ages will program (Early
      programming) the health and physiology of the child and the future adult, the study wants to
      obtain evidence of the effects of this new infant formula on the immune system and the
      development of the child compared to breast milk during the first year of life, hoping that
      it promotes proper growth, adequate cognitive development and maturation of the immune system
      as similar as possible to children fed to the mother's breast.
