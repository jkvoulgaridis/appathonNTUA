  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to find out about ways to enhance well-being during
      pregnancy and the postpartum period (after the baby is born). The &quot;Mamma Mia&quot; app and/or
      guided support from study staff (&quot;Mamma Mia Plus&quot;) may be helpful because the app provides
      skills and information related to many important topics during and after pregnancy. This
      study will allow us to learn more about whether and how the app is helpful to women.

      This study will compare findings in women who do not use the app (&quot;usual care group&quot;) versus
      women who use the app (&quot;Mamma Mia group&quot;) versus women who use the app and receive regular
      contact from study staff (&quot;Mamma Mia Plus&quot;). The study will assess well-being, depression,
      stress, and anxiety as well as whether certain factors (for example, women's age, type of
      healthcare provider, amount of social support) are related to the effects of the app. For
      women randomized to use the app, the study will also collect information about the time spent
      using the app and the modules completed.

      Usual prenatal and postpartum care involves regular visits with participant's women's health
      care provider while pregnant and after the baby is born. In this study, participants will
      receive continue receiving usual care. In addition, participants will be randomly assigned
      (like the flip of a coin) to participate in one of the following groups:

        1. The &quot;usual care group&quot;, or

        2. The &quot;Mamma Mia group&quot; (which is to use the &quot;Mamma Mia&quot; app regularly), or

        3. The &quot;Mamma Mia Plus group&quot; (which is to use app regularly plus receive regular contact
           with study staff).

      There is a 1 chance in 3 of being assigned to each of the three groups. participants have an
      equal chance of being assigned to any one of the groups.

      Participants in the &quot;usual care group&quot; will be asked to do the following things:

        1. Complete survey questions at entrance into the study.

        2. Complete survey questions every few months (see schedule below).

      Participants in the &quot;Mamma Mia group&quot; will be asked to do the following things:

        1. Complete survey questions at entrance into the study.

        2. Use the &quot;Mamma Mia&quot; app on a regular basis (on average: weekly for about 10 minutes)
           from entering study until six months postpartum; participants will receive an email
           reminder to complete modules when they should be completed.

        3. Complete survey questions every few months.

      Participants in the &quot;Mamma Mia Plus group&quot; will be asked to do the following things:

        1. Complete survey questions at entrance into the study.

        2. Use the &quot;Mamma Mia&quot; app on a regular basis (on average: weekly for about 10 minutes)
           from entrance into the study until six months postpartum.

        3. Complete survey questions every few months.

        4. Participants will receive phone calls or emails or texts (depending upon participant
           preference) from study staff every few months.

    <description>Users of the Mamma Mia program progress through the intervention in a sequence of modules.
Every day that a module should be completed, you will receive a notification with a reminder to access the app. By clicking on the reminder, you can access that particular day's session content. Modules involve a variety of information and activities; for example, there are guided mindfulness practices, information on breastfeeding, instructional videos on how to interpret your baby's cries, and discussions on how to have effective discussions with your partner or healthcare provider about your needs.</description>
