      This study will be conducted using a randomized, controlled, crossover design with three
      treatments. The purpose of the study is to determine the effects of diabetes-specific formula
      on glycemic control in individuals with type 2 diabetes.

      All study participants will be asked to attend a test session where their glycemic,
      insulinemic and satiety response to a test meal will be measured, followed by a seven-day
      washout period where they will not receive or consume any study meal during this period. This
      cycle will be repeated until all participants complete three test sessions.
