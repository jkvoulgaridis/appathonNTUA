    <textblock>
      Participants will download a phone-tracking app for a week to track phone usage, providing
      objective data on usage patterns. Quantitative tasks and questionnaires will also be carried
      out before and after the tracking period.

      A notable shortcoming of existing mobile phone research is that 'phone use' has almost
      exclusively been measured through subjective reports - by simply asking respondents how much
      time they spend on their mobile phones each day. This operational definition, however, is a
      major shortcoming as phone use is difficult to track - and is thus likely to be highly
      inaccurate.

      To address this gap, the investigators describe in this proposal a first step to characterize
      phone usage in an objective manner - by asking adolescents to download a phone-tracking app
      for a week. This circumvents measurement errors inherent to self-reports, and allows us to
      probe: (1) how accurate adolescents' estimates are of their own phone usage, and (2) whether
      objective phone usage predicts any cognitive, socio-emotional, or physical outcomes. The
      completion of this study will represent an important step forward in the development of
      empirically-driven guidelines on phone use amongst adolescents.
