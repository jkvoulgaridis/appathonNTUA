  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test the impacts of real time fMRI neurofeedback in patients with Borderline
      Personality Disorder. This is a pilot study in a small number of people enrolled in clinical
      programs at Yale New Haven Hospital.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Affective Lability</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline compared to the week after intervention</time_frame>
    <description>This outcome will be measured by the change in variance of negative emotions measured using ecologic momentary assessment (EMA: surveys sent to participants by smartphone app) repeatedly over a four-day period at each timepoint. The variance between measurements at each timepoint will be calculated, and compared to the other timepoints. There will be 5 negative emotion items at each timepoint, and a higher score indicates more negative emotion.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Mean Negative Affect</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline compared to the week after intervention</time_frame>
    <description>This outcome will be measured by change in mean negative emotion score measured using ecologic momentary assessment (EMA: surveys sent to participants by smartphone app) repeatedly over a four-day period at each timepoint. The mean score at each timepoint will be calculated, and compared to the other timepoints. There will be 5 negative emotion items at each timepoint, and a higher score indicates more negative emotion.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Borderline Personality Disorder Symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline compared to the week after intervention</time_frame>
    <description>This outcome will be measured by change in Borderline Symptom List (BSL-23) score after neurofeedback. This scale has 23 items, each scored 0-4, and total score is mean item endorsement (sum of all items divided by 23). Higher scores indicate more symptom endorsement.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Amygdala Regulation</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline compared to the week after intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Change in ability to regulate amygdala activity when exposed to provocative images. Amygdala activity is measured as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) blood oxygen dependant (BOLD) signal</description>
