    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to explore the association of high sensitivity
      C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and radiotherapy(RT)-induced toxicity in patients with
      nasopharyngeal carcinoma. In each patient, hsCRP levels in the pre- and post-RT plasma
      samples will be measured according to the schedule we set.

    <description>The hscrp levels in the plasma samples from each participant were measured at the following time points:
at the time of diagnosis completion/before the initiation of the first neoadjuvant chemotherapy
before the initiation of each neoadjuvant chemotherapy
before the initiation of the first radiotherapy
during radiotherapy, once a week
1 week and 4weeks after the last radiotherapy</description>
