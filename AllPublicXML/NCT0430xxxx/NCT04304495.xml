  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Falls by older adults are often predictable and preventable, yet there is a notable lack of
      research evaluating interventions to reduce the occurrence of recurrent falls in older adult
      Emergency Department (ED) patients. In this study, patients, caregivers, physical therapists
      (PTs), pharmacy specialists, and clinicians provide a patient-centric, collaborative approach
      to fall prevention that bridges the ED visit with outpatient resources. The Apple Watch
      Series 4 will be evaluated by older adults and their caregivers for usability as a tool to
      track gait, function, and fall events.

      Falls by older adults are often predictable and preventable, yet there is a notable lack of
      research evaluating interventions to reduce the occurrence of recurrent falls in older adult
      Emergency Department (ED) patients. Dr. Goldberg's Beeson K76 project GAPcare II, the
      Geriatric Acute &amp; Post-acute Care Coordination Program for Fall Prevention in the Emergency
      Department, addresses this lack of research by further refining and examining the
      intervention she created in her GEMSSTAR R03 project. In her Beeson K76 GAPcare II project,
      Dr. Goldberg will build on the lessons learned from the GEMSSTAR R03 work. GAPcare II's
      specific aims are to: conduct field testing with geriatric patients with and without
      cognitive impairment and their caregivers to assess the feasibility, acceptability, and
      usability of the Apple Watch to objectively measure fall-related outcomes.

        We will conduct field testing with older adult ED patients who sustained a fall and their
        caregivers (n=30 total) to determine if they can use the Apple Watch either (1)
        continuously or (2) periodically.
