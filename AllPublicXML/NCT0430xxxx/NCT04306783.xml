  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose a pilot study of monitoring a sample of 6 older patients receiving
      active cancer treatment over a period of 6 months with in-home sensor monitors installed and
      maintained by Foresite Healthcare. The investigators also propose exploring the beliefs and
      attitudes of those who are not willing to allow in-home sensor monitoring by asking them to
      complete a brief survey related to in-home sensor monitoring. The investigators hypothesize
      that patients will find the equipment acceptable and unintrusive, that changes in
      home-monitored patient parameters will precede clinical events and that patient trajectories
      will be more fully characterized with the in home sensors.

    <description>Older adults with cancer undergoing systemic cancer treatment will undergo passive monitoring with motion sensors and bed sensor. Passive infrared (PIR) motion sensors will be installed in their homes to detect presence in a particular room (e.g., bathroom or kitchen) as well as for specific activities. There will also be a bed sensor, which is a pneumatic strip installed under the bed linens, which measures displacement of the resident's upper torso as he or she lies on the bed. Participants will complete a baseline primarily self-administered survey, an abbreviated assessment with each follow up clinic visit (at least once per month) for 6 months of follow up and a final end of study assessment.</description>
