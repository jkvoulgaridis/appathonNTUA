  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of extended dosing of
      IONIS-PKK-LRx administered subcutaneously (SC), with alternative dosing and/or dose frequency
      with IONIS-PKK-LRx in participants with hereditary angioedema (HAE).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label extension study of IONIS-PKK-LRx in up to 24 participants with HAE. The
      length of participation in the study is approximately 68 weeks, which includes an up to
      4-week qualification period, a 52-week treatment period, and a 12-week post-treatment period.

    <description>The AE-QoL was developed to measure health-related quality of life (HRQoL) impairment in participants with recurrent angioedema. The AE-QoL is a self-administered questionnaire that can be completed in less than 5 minutes. It comprises 17 items across 4 domains: functioning, fatigue/mood, fears/shame, and food. Responses use a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 'never' to 'very often.' Global and domain scores range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating greater impairment</description>
