  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to determine the signs and symptoms of irregular
      sleep-wake rhythm disorder (ISWRD) that are important to patients and caregivers of patients
      with Alzheimer's disease dementia (AD-D), AD-D with cerebrovascular disease (CVD), and/or
      vascular dementia (VaD) and ISWRD, and to draft an instrument or instruments to assess them.

      The study is comprised of an interview with patients and caregivers to determine the signs
      and symptoms of ISWRD that are important to patients and caregivers of patients.

             and/or VaD on the basis of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke
             (NINDS) and the Association Internationale pour la Recherche et l'Enseignement en
             Neurosciences (AIREN) criteria, and AD-D with CVD on the basis of NINDS-AIREN criteria

             available. No MMSE will be conducted during telephone visits, but if a recent MMSE is
             available, that is, within the past 3 months, that MMSE must be assessed for
             eligibility.

          4. Meets criteria for Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, Irregular Sleep-Wake Type
             (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders - 5th edition [DSM-5]) and the
