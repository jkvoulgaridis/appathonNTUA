    <textblock>
      This study will test the feasibility and acceptability of virtual reality assisted cognitive
      behavioural therapy for the treatment of social anxiety in autistic adolescents. Five
      adolescents will receive the intervention and a parent/caregiver of each adolescent will be
      asked to act as informants on some questionnaires and interviews.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Difficulties interacting with others in social situations is a core characteristic of autism
      spectrum disorder (ASD). These difficulties are intensified by social anxiety - commonly
      experienced in autistic adolescents. A promising psychological treatment is cognitive
      behavioural therapy (CBT), but there are constraints in its use for the autistic population.
      For example, CBT requires patients to imagine being in a social situation that would cause
      anxiety, but autistic people often experience difficulties with imagination. The use of
      virtual reality (VR) in CBT may help to lessen such constraints. VR uses 3D
      computer-generated visual environments displayed through a head-mounted display. The images
      are synchronised to the movements of the user such that they experience feeling immersed in
      the virtual scene. The virtual scene can involve social scenarios, making it an ideal tool
      for eliciting social anxiety in the treatment setting. The investigators can see if these
      virtual scenarios are indeed eliciting social anxiety by recording physiological responses
      (e.g. heart rate) in parallel with patients' anxiety ratings during exposure. This is
      important for CBT to be effective.

      This study will test the feasibility and acceptability of VR-assisted CBT, combined with the
      use of physiological measurements, in autistic adolescents experiencing social anxiety. The
      therapy will typically consist of 8-20 weekly sessions and will be delivered by clinical
      psychologists in local mental health services. Conventional outcome measures will be used and
      feedback from youth and their parents/caregivers will be requested. The results of this study
      may lead to modification of the treatment and research methods. They will inform a later
      pilot randomised controlled trial.

    <description>Measured using the Revised Children's Anxiety and Depression Scale (and Subscales) (RCADS; Chorpita et al. 2000). This is a 47-item self-report questionnaire. Both youth (suitable for ages 8 to 18 years) and parental/caregiver forms will be administered. Participants rate each item using a 4-point Likert scale (0 = Never; 3 = Always). The questionnaires are scored using spreadsheets provided by the developer. A t-score is computed based on the person's school year. T-scores of 70 and higher are classified as clinically significant. Higher t-scores indicate increased symptoms.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Global Outcome Ratings of Severity of Illness.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; end of therapy up to 20 weeks; follow-up: 6 weeks post-treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>Measured using the Clinical Global Impression-Improvement Scale (CGI-I; Guy, 1976).
At baseline, the researcher will rate their &quot;impression&quot; of illness severity using baseline qualitative data from the Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule (ADIS-IV; Albano &amp; Silverman, 1996) on a 7-point Likert scale (1 = normal, not ill at all; 7 = among the most severely ill patients). The ADIS-IV is a semi-structured clinical interview which will be conducted separately with patients and their parents/caregivers (informants).
The same researcher will compare baseline ADIS-IV data with data obtained from a follow-up (qualitative) interview to rate &quot;improvement&quot;. The follow-up interview will be semi-structured, follow a topic guide, and be conducted with the patient and their parent/caregiver (informants) separately. Topics will cover functioning across activities of daily living. &quot;Improvement&quot; will be rated on an 8-point Likert scale (1 = completely recovered; 5 = no change; 8 = very much worse).</description>

    <description>A composite index will be computed for overall body movement during the sampling period using a 3-axis accelerometer. Sampled at 32Hz. Range [-2g, 2g]. An index for overall movement will be extracted using the standard Euclidean metric for each axis sensor at each sampling point and summed for the total recording sample length. Recordings will only be made during the first and final VR exposure sessions. In both sessions, this will involve a 5-minute baseline recording while participants experience a relaxing VR scene. This will be followed by VR exposure for &lt;1 hour during which recordings are also made.

    <description>Measured using the Subjective Units of Distress Scale (SUDs; Kim et al., 2008; Wolpe, 1973). This is a self-report scale with ratings ranging from 0 (no distress) to 10 (highest distress/anxiety ever). Ratings acquired every 120 seconds using a visual analogue scale (fear thermometer) in the VR environment. Ratings will only be collected during the first and final VR exposure sessions. In both sessions, this will involve 5-minute baseline ratings while participants experience a relaxing VR scene. This will be followed by VR exposure for &lt;1 hour during which ratings are collected. A button on the device will be used to timestamp the start and end of VR relaxation/exposure tasks.</description>

    <description>Measured using the ITC-Sense of Presence Inventory (ITC-SOPI short version; Lessiter et al., 2001). This is a 12-item self-report questionnaire that measures experiences of media. It will be used to measure sense of presence, engagement, ecological validity, and negative effects in the VR environment. For each item, respondents are asked to rate how much they agree or disagree on a 5-point Likert scale (1 = strongly disagree; 5 = strongly agree). The ratings of the three items corresponding to negative effects will be averaged when scored. Higher scores indicated increased negative effects.
This questionnaire will be administered immediately after the first and last VR exposure sessions.</description>

    <description>The intervention will be delivered in NHS services and will involve using VR to assist the delivery of conventional CBT for the treatment of social anxiety in autistic adolescents. Social situations that are commonly anxiety-evoking for this patient group will be simulated in VR and used for exposure (a typical component of CBT for social anxiety). Therapists will use a modular approach involving optional modules such as psychoeducation on anxiety in the context of ASD, managing expectations of outcome and emotional literacy training. Essential modules include rapport building, introducing the use and purpose of VR, and exposure (incorporating VR). Because CBT is delivered in routine clinical practice, the VR exposure sessions will be the main subject of interest.</description>
