  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, randomized, phase II, multicenter study of the safety and efficacy of
      atezolizumab + chemoradiotherapy compared with treatment with chemoradiotherapy in
      participants with limited stage SCLC.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants can receive concurrent or sequential chemoradiotherapy (CRT) as per local
      standard of care, but they must be randomized within 6 weeks from completion of
      chemoradiotherapy. Participants should receive at least 4 cycles of chemotherapy and
      radiotherapy dose of 56-64 Gy before randomization, and those participants who have not
      progressed during CRT will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to atezolizumab arm or control arm.
      All randomized patients will receive additional two cycles of chemotherapy (total 4-6 cycles
      of chemotherapy), and chemotherapy will be administrated concurrently with atezolizumab
      treatment for the atezolizumab arm. Whether additional two cycles of chemotherapy will be
      used will be at the discretion of investigator.

    <description>EORTC QLQ-C30, European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality-of-Life Questionnaire—Core 30 Questionnaire, is a validated, reliable self-report measure. It consists of 30 questions that assess five aspects of patient functioning (physical, emotional, role, cognitive, and social), three symptom scales (fatigue, nausea and vomiting, pain), global health/quality of life, and six single items (dyspnea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, and financial difficulties) with a recall period of the previous week. Scale scores can be obtained for the multi-item scales.</description>
