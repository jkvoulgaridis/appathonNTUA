  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This observational cohort will evaluate the cardiovascular effects of chemoradiation used to
      treat locally advanced, non-small cell lung cancer. Patients will be enrolled prior to the
      start of therapy and followed during and for at least 2 years after therapy with
      echocardiograms, nuclear stress tests, blood sampling, and quality of life surveys.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer is both the most common malignancy worldwide and the leading cause of cancer
      death in the US. While radiation therapy is highly effective for many solid tumors, thoracic
      radiation therapy carries a risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality that limits
      critical gains in cancer control and survival. The investigators will perform detailed
      cardiovascular phenotyping using biologic and imaging markers to define functional and
      physiologic perturbations that occur with radiation therapy. The study will provide insights
      into how cardiovascular risk factors and disease impact these biologic and functional
      changes. The investigators will also determine which radiotherapy dose-volume metrics are
      indicative of subclinical cardiotoxicity.

    <description>Patients will be treated with definitive concurrent chemoradiation with curative intent as determined by their medical and radiation oncologists. We will consider timing of initiation and discontinuation, type, and cumulative dose of platinum based chemotherapy. We will also consider dose, duration, and type of immunotherapy. Radiation therapy will be delivered via proton or proton therapy. Our primary radiation therapy dose-volume exposures are whole heart volumetric dose. As secondary exposures, we will comprehensively define radiation therapy dose parameters to the right ventricle, entire left ventricle, left ventricle segments, coronary arteries, and mean heart dose.</description>
