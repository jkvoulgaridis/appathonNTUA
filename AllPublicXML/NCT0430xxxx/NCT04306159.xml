  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      General anesthesia combined subcostal transversus abdominis plane (TAP)or rectus sheath block
      (RSB)can significantly reduce the use of opiates in minimally invasive surgery.However,
      similar reduction was not observed in open abdominal surgery during perioperative
      period.Therefore, the investigators should try to improve the blocking methods to reduce the
      side effects of a large number of opiates. Based on the range and its analgesic effect of
      various nerve block is obviously related to the injection site of local anesthetics, this
      randomized controlled study hypothesized that modified RSB under the guidance of surgical
      incision may be more effective in inhibiting the harmful stimulation of surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For abdominal cancer surgery with midline incision, subcostal transversus abdominis plane or
      rectus sheath block combined with general anesthesia was more effective in reducing pain
      scores and opioid consumption compared with general anesthesia alone. However, there was no
      statistically significant difference in supplementary fentanyl during operation. Besides
      adequate pain relief around incisions, blunting visceral traction response has also an
      important role in hemodynamic stability.With the evidences for a potential mechanism for the
      antinociceptive effects of propofol on visceral nociception and dexmedetomidine combined with
      oxycodone can provide good visceral analgesia, the investigators supposed that visceral
      nociception was well suppressed by adequate antinociceptive drugs. The propofol combination
      with dexmedetomidine may had significant effect on the reduction of the sympathoadrenergic
      tone with decrease of blood pressure and heart rate.

    <description>Basal blood pressure and heart rate were recorded after midazolam administration of 0.02 mg/kg. Anesthesia was induced with sufentanil 0.4 Î¼g/kg and propofol 2-2.5 mg/kg, IV route. An IV bolus of cisatracurium 0.1 mg/kg IV was given to facilitate tracheal intubation. Anesthesia was maintained with propofol 4-6 mg/kg/h combined dexmedetomidine 0.2 Î¼g/kg/h(after 0.2 Î¼g/kg/h loading dose within 15min)by bispectral index (BIS) 40-60 and additional bolus doses of remifentanil 0.2-0.5 Î¼g/kg/min to keep arterial pressure values around 20% below baseline values. Sufentanil 0.1-0.2 Î¼g/kg and flurbiprofen 100mg was administrated once the abdomen was closed, then a patient controlled analgesia pump was used. No RSB was performed.</description>
