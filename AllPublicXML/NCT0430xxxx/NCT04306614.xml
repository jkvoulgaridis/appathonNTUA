    <textblock>
      Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-guided transbronchial needle aspiration is a procedure used
      to obtain tissue samples (biopsies) of lymph nodes near the airways or of lung tumours
      growing in close proximity to the airways. Briefly, an endoscope with an ultrasound probe
      which is inserted through the mouth and into the airways. Once in the airways, the ultrasound
      allows for identification of the optimal biopsy site; a hollow biopsy needle is then inserted
      into the tissue under real-time ultrasound visualization and a sample is extracted.

      In the investigator's centre, the extracted sample is then immediately subjected to rapid
      on-site evaluation (ROSE). During the ROSE procedure, a cytotechnologist uses part of the
      sample to make a limited number direct smears which are then rapidly stained and evaluated
      under a microscope by the cytotechnologist. The cytotechnologist provides an assessment of
      the adequacy of the sample for diagnosis. The respirologist performing the EBUS then uses
      this information to: i) determine whether additional sampling is required, and ii) triage any
      additional samples for ancillary studies as needed. A final cytopathological diagnosis is
      established several days later, when all of the material from the procedure (including the
      material not evaluated at ROSE) is examined by a cytopathologist.

      There are different techniques which are utilized to perform the needle aspiration biopsy.
      Suction aspiration (where pressure suction is applied to the needle to draw out material)
      which is the standard at many centres around the world and capilliary suction (where a tiny
      wire is drawn back slowly to create more gentle suction force) which is utilized often at
      LHSC.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate for differences in ROSE adequacy between these two
      methods.
