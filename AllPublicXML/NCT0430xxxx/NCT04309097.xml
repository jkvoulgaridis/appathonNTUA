  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of the current study is to conduct a cluster-randomized control trial to
      evaluate the effectiveness of a novel digital intervention in reducing anxiety and digital
      eye strain compared to usual care among Chinese children during the period of home
      confinement.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), many countries have taken the
      decision of school closure after the confirmation of coronavirus cases in the general
      population. In China, the burden of COVID-19 is among the highest in the world, with more
      than 80,000 cases confirmed by 11th March 2020. An estimate of 220 million children and
      adolescents are confined at home for weeks with inadequate level of physical activity and
      more susceptible to anxiety. There is also a concern of digital eye strain for many children
      who spend hours daily in front of a computer screen for recreation or learning purposes.

      Recess represents an essential scheduled period in a school day for psychological and
      physical relaxation. During the unusual period of home confinement, many schools have already
      issued physical activity requirement and policy recommending recess and physical activity
      breaks. However, recess could be easily skipped by students during online learning at home.

      Mobile health intervention offers a potential opportunity for capitalizing on digital
      technology as a feasible modality to encourage recess activities, especially in regions where
      social distancing is implemented as an emergency measure. The primary aim of the current
      study is to conduct a cluster-randomized control trial to evaluate the effectiveness of a
      novel digital intervention during recess in reducing anxiety and digital eye strain compared
      to usual care among Chinese children during the period of home confinement.

    <description>Change in anxiety will be measured by the Spence Children's Anxiety Scale (SCAS) designed by Spence (1998). The SCAS (45-item) is self-report scale with a 4-point Likert type, consisting of 44 items and one open-ended question. Overall assessment is done by total score.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in syndromes of digital eye strain</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline &amp; at 2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Syndromes of digital eye strain will be measured with the Computer Vision Syndrome Questionnaire (CVS‐Q) designed by Seguí et al (2015). The self-reported CVS-Q questionnaire (16-item) evaluates the frequency (never, occasionally or often/always) and the intensity (moderate or intense) of 16 symptoms: burning, itching, feeling of a foreign body, tearing, excessive blinking, eye redness, eye pain, heavy eyelids, dryness, blurred vision, double vision, difficulty focusing for near vision, increased sensitivity to light, colored halos around objects, feeling that sight is worsening, and headache. Overall assessment is done by total score.</description>

    <description>The PROMIS pediatric sleep disturbance questionnaire (4-item), designed by Forrest et al (2018), assesses self-reported experiences of sleep disturbance over the past 7 days. Raw score will be converted to T-Score.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline &amp; at 2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be asked to indicate the average time in hours per day spent on each the following activities: reading, writing, computer/PAD use, smart phone, watching TV, and playing video games.</description>

    <description>REAP is a live-streaming platform that allows users to shoot short videos or photos related to their physical exercise or eye relaxation (e.g., staring out of the window) using their smartphones. The app has been optimised to be used with the iPhone or Android.
When taking a online course recess, students will have access to the REAP platform that allows them to watch stay-at-home workout videos developed by exercise physiologists. Students will then be asked to create their own workout videos/photos and upload them to the live-streaming platform. When upload is completed, students will receive instant motivational messages to increase their engagement with the program.</description>
