  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overarching goal of this pilot study is to explore the feasibility, acceptability, and
      patient/provider satisfaction of pharmacy-based administration and dispensing of methadone
      for opioid use disorder. The results gained will inform the development of a future multisite
      randomized clinical trial.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      . The study will use a non-randomized, prospective, single group design. Twenty long-term,
      clinically-stable methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) patients who receive between 6- and
      13-days methadone take-home doses will be enrolled in the study where their methadone
      take-home administration and dispensing will be transferred to a community pharmacy for 3
      months. Participants will also complete three follow-up assessments at 1-month, 2-months, and
      3-months after the baseline visit to collect clinical and safety information since the
      previous assessment. Primary outcomes will be focused on feasibility measures (recruitment,
      accessibility to methadone treatment, substance use, medication call back success, and
      retention in treatment). Secondary outcomes will be focused on self-reported satisfaction
      measures from MMT providers (e.g., physician, physician assistant, nurse, and counselor)
      pharmacists, and patient participants.

    <description>The recruitment rate will be assessed on a monthly basis until the enrollment target is reached. The recruitment rate is operationalized as the total number of participants consented in one month. The per-month proportion of consented participants enrolled into the pharmacy follow-up phase will also be calculated, as well as the per-month proportion of pre-screened participants that were consented.</description>

    <time_frame>Up to 3 months per participant</time_frame>
    <description>Adherence to pharmacy-based methadone treatment will be defined as the proportion of methadone take-home doses dispensed at the pharmacy out of the total number of take home doses prescribed and the proportion of successful scheduled methadone dose call-back with no signs of methadone diversion.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Treatment retention</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 months per participant</time_frame>
    <description>Treatment retention will be determined by the proportion of participants who remain in treatment at the pharmacy during the 3-month follow-up phase.</description>
