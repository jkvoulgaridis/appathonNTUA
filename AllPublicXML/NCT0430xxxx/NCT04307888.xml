      Multicentre prospective registry including consecutive patients undergoing Percutaneous
      Endovascular Aneurysm Repair (PEVAR), Percutaneous Endovascular Thoracic Aneurysm Repair
      (PTEVAR) or Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (TAVI) in which variables related to the
      percutaneous access closure for implanting devices at aorta level will be collected and
      analyzed.

      The follow-up period will be 30 days after the procedure. The duration of the recruitment
      period will be one year. All data will be collected telematically and incorporated into a
      database for subsequent statistical analysis.

      There will be 2 points for data interim analysis at 6 and 12 months after initiation of the
      study.

    <measure>Quality of Life assesed by EuroQol-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days</time_frame>
    <description>Estimated Impact of the procedure on the Quality of Life measured by EQ-5D Questionnaire on 5 dimensions; mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Mobility dimension asks about the person's walking ability. Self-care dimension asks about the ability to wash or dress by oneself, and usual activities dimension measures performance in &quot;work, study, housework, family or leisure activities&quot;. In pain/discomfort dimension, it asks how much pain or discomfort they have, and in anxiety/depression dimension, it asks how anxious or depressed they are. The study participants self-rate their level of severity for each dimension.
Rated level can be coded as 1, 2, or 3, which indicates having no problems for 1, having some problems for 2, and having extreme problems for 3. As a result, a person's health status can be defined by a 5-digit number, ranging from 11111 (having no problems in all dimensions) to 33333 (having extreme problems in all dimensions).</description>

    <measure>Incidence of Procedure-Emergent Adverse Events related to Frailty as assessed by the Modified Frailty Index (mFI-11)</measure>

    <description>Incidence of any postoperative adverse event or mortality related to the frailty assessed by the modified frailty index (mFI-11), an 11-factor score predictive of increased risk for postoperative morbidity and mortality in patients undergoing elective and emergent surgery that scores the frailty between 1 to 11, being the 11 the most frailty status.</description>

    <description>Evaluation of the discomfort or pain after the procedure determined at the end of the procedure with the Visual Analog Scale for Pain, which is a psychometric measuring instrument designed to assess the pain intensity experienced by each patient individually.
The analogous visual scale used for this study measures from 0-10 the intensity of the pain with a series of &quot;faces&quot; that show the intensity in the pain experimentation with categories like &quot;No pain&quot; approximately 0-1, mild, annoying in number 2, nagging in number 4, distressing in number 6, intense in number 8 and worst possible in number 10.</description>
