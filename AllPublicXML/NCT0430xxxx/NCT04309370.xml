      This will be a single site pilot study. 20 subjects with EPP, defined as medical record
      documentation of the onset of clinically significant psychotic symptoms within the past 10
      years, will be enrolled. Prior to randomization subjects will undergo fMRI during CC task
      (Stroop Color-Word paradigm) and resting-state paradigms. This baseline scan will also
      include a high-resolution structural sequence for neuronavigation purposes. Then, on two
      separate days, each occurring one-week apart, subjects will receive one session of excitatory
      (20 Hz) rTMS targeting the LDLPFC and one session targeting the LSPC. The order of
      stimulation sites will be randomized and counter-balanced. Immediately following each
      session, subjects will undergo repeat fMRI during CC and RS paradigms. Investigators will
      also examine the effect of rTMS on CC performance.

    <textblock>
      In spite of existing work studying rTMS as a treatment modality in schizophrenia, there are
      no studies that have examined the effects of rTMS targeting superficial CCN structures
      (LDLPFC and LSPC) on ACC activity or CCN connectivity in schizophrenia. It is also important
      to note that the vast majority of studies using rTMS in schizophrenia have examined chronic
      populations where confounds associated with prolonged duration of illness may be present. EPP
      is a desirable population to study because these individuals tend to have fewer psychiatric
      and physical comorbidities and less antipsychotic drug exposure, all of which are factors
      that may confound investigations of new treatment interventions for this illness. In light of
      the significant unmet medical need associated with schizophrenia and the grave clinical
      effect of disrupted CC in the illness, rTMS modulating the ACC, and potentially CCN
      circuitry, represents an unexplored and novel potential treatment option.

      The goal of this project is to utilize HF (20 Hz) rTMS, in conjunction with functional
      magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), to provide evidence that rTMS targeting superficial CCN
      structures (LDLPFC and LSPC) modulates: 1) activation in the ACC during in-scanner CC task
      performance and 2) functional connectivity between the CCN structures during in-scanner CC
      task performance. This study will provide vital preliminary data on target engagement
      informing future clinical trials seeking to investigate rTMS as a novel treatment for CC
      impairment in schizophrenia. This study will also seek to refine the understanding of the
      brain circuitry that mediates the potential pro-CC effects of rTMS through the use of fMRI at
      baseline and following the course of rTMS administration.

    <description>Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a non-invasive neuromodulation technique that received FDA clearance for use in treatment resistant major depressive disorder in 2008. rTMS utilizes the application of a repetitively pulsed magnetic field over the scalp to induce an electric field within a discrete area of the cerebral cortex. This electric field results in altered ion flow across the neuronal cellular membrane and ultimately changes in neuronal polarization. rTMS modulates cortical activation depending on the stimulation parameters used. Physiological studies have provided evidence that suggests that high-frequency (HF) rTMS produces an increase in local cortical excitability. Studies have also demonstrated that rTMS may increase or decrease functional connectivity between separate but related cortical structures, utilizing high and low frequency stimulation, respectively.</description>
