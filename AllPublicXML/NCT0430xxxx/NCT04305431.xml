      Background:

      The risk of heart disease among African Americans is still common despite a greater
      understanding of the disease and better approaches to managing it. Healthy cooking and eating
      patterns can help reduce the risk of heart disease. But things like access to grocery stores
      and knowledge of good nutrition can affect these healthy patterns. Researchers want to see if
      community-based programs can help.

      Objective:

      To learn about the cooking behaviors of African American adults at risk for heart disease.
      Also, to see if a community-based cooking intervention will affect home-cooking behaviors.

      Eligibility:

      African American adults 18 and older who live in Wards 7 and 8 of Washington, D.C., and have
      at least one self-reported risk factor for heart disease

      Design:

      Phase I participants will complete a survey. It asks about their medical history, lifestyle,
      stress level, and eating habits. They will take part in a focus group. During this, they will
      talk about what they eat and what foods are available to them. Participation lasts 1 day for
      3 hours at Pennsylvania Avenue Baptist Church in Washington, D.C.

      Phase II participants will go to shared cooking events at Pennsylvania Avenue Baptist Church.
      These will be held once a week for 6 weeks. They will be led by a trained chef. Participants
      will visit the NIH Clinical Center 3 times. Transportation will be provided if they need it.
      They will have physical exams and have blood drawn. They will be interviewed and complete
      questionnaires. A dietician will review the food they eat. An occupational therapist will
      assess their cooking skills. They will keep a daily cooking journal. Participation lasts 18
      weeks.

      Disparities in cardiovascular disease (CVD) morbidity and mortality among African-Americans
      (AAs) persist despite advances in risk factor identification and evidence-based management
      strategies. Studies suggest risk factor reduction, such as obesity treatment, positively
      attenuates the mortality disparity between AAs and other racial/ethnic groups. Closing the
      CVD disparity gap may require attention to more proximal causes of CVD that lower risk
      factors, including cardiovascular health behaviors such as dietary intake and physical
      activity. Cardiovascular-related health behaviors are directly correlated with socioeconomic
      status, and thus, populations with lower socioeconomic status are more likely to experience
      disparate health outcomes. One particularly important health behavior known to reduce CVD
      risk, but also with culturally specific influences and dynamics, is dietary behavior. Factors
      such as food access, decreased nutritional awareness, and cultural preference are significant
      contributors to dietary behaviors and lower dietary quality. Given that lower dietary quality
      is reported among AAs, it is important to understand how these other factors may influence AA
      dietary behaviors and decisions. Among dietary behaviors, cooking behavior is identified as
      an important way to lower sodium intake and daily calories as well as to improve fiber
      intake. Cooking activity among AAs has been reported as lower than other racial/ethnic
      groups. Determinants of cooking among AAs have not been fully explored in the literature.
      Qualitative studies suggest demographic variables related to employment, number of family
      members, as well as psychosocial variables related to social support and norms may have a
      role. Limited cooking intervention studies, which have included AAs, suggest improved
      outcomes related to diet, including DASH scores, but impact on home cooking behavior during
      or after a cooking intervention is not known, because self-reported confidence and/or dietary
      quality variables have been the primary outcomes reported. Furthermore, outcomes of these
      studies and suggested related factors to home cooking have not been measured against
      feasibility measures for delivering the intervention in a community setting.

      This study will occur in two phases: First phase consists of a focus group discussion on
      dietary behaviors with community members and the second phase consists of the dietary
      behavior intervention delivered in a community setting, clinical examination, survey and
      biomarker data collection.The primary objective of this study is to explore feasibility
      measures, facilitators and barriers related to cooking and cooking frequency among an AA
      adult population at risk for CVD following participation in a cooking intervention.

      Secondary objectives are to explore relationships between feasibility measures, especially in
      relation to participant burden, cooking frequency, facilitators and barriers and factors
      suggested from current literature as related to cooking at home. These include 1)
      psychosocial factors, social support, social network diversity, perceived stress on cooking
      behaviors, 2) lifestyle behaviors: sleep, physical activity, 3) built environment factors.
