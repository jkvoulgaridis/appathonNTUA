  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the non-weight bearing glenohumeral joint, focal chondral defects are encountered
      infrequently and are usually found in association with other pathologies, such as
      glenohumeral instability, postoperative chondrolysis, focal osteonecrosis, septic arthritis,
      osteochondritis dissecans, and rotator cuff tears. Several studies revealed that
      approximately one-third of patients with rotator cuff disease have concomitant articular
      cartilage lesions. Because the glenohumeral articular cartilage is one of the thinnest in the
      body, the overall accuracy of non-contrast MRI in detecting glenohumeral articular cartilage
      lesions is moderate and it is difficult to have an accurate characterization of a lesion my
      MRI. So, currently, arthroscopy is considered the ''gold standard'' for glenohumeral
      cartilage assessment. Even if the literature lacks high-quality evidence regarding the
      nonsurgical and surgical treatment options for patients with shoulder chondral defects, in
      these scenarios, where, in our experience, the most of the lesions are small, diffuse and of
      ICRS grade 2 or 3 (non-full thickness), arthroscopic debridement is a good option for
      addressing glenohumeral chondropathy. The main drawbacks with this type of procedure are the
      removal of underlying healthy cartilage and the potential lack of chondral surface smoothing.
      Alternatives used to perform arthroscopic chondral debridement is thermal application,
      carried out by the use of laser devices or the application of monopolar or bipolar
      radiofrequency (RF). As regards the glenohumeral joint, there are several studies that
      underlined the potential benefit of arthroscopic debridement in glenohumeral chondropathy and
      early stage of osteoarthritis, but the type of debridement used in all these studies was
      mechanical or not specified. Because recent studies showed that Compared to conventional MD,
      50° RF treatment appears to be a superior method based on short- and medium-term clinical
      outcomes and the progression of knee osteoarthritis [11], we want to specifically evaluate
      the effects of RF in patients with grade II or III chondropathy found during arthroscopy for
      rotator cuff disorders.

      This study is a prospective, therapeutic open blind randomized study. The enrollment of the
      patients will start immediately after the ethical committee approval. Considering our cases
      and our experience we plan to reach 40 patients (20 patients for group) which respect the
      inclusion and exclusion criteria in 2 months. We plan to enroll 6 more patients (3 for each
      group) in order to cover eventual loss of patients during the follow-up and these patients
      will be evaluated after surgery only if there will not be any losses among the initial 40
      patients. During surgery, assessment of the chondropathy will be done and only patients with
      International Cartilage Regeneration and Joint Preservation Society (ICRS) grade 2 or 3
      chondropathy will be enrolled. After addressing the rotator cuff pathology, the patient will
      be randomized and the radio-frequency (RF) debridement will be performed or not performed, so
      the patients will enter the control group (no RF) or the treatment group. The clinical
      evaluation will be performed by R.R., preoperatively and at 3 months, 6 months and 12 months
      after surgery. At 3 months post-operatively an MRI will be obtained and assessed by an expert
      shoulder doctor with particular attention for the cartilage. All the data will be completed
      and analyzed in about 12-13 months after the enrollment is completed and we estimate to
      present the data by May 2020.

    <description>The bipolar radiofrequency-based chondroplasty device is used in the COBLATION mode (yellow) with The WEREWOLF system and the wand FLOW 50 in Lo mode (low) which are approved by the FDA for chondroplasty and debridement of the articular cartilage; fibrillations were removed and the surface was smoothed. This low energy and low suction setting minimizes damage to healthy chondrocytes surrounding and is therefore the preferred setting for the removal of articular cartilage.</description>
