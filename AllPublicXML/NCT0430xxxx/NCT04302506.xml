  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was a retrospective study of a clinical observational cohort. The patients were admitted
      and definitely diagnosed by liver biopsy as drug-induced liver injury from September 2014 to
      September 2019, in the Second Department of Liver Disease, Beijing Ditan Hospital Affiliated
      to Capital Medical University were enrolled, and these patients also met the RUCAM score and
      were clinically diagnosed as DILI. Baseline clinical data and follow-up biochemical data at
      3, 6, and 12 months were collected. SPSS software was used to analyze the characteristics of
      clinical data and the dynamic changes of biochemical indicators. Logistic regression was used
      to analyze the risk factors associated with the chronicity of DILI. Bivariate Logistic
      regression model and ROC curve were used to obtain the clinical indicators for combined
      diagnosis of chronicity of DILI patients. To investigate the clinical features and prognostic
      factors of drug-induced liver injury.

        The Department of Hepatology Division 2, Beijing Ditan Hospital, Capital Medical University
        was admitted and a liver biopsy was performed from 2014.9 to 2019.9. The patients were
        clearly diagnosed with drug-induced liver injury. These patients also met the RUCAM score
        and were diagnosed as DILI.
