  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study plans to learn more about the effectiveness of the TearRestore eyelid warming mask
      on signs and symptoms of Meibomian Gland Dysfunction (MGD). MGD is a leading cause of dry eye
      symptoms. Warm compresses are a standard treatment recommended by physicians to treat those
      diagnosed with MGD. The study will investigate whether the TearRestore mask affects meibomian
      gland function and dry eye symptoms.

    <textblock>
      The study will evaluate the effectiveness of the TearRestore eyelid warming mask on signs and
      symptoms of MGD. Warm compress treatments have been recommended as part of the standard of
      care by eye physicians, and are an important means in treating MGD. However, current
      treatment options suffer from varied temperature maintenance and poor compliance. The
      TearRestoreâ„¢ mask offers patients a unique experience through providing sustained heat and
      the ability to see throughout the treatment, which will improve efficacy through improved
      compliance. If shown to be effective in altering Meibomian gland secretions at a single
      visit, this novel treatment could potentially offer the millions of patients suffering from
      MGD a more convenient and effective way to treat the condition.
