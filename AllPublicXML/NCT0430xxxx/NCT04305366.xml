  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the presence of miRNA markers in saliva, blood,
      FNA and tissue specimens in patients with and without head and neck cancer and evaluate
      whether these miRNA markers can provide prognostic or diagnostic clinical significance in the
      treatment of head and neck cancer patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Micro RNA (miRNA) markers were initially discovered in 1993 and recent research has shown
      that they have great potential for use as both surveillance and prognostic markers in cancer
      treatment, as well as potential targets for cancer therapy. Recent research has identified
      several miRNA markers which appear to be potential markers for head and neck squamous cell
      carcinoma, and these have been tested in both mouse and human banked tumor samples. These
      investigators hypothesize that these markers may also be present in other tissues, including
      fine needle aspiration biopsy, blood, and saliva specimens, and will be sensitive and
      specific to patients with known head and neck cancer.

    <description>Fine needle aspiration (FNA) biopsies, saliva, serum and tumor samples will be collected from HNSCC patients and controls. Samples will undergo real-time PCR using miRNA biomarkers. The efficacy of these biomarkers will be collected, to determine the status of the Head/Neck Cancer as the study progresses</description>

    <description>This study will target patients with a diagnosis squamous cell carcinoma in the head and neck. In addition, this study will also target patients undergoing tonsillectomy or sleep surgery as the control group. This study will aim to enroll an equal number of patients into both the study group and control group. However, this will be dependent on patient encounters within the adult ENT clinic.</description>
