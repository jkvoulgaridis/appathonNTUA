  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Following European guidelines patients undergoing colonoscopy in one of Odense University
      Hospitals units will now be offered a colon capsule endoscopy (CCE) in case of incomplete
      examinations. Patients formerly referred to colonoscopy in general anesthesia or patients who
      decline colonoscopy after having completed bowel preparation will also be offered a CCE. In
      our department we have conducted a comparison study documenting that the sensitivity of CCE
      is superior to CT colonography in both polyps &gt;9 mm and polyps &gt;5 mm, which is also supported
      by an Italian study. The safety and completion rate of CCE following incomplete colonoscopy
      is confirmed by several studies including one multicenter study and the completion rate is
      not significantly lower compared to other patient groups. In an incomplete colonoscopy it is
      always the most oral part of the colon which is not visualized, whereas in CCE, an incomplete
      investigation will most often have visualized the oral part. By combining incomplete
      colonoscopy results and incomplete CCE results we can identify patients who have had a
      complete colon investigation although both investigations were incomplete.

      Aim: to investigate the quality of CCE and the completion rate in patients who have undergone
      an incomplete colonoscopy, have completed bowel preparation but declines colonoscopy or have
      been referred to colonoscopy in general anesthesia.
