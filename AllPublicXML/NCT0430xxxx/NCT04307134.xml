      Besponsa is approved for the treatment of R/R B-cell ALL in Korea. In accordance with the
      Standards for Re-examination of New Drug, it is required to conduct a PMS. Post marketing
      surveillance is required to determine any problems or questions associated with besponsa
      after marketing in Korea, with regard to the following clauses under conditions of general
      clinical practice. Therefore, through this study, effectiveness and safety of besponsa will
      be observed.

      Before the approval of BESPONSA速 in Korea, this non-interventional study is designated as a
      Post-Marketing Surveillance (PMS) Study and is a commitment to Ministry of Food and Drug
      Safety (MFDS), as a part of Risk Management Plan (RMP) which is required by MFDS. The safety
      and effectiveness information of BESPONSA速 will be gathered at minimum 160 subjects
      administered in the setting of routine practice in Korea during the initial 6 years after the
