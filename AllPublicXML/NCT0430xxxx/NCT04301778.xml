  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Objective Response Rate (ORR) per mRECIST (modified RECIST)</measure>
    <time_frame>4 years</time_frame>
    <description>ORR is defined as the number of patients achieving a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) based on the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (mRECIST) at any time during the study. CR = disappearance of all target lesions, PR is =&gt;30% decrease in sum of diameters of target lesions, progressive disease (PD) is &gt;20% increase in sum of diameters of target lesions, stable disease (SD) is &lt;30% decrease or &lt;20% increase in sum of diameters of target lesions. Estimation based on the Kaplan-Meier curve.</description>

    <measure>Number of participants experiencing study drug-related toxicities</measure>
    <time_frame>4 years</time_frame>
    <description>When calculating the incidence of Adverse Events (AEs), each AE (as defined by NCI CTCAE v5.0) will be counted only once for a given subject.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall survival (OS)</measure>
    <time_frame>4 years</time_frame>
    <description>OS will be measured from date of first dose until death or end of followup (OS will be censored on the date the subject was last known to be alive for subjects without documentation of death at the time of analysis). Estimation based on the Kaplan-Meier curve.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression-free Survival (PFS) per mRECIST</measure>
    <time_frame>4 years</time_frame>
    <description>PFS is defined as the number of months from the date of treatment to disease recurrence [disease recurrence (DR) progressive disease (PD) or relapse from complete response (CR) as assessed using mRECIST criteria] or death due to any cause. Per mRECIST criteria, CR = disappearance of all target lesions, Partial Response (PR) is =&gt;30% decrease in sum of diameters of target lesions, Progressive Disease (PD) is &gt;20% increase in sum of diameters of target lesions, Stable Disease (SD) is &lt;30% decrease or &lt;20% increase in sum of diameters of target lesions.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of Response (DOR)</measure>
    <time_frame>4 years</time_frame>
    <description>Number of weeks from the start date of PR or CR (whichever response is recorded first) and subsequently confirmed to the first date that recurrent or progressive disease or death is documented. Per mRECIST, CR = disappearance of any intratumoral arterial enhancement in all target lesions, PR is =&gt;30% decrease in sum of diameters of target lesions.</description>
