  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of the trial are to demonstrate the safety and performance of the Zenflow
      Spring System in relieving the symptoms of obstructive Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the Zenflow Study (ZEST CAN) is to evaluate the safety, performance and
      effectiveness of the Zenflow Spring System for the treatment of Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms
      (LUTS) that arise due to bladder outlet obstruction (BOO), secondary to the presence of
      Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH). It is intended that the features of the Zenflow Spring
      will provide an effective office-based treatment and management therapy for BPH with little
      or no side effects.
