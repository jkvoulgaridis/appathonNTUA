  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      AL amyloidosis begins in the bone marrow where abnormal proteins misfold and create free
      light chains that cannot be broken down. These free light chains bind together to form
      amyloid fibrils that build up in the extracellular space of organs, affecting the kidneys,
      heart, liver, spleen, nervous system and digestive tract.

      The primary purpose of this study is to determine the recommended dose of CAEL-101 to
      facilitate progression of further clinical trials.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label, sequential cohort, dose-selection study of CAEL-101 in
      Mayo Stage I, Stage II and Stage IIIa AL amyloidosis patients. The primary objective is to
      define the safety and tolerability of CAEL-101 and determine the recommended Phase 3 dose for
      patients with AL amyloidosis. The secondary objective is to describe the pharmacokinetic (PK)
      profile of CAEL-101.

      The study will employ a 3+3 dose escalation design. At least 3 patients will be enrolled in
      each dose cohort unless adverse events (AE) preventing further dosing are observed. CAEL-101
      will be administered in combination with the standard of care (SoC)
      cyclophosphamide-bortezomib-dexamethasone (CyBorD) chemotherapy.

    <intervention_model_description>The initial cohort dose assignments will be: Cohort 1 500 mg/m^2, Cohort 2 750 mg/m^2 and Cohort 3 1000 mg/m^2.
The study will employ a 3+3 dose escalation design. At least 3 patients will be enrolled in each dose cohort unless adverse events (AE) preventing further dosing are observed.
The Sponsor and at least one Investigator will jointly decide the following:
Dose increases in the next cohort and/or dose schedule
Recommended Phase 3 dose
Dose reductions based on severity, duration and frequency of toxicities observed at the previous dose level
The Sponsor may choose to evaluate CAEL-101 in additional patients and at other/higher doses and dosing schedules to further assess the PK profile, the benefit/risk profile and/or based on the safety findings from ongoing CAEL-101 clinical trials.</intervention_model_description>
