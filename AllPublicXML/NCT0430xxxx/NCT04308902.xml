  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In Canada, the leading cause of long-term disability in children is being born at very low
      birth weight (VLBW). To help improve outcomes, nutrition is a modifiable aspect of infant
      care. Mother's milk is the optimal way to feed VLBW infants; however, many need a supplement
      of donor milk or preterm formula as not enough mother's milk is available. As the ideal
      supplement for prolonged feeding and its long-term effects is currently unknown, this study
      is a prospective follow-up of infants born VLBW who were fed mother's own milk or pasteurized
      donor breastmilk nutrient enriched with a human milk-based fortifier or a bovine
      protein-based fortifier. Intakes of donor milk, fortifier type, macronutrients and fatty
      acids will be explored. Areas of development to be assessed include: cognition, language,
      motor skills, and body composition. This study will also cross-sectionally examine aspects of
      eating behaviours, food parenting and the home environment (e.g., stress, home chaos, family
      functioning) with a term-born comparison. A DNA biorepository will also be created.
