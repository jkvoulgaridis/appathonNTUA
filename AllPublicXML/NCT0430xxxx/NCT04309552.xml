  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study to assess a new methodology developed for High Grade Glioma (HGG).
      FMISO PET (Fluoromisonidazole-PET) allows researchers to study whether tumor cells lack
      oxygen (hypoxia). FLT PET (Fluorodeoxythymidine-PET) allows researchers to study the increase
      in the number of cells as a result of cell growth and cell division (proliferation). Tumors
      that have low oxygen levels and/or are dividing fast shall resist to standard cancer
      treatment. The study will compare FMISO PET and FLT PET imaging techniques with molecular
      biomarkers of hypoxia, angiogenesis, and cellular proliferation in tissue.
      proliferation).This information could help researchers develop new treatment techniques to
      better treat cancer.

    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study to assess a novel methodology recently developed to simultaneously
      image tumor hypoxia and proliferation by means of simultaneous FMISO and FLT PET acquisition.
      FMISO (18F-Fluoromisonidazole) PET is a non-invasive method for detecting tumor hypoxia in
      solid tumors. FLT (3'-deoxy-3'[(18)F]-fluorothymidine) PET is a non-invasive method to image
      Cell proliferation rate. Imaging of tumor hypoxia and proliferation with FMISO and FLT PET
      respectively are two very well established techniques in in high-grade glioma. The long-term
      goal of this proposal is to establish clinically robust methodology to simultaneously image
      multiple tumor hallmarks. The central hypothesis is that combined information from multiple
      tumor hallmarks will offer complementary information about the underlying physiological
      processes, and will yield synergistic prognostic and predictive values. The rationale is that
      these findings will enhance the understanding of the underlying biology and pathophysiology,
      and will open new therapeutic strategies to target radioresistant and highly aggressive
      regions within the tumor, as well as aiding in the development of imaging theragnostics. The
      method used in this proposal is based on our previous work on simultaneous imaging of
      FMISO/FLT PET, and is facilitated by prior knowledge of the tissue pharmacokinetics, and an
      ability to distinguish the two radiotracers fractions in blood by thin-layer chromatography
      (TLC). The study will compare FMISO and FLT imaging findings with those from molecular
      biomarkers of hypoxia, angiogenesis, and cellular proliferation in tissue.

    <description>FMISO/FLT images will be used for intraoperative neuro-navigation and targeted sampling of FMISO and FLT avid tumor subregions prior to tumor excision. PET metrics will be correlated with immuno-histochemistry (IHC) analyses for HIF-1α, Ki-67, VEGF, EGFR, IDH1, and pimonidazole, as well as molecular analyses of TERT promoter mutation status. Results will be based on a composite score from all measurements. These markers contribute to disease progression in HGG.</description>
