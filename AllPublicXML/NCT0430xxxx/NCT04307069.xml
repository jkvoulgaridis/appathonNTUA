  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prolonged rupture of membranes has been associated with increased risk of chorioamnionitis
      and endometritis. In this study the investigators will investigate whether an early
      intervention to augment labor with oxytocin is superior to expected management for
      spontaneous delivery (up to 24 hours).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prelabor rupture of the membranes (PROM) refers to rupture of the fetal membranes prior to
      the onset of regular uterine contractions.

      PROM at term can be managed actively by induction of labor or expectantly by waiting for the
      onset of a spontaneous labor. Several studies have shown an association between expectant
      management and higher rates of maternal and neonatal adverse outcomes, especially infections.
      Furthermore, expectant management has been shown to increase the risk for cesarean deliveries
      (CD), chronic lung disease, cerebral palsy and neonatal mortality. It is suggested that the
      risk for those complications increase proportionally with the longer the duration of ruptured
      membranes. Others disagree with those associations.

      In this study the investigators will investigate whether early administration of oxytocin is
      superior to expectant management of 24 hours in patients with PROM at term, in terms of time
      to delivery and maternal and neonatal adverse outcomes, regardless of bishop score.
