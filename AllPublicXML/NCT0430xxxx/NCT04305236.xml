             in situ of the cervix) unless in complete remission with no therapy for a minimum of
             three years or have received an autologous or allogeneic stem-cell transplant

          -  Have an active bacterial or fungal infection or a detectable viral infection (for
             example HIV or viral hepatitis). Screening is not required for enrollment

          -  Recent therapy with a biologic agent or a monoclonal therapy is excluded. Wash out of
