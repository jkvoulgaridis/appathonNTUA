  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients suffering from borderline personality disorder (BPD) are considered frequent
      utilizers of psychiatric emergency rooms and of psychiatric hospitalizations. Nonetheless,
      recent studies challenge the effectiveness of psychiatric hospitalizations in reducing BPD
      symptoms, and some have even indicated potentially harmful effects such as increasing suicide
      risk post-discharge. These findings highlight the importance of effective outpatient
      treatments for BPD patients in public psychiatric hospital settings. In this study we aim to
      assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of two empirically-based treatments for BPD:
      dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) and dynamic deconstructive psychotherapy (DDP).

      In this study we aim to assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of two
      empirically-based treatments for BPD: dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) and dynamic
      deconstructive psychotherapy (DDP). Sixty-eight participants with BPD will be randomized to
      each of two treatment groups. Participants and therapists will be recruited from the Shalvata
      MHC, a 139‚Äêbed psychiatric institution with outpatient units serving a population of more
      than 600,000 people in Israel. A blinded research assistant will administer primary and
      secondary outcome measures every 3 months during the 12 months of treatment and at the end of
      the 6-month naturalistic follow-up period after ending treatment with DDP or DBT. Therapist
      adherence will be systematically assessed in both treatments for 10% of sessions. Primary
      outcome measure will be comprised of the Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), as
      assessed by estimating the healthcare utilization costs per incremental improvement in
      suicide severity. Secondary outcome measures will include BPD and depression symptom severity
      and quality of life. This study was submitted to the institutional review board of the
      Shalvata MHC in November 2019, and is expected to be approved by late Janury 2020.

    <description>Today, the most well-known and established treatment for borderline personality disorder is Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) that developed by Marsha Linhan in the 1990s. DBT is currently used in other disorders such as: eating disorders, addictions, impulse control problems and bipolar disorder. Various studies have found a beneficial effect for this treatment in various areas: decreased suicidal thoughts and attempts and self-harm behaviors, improvements in suicide attempts, anger levels, impulsive behaviors, depressive symptoms, The use of drugs, the percentage of dropouts from treatment, number Hospitalization and general function.</description>

    <description>DDP treatment is part of a trend of dynamic therapies to treat borderline personality disorder. The DDP focuses on deficiencies in the emotional experience processing and is performed in the form of weekly, individual sessions with a trained therapist over a 12-18 month period. Treatment is based on the need to correct three neurocognitive functions responsible for adaptive processing of emotional experiences: association (the ability to recognize, understand their existence, and experience a sequence of emotional experiences), attribution (the ability to make complex attributions about the self and others), and the ability to make realistic attribution, about the self and the other. Interventions that activate these three functions are the basis for DDP treatment.</description>
