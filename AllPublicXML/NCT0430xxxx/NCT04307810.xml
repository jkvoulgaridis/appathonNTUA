      Assessment of children based on their behavior is one of the most important skills for a
      pediatric dentist. The major aspect of child management in the dental care is managing dental
      anxiety and fear as it is considered to be the main barrier for successful completion of
      dental treatment.

      Dental anxiety is a common problem which develops mostly in childhood and adolescence. It can
      have major implications for the child, dental team, and dental services. Providing treatment
      for the child with dental anxiety can be time-consuming, costly, and demanding for the
      clinician.

      Previous studies have shown that a majority of children with dental anxiety present behavior
      management problems (BMP) in dental treatment situations. Evaluating a child's level of
      anxiety before pediatric treatment is the key, since this anxiety is closely related to their
      behavior during dental visits. Therefore, predicting the behavior is a basic requirement to
      reduce child's negative attitude during treatment.

      Many behavior rating scales are available to assess and evaluate the behavior of a child on
      each dental visit. Frankl et al classified child's behavior into four groups according to the
      child's attitude and cooperation or lack of cooperation during dental treatment. This
      classification is known as Frankl behavior rating scale, which is one of the most reliable
      tools developed for behavior rating of children in dental sittings.
