  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to compare the two cardioplegia solutions (blood cardioplegia by
      means of MPS ® vs. Cardioplexol ®) regarding perioperative outcome and with special attention
      to cardiac markers in patients with a recent heart attack.
