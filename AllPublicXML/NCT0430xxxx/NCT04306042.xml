  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, open-label, non-interventional, retrospective registry study, with no
      pre-set statistical assumptions and will not intervene subject's clinical treatment or
      clinical management.

      In the study, the clinical data of the subjects will be retrospectively collected from the
      electronic health records (EHR) of each research center. The clinical information will be
      based on the actual medical records of the cases. After the retrospective study time (June
      30, 2020), patients will be followed for one-year and two-year survival. Clinical treatment
      and management will be based on local clinical practices and regulations. This study will
      record the actual diagnosis and treatment, and will not interfere with any clinical decision.

      After subject-out, patients will be followed for one-year and two-year survivals, thus the
      follow-up consent will be exempted. All patients receiving PD-1 monoclonal antibody in
      combination with chemotherapy will be visited during the entire study period. At the end of
      study, investigator will check up on the conditions of patients who withdraw from the study.
