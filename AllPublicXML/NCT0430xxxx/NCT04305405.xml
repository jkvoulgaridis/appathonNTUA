    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the PK, PD and long-term safety of Benralizumab administered
      subcutaneously in 30 children aged 6 to 11 years with severe eosinophilic asthma. Up to an
      additional 3 Japanese patients aged 12 to 14 years will be enrolled to meet local regulatory
      requirements.
