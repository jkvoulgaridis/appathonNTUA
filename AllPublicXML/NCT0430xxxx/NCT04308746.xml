  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is conducted to investigate the effects of priming different cultural orientations
      on participants' decisions on whether to donate their organs, in an opt-out donation system
      scenario where the default is a presumed consent on the part of the individual.

    <textblock>
      Participants complete a survey where they respond to scales measuring their baseline cultural
      and power distance orientations, and answer questions on their demographics such as gender,
      race, employment etc.

      24 hours later, participants fill in a 2nd survey where they are instructed to complete 1 out
      of 2 possible priming tasks. The possible tasks consist of an Individualistic priming
      condition and a Collectivistic priming condition; both tasks require participants to answer 3
      statements each to 3 questions regarding the self or their social group. Participants then
      indicate their choice on whether to donate their organs (default or opt-out), rate their
      confidence regarding their choice and complete the same scales measuring their cultural and
      power distance orientations.

    <measure>Binary survey item - Decision to Donate Organ</measure>
    <time_frame>1 minute</time_frame>
    <description>From a scenario where participants imagine themselves applying for a driver's license in a country where an opt-out organ donation system is enforced, participants are asked to make a binary choice between choosing to donate their organs (default) and choosing not to donate their organs (opt out).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Line scale survey item - Confidence in Decision to Donate Organ</measure>
    <time_frame>1 minute</time_frame>
    <description>Participants are asked to mark along a line scale on how confident they feel about their decision to donate their organs. The extreme ends of the line scale are defined as &quot;Not Confident At All&quot; (0) and &quot;Extremely Confident&quot; (100).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Individual levels of individualism &amp; collectivism</measure>
    <time_frame>5 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Individualism and collectivism levels will be measured by Triandis &amp; Gelfand (1998)'s &quot;Culture Orientation Scale&quot;. This is a 16-item scale designed to measure: 1) Vertical Collectivism (VC) - seeing the self as a part of a collective and accepting hierarchy and inequality within that collective; 2) Vertical Individualism (VI) - seeing the self as fully autonomous, but recognizing and accepting the existence of inequality; 3) Horizontal Collectivism (HC) - seeing the self as part of a collective but viewing all the members of that collective as equal counterparts; and 4) Horizontal Individualism (HI) - seeing the self as fully autonomous, and believing in equality amongst individuals.
All items are answered on a 5-point scale, ranging from 1 = strongly disagree &amp; 5 = strongly agree. Each dimension's items are summed up separately to create a VC, VI, HC, and HI score to reflect the level of collectivism and individualism in the sampled group.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Individual levels of power distance</measure>
    <time_frame>3 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Individualism and collectivism levels will be measured by a 5-item scale used by Hanzaee and Dehkordi (2011) to measure Power Distance, defined as &quot;the extent to which the less powerful members of institutions and organizations within a country expect and accept that power is distributed unequally&quot; (Hofstede and Hofstede, 2005)
All items are answered on a 5-point scale, ranging from 1 = strongly disagree &amp; 5 = strongly agree. All items are summed up to create an average score to reflect the level of power distance orientation in the sampled group.</description>
