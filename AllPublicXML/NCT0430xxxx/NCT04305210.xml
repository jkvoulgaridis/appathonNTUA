  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dementia is a common neurodegenerative syndrome in aged population. Alzheimer's disease (AD)
      is the most common disease. The main pathological findings in AD include senile plaques (SP)
      and neurofibrillary tangles (NFT). The b-amyloid is the main peptide in SP and tau protein is
      the main finding in NFT. In addition, b-amyloid is considered as a disease biomarker, but the
      severity of AD is related with the tau protein.

      Recently a new tracer 18F-PM-PBB3 has been introduced in tau PET images. In a prelimary study
      with the 18F-PM-PBB3, the tau PET scan provide a good tool to evaluate tau deposition pattern
      among healthy volunteers, and patients with mild and moderate dementia due to AD. In this
      study we will enroll 20 healthy controls, 20 amnestic mild cognitive impairment patients
      (aMCI), 20 mild-moderate dementia due to AD patients and 10 other dementia such as
      frontotemporal dementia patients. All of the subjects will receive 18F-PM-PBB3 tau PET scan,
      and 18F-flobetapir (AV-45) amyloid PET scan, brain magnetic resonance images and clinical
      evaluation. We will follow up the clinical features for 2 years to understand the disease
      progression, disease conversion from aMCI to AD.

      The study aims to investigate the deposition patterns of tau protein with 18F-PM-PBB3 and
      amyloid protein with 18F-flobetapir in patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment due
      to AD, mild to moderate degree of dementia due to AD and healthy controls. The study will
      provide the information of these two proteins in different stages of dementia patients. The
      results may help the strategy in selection of anti-dementia drugs in the pharmaceutical
      company and industry and reduce the economic burden for the society. The study also can
      improve the understanding of Alzheimer's disease in academic research.
