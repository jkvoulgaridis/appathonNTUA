  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      Distress, anxiety, and other psychological disorders may be more common in people with
      primary brain tumors (PBTs). PBTs can affect their symptoms and quality of life. PBTs can
      also affect their tolerance of cancer treatments. Researchers want to learn if virtual
      reality (VR) technology can help. VR uses computer technology to make fake experiences and
      environments that look real. It lets people escape from their lives and experience more
      positive

      thoughts and emotions.

      Objective:

      To learn if it is feasible to use a VR relaxation intervention in people with PBT.

      Eligibility:

      Adults 18 and older who have a brain tumor and have recently reported psychological distress
      during their participation in the Natural History Study (NHS), protocol #16C0151

      Design:

      Participants will give saliva samples at 4 time points. They will fill out 4 questionnaires
      at 4 times points. These forms are not part of the NHS. The 4 time points are:

      before the VR intervention in clinic

      after the VR intervention in clinic

      1 week later at home

      1 month later at home

      Participants will get a VR headset. It looks like a thick pair of goggles that goes over the
      eyes. Participants will view computer-generated environments on this headset.

      Participants will have a phone interview 1 week after the VR viewing. It will last 10 to 15
      minutes.

      This study will also use the forms and questionnaires that the participants fill out as part
      of the NHS.

      Participation lasts 4 to 6 weeks.

      Background:

        -  Psychological distress is a common concern for patient across the cancer trajectory,
           which has been associated with worse clinical outcomes in terms of quality of life,
           adherence to treatment regimens, satisfaction with care, and poorer survival in past
           research.

        -  Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to alleviate some of the negative aspects of
           illness by allowing individuals to escape from their lives and experience more positive
           thoughts and emotions, which can be accomplished using cardiac coherence breathing
           techniques and distraction (both of which can improve psychological symptoms).

        -  Past VR research has shown promising improvements in anxiety, pain, distress and
           distraction through use of immersive VR interventions, though there is scant evidence in
           PBT populations, particularly in the time period surrounding their neuroimaging and
           clinical appointments when distress and anxiety can be highest.

        -  The purpose of this phase II clinical trial is to determine the feasibility of
           implementing an immersive VR relaxation intervention in a PBT population and to assess
           the efficacy of the intervention to improve psychological distress and anxiety at the
           time of clinical evaluation. VR is an innovative delivery approach to teach our patients
           validated breathing and mindfulness techniques that can improve their psychological
           symptoms and their ability to self-manage these symptoms.

      Objective:

      -To describe the feasibility of implementing a VR intervention in a PBT population, including
      eligibility, accrual, compliance, adverse device effects, study completion, and participant
      satisfaction with the intervention

      Eligibility:

        -  PBT patients enrolled on the Natural History Study (NHS) trial in the Neuro-Oncology
           Branch (NOB) (all tumor types and grades eligible)

        -  Patients can be newly diagnosed, receiving active treatment, or on surveillance

        -  Adults (greater than or equal to 18 years of age) who are English-speaking and able to
           self-report symptoms

        -  Active corticosteroid therapy is permissible

        -  Exclude patients without tissue diagnosis, recent cranial surgery (less than or equal to
           2 weeks), scalp wound healing issues, epilepsy, or seizures within the last 6 weeks

        -  Exclude patients who have a hypersensitivity to motion, severe nausea, or visual field
           deficits that might interfere with VR experience

      Design:

        -  This is a phase II feasibility clinical trial with a single arm experimental design.

        -  Study will include collection of self-reported patient outcome measures (PROs) for
           distress, anxiety, mood disturbance, and symptom burden/interference, as well as
           salivary stress biomarkers, all of which are collected at baseline and immediately after
           a brief VR relaxation intervention to determine acute effects on distress, anxiety, and
           biological stress measures. Repeat post-intervention assessments of all outcome measures
           will be done approximately 1 week and 1 month following the initial intervention to
           determine sub-acute effects on all PROs and biological measures once patients have
           returned home from their appointment. A semi-structured qualitative interview will also
           be conducted 1 week after the initial intervention to assess participant satisfaction
           with the intervention.

        -  Descriptive statistics, T-tests, Wilcoxon rank sum tests, and multiple logistic
           regression models will be used to evaluate the feasibility of the VR intervention.
           Linear mixed models and effect size calculations will be used to evaluate the acute and
           sub-acute effects of the VR intervention on self-reported PROs. Pearson or Spearman
           correlations will be used to evaluate the relationship between the biological stress
           measures and self-reported PROs.

        -  A total of 120 PBT patients will participate in this study.
