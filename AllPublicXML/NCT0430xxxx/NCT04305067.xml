      The purpose of this study is to establish the feasibility of delivering a prescribed,
      individualised supervised aerobic and resistance exercise programme during adjuvant therapy,
      to improve survival and reduce symptom burden in pancreatic cancer

    <description>Patients will complete an International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ-SF). This questionnaire will comprise 4 generic items to obtain comparable health-related physical activity. Patients will detail the number of days, hours and minutes that they undertake (1) vigorous exercise (2) moderate exercise (3) walking exercise and (4) sitting. Total physical activity will be generated and monitored for improvement or decline. Higher reported scores indicate higher levels of self-reported physical activity.</description>

    <description>Fatigue will be measured by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Fatigue (FACIT-Fatigue) questionnaire. Patients will score several fatigue items over the past 7 days on a scale (0 = not at all; 4 = very much), generating a total (0 - 52) with higher scores linked to greater quality of life.</description>

Patients will select a level of difficulty (I have no - I have extreme) on that particular days health for mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain / discomfort and anxiety / depression. Patients will then rate 'how good' or 'how bad' their health is on that day using a 100 point scale (0 = worst health you can imagine; 100 = best health you can imagine).</description>

    <description>16 weeks of supervised, moderate intensity, aerobic and resistance exercise. Aerobic exercise will be completed supervised, 2 days per week, commencing with a single 10 minute bout and progressing to 30 minutes of continuous aerobic exercise. Resistance exercises will involve whole body activities and commence with 1 set of each exercise (6-12 repetitions) and progress to 3 sets. The resistance exercises will gradually progress in difficulty throughout the program and will utilise daily undulating periodisation</description>

    <description>Exercise programs will be individually tailored to the capabilities of each participant and gradually progressed accordingly. Each patient will be asked to complete one home-based aerobic exercise sessions each week. At baseline, 16 weeks and 3 month followup patients will complete a physical fitness assessment (30 second sit to stand and six minute walking tests) and a range of quality of life questionnaires. Upon completion of the 16 week exercise intervention, patients will be invited to partake in semi-structured interviews to determine the effectiveness of the program and their experience throughout.</description>
