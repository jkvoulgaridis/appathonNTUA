  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this proposal, the investigators challenge the assumption that following the physical
      activity guidelines implies benefit for ALL adults, and that if benefit is not achieved in
      response to first line therapy, it will be by simply exercising more. Thus, for improving
      cardiorespiratory fitness and cardiometabolic risk factors, unanswered questions include: 1)
      To what extent, regardless of exercise amount or intensity, is exercise not associated with
      benefit? Demonstration of a resistance to benefit through exercise in a substantial number of
      adults would be a novel and important finding, would counter the assumptions of many if not
      most health care practitioners, and could have immediate and direct application in all health
      care settings. 2) To what extent will non-responders to first line therapy (150 min/wk) be
      required to increase exercise amount or intensity to achieve benefit? 3) To what extent will
      failure to improve CRF segregate (be associate with) with cardiometabolic risk factors? The
      investigators propose that adults who remain exercise resistant for improvement in CRF and
      cardiometabolic risk despite increasing amount or intensity are at high risk of metabolic
      disease and consequently, are candidates for alternative treatment strategies. 4) To what
      extent is biological sex and/or phenotype a determinant of response or non-response to
      exercise?

      The trial has three objectives:

      Primary objective: Determine whether alterations in exercise amount and intensity improves
      the rate of clinically meaningful improvements in aerobic exercise capacity as measured by
      cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF, VO2peak) among adults.

      Secondary objective: Determine whether common cardiometabolic risk factors segregate with
      respect to variation in CRF to first line therapy in adults, and, whether clinically
      meaningful improvements in cardiometabolic risk factors segregate with associated improvement
      in CRF.

      Tertiary objective: Identify whether biological sex and/or phenotype are determinants of
      variation in CRF and cardiometabolic risk factors in response to first line therapy, and,
      whether they predict variability in CRF response to alterations in exercise dose.
