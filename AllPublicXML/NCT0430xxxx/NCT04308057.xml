  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular ageing is implicated in the development of cardiovascular disease (CVD).
      Aquatic exercise is being considered as a co-adjuvant form of rehabilitation, but there is
      limited evidence for its cardiovascular risk-reduction properties for older people. Our study
      aims to address this by exploring the cardiovascular effects of long-term aquatic exercise in
      older adults in comparison to those who are either inactive or engaged in land-based/mixed
      training by measurement of micro- and macro-circulation.

    <time_frame>Baseline.</time_frame>
    <description>We will use FMD as a measure of endothelium-dependent, nitric oxide (NO)-mediated, macro (arterial)- circulatory function. Baseline scanning to assess resting vessel diameter will be recorded over 3 minutes, following a 10-minute resting period. A rapid inflation-deflation pneumatic cuff placed immediately distal to the elbow joint will be used to as an FMD stimulus.</description>

    <measure>Microcirculatory function</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline.</time_frame>
    <description>Skin blood flow will be measured as cutaneous red blood cell flux using a Laser Doppler Flowmeter (LDF). Local thermal hyperaemia will be induced using a heating disc surrounding the probe. The probe will be attached to the skin using a double-sided adhesion sticker. Participants will be rested in a supine position in a temperature-controlled room with a constant ambient temperature of 24° C for 35 minutes. Heart rate and diastolic and systolic blood pressure was recorded from the left arm at 5-minute intervals throughout the protocol (Dinamap Dash 2500, GE Healthcare, USA). Baseline skin blood flow data will be recorded for 5 minutes with the local heating disc temperature set at 30° C. Following this, rapid local heating will be initiated to obtain maximal vasodilation and the temperature will be increased by 1° C every 10 seconds until 42° C was reached. This will then be maintained for 30 minutes following, which the test will be completed.</description>
