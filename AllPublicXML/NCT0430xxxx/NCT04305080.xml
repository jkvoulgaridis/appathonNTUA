  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research aims to evaluate the effect of anodic oxidation of implant abutment collar on
      the peri-implant soft tissue health.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A randomized controlled clinical trial will be implemented on 10 implant abutments in five
      patients, each having 2 dental implants in the same quadrant. Abutments with standard silver
      collars will be divided into two groups: Group 1 (test group) will undergo anodic oxidation
      of the abutment collar changing it into pink color. Group 2 (control group) untreated
      abutments.

    <measure>Pink aesthetic score</measure>

    <description>Each variable will be assessed using the 0-2 scoring; with 2 being the highest score and 0 the lowest score. The highest possible score is 14 reflecting a peri-implant tissue that is most similar to the soft tissues of the reference tooth. The mesial and distal papillae will be assessed as complete, incomplete, or absent.</description>

    <measure>Plaque index (Silness-Löe Index)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline</time_frame>
    <description>This will be assessed on 4 surfaces of 6 index teeth. Each of the four surfaces of the teeth (buccal, lingual, mesial and distal) is given a score from 0-3. The scores from the four areas of the tooth are added and divided by four in order to give the plaque index for the tooth with the following scores and criteria. 0:No plaque, 1: A film of plaque adhering to the free gingival margin and adjacent area of the tooth. The plaque may be seen in situ only after application of disclosing solution or by using the probe on the tooth surface.
2: Moderate accumulation of soft deposit s within the gingival pocket, or the tooth and gingival margin which can be seen with the naked eye. 3: Abundance of soft matter within the gingival pocket and/or on the tooth and gingival margin.</description>

    <description>Abutments will undergo anodic oxidation process after etching with Hydrofluoric acid &amp; Nitric acid mixture for 10 minutes for debridement in a bath of distilled water with citric acid for 5 minutes to turn the abutment collar into pink color. The stainless steel plate will be connected to the cathode (-) and titanium abutments will be connected to the anode (+) end of the DC Power Supply. After then abutments will be left in distilled water for 10 minutes and sterilized before insertion in patient mouth.</description>
