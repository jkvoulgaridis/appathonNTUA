  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be conducted as a pilot trial of the TransAeris system for the prevention and
      treatment of ventilator-induced diaphragm dysfunction (VIDD) in patients identified prior to
      surgery to be at greater risk of prolonged mechanical ventilation (PMV).

    <textblock>
      This pilot study is an open label observational study in adult open cardiac surgery patients.
      Eligible patients from whom informed consent is obtained and electrodes are successfully
      implanted are enrolled in the study. All subjects will be implanted with the TransLoc
      electrodes during their primary surgery. Following admission to the ICU, diaphragm EMG
      recording will begin and continue until TransAeris use begins or until discharge from the
      ICU. TransAeris stimulation therapy adjunctive to continued MV will begin 24 hours after
      leaving the operating room. TransAeris stimulator settings (stimulus intensity, stimulus
      frequency, and burst on/off) will be programmed to optimize diaphragm recruitment without
      compromising patient comfort.

      When deemed ready by the physician, the subject will perform a spontaneous breathing trial
      (SBT). Diaphragm EMG will be recorded for the first 15 minutes of an SBT, when performed with
      study staff available, then TransAeris therapy will continue. If an SBT is not performed on a
      day or performed when study staff is not available, a diaphragm EMG will be recorded for 15
      minutes and then TransAeris therapy will be resumed. If the subject fails the SBT or the
      physician determines the subject is inappropriate for extubation, TransAeris stimulation
      therapy will continue. Prior to leaving the ICU, diaphragm EMG will be recorded for 15
      minutes and the TransLoc electrodes will be removed. Subjects that reach Day 30 after
      implantation will stop TransAeris therapy. Diaphragm EMG will be recorded for 15 minutes and
      the TransLoc electrodes will be removed prior to the end of Day 30.
