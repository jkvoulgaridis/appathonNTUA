  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The obtained results are likely to determine whether changes in the diet of patients with
      irritable bowel syndrome will affect their nutritional status. They will also allow you to
      assess whether dietary treatment will affect the resolution or alleviation, or severity of
      disease symptoms in IBS. The test results can be used in clinical practice.

      Participation in the study does not carry any risk of complications associated with
      undergoing a medical experiment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, parallel study that includes 1 initial visit and 1 final visit,
      separated by 8 weeks of diet. The investigators enrolled 73 women in the study, who met the
      criteria for inclusion in the study, to determine whether changes in the diet of patients
      with irritable bowel syndrome will affect their nutritional status. At the initial and final
      visit (after 8 weeks) in all patients, anthropometric measurements, body composition, an
      interview questionnaire concerning the symptoms of the disease was performed, the intensity
      of abdominal pain was assessed, the life quality of patients on the IBS-QOL scale was
      assessed, the calprotectin concentration in the stool was determined and the questionnaire
      regarding the quantitative assessment of diet was performed. The study population was divided
      using simple lottery into 3 groups with different dietary treatment for 8 weeks: group 1 - 26
      patients - diet with low content of easily fermenting carbohydrates (FODMAP), group 2 - 21
      patients - an elimination-rotation diet, and group 3 - (control) - 26 patients - classic diet
      treatment (recommended by the leading gastroenterologist).

    <measure>Comparative analysis of selected clinical symptoms of IBS patients before and after 8 weeks of nutritional intervention.</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>During the first visit, each applicant will receive a detailed interview on sociodemographic characteristics, lifestyle and professional work. The interview questionnaire contains questions about the most common symptoms of the disease (including abdominal pain, flatulence, stool disorders).</description>

    <measure>Assessment of intestinal inflammation in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (before and after 8 weeks of using the recommended diet).</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Intestinal inflammation was assessed by faecal calprotectin. At the first visit, each patient must bring a stool sample to assess calprotectin levels. The test will be carried out normalized and certified by Elisa.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Comparative analysis of the quality of life of IBS patients before and after 8 weeks of nutritional intervention.</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The current quality of life for patients with irritable bowel syndrome will be assessed using the IBS-QOL (Irritable Bowel Syndrome-Quality Of Life Questionnaire); total score between 34 -170 points, the highest sum means the most reduced quality of life.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Comparative analysis of the nutritional value of diets used before the study and after 8 weeks of dietary treatment using the FODMAP diet, elimination-rotation and conventional.</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Quantitative diet assessment was based on a 24h diet recall from 3 days preceding the study. The respondents estimated the amount of each food and ingredient consumed. The results from each patient were averaged in accordance with the adopted recommendations of the Institute of Food and Nutrition in Warsaw and the nutritional value of daily food rations was analyzed using Dieta 5.0 software calculating the average intake of the energy, nutrients, vitamins, minerals, cholesterol and dietary fibre.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Individually calculated Body Mass Index</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Individually calculated BMI (Body Mass Index) - this is the ratio obtained by dividing the body weight in kilograms by the square of the height in meters</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Individually calculated Waist-Hip Ratio</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Individually calculated WHR (Waist-Hip Ratio) - coefficient resulting from dividing the waist circumference by the hip circumference (measurements made in centimeters).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Assessment of nutrients causing food hypersensitivity (IgG1-3)</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The baseline reaction of alimentary IgG1-3 in blood serum was measured in μg/ml in the ranges: &lt;7.5 μg/ml - not elevated, ≥7.5 μg/ml - increased and ≥20.0 μg/ml - significantly increased.</description>

  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain intesity</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Pain intensity will be assessed using the VAS (Visual Analogue Scale) numerical scale; total score between 0 -10 points, the higher the value the stronger the pain.</description>
