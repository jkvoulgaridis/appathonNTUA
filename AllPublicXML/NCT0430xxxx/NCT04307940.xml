  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With this study researchers want to collect information on how long the pain relief lasts
      after a fixed dose of naproxen sodium or hydrocodone/acetaminophen or placebo (contains no
      medication) over 12 hours in subjects experiencing moderate to severe pain after having their
      wisdom teeth removed. Naproxen Sodium (Aleve®) is a drug that is used for the temporary
      relief of minor aches and pains.

      Hydrocodone/Acetaminophen is a combination drug used to relieve moderate to severe pain. It
      contains an opioid (narcotic) pain reliever (hydrocodone) and a non-opioid pain reliever
      (acetaminophen).
