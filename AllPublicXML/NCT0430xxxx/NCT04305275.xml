    <measure>Change From Baseline Compared to Placebo in The Essential Tremor Rating Assessment (TETRAS) Performance Subscale Part 4 Upper Limb Tremor Score on Day 29</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 29</time_frame>
    <description>TETRAS is a validated, comprehensive clinical assessment of essential tremor. For the performance subscale part 4 upper limb (UL) tremor score, all 3 maneuvers in the UL assessments of part 4 (subscale 4a, 4b, and 4c) will be completed for both arms, first for the left arm and then for the right. The part 4 subscale ordinally rates postural (limbs extended forward and wing-beating [elbows flexed]), and kinetic (finger-nose-finger maneuver) tremor on a 0 to 4 severity scale in 0.5-point increments. TETRAS Part 4 score for each upper limb ranges from 0 to 12 and for both upper limbs from 0 to 24.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline Compared to Placebo in TETRAS Performance Subscale Part 4 Upper Limb Tremor Score at all Other Timepoints</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 1, 8, 15, 22 and on Day 42 (or Early Termination Visit [ETV] / End of Study [EOS])</time_frame>
    <description>For the performance subscale part 4 upper limb (UL) tremor score, all 3 maneuvers in the UL assessments of part 4 (subscale 4a, 4b, and 4c) will be completed for both arms, first for the left arm and then for the right. The part 4 subscale ordinally rates postural (limbs extended forward and wing-beating [elbows flexed]), and kinetic (finger-nose-finger maneuver) tremor on a 0 to 4 severity scale in 0.5-point increments. TETRAS Part 4 score for each upper limb ranges from 0 to 12 and for both upper limbs from 0 to 24.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline Compared to Placebo in Kinesia ONE Accelerometer Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 1, 8, 15, 22, 29 and on Day 42 (or ETV / EOS)</time_frame>
    <description>Kinesia ONE is a wireless motion sensor worn distally on the index finger, which utilizes 3 orthogonal accelerometers and 3 orthogonal gyroscopes to monitor three-dimensional motion. Via the Kinesia ONE software application, measures of three-dimensional motion are converted to scores ranging from 0 to 4. Higher scores indicate greater tremor severity. Motion in each arm will be captured separately.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline Compared to Placebo in TETRAS Scale Activities of Daily Living (ADL) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 1, 8, 15, 22, 29 and on Day 42 (or ETV / EOS)</time_frame>
    <description>The ADL subscale will assess how ET impacts typical activities of daily living (speech, eating, drinking, dressing, personal hygiene, writing, occupational impairment, social impact and activities affected by upper limb (UL) tremor). It consists of 12 items, each rated from 0 (normal activity) to 4 (severe abnormality) with overall ADL score range of 0 to 48.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline Compared to Placebo in TETRAS Total Performance Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 1, 8, 15, 22, 29 and on Day 42 (or ETV / EOS)</time_frame>
    <description>The total performance score is based on overall rating of tremor amplitude in the voice, limbs, head, face, trunk, while performing pre-specified tasks, and functional task capabilities (handwriting, spiral drawing, and holding a pen over a dot). Each of these items is rated from 0 (no tremor) to 4 (severe tremor) with an overall performance score of 0 to 64.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Day 42</time_frame>
    <description>A TEAE is defined as an AE with onset after the start of investigational product (IP), or any worsening of a pre-existing medical condition/AE with onset after the start of IP and throughout the study.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participant has a diagnosis of ET, defined as isolated tremor syndrome consisting of
             bilateral upper limb action tremor for at least 3 years prior to screening, with or
             without tremor in other locations and absence of other neurological signs, such as
             dystonia, ataxia, or parkinsonism, isolated focal tremors (eg, voice, head), task- and
             position-specific tremors, sudden tremor onset or evidence of step-wise deterioration
             of tremor.

          -  Participant scores at least 1.5 for each of the six items that comprise the combined
             total upper limb TETRAS (total performance subscale part 4) with the total score for
             the dominant upper limb (the sum of the three items for either the right or left upper
             limb, whichever is dominant) being at least 5.5, at both Screening and predose on Day
             1.

          -  Participant is willing to discontinue medications taken for the treatment of ET within
