      To determine the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of TBio-6517 when administered by direct
      injection into tumor(s) alone and when combined with pembrolizumab in patients with solid
      tumors (RIVAL-01).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1/2a dose escalation study with TBio-6517 administered by direct injection
      into tumor(s). The Phase 1 portion has 2 arms; the first arm (Arm A) will determine the RP2D
      of TBio-6517 alone when directly injected into tumor(s), and the second arm (Arm B) will
      determine the RP2D of TBio-6517 when combined with pembrolizumab.

      In the Phase 2a portion, the clinical benefit of TBio-6517 combined with pembrolizumab will
      be further explored in patients with Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) or Microsatellite
      Stable Colorectal Cancer (MSS-CRC) as assessed by overall response rate (ORR) from central
      radiology review.
