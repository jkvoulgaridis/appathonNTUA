  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Colon cancer is the second most common cancer in men and the third most common cancer in
      women worldwide. The clinical objectives of administering sedation for GI endoscopy are to
      relieve patient anxiety and discomfort and to improve the outcome of the examination. Use of
      N2O could potentially provide an alternate safe and cheap option for patients who do not
      prefer IV sedation for colonoscopy

      Patients who are considered low risk for anesthesia administration (ASA class &lt;IV) receive
      moderate sedation with a combination of intravenous benzodiazepine and opioid medication. an
      alternative method of providing analgesia with &quot;on-demand&quot; inhalation of nitrous oxide
      (hereafter referred to as N2O) combined with oxygen has been postulated. Nitrous Oxide has
      been used for analgesia in various procedures including childbirth, general anesthesia,
      pediatric dentistry, bone marrow aspiration, fracture reductions, and minor surgical
      procedures (surgical dressings, pulmonary endoscopy, an abscess . It could potentially reduce
      overall costs for the procedure, in addition to providing a quicker recovery, turn over
