          -  Maintained urethra sensibility as judged by the subject. (Can you feel the catheter
             during catheterization? Yes.).

          -  Practice intermittent catheterization at least 2 times daily.

          -  Use catheter size available in the study

          -  Experienced practitioners of intermittent catheterization defined as a minimum of
             three months on therapy, but not more than approximately 5 years on therapy.

             UTI, is a positive urine culture of ≥10^3 CFU/ml of ≥1 bacterial species and presence
             of symptoms or signs compatible with UTI with no other identified source of infection.

          -  Known urethral stricture which, in the opinion of the investigator, could influence
             the subject's evaluation of the catheters.

          -  Involvement in the planning and conduct of the study (applies to both Wellspect staff
             and staff at the study site).

          -  Previous enrolment in the present study.

          -  Simultaneous participation in another clinical study that may impact the primary
             endpoint
