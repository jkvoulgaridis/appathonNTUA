      RATIONALE: Studying samples of plasm by metabolomics-based approach from women with
      metastasis breast cancer may help doctors understand the biomarker of visceral metastasis.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying the biomarker of visceral metastasis by metabolomics
      approach in metastasis breast cancer undergoing treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Imaging evaluation of the effect of chemotherapy on patients with visceral metastases from
      breast cancer, metabolomics was used to analyze the changes of metabolites in plasma, and to
      find biomarkers that could reflect visceral metastasis and treatment effects. The purpose is
      to help clinicians predict whether patients have potential visceral metastases, evaluate the
      effects of visceral metastasis treatment, and reflect the patient's prognosis.

      Patients with visceral metastases on imaging examinations received chemotherapy as planned,
      and blood samples were collected from patients before and during imaging assessments.
      Analysis of metabolites in plasma using ultra high performance liquid chromatography. Patient
      information were collected through medical record, including race, age, height and body mass
      index, menarche age, menstrual status, menopausal age (if applicable), tobacco and alcohol
      history, motherhood history, family history, etc.
