  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with COPD will be entered. Participants will be randomized to one of three study
      arms: Arm 1: meditation; Arm 2: relaxation; Arm 3: Control. Hypothesis: Progressive muscle
      relaxation and mindfulness meditation will decrease severity of dyspnea, fatigue and care
      dependency.

    <textblock>
      Previous reports have revealed that progressive muscle relaxation and meditation are
      decreasing symptoms burden in chronic disease. On the other hand, no study has been conducted
      to determine the effects of progressive relaxation exercise and mindfulness meditation on
      dyspnea, fatigue and care dependency in patients with COPD. The present study investigates
      the effects of progressive muscle relaxation and mindfulness meditation in a single-site,
      3-arm, assessor-blinded randomized, controlled study of 65 COPD patients. Arm 1: meditation;
      Arm 2: relaxation; Arm 3: Control.The investigators hypothesize that Progressive muscle
      relaxation and mindfulness meditation will decrease the severity of dyspnea, fatigue and care
      dependency.

    <description>The progressive muscle relaxation intervention, designed by Jacobson (1987), will be consist of sessions involving straining and relaxing all muscle groups from head to foot with deep breathing and last for 20 min. The patients will be asked to tense a very muscle group for 5 s and relax after counting up to 10 s while breathing out. In this way, facial, head, neck, shoulders, arms, chest, abdomen, legs, hips, feet and fingers muscles are stretched and relaxed on purpose for relaxing in patients with COPD.</description>

    <description>The research team closely will be following the mindfulness meditation intervention, developed by Kabat-Zinn, Lipworth, and Burney (1985), which is a part of the mindfulness-based stress reduction program. Mindfulness meditation is including interventions such as yoga, body scan, walking meditation, and sitting meditations. In the present study, the researchers will prefer sitting meditation. In this context, the second co-author will want patients to sit up in the chair in an upright and comfortable position. The patients will focus on deep breathing and felled the breath flowing throughout their body during the interventions that will last for 20 min in each session.</description>
