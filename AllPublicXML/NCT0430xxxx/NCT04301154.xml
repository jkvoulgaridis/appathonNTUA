      Phase I, Proof of Concept, Open-Label, Randomized Clinical Trial to Evaluate the Safety and
      Effects of Using Prime-boost HIVIS DNA and MVA-CMDR Vaccine Regimens with or without
      Toll-like Receptor 4 Agonist on HIV Reservoirs in Perinatally HIV Infected Children and Youth
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It can be hypothesized that HIVIS DNA and MVA-CMDR vaccination will lead to a reduction in
      HIV reservoir markers as a result of vaccine-induced immune responses. The effects may be
      superior with the addition of TLR4 agonist as immune adjuvant.

      In addition, there is also the hypothesis that vaccination with HIVIS DNA and MVA-CMDR
      several years after the initial HIVIS DNA vaccination in the PEDVAC study will result in
      strong immune responses.

      The study will enroll up to 45 perinatally HIV infected children and youth ≥ 9 years old who
      are on suppressive antiretroviral therapy (ART).

    <description>25 study participants aged ≥ 9 years will be enrolled and randomized into arms 1, 2 and 3. They will be from 3 different study sites (Stellenbosch University, Cape Town, South Africa; Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand; Children's Hospital Bambino Gesù, Rome, Italy). The rationale for including aged 9 and above is because Cervarix is licensed for age ≥ 9 years.</description>

    <description>20 participants will be enrolled to investigate the effects of vaccination with HIVIS DNA ± Cervarix and MVA-CMDR in youth previously enrolled in the PEDVAC study in which 10 had received HIVIS DNA and 10 did not receive vaccine in 2009-2012. They are perinatally HIV-infected and currently being followed at the Children's Hospital Bambino Gesù in Rome. Their median (range) ages are 21 (15 to 25) years old.</description>
