      This study aims to evaluate the feasibility and possible benefits of 3D-printed made to
      measure splints for postoperative or post-traumatic treatment in hand surgical patients
      (intervention group) in comparison to thermoplastic splints individually adjusted by
      occupational therapists (control group).
