  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Delirium is highly associated with adverse clinical outcomes of intensive care unit (ICU)
      patients, including increased cognitive impairment, duration of intubation, ICU length of
      stay, mortality, physical dependence, and health care costs. This randomised controlled study
      will firstly develop a family-supported sensory stimulation package based on the literature
      review as well as the findings of the cross-sectional survey and the in-depth interview. The
      intervention effects than will be evaluated using outcomes including delirium incidence,
      delirium duration, delirium severity, ICU patients' consciousness and cognitive function as
      well as family members' satisfaction and anxiety. This study is expected to provide evidence
      of the effectiveness of family-supported sensory stimulation on preventing delirium among ICU
      patients.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Delirium incidence</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of seven days</time_frame>
    <description>Delirium incidence means the number of patients who are delirious.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Delirium duration</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of seven days</time_frame>
    <description>Delirium duration means the number of days that a patient is delirious.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Level of consciousness</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of seven days</time_frame>
    <description>The patient's level of consciousness will be assessed using the Chinese version of Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (RASS).RASS ranges between plus four and minus five, with higher scores indicating hyperactivity, while plus four means patients are combative, and minus five means patients are unarousable. A higher score means a worse outcome.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of seven days</time_frame>
    <description>The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) is a brief cognitive screening tool for mild cognitive impairment, and assesses eight different cognitive domains that include attention and concentration, executive function, memory, language, visual/ constructional skills, conceptual thinking, calculations, and orientation. A higher score means a better outcome.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Depressive symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of seven days</time_frame>
    <description>The 9-item Chinese version of Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) will be used to measure patients' psychological well-being.Patients will be asked for their agreement to the description of each item, from zero (not at all) to three (nearly every day). All item scores are summed (total score = 27). A higher score indicates greater severity of the depressive symptoms.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Family satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of seven days</time_frame>
    <description>Family satisfaction will be measured using the Critical Care Family Satisfaction Survey (CCFSS).CCFSS has 27 items and five dimensions: medical condition guarantee, access to information, acceptance, support, and comfort. Family caregivers will be asked for their agreement to the description of each item, from one (very unsatisfactory) to five (very satisfactory). All item scores are summed (total score = 135). A higher score indicates a greater level of satisfaction.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Level of anxiety</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of seven days</time_frame>
    <description>The level of anxiety of family caregivers will be measured by the Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS). SAS has 20 items, with each item ranging from one (not at all) to four (very much so). The scale will use both positive and negative scoring, with a total score of 50-59 indicating mild anxiety, 60-69 indicating moderate anxiety, and ≥70 indicating severe anxiety.</description>

    <description>Participants allocated to the intervention group will receive a model-based sensory stimulation intervention, which is aimed at providing visual and auditory stimulation to ICU patients with additional support from family caregivers.</description>

    <description>Participants in the control group will receive usual care routine that they are receiving or planning to receive. The registered ICU nurses will provide the same nursing care as previously, including but not limiting to the use of sedation, analgesia, spontaneous breathing trial, indwelling catheter, feeding, and bowel care.</description>

    <intervention_name>Sensory stimulation</intervention_name>
    <description>Sensory stimulation can be formed in different aspects, and the most important ones are visual stimulation and auditory stimulation. Visual stimulation interventions involved providing a calendar, clock or familiar objects such as photographs of family caregivers; while auditory stimulation included calling the name of patients, helping to orientate the time and location, introducing hospital information, the ICU surrounding and treatment, and communicating with patients, who could not talk due to artificial airway, through a blackboard and use of gestures.</description>
