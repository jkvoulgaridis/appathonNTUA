  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The stimuli that activate nociceptors cause the dorsal horn of the spinal cord neurons to be
      sensitive to low-intensive afferent stimuli by decreasing the excitation threshold in
      patients with osteoarthritis. Although painful stimuli disappear, this situation causes pain
      to continue and a decrease in quality of life. Therefore, central sensitization should be
      considered and treated in patients with osteoarthritis. Although various pharmacological and
      electrophysiological agents are used in the treatment of central sensitization, adequate
      efficacy is not provided in patients with osteoarthritis. The aim of this study is to
      investigate the effects of balance exercises on central sensitization in patients with knee
      osteoarthritis.

    <measure>Western Ontario ve McMaster University Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC)</measure>
    <time_frame>Before intervention, change in WOMAC scores at sixth week, change in WOMAC scores at 3 months.</time_frame>
    <description>It consists of three sections as pain, stiffness and physical function and a total of 24 questions and scoring for each question as 0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 = medium, 3 = severe, 4 = very severe. Total WOMAC rate increases as pain, stiffness and physical function deterioration increase</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Central Sensitization Inventory (CSI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Before intervention, change in CSI scores at sixth week, change in CSI scores at 3 months.</time_frame>
    <description>CSI consists of 2 parts as A and B. Part A contains 25 items associated with central sensitization symptoms, and the person is asked to score each item between 0 (never) and 4 (always) and total score ranges from 0-100. It is accepted that there is central sensitization in individuals over 40 points. Part B consists of 10 diseases. In this section, it is questioned whether she was diagnosed one or more of these 10 diseases. If any of these diseases exist, the person is excluded from the study.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Berg Balance Scale (BBS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Before intervention, change in BBS scores at sixth week, change in BBS scores at 3 months.</time_frame>
    <description>In this scale, the patient is asked to perform 14 different activities. Every activity is scored between 0 (the worst)- 4 (the best) and a maximum of 56 points can be obtained.There is a correct proportion between the height of the score obtained and the balance.</description>
