  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study investigates the behavioral effects of an adapted manual-based social skills
      training program (SKOLKONTAKT) for the mainstream education plan delivered by school
      personnel, with pupils (15-20 years) with social-communication needs; either formally
      diagnosed (i.e. autism spectrum disorders or ADHD) or teacher-reported subclinical
      difficulties. N=40 are recruited from a community school in the Stockholm area (Sweden).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      So far, research has failed to consider the effectiveness of social skills training in school
      settings, and has instead focused on clinical or laboratory settings. This approach presents
      an interesting paradox given that the primary goal of social skills training is to affect
      change in the child's behavior in everyday life including school. Research undertaken in
      authentic everyday environments is not only more likely to result in real world outcomes for
      children and adolescents with ASD and ADHD, but greater utility in guiding models of service
      delivery. The objective of the current line of research is to adapt and evaluate methods
      originally designed to support children and adolescents with ASD and ADHD in clinical
      settings (&quot;KONTAKT&quot;), to be feasible and effective in school settings, that can be conducted
      by school personnel, and are are applicable to children with autistic and inattentive,
      hyperactive-impulsive disorders, as well as other less defined special social needs
      (&quot;SKOLKONTAKT&quot;).
