    <textblock>
      The primary objectives of the study are: (1) in the dose-escalation part: to evaluate safety,
      tolerability and to determine the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of MORAb-202, and (2) in an
      expansion part: to evaluate the objective response rate (ORR) in each of the selected tumor
      types at the RP2D.
