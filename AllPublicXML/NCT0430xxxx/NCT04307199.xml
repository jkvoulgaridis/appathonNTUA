      The primary aim of the MILO study is to inform the optimal design of a future definitive
      randomised trial to evaluate the effectiveness (including optimal timing and frequency) of
      membrane sweeping to prevent post-term pregnancy. We will also assess the acceptability and
      feasibility of the proposed trial interventions to clinicians and women (through focus group
      interviews).

      Methods/Design

      Multicentre, pragmatic, parallel group, pilot randomised controlled trial with an embedded
      factorial design. Pregnant women with a live, singleton fetus ≥ 38 weeks gestation, cephalic
      presentation, longitudinal lie, intact membranes, English speaking and ≥18 years of age will
      be randomised in a 2:1 ratio to:

      • Membrane sweep versus no membrane sweep

      Women allocated randomly to a sweep will then be randomised further (factorial component) to:

        -  early (from 39 weeks) versus late (from 40 weeks) sweep commencement; and

        -  a single verses weekly sweep

      The proposed feasibility study consists of four work packages i.e., (1) a multicentre, pilot
      randomised trial, 2) a health economic analysis and 3) a qualitative study (4) a study within
      the host trial (a SWAT).

• Membrane sweep (2) versus no membrane sweep (1).
Those allocated to the intervention group will then be further randomised in a factorial fashion to A, B, C or D:
A. Membrane sweep @ 39 weeks' gestation only B. Membrane sweep @ 40 weeks' gestation only C. Membrane sweep @ 39, 40 and 41 weeks' gestation or until onset of labour D. Membrane sweep @ 40 and 41 weeks' gestation or until onset of labour</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>Clinicians performing a membrane sweep cannot be blinded and it is not feasible to genuinely blind membrane sweeping for women. Therefore, neither clinicians administering the intervention nor women will be blinded to group assignment. Data will be reviewed by two assessors blinded to group allocation</masking_description>
