      Brief Summary: This study aims to investigate whether protein fortification of foods and
      beverages causes mouthdrying and mucoadhesion and whether this is influenced by age and
      saliva flow.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To investigate whether whey protein beverages cause mouthdrying in older adults and if
      perception and acceptance are influenced by repeated consumption, age and individual
      differences in saliva flow.

      To investigate whether protein fortification of cupcakes causes mouthdrying and if perception
      and acceptance are influenced by repeated consumption, age and individual differences in
      saliva flow in a home environment.

      To investigate whether mucoadhesion is present within different food models, if sensitivity
      to mucoadhesion increases with age and to determine if a reduced salivary flow results in
      strengthened mucoadhesion.

    <intervention_model_description>This study involves both a crossover design where each participant tastes both the control product (not fortified) and the protein fortified product with an appropriate break between the two sessions. It is also both a within and between groups design as the responses from the older participants will be compared to the younger participants. The study will be conducted single blind as it not feasible to blind the researcher. Each participant will attend 2 study visits and all foods will be presented with random blinding codes.</intervention_model_description>
