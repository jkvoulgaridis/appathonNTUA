  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Several randomized, controlled trials, mostly involving women undergoing cesarean delivery,
      have shown that the prophylactic intravenous administration of 1 g of tranexamic acid after
      childbirth reduced blood loss. Most were small, single-centre trials with considerable
      methodologic limitations.

      It is important to emphasize that none of these RCTs has included women at increased risk of
      PPH such as placenta previa, a context in which the prevalence of moderate and severe blood
      loss is significantly higher and where the magnitude of the effect of TXA may highly differ
      compared to low risk women

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      TXA is a promising candidate drug, inexpensive and easy to administer, that can be easily
      added to the delivery management of women worldwide. Strong evidence that TXA reduces blood
      transfusion in elective and emergency surgery, outside obstetrics, has been available for
      many years, whatever the type of surgery (ie cardiac, orthopaedic, hepatic, urological, and
      vascular surgery). Tranexamic acid was recently shown to reduce bleeding-related mortality
      among women with postpartum hemorrhage, especially when the drug was administered shortly
      after delivery. A meta-analysis of data from individual patients including data from patients
      with trauma and women with postpartum hemorrhage suggested the importance of early treatment.

      Several randomized, controlled trials (RCTs), involving women undergoing cesarean delivery,
      as well have meta-analyses, have shown that the prophylactic intravenous administration of 1
      g of tranexamic acid after childbirth reduced blood loss. Most of them were small, single-
      center trials with considerable methodologic limitations. Thus, no guidelines advocate the
      use of tranexamic acid to prevent blood loss after cesarean delivery. Moreover, it is
      important to emphasize that none of these RCTs has included women at increased risk of PPH
      such as placenta previa, a context in which the prevalence of moderate and severe blood loss
      is significantly higher and where the magnitude of the effect of TXA may highly differ
      compared to low risk women.

      The aim of our study is to conduct a large multicentre randomised, double blind placebo
      controlled trial to adequately assess the impact of TXA for preventing PPH following a
      cesarean delivery in women with placenta previa.
