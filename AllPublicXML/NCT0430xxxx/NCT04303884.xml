  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN) represents a group of rare tumors that accounts for
      less than 5% of gynecologic cancers which arising from malignant transformation of
      trophoblast, a cell originating from placenta. Placental expression of paternal antigens make
      placenta a target for maternal immune recognition during pregnancy, and PD-L1 expression
      maintains gestational tolerance. Also in GTN, PD-L1 is strongly expressed, suggesting the
      ligand is involved in tumor-immune evasion.

      Most female patients with GTN cured with chemotherapy, however less than 5.0% of them die as
      a result of multi-drug resistance, necessitating novel approaches. Although there was limited
      data due to its rarity, the treatment response of avelumab and pembrolizumab in GTN is
      excellent (50% ~ 71.4% complete remission rate), as reported in the previous studies.

      Therefore targeting of interaction PD-1/PD-L1 inhibition could be effective therapeutic
      strategy in chemoresistant GTN.

      This study investigate clinical efficacy of patients with GTN resistant/refractory to
      multi-agent chemotherapy who treat with pembrolizumab.

             consent with histologically confirmed diagnosis of gestational trophoblastic neoplasia
             (hydatidiform-mole, invasive mole, gestational choriocarcinoma, placental site
             trophoblastic tumor, and epithelioid trophoblastic tumor) refractory or
             chemo-resistant to multi-agent chemotherapy (such as EMA-CO, EMA-EP, BEP, TP-TE etc.)
             status will be enrolled in this study.

          -  A female participant is eligible to participate if she is not pregnant, not

          -  The participant provides written informed consent for the trial.

          -  Have measurable disease based on RECIST 1.1. Lesions situated in a previously

             lesions.

          -  Have provided archival tumor tissue sample or newly obtained core or excisional biopsy
             of a tumor lesion not previously irradiated. Formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded tissue
             blocks are preferred to slides. It might be enrolled in this study even if tissue is
             not available for a variety of reasons.

          -  Have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 to 1.
             Evaluation of ECOG is to be performed within 7 days prior to the date of allocation.

          -  Have adequate organ function as defined in the followings;

               1. Patients with adequate bone marrow function measured within 28 days prior to
                  administration of study treatment as defined below : Absolute granulocyte count ≥
                  1.5 x 10 9 /L ; Platelet count ≥ 100 x 10 9 /L ; Haemoglobin ≥ 9.0 g/dL (may have
                  been blood transfused)

               2. Patients with adequate renal function : Calculated creatinine clearance ≥ 30
                  ml/min according to the Cockcroft-Gault formula (or local institutional standard
                  method)

               3. Patients with adequate hepatic function : Serum bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x UNL and AST/ALT
                  ≤ 2.5 X UNL (≤ 5 X UNL for patients with liver metastases)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  GTN is a pregnancy-related tumor, all candidates will be positive for pregnancy test.
             Therefore, a positive pregnancy test is not exclusion criteria.

          -  Has received prior therapy with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, or anti PD L2 agent or with
             an agent directed to another stimulatory or co-inhibitory T-cell receptor (eg, CTLA-4,
             OX 40, CD137).

          -  Has received prior systemic anti-cancer therapy including investigational agents
             within 4 weeks prior to allocation.

          -  Has received prior radiotherapy within 2 weeks of start of study intervention.
             Participants must have recovered from all radiation-related toxicities, not require
             corticosteroids, and not have had radiation pneumonitis. A 1-week washout is permitted
             for palliative radiation (≤2 weeks of radiotherapy) to non-CNS disease.

          -  Has received a live vaccine within 30 days prior to the first dose of study drug.

             mumps, rubella, varicella/zoster (chicken pox), yellow fever, rabies, Bacillus
             Calmette-Guérin (BCG), and typhoid vaccine. Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection
             are generally killed virus vaccines and are allowed; however, intranasal influenza
             vaccines (eg, FluMist®) are live attenuated vaccines and are not allowed.

          -  Is currently participating in or has participated in a study of an investigational
