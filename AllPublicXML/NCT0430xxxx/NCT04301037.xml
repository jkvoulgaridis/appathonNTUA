  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective randomized study conducted on 30 patients with an age spanning between
      20 and 55 years. Half of the sample was treated by tension band wiring for closed medial
      malleolar fractures, and the other half by two cannulated screws. The patients were assessed
      at (6w-3months and 6months) for clinical and radiological union and evaluated functionally
      (12 months) using modified Olerund and Molander scoring system.

    <description>medial malleolus fracture fixed with tension band wiring): 2 k.wires (1.6 mm) are inserted perpendicular to the fracture site. Again the position is checked under image intensification for the correct direction and length. We drilled a 2.5mm hole with a protection sleeve, 2-3cm above the level of the horizontal joint line, aiming the drill bit slightly inferiorly to avoid screw pullout. We inserted a 3.5mm unicortical screw about 30 mm in length (with or without washer), 2-3mm is left for the wire between the bone and screw head before full tightening. A steel wire is constructed into a figure of eight between the screw the reduction k. wires, then twisted to achieve interfragmentary compression</description>

    <description>In group 2 (15 patients with medial malleolus fixed by 2 cannulated screws): Two guide wires (1.6mm) are inserted perpendicular to the fracture site, the appropriate length, proper insertion site including the distance from the articular surface is checked fluoroscopically .the length is measured .drilling of the bone through the threaded guide wire with a cannulated drill bit (3.2mm). A two 4.5mm partially threaded cannulated screws (with or two washers) are inserted through the guide to achieve Compression, the guide wires are then removed</description>
