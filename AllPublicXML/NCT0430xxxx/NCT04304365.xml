  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate a home follow-up alternative after medication abortion with
      pregnancy testing and a completion test. Clinical evaluation after a medication abortion
      (MAB) is standard of care to diagnose continued pregnancy and treat complications, typically
      done with a provider and an ultrasound examination or serial blood testing. Follow-up rates
      in the literature after MAB have been found to be 51% to 77% in recent literature using these
      standard follow-up methods. Though medication abortion is highly efficient, the on-going
      pregnancy rate is about 4% for pregnancies with gestational age up to 70 days from last
      menstrual period, thus highlighting the importance of follow-up as patients may not know they
      have a continued pregnancy weeks to even months after taking medication for an abortion. The
      investigators plan on providing participants with the option of a home follow-up option
      versus the standard of care (clinic) option. The primary objective of this study is looking
      at follow-up rates by each of these groups. As more options are provided for follow-up to
      patients, it is hoped that follow-up rates will improve and reduce the burdens of clinic
      visits on both providers and patients, ultimately making continued pregnancy after a
      medication abortion a never event.

      The primary objective of this research is to determine if introducing home follow-up will
      improve follow-up rates after medication abortion

      Secondary objectives of the study are to:

        -  assess the feasibility of mobile phone text messaging with low sensitivity pregnancy
           testing for home follow-up after medication abortion

        -  assess the acceptability of chosen follow-up after medication abortion

        -  determine the complication rate, emergency room visit rate, and ongoing pregnancy rate
           after home follow-up

      This prospective cohort study will be carried out at a single, urban hospital-based abortion
      clinic exploring the feasibility and acceptability of home follow-up after medication
      abortion with text messaging and a Low Sensitivity Pregnancy Test (LSPT). Participants will
      be recruited from a single abortion practice at Boston Medical Center (BMC) in Boston,
      Massachusetts. This clinic serves a multi-ethnic population from the South Boston area, with
      most patients English and Spanish speaking and covered by public insurance. Abortion care is
      provided by obstetrics and gynecology residents, family planning fellows, nurse
      practitioners, and family planning doctors.

      As part of the study participants will be given the choice to have clinic follow-up or home
      follow-up. The clinic follow-up cohort will receive our clinic standard of care - they will
      be scheduled for a visit with a provider in 1-2 weeks that will include an ultrasound
      examination. This cohort will be asked the same questions to assess completion that will be
      asked of the home follow-up group.

      Participants enrolled in the home follow-up group will be instructed that they will be
      contacted by research staff through text message 14 days after the initial visit. At
      enrollment, they will receive instruction for when the study team will be contacting them,
      how to use the LSPT, as well as the test itself. The participant will take the pregnancy test
      at home in 14 days and answer completion questions by text message for follow-up. Patients
      that screen positive will be asked to return to clinic for a visit with a provider.

    <description>All participants in this group will receive the standard of care at BMC which includes receiving a follow-up visit date and time before leaving the initial visit, when they receive the medications for abortion. Patients then return to clinic 1-2 weeks later to be seen by a provider with an ultrasound for confirmation of abortion completion. Participants who do not come for a return visit receive one phone call to reschedule their appointment.</description>
