    <textblock>
      The goal of the proposed research project is to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and
      preliminary outcomes of an online multicomponent commercial weight loss program and to
      understand the relationship between program engagement and outcomes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Technology is changing the delivery of behavioral weight loss programs and providing a way to
      extend reach to wider audiences. Commercial programs that were once completely delivered via
      in person meetings at brick-and-mortar businesses are now being converted into online
      programs. WW (formerly known as Weight Watchers) is an industry leader and one of few
      commercial programs that has significant evidence for efficacy on weight loss. The WW program
      includes a mobile app that helps people follow the WW SmartPoints Program, rewards for
      consistent tracking, an online community to connect with other users, and a 24/7 text chat
      with coaches function. WW also recently developed a virtual group coaching program that
      places 75-100 users into private groups where they receive educational content and support
      from each other and a coach.

      Previous research by the investigators and others reveals that greater engagement in online
      group-based weight loss programs is associated with greater weight loss. Investigators have
      also found that an online group coaching program paired with a calorie tracking mobile app is
      effective at producing weight loss. WW has done a &quot;soft launch&quot; of the virtual group coaching
      program on their platform. WW is sponsoring this project to perform a one-arm trial of the WW
      comprehensive online weight loss program that includes the virtual group coaching program.
      Findings will inform the continued development of the virtual group coaching program and
      extend the literature on how people engage in online weight loss programs. Project aims are
      as follows: 1) To examine the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary outcomes of a
      multicomponent online commercial weight loss program that includes a mobile app, incentives
      for tracking, 24/7 coaching, an online community, and virtual group coaching. Feasibility is
      defined as use of each component, engagement in the online community and virtual group
      coaching, and incentives (WellnessWins) earned. Acceptability of each program component and
      the overall program will be evaluated at 6 months. Preliminary outcome is defined as weight
      change from baseline to 3- and 6-months. Secondary preliminary outcomes include changes in
      diet quality, physical activity, quality of life, sleep quality, food cravings, and mood from
      baseline to 6 months. 2) To examine whether greater overall engagement in the virtual group,
      greater engagement with coaches, greater total engagement with peers in the virtual group and
      online community, and engagement with a higher number of peers (in virtual group and online
      community) predict greater weight loss at 3- and 6-months. 3) To examine the associations
      between total use of program components (and each individual program component) and change in
      weight. We hypothesize that greater use of program components (individually and total) will
      predict greater weight loss.

    <description>This 6-month intervention includes the use of three components: WW's mobile app, Virtual Group Coaching (VGC), and Connect (an online community that has no coach posts). The WW weight loss curriculum involves: self-monitoring of weight, dietary intake, and physical activity; making dietary changes; increasing physical activity; and learning behavioral strategies to manage these goals. Each week, participants will set goals and weigh in with the coach via a private direct message function. The coach will post videos and start conversation threads in the VGC group based on the topic of the week. Participants will be encouraged to use the app and the virtual coaching group daily.</description>

    <description>The 6-month intervention includes the use of WW's mobile app, Virtual Group Coaching (VGC), and Connect. The WW app sets members up with a personal food plan. The app will track daily SmartPoints Budget, which is how users keep track of their daily dietary intake and physical activity. The app also provides recipes, and provides access 24/7 to text chat with WW coaches. VGC is offered through the WW app and provides one-on-one and group support from a WW coach. The group will be managed by 1-2 coaches who are WW employees. The coach will help with goal setting, troubleshoot challenges, and follow-up on progress toward goals each week. Connect is WW's online community that gives members an opportunity to receive motivational support from each other. Members can post about their journey through photos, videos, and comments. Members can also choose Connect Groups to join, which are &quot;chat rooms&quot; based on WW progress, location, interests, age, or hobbies.</description>
