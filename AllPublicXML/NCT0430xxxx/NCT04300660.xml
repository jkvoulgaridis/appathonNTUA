  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Persistent pain after surgery has significant physical and mental consequences for the
      patient, as well as a significant economic impact on health systems. Neuropathic pain is
      caused by direct or indirect damage to the somatosensitive system. In thoracic surgery,
      chronic neuropathic pain is represented by Post-Thoracotomic Pain Syndrome (PTPS), defined as
      recurrent or persistent pain in the thoracotomy scar site that persists for more than 3-6
      months. Currently, in literature, the prevalence of PTPS is extremely variable. This
      prospective observational study aims to assess the incidence of pain in the weeks and months
      following surgery and to assess whether and how the presence of painful symptoms changes the
      patient's quality of life.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For each patient enrolled in the study, in the pre-operative phase, comorbidities, any
      chronic analgesic therapy and quality of life (through a dedicated questionnaire - Euro QoL
      5D5L1) will be recorded. Surgical data (type of procedure, lobe affected by resection, type
      of approach and surgical time) and anesthesiological data (intravenous opioid, locoregional
      technique (s), non-opioid analgesics administered and other medications) will be collected in
      the perioperative phase. In the 48 hours following the surgery (in the Recovery Room, at 6h,
      12h, 24h, 36h and 48h) the patient's pain data will be recorded (static, dynamic and
      cough-associated NRS) and those relating to any complications. The total amount of morphine
      administered to the patient in the first 48 hours will also be recorded. Each patient will be
      evaluated 7 days, 1, 3 and 6 months after the surgery by telephone interview. In this last
      phase, the possible presence of pain and its characteristics will be assessed, especially if
      these meet the criteria of neuropathic pain.
