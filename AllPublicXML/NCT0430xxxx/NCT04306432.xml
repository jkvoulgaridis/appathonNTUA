    <textblock>
      This study will assess cognitive function in patients with a primary brain tumour treated
      with radiation therapy (RT) to generate radio-sensitivity and volume effect parameters for
      the development of cognitive dysfunction. All types of brain tumours apart from glioblastoma
      will be included.

      RT is fundamental in the treatment of primary brain tumours. RT contributes to improved local
      control and prolonged progression-free survival in patients with a broad range of tumour
      types. Irradiation to the normal brain may lead to cognitive impairments. Clarifying the
      nature and severity of impairment in adult RT-treated brain tumour patients, including
      region-specific effects, are important for optimal utilization of novel conformal RT
      technologies such as proton therapy.

      The study is a prospective nationwide study including approximately 300 brain tumour patients
      from the Danish Center of Particle Therapy and the four Neuro Oncology Centers in Denmark.

      The patients will be assessed with a comprehensive battery of standardized cognitive tests
      and complete a questionnaire (PRO's). They will do this prior to RT treatment and 1, 3, 5 and
      10 years afterwards. The PRO's includes measures on quality of life, fatigue, sleep,
      depression, anxiety, and socio demographics. The standardized tests are: Trail making Test
      (TMT); Hopkins Verbal Learning Test (HVLT); Controlled Oral Word Association Test (COWAT) -
      Animals and S; Coding and Digit Span from WAIS-IV. The correlation between cognitive scores
      and RT dose-volume parameters to specific areas in the brain will be tested.

      This study will elucidate the dose-response relationship in radiation-induced damage to
      substructures of the brain such as hippocampus, thalamus, temporal and frontal lobes that
      will allow the clinician to prioritize these structures in planning of proton radiotherapy.
