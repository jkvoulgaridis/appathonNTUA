  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study was to evaluate the effects of reactive balance training (RBT)
      targeting slipping and tripping on laboratory-induced slips and trips. In an effort to build
      upon prior work, the present study included: 1) a control group receiving an alternative
      balance training intervention; 2) separate training and assessment sessions; 3) alternative
      RBT methods that may be more amenable to work outside the lab compared to prior methods, and
      4) older adult participants receiving individualized training to reduce drop-out. The
      investigators hypothesized that slips after RBT would result in improved reactive balance
      kinematics, and a lower incidence of falls, compared to either initial slips before any
      intervention or after a control intervention. The investigators also hypothesized that trips
      after RBT would result in improved reactive balance kinematics, and a lower incidence of
      falls, compared to either initial trips before any intervention or after a control
      intervention. Results were intended to contribute to knowledge regarding the efficacy of
      alternative methods for RBT, and provide additional evidence regarding its efficacy.

    <intervention_model_description>A two-group, pretest-posttest parallel design was employed. Participants were first assigned to either the reactive balance training or control intervention using minimization. During the first week, participants completed a pre-intervention assessment involving exposure to a single laboratory-induced slip or trip based upon random assignment. During the second and third weeks, participants completed a total of four sessions of their assigned intervention (two sessions per week for two weeks). During the fourth week, participants completed a post-intervention assessment involving exposure to the other perturbation (slip or trip) that they did not experience during the pre-intervention assessment. This design was selected to evaluate gait and reactive balance prior to any training intervention, and to avoid any unintended training effects induced by exposing participants to the same perturbation more than once.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Four training sessions, conducted twice a week for two weeks in groups of 1-2 participants. Each session was 0.5-1 hours, with an active training time of 30 minutes for each participant.
Reactive balance training involved both slip and trip training.
Slip training involved repeatedly stepping onto a low-friction interface (nylon fabric placed over a 0.9 × 0.9 meter polycarbonate sheet) while practicing controlling/decelerating the slipping foot and properly positioning the non-slipping foot under the pelvis.
Trip training involved repeatedly practicing recovery from simulated trips on a modified treadmill. While standing on a modified treadmill, the treadmill belt was quickly accelerated posteriorly to elicit a forward loss of balance that mimicked a trip while walking. Participants attempted to step to avert a fall, and to establish a stable gait on the treadmill, after which the treadmill speed was slowed to zero to complete the trial.</description>

    <description>Four training sessions, conducted twice a week for two weeks in groups of 1-2 participants. Each session was 0.5-1 hours, with an active training time of 30 minutes for each participant.
The control intervention involved general balance exercises adapted from the Otago Exercise program. Briefly, all four sessions involved balance exercises and strength exercises using ankle weights, and were progressively increased as performance improved by increasing ankle weights or the difficulty of the balance exercises (e.g., not holding onto a wall or support).</description>
