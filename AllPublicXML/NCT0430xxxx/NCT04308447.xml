  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the AbleLite early feasibility study is to evaluate the function of
      the upper limbs of participants diagnosed with neuromuscular disorders as children, with and
      without use of the Abilitech AbleLite device in the clinic and home environments. Functional
      outcomes will include documenting active range of motion and the ability to perform
      activities of daily living (ADLs) using the standardized Canadian Occupational Performance
      Measure (COPM) and the Role Evaluation of Activities of Life (REAL) assessments. Secondary
      objectives are to assess the safety record and report on adverse events (AEs) and parameters
      related to device usage, including device usage time and the time required to don/doff the
      device.
