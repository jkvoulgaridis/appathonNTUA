  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Previous work has shown that NOL (Medasense, Ramat Gan, Israel) accurately quantifies
      nociception during general anesthesia. Presumably, titrating opioids to NOL will therefore
      provide individual guidance so that patients will be given about the right amount. Patient
      given the right amount will presumably awaken quickly when anesthesia is done, and have good
      initial pain control in the post anesthesia care unit (PACU). To the extent that NOL
      titration facilitates optimal opioid dosing, patients are likely to have better PACU
      experiences — which would be an important outcome that clinicians and regulators are likely
      to take seriously.
