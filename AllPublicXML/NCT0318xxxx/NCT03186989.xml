      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, followed by an Open-Label
      Extension in up to 44 participants. This study will consist in two parts:

      Part 1: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multiple ascending dose period in
      participants with Mild Alzheimer's Disease, followed by Part 2: the open-label, long-term
      extension period.
