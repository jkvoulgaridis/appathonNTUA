      Detection of Integrin avb6 in Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis and Primary Sclerosing
      Cholangitis with [18F]FP-R01-MG-F2 PET/CT
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stanford University has developed a new PET tracer that selectively binds to integrin avb6, a
      cell surface receptor that is overexpressed in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Increased
      avb6 receptors on IPF lung tissue has been well documented, while its expression remains
      relatively non-existent in the healthy adult lung.

      In primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), integrin avb6 is also up-regulated in the biliary
      epithelial cells, which drive the progression of biliary tree strictures and liver fibrosis
      through activation of TGF-b, as has been shown in IPF.

      The selected PET tracer [18F]FP-R01-MG-F2 has shown promise identifying integrin avb6 in both
      preclinical and clinical studies at Stanford University. The investigators have demonstrated
      low [18F]FP-R01-MG-F2 radiopharmaceutical uptake in the heart and lung region of healthy
      volunteers, which was an expected biodistribution (the normal tissue uptake of the
      radiopharmaceutical within the body) based on immunohistochemical staining of healthy lung
      tissue, which demonstrated the presence of minimal avb6 receptors in healthy lung tissue.

      Similarily, radiopharmaceutical uptake in the hepatic and biliary region of healthy
      volunteers was low, suggesting that it may also be useful for the detection of increased avb6
      in the bile ducts of cholestatic liver disease patients such as PSC.

      OBJECTIVE:

      1) To evaluate the feasibility of [18F]FP-R01-MG-F2 PET/CT scanning in patients with
      Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis and Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis

      We will evaluate [18F]FP-R01-MG-F2 for the detection of Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF)
      and Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis (PSC). The performance of [18F]FP-R01-MG-F2 PET/CT will be
      assessed in a cohort of up to 13-15 IPF patients, 5 PSC patients, and 5 age-matched healthy
      controls. Feasibility will be measured by drawing regions of interest (ROI) around the lung/
      liver of participants with IPF or PSC, respectively, and the lungs of healthy adult
      volunteers and comparing the calculated standardized uptake value maximum(s) (SUVmax).

      The tracer's biodistribution, safety, and tolerability will also be studied.

    <description>The SUVmax in a lung or liver with known IPF or PSC respectively will be compared to the SUVmax in a known healthy lung/liver. It is expected that the SUV max, which is a measurement of the maximum value of radiopharmaceutical uptake within the region of interest (ROI) in IPF and PSC will be higher than the SUV max in the healthy lung/liver.</description>

    <description>Blood samples for blood time activity measurements taken at 1, 3, 5, 10, 30, and 60 minutes after tracer injection, and then at every 30 minute intervals up to 2 hours after tracer injection will allow for tracer kinetic analysis. Tracer kinetic analysis shows radiopharmaceutical distribution from the blood to the tissues over time.</description>

    <description>EKG data, vital signs and laboratory data collected before IV injection of [18F]FP-R01-MG-F2 and after completion of the scan will allow the investigators to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the radiopharmaceutical. This will be measured as the number of patients who successfully completed the study.</description>

    <description>7mCi (range 6-9 mCi) [18F]FP-R01-MG-F2 will be administered to all study participants. IPF patients and healthy volunteers will have a 60-minute dynamic PET/CT scan to the center of the lungs in the FOV followed by two vertex-to-thigh PET/CT scans. PSC patients will have only two vertex-to-thigh PET/CT scans to the center of the liver in the FOV.
Patients will have a repeat [18F]FP-R01-MG-F2 PET/CT scan performed within 3-8 weeks post initial scan (within 12-24 months post initial scan for previously scanned IPF patients if they are willing to be re-consented).</description>
