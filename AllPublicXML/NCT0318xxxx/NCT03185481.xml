    <textblock>
      This is an open label study evaluating the long term safety and tolerability of PF-06649751
      in Parkinson's disease patients who experience motor-fluctuations. Subjects who completed Ph2
      study B7601003 will be randomized to one of 4 treatment groups (15 mg QD, 7 mg QD, 3 mg QD,
      or 1 mg QD group) depending on the treatment received in B7601003 and titrated up to 15 mg QD
      over a 3 week period, as appropriate. All subjects who were blindly down-titrated during the
      B7601003 study will remain at/or be titrated to 7 mg QD only and remain at that dose for the
      rest of the B7601017 study in order to protect the blind for the prior study. Subjects who
      successfully titrate to 15 mg QD will enter the Adjustment Period at that dose.

      Subjects who cannot tolerate 15 mg QD at any time during the study will be allowed to
      down-titrate to 7 mg QD (but not lower) and will stay at that dose for the rest of the study.

      Subjects who cannot remain at a stable dose (7 mg or 15 mg QD) will be discontinued.

    <intervention_model_description>Depending on the actual treatment the subject received in B7601003, subjects will be randomized to one of 4 treatment groups (15 mg QD, 7 mg QD, 3 mg QD, or 1 mg QD group) and titrated up to 15 mg QD over a 3 week period, as appropriate.
All subjects who were blindly down-titrated during the parent study (B7601003) will remain at/or be titrated to 7 mg QD only and remain at that dose for the rest of the B7601017 study in order to protect the blind for the parent study. Subjects who successfully titrate to 15 mg QD will enter the Adjustment Period at that dose. Subjects who cannot tolerate 15 mg QD at any time during the study will be allowed to down-titrate to 7 mg QD (but not lower) and will stay at that dose for the rest of the study.

    <time_frame>Baseline to last visit after termination (up to approximately 3 months)</time_frame>
    <description>The Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) is an interview based rating scale to systematically assess suicidal ideation and suicidal behavior. At each suicidality assessment, participants felt to have significant suicidal ideation with actual plan and intent or suicidal behavior, must be evaluated by a clinician/mental health professional (MHP) skilled in the evaluation of suicidality in the participants by virtue of training or experience who determined if it is safe for the participants to participate/continue in the trial. The denominator used in the percentages was the number of participants assessed for suicidality or worsening, the denominator included the subset of participants who had any level of suicidality reported at baseline. For new onset, the denominator included the subset of participants with no suicidality reported at baseline.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline for Hauser Participant Diary Data in Daily OFF Time</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 21 and Day 35</time_frame>
    <description>Available diaries are designed to record participant motor state for half hour intervals. These diaries are a way for participant to assess their own health status without clinician bias or interpretation. In participant diaries, &quot;OFF&quot; time is defined as a period when medication has worn off and is no longer providing benefit with regard to mobility, slowness, and stiffness. During this period, Parkinson's Disease (PD) participants experience relatively poor overall function with worsening of tremor, rigidity, balance, or bradykinesia.</description>

    <description>Available diaries are designed to record participant motor state for half hour intervals. These diaries are a way for participants to assess their own health status without clinician bias or interpretation. &quot;ON&quot; time is defined as the time when medication is providing benefit with regard to mobility, slowness, and stiffness. &quot;ON&quot; time can be classified as associated with or without troublesome dyskinesia that interfere with activities of daily living.It has been demonstrated that &quot;ON&quot; time with troublesome dyskinesia are generally considered by participants to be &quot;bad time&quot; with regard to motor function.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline to last visit after termination (up to approximately 3 months)</time_frame>
    <description>The total MDS-UPDRS score developed by the Movement Disorder Society is the most common method of evaluating the severity of Parkinson's Disease (PD). Part I assesses non motor experiences of daily living(range 0-52).Part II assesses motor experiences of daily living(0-52). Part III assesses the motor signs of PD.Part IV assesses motor complications, dyskinesias, and motor fluctuations(0-24).Total Score:The sum of Parts I, II, III, and IV.Each question is anchored with five responses:0=normal, 1=slight, 2=mild, 3= moderate, 4=severe.Higher part and total scores indicate more severe signs of PD.There are four subscales in Part III:the tremor subscale(range 0-36),the rigidity subscale(0-20),the bradykinesia subscale(0-36),the postural instability and gait disorder (PIGD) subscale(0-12).</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Worsening Suicidality and New Onset Suicidality</title>
        <description>The Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) is an interview based rating scale to systematically assess suicidal ideation and suicidal behavior. At each suicidality assessment, participants felt to have significant suicidal ideation with actual plan and intent or suicidal behavior, must be evaluated by a clinician/mental health professional (MHP) skilled in the evaluation of suicidality in the participants by virtue of training or experience who determined if it is safe for the participants to participate/continue in the trial. The denominator used in the percentages was the number of participants assessed for suicidality or worsening, the denominator included the subset of participants who had any level of suicidality reported at baseline. For new onset, the denominator included the subset of participants with no suicidality reported at baseline.</description>

        <description>Available diaries are designed to record participant motor state for half hour intervals. These diaries are a way for participant to assess their own health status without clinician bias or interpretation. In participant diaries, &quot;OFF&quot; time is defined as a period when medication has worn off and is no longer providing benefit with regard to mobility, slowness, and stiffness. During this period, Parkinson's Disease (PD) participants experience relatively poor overall function with worsening of tremor, rigidity, balance, or bradykinesia.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline for Hauser Participant Diary Data in Daily ON Time Without Troublesome Dyskinesia</title>
        <description>Available diaries are designed to record participant motor state for half hour intervals. These diaries are a way for participants to assess their own health status without clinician bias or interpretation. &quot;ON&quot; time is defined as the time when medication is providing benefit with regard to mobility, slowness, and stiffness. &quot;ON&quot; time can be classified as associated with or without troublesome dyskinesia that interfere with activities of daily living. &quot;ON&quot; time without dyskinesia and on time with non troublesome dyskinesia are generally considered to be &quot;good time&quot;.</description>

        <description>The total MDS-UPDRS score developed by the Movement Disorder Society is the most common method of evaluating the severity of Parkinson's Disease (PD). Part I assesses non motor experiences of daily living(range 0-52).Part II assesses motor experiences of daily living(0-52). Part III assesses the motor signs of PD.Part IV assesses motor complications, dyskinesias, and motor fluctuations(0-24).Total Score:The sum of Parts I, II, III, and IV.Each question is anchored with five responses:0=normal, 1=slight, 2=mild, 3= moderate, 4=severe.Higher part and total scores indicate more severe signs of PD.There are four subscales in Part III:the tremor subscale(range 0-36),the rigidity subscale(0-20),the bradykinesia subscale(0-36),the postural instability and gait disorder (PIGD) subscale(0-12).</description>
