  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well remetinostat works in treating patients with skin basal
      cell cancer. Remetinostat may slow the growth of basal cell cancer cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Overall response rate of basal cell carcinoma (BCC) in subjects at 6 weeks.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Suppression of GLI1 (glioma-associated oncogene) expression in treated BCCs as compared
      with baseline.

      II. Safety assessment of Remetinostat after 6 weeks of topical treatment.

      OUTLINE:

      Tumors receive Remetinostat topically three times per day (TID) for 6 weeks in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for at least 4 weeks.

    <description>Overall response rate will be defined as the proportion of subjects with either a complete response or a partial response among all eligible and treated subjects. Exact binomial 90% confidence intervals will be computed for the overall response rate. The data will be analyzed first by intention to treat analysis and then per protocol analysis by only including subjects that are &gt; 80% compliant with drug treatment. For subjects who drop out, data from their last study visit will be used if they contribute a biopsy. The analysis population will include participants who have consented to undergo</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Must have at least one BCC lesion &gt; 1 cm (BCC &gt; 5 mm) in non-cosmetically sensitive
             site(s)

          -  Must be willing to apply the topical remetinostat 3 times daily for 6 weeks

          -  For women of child bearing potential, a negative urine pregnancy test

          -  Women of child bearing potential are expected to use an effective method of birth
             control while participating in the study and for 1 month after applying the last dose

          -  For male subjects with female partners of childbearing potential, agreement to use
             adequate contraception while participating in the study and for 1 month after applying
             the last dose

          -  Has signed and dated the current Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved informed
             consent document

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Taking any medication known to interact with histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors,
             such as valproate or anticoagulants

          -  Taking any medication known to affect hedgehog (HH) signaling pathway such as
             itraconazole

          -  Within the past 6 months, has used topical or systemic therapies that might interfere
             with the evaluation of the study medication during the study; specifically, these
             include the topical use to the study tumors of:

               -  Glucocorticoids

               -  Retinoids either systemically or topically (eg, etretinate, isotretinoin,
