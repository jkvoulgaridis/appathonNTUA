    <textblock>
      The objective of this POC clinical study is to evaluate the moisturising effects on fine
      lines and wrinkles, texture, barrier function, hydration and elasticity delivered by 4 weeks
      of twice daily application of the test product on participants presenting visible signs of
      ageing.

      Participants who meet all the inclusion/exclusion criteria will be randomised to one of three
      treatment groups: test product/positive control, test product/no treatment or positive
      control/no treatment at the baseline visit. Product application within treatment group will
      be further randomised to either the right or left side of the face. Participants will apply
      one of the assigned treatments to one side of the face (left or right) and another assigned
      treatment to the other side of the face as per the randomisation schedule. Participants will
      be instructed to apply the assigned treatments twice daily (morning and evening,
      approximately 8-12 hours apart) for 4 weeks (28 days).

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Ra (a dermaTOP Parameter), of Test Product Treated Versus (vs.) Untreated Side at Day 29</measure>
    <time_frame>At Baseline and Day 29</time_frame>
    <description>Using fringe projection and optical triangulation techniques, the 3D (three dimensional) surface structure of a designated investigational skin site on each side of the face was captured as an in vivo measurement using dermaTOP. From the captured 3D structure, roughness parameters were calculated. Ra is usually used for wrinkle assessments, representing the finer skin structure (Ra). Ra was the average deviation of the profile from the mean line (arithmetic mean of the absolute values of the point's heights).</description>

    <time_frame>At Baseline, Day 15 and 29</time_frame>
    <description>Using fringe projection and optical triangulation techniques, the 3D surface structure of a designated investigational skin site on each side of the face was captured as an in vivo measurement using dermaTOP. From the captured 3D structure, roughness parameters were calculated. Rz usually used for wrinkle assessments, representing the rough structure, such as wrinkles. Rz was an average of the 5 sub-profiles (peak to valley heights) local maximum. From each local profile the peak to peak height value is calculated; the average of the 5 peak to peak height values was Rz.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Sa (dermaTOP Parameters) at Day 15 and 29</measure>
    <time_frame>At Baseline, Day 15 and 29</time_frame>
    <description>Using fringe projection and optical triangulation techniques, the 3D surface structure of a designated investigational skin site on each side of the face was captured as an in vivo measurement using dermaTOP. The 3D skin surface profile was calculated from the position of the fringes in combination with the Gray values of each pixel. From the captured 3D structure, roughness parameters were calculated. Sa was the arithmetic average of the absolute (non- signed) heights of the topography points. Sa was the 3D Area -Equivalent of 2D profile roughness parameter Ra.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Clinical Fitzpatrick Wrinkle Score, at Day 15 and 29</measure>
    <time_frame>At Baseline, Day 15 and 29</time_frame>
    <description>A blinded, trained and qualified examiner performed Clinical Fitzpatrick Wrinkle Score assessments by visually grading the crow's feet area under standard conditions of illumination. Fitzpatrick Wrinkle Scores range between 1-9 where 1-3= Fine wrinkles, 4-6= Fine to moderate depth wrinkles, a moderate number of wrinkles, 7-9= Fine to deep wrinkles, numerous lines, with or without redundant skin folds. Low value indicated better results.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Instrumental Corneometer Values, at Day 15 and 29</measure>
    <time_frame>At Baseline, Day 15 and 29</time_frame>
    <description>Measurement of Stratum Corneum (SC) hydration was performed by the electrical capacitance method with a Corneometer. The measuring principle was based on changes in the capacitance of the measuring head, functioning as a condensator. An electric field was created between gold conductors to enable the dielectricity of the SC to be measured. Because the dielectricity varies as a function of the skin's water content, the SC moisturisation was measured. Higher value of corneometery indicates high moisture content.</description>

    <measure>Percent Improvement From Baseline in Skin Texture Rankings Based on Lay Grader Assessment of High Resolution Images at Day 29</measure>
    <time_frame>At Baseline and Day 29</time_frame>
    <description>High resolution images of the left and right side of each participant's whole half-face were taken at baseline and Day 29. Each blinded image pair was randomly displayed on a color-calibrated screen and assessed by a panel of lay graders, who ranked each image based on texture, defined as pores, smoothness and unevenness, on a scale of: 1 = better; or 2 = worse (lower score indicated improvement). The total proportion of improvement (from all lay graders) on Day 29 than baseline is reported for this endpoint.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Instrumental Cutometer Parameters R5, at Day 15 and 29</measure>
    <time_frame>At Baseline, Day 15 and 29</time_frame>
    <description>The Cutometer measures elasticity of the upper skin layer using negative pressure which deforms the skin mechanically. Negative pressure was created in the device and the skin was drawn into the aperture of the probe and after a defined time released again. Inside the probe, the penetration depth was determined by a non-contact optical measuring system. The light intensity varies due to the penetration depth of the skin. The resistance of the skin to the negative pressure (firmness) and its ability to return into its original position (elasticity) was displayed as curves (penetration depth in mm/time) in real time during the measurement. This measurement principle provides information about the elastic and mechanical properties of the skin surface and enables objective quantification of skin ageing. R5 (net elasticity): the elastic portion of the suction part versus the elastic portion of the relaxation part.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Trans-Epidermal Water Loss (TEWL) at Day 15 and 29</measure>
    <time_frame>At Baseline, Day 15 and 29</time_frame>
    <description>TEWL measuring principle was based on water vapour gradient determination between two pairs of sensors (temperature and relative humidity) placed at different distances perpendicularly to the skin. Measurements were taken in triplicate and then an average (mean) reading was calculated on the left and right Sub-ocular/ Cheek Area directly from the corner of the eyes onto the middle of the cheekbone. A decrease in TEWL corresponds to an improved skin barrier function.</description>

        <description>Using fringe projection and optical triangulation techniques, the 3D surface structure of a designated investigational skin site on each side of the face was captured as an in vivo measurement using dermaTOP. From the captured 3D structure, roughness parameters were calculated. Rz usually used for wrinkle assessments, representing the rough structure, such as wrinkles. Rz was an average of the 5 sub-profiles (peak to valley heights) local maximum. From each local profile the peak to peak height value is calculated; the average of the 5 peak to peak height values was Rz.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Instrumental Corneometer Values, at Day 15 and 29</title>
        <description>Measurement of Stratum Corneum (SC) hydration was performed by the electrical capacitance method with a Corneometer. The measuring principle was based on changes in the capacitance of the measuring head, functioning as a condensator. An electric field was created between gold conductors to enable the dielectricity of the SC to be measured. Because the dielectricity varies as a function of the skin's water content, the SC moisturisation was measured. Higher value of corneometery indicates high moisture content.</description>

        <description>High resolution images of the left and right side of each participant's whole half-face were taken at baseline and Day 29. Each blinded image pair was randomly displayed on a color-calibrated screen and assessed by a panel of lay graders, who ranked each image based on texture, defined as pores, smoothness and unevenness, on a scale of: 1 = better; or 2 = worse (lower score indicated improvement). The total proportion of improvement (from all lay graders) on Day 29 than baseline is reported for this endpoint.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Instrumental Cutometer Parameters R5, at Day 15 and 29</title>
        <description>The Cutometer measures elasticity of the upper skin layer using negative pressure which deforms the skin mechanically. Negative pressure was created in the device and the skin was drawn into the aperture of the probe and after a defined time released again. Inside the probe, the penetration depth was determined by a non-contact optical measuring system. The light intensity varies due to the penetration depth of the skin. The resistance of the skin to the negative pressure (firmness) and its ability to return into its original position (elasticity) was displayed as curves (penetration depth in mm/time) in real time during the measurement. This measurement principle provides information about the elastic and mechanical properties of the skin surface and enables objective quantification of skin ageing. R5 (net elasticity): the elastic portion of the suction part versus the elastic portion of the relaxation part.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Instrumental Cutometer Parameter R7, at Day 15 and 29</title>
        <description>The Cutometer measures elasticity of the upper skin layer using negative pressure which deforms the skin mechanically. Negative pressure was created in the device and the skin was drawn into the aperture of the probe and after a defined time released again. Inside the probe, the penetration depth was determined by a non-contact optical measuring system. The light intensity varies due to the penetration depth of the skin. The resistance of the skin to the negative pressure (firmness) and its ability to return into its original position (elasticity) are displayed as curves (penetration depth in mm/time) in real time during the measurement. This measurement principle provides information about the elastic and mechanical properties of the skin surface and enables objective quantification of skin ageing. R7: Portion of the elasticity compared to the complete curve values.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Trans-Epidermal Water Loss (TEWL) at Day 15 and 29</title>
        <description>TEWL measuring principle was based on water vapour gradient determination between two pairs of sensors (temperature and relative humidity) placed at different distances perpendicularly to the skin. Measurements were taken in triplicate and then an average (mean) reading was calculated on the left and right Sub-ocular/ Cheek Area directly from the corner of the eyes onto the middle of the cheekbone. A decrease in TEWL corresponds to an improved skin barrier function.</description>
