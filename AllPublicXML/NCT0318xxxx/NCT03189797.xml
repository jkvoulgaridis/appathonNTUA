      This study will be conducted to evaluate The Effect of tailored preventive program on caries
      incidence using International Caries Classification and Management System (ICCMS) at a follow
      up periods of 3 ,6 and 12 months.

      A total number of 144 high caries risk dental students were selected based on the applied
      caries risk assessment method (CAMBRA). In the study group they were given a preventive
      program as homecare program including tooth brushing 2/day with a fluoride toothpaste( 5000
      ppm F) following the instructions in addition to fluoride mouth rinse. For the clinical
      approach motivational engagement was done by discussing with patients how to improve oral
      health behavior including amount of sugar, fibrous food and junk food. This in addition to
      pits and fissures sealant, F- varnish 2 times /year. Recalls up were done at 3, 6 and 12
      months by recording the caries prevalence , application of fluoride varnish every 6 months
      and dietary intake interventions. In the Control group participants assigned to the control
      condition will be advised to maintain their existing lifestyles. For ethical reasons, if the
      program shows its effectiveness, it will be made available to all groups at the end of the
      study.

Before the dental educational program, an oral examination will be done for the patient. Examination will be done by using mouth mirror and probe in natural day light. The educational program and outcome assessment will be assessed by ICCMS three times (immediately, three and six months) as the follow:
Score 0 Tooth surfaces show no evidence of visible caries (no or questionable change in enamel translucency). Score 1 First or distinct visual changes in enamel seen as a carious opacity or visible discolouration not consistent with clinical appearance of sound enamel and which show no evidence of surface breakdown or underlying dentine shadowing.
Score 2 A white or brown spot lesion with Localised enamel breakdown, without visible dentine exposure.
Extensive stage Score 3 A distinct cavity in opaque or discoloured enamel with visible dentine.</description>
