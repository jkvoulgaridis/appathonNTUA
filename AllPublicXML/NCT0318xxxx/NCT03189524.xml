    <textblock>
      This phase I clinical study is to investigate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics/
      pharmacodynamics of BTK inhibitor BGB-3111 in Chinese participants with B-cell lymphoma, by
      conducting in two stages, the first stage being the safety assessment of dose, and the second
      stage being the dose expansion.

      Part I: Safety evaluation - according to the results of preclinical toxicological trials and
      the results of the phase I clinical study conducted in Australia and New Zealand, two
      regimens of BGB-3111 320 mg daily (160 mg twice daily (BID), administered in the morning and
      at night, or 320 mg QD) and &quot;3+3&quot; design is adopted for the assessment. The recommended dose
      and method of administration of phase II clinical study will be determined according to the
      Part I results.

      Part II: Dose expansion - this stage is to further evaluate the preliminary anti-tumor
      effects of BGB-3111 in Chinese participants with follicular lymphoma (FL) or marginal zone
      lymphoma (MZL), approximately 20 participants with relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma
      (FL) or marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) will be enrolled. The recommended Phase 2 dose will be
      used in the Part II.
