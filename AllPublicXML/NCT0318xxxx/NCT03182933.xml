      physical therapy measures and pain scores as well as opiate consumption.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) can be associated with a large amount of postoperative pain.
      This pain can oftentimes be severe enough to limit participation in physical therapy and
      ultimately delay discharge resulting in increased cost. Several strategies have been
      developed in an effort to decrease postoperative pain following TKA while maintaining lower
      extremity strength and maximizing participation in physical therapy. Recently, adductor canal
      blockade has gained popularity as it is reported to provide analgesia to the anterior knee
      without resulting in significant quadriceps muscle weakness. One downside of single shot
      peripheral blockade is the duration of analgesia can oftentimes be short lived. The advent of
      depot local anesthetics has made this an attractive option, especially in busy practices
      where placing peri-neural catheters may not be practical or cost effective. This study aims
      to carefully evaluate this relationship using a physical therapy evaluation method that
      relies on both motor strength and pain control. In addition, we hope to carefully evaluate
      motor strength using a novel method of strength measurement in an effort to further evaluate
      the impact of depot local anesthetic injection into the adductor canal on physical therapy
      and analgesia.

Peripheral Nerve Blockade: Each study arm will receive their respective formulation of local anesthetic, either standard bupivacaine or liposomal bupivacaine upon randomization
10 meter walk test on post-operative day 1: Patient asked to walk 10 meters at comfortable pace on post-operative day one when deemed safe to do so by the physical therapist
In person and over the phone questionnaire: Presuming the patient has left the hospital each patient will be called on post-operative day 2, 3 to assess nausea, opioid consumption, satisfaction with anesthesia technique, nausea and vomiting as well as pain scores
Force transduction of quadriceps strength: Patient will be asked to flex quadriceps at maximal ability and a transducer (Kiio device) will record a force value pre operatively and on post operative day 1</description>
