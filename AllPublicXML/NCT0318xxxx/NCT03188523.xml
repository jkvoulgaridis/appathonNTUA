  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and
      anti-retroviral therapy (ART) activity of monotherapy with MK-8504 (a tenofovir pro-drug), in
      ART-naïve Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)-1 infected participants. The primary hypothesis
      is that MK-8504, at a dose that is sufficiently safe and well tolerated, has superior
      antiretroviral activity compared to placebo, as measured by change from baseline in plasma
      HIV-1 ribonucleic acid (RNA) at 168 hours post-dose.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Plasma HIV-1 Ribonucleic Acid (RNA) at 168 Hours Post-Dose</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 168 hours post-dose</time_frame>
    <description>Plasma samples were collected from participants after a single dose of MK-8504 to assess viral load. The log10 plasma HIV-RNA (copies/mL) measurements from participants in each panel were pooled and analyzed based on a longitudinal data analysis model. Change from baseline to 168 hours post-dose was determined for each treatment group. Results are expressed as change in HIV RNA log10 (copies/mL).</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants Who Experienced At Least One Adverse Event (AE)</measure>
    <time_frame>From Day 1 through Post-Trial Visit (up to 25 days)</time_frame>
    <description>An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which did not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE could therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product or protocol-specified procedure, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product or protocol-specified procedure. Any worsening (i.e., any clinically significant adverse change in frequency and/or intensity) of a pre-existing condition that is temporally associated with the use of the Sponsor's product, was also an AE. The number of participants experiencing at least one AE was reported for each arm.</description>

    <description>Plasma samples were collected in a fasted state pre- and post-dose and used to determine AUC0-168hr of plasma MK-8504. Because plasma MK-8504 was expected to rapidly disappear from plasma based on prior experience with healthy participants, sampling was done until 72 hrs and AUC0-168 hr was computed from these data assuming 1) a mono-exponential concentration decline after 72hrs; 2) accurate estimation of the elimination rate based on available data; and 3) no involvement of other processes besides elimination after 72 hrs.</description>

        <description>An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which did not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE could therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product or protocol-specified procedure, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product or protocol-specified procedure. Any worsening (i.e., any clinically significant adverse change in frequency and/or intensity) of a pre-existing condition that is temporally associated with the use of the Sponsor's product, was also an AE. The number of participants experiencing at least one AE was reported for each arm.</description>

        <title>Area Under the Concentration-Time Curve of Tenofovir in Plasma From Time 0 to 168 Hours (AUC0-168hr)</title>
        <description>Plasma samples were collected in a fasted state pre- and post-dose and used to determine AUC0-168hr of plasma tenofovir. Because plasma tenofovir was expected to rapidly disappear from plasma based on prior experience with healthy participants, sampling was done until 72 hrs and AUC0-168 hr was computed from these data assuming 1) a mono-exponential concentration decline after 72hrs; 2) accurate estimation of the elimination rate based on available data; and 3) no involvement of other processes besides elimination after 72 hrs.</description>
