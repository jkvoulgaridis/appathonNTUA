  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study evaluates the effects of antithrombotic drugs (anticoagulant drugs or antiplatelet
      drugs) for prevention of ischaemic events in patients With recent intracerebral haemorrhage.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with spontaneous ICH have an increased risk of recurrent ICH and they also have an
      increased risk of ischaemic diseases. Around 40-50% of patients use, or have an indication,
      for antithrombotic drugs at the time of ICH. However, little is known about the benefits and
      harms of using antithrombotic drugs for prevention of ischaemic events in patients who have
      had an ICH.

      There are only observational studies addressing this question. Because of the lack of
      randomised-controlled trials and the inconclusive findings of the observational studies,
      guidelines have variably endorsed both starting and avoiding antithrombotic drugs after ICH.

      The investigators therefore want to study the effect and safety of using antithrombotic drugs
      after ICH. Furthermore, since findings on MRI can be biomarkers for subsequent bleeding,
      there will also be performed a sub-study of the association between such findings on MRI and
      risk of recurrent ICH during treatment with antithrombotic drugs.

      Patients with ICH during the last 6 months and with an indication for antithrombotic drugs
      will be included. Patients with vascular disease and indication for antiplatelet drugs will
      be randomised to antiplatelet treatment vs. no antithrombotic treatment. Patients with atrial
      fibrillation and indication for anticoagulant treatment will be randomised to anticoagulant
      treatment vs. no anticoagulant treatment. The follow up period is 2 years, and the primary
      effect variable is new ICH. The investigators will also assess new intracranial haemorrhage,
      extracranial haemorrhage and ischemic events, and functional and cognitive outcome.

          -  Patient age ≥18 years.

          -  Spontaneous, primary ICH, of ≥1 day, but not more than 180 days after onset of
             qualifying ICH, i.e.:

                  spontaneous ICH (i.e. any brain/bone/soft tissue appearances of trauma must have
                  occurred secondary to a spontaneous ICH)

               -  No 'secondary' or underlying structural cause (e.g. haemorrhagic transformation

                  intracerebral venous thrombosis)

          -  Patient have indication for antithrombotic (i.e. anticoagulant or antiplatelet) drug
             for the prevention of ischaemic events, either antiplatelet drugs (for patients with
             vascular disease), or anticoagulant drug for patients with atrial fibrillation.

          -  Consent to randomisation from the patient (or personal / legal / professional
             representative if the patient does not have mental capacity).

          -  MRI (or CT) is performed before randomisation.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Clear indication for antiplatelet or anticoagulant treatment (e.g. prosthetic heart

          -  Contraindications to the antithrombotic drug that will be administered.

          -  Patient is pregnant, breastfeeding, or of childbearing age and not taking
             contraception.
