    <textblock>
      This dose-escalating study is to determine the safety, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary
      efficacy of venetoclax in combination with navitoclax and chemotherapy in adult and pediatric
      participants with relapsed/refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) or
      relapsed/refractory lymphoblastic lymphoma. A safety expansion cohort of approximately 20
      patients may be enrolled in addition to the 50 participants in dose-escalation cohort.
