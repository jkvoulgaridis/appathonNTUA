  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators plan a prospective randomized controlled study that compares whether the
      use of a decision aid results in different scores on variables reflective of the
      decision-making process, behavior, health outcomes, communication, and healthcare system.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Decision aids (shared decision making tools—websites, videos, or pamphlets) are interventions
      to prepare patients to make more informed decisions and satisfying decisions that match their
      preferences and values. With greater understanding of the risks and benefits of the treatment
      options patients may make a more informed choice.

      Decision aids - delivered online, on paper, or on video - increase patient participation in
      the decision-making process,1 and can result in a decrease in discretionary surgery for knee
      osteoarthritis, herniated disk, and benign prostatic hypertrophy.2-4 They also reduce
      decisional conflict. Relatively few studies have investigated the influence of decision aids
      in orthopedic or hand surgery. Decision aids might affect decisional conflict, satisfaction,
      and outcomes in hand surgery where many treatments are discretionary and address quality of
      life.

      Utilizing the Ottawa Decision Support Framework- an evidence-based, practical theory used to
      guide the development of decision aids - and the International Patient Decision Aid Standards
      criteria the investigators developed a decision aid for trapeziometacarpal arthritis.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Decision Conflict Scale (DCS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>This scale measures patients' perception of uncertainty in making health-related decisions and consists of 3 subscales: (1) uncertainty choosing between different options, (2) modifiable factors contributing to this uncertainty—feeling uninformed, unclear about personal values, and feeling unsupported, and (3) perceived effectiveness of the decision—making an informed and values-based choice and expressing satisfaction with the decision. We used the validated statement format Decisional Conflict Scale, consisting of 16 items with 5 response options. Total scores range from 0 (no decisional conflict) to 100 (extremely high decisional conflict).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>QuickDASH (Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand) Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>The short form of the Disabilities of Arm Shoulder and Hand to assess upper extremity disability. The scale range is from 0-100, where 0 is no difficulty performing tasks and 100 is the most difficulty or unable to complete any tasks.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Health Questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>The PHQ-2 screens for depressive mood over the past 2 weeks. The score ranges from 0-6, where 0 is not at all depressed and 6 is major depression.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Consultation and Relational Empathy (CARE) Measure</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>The CARE measure is a 10-item questionnaire capturing patient perception of the physician's empathetic understanding under the office visit. Each item is rated on a 5-point Likert scale, yielding a total score from 0-50. A higher score indicates greater empathy.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>11-point Ordinal Satisfaction Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>The patient satisfaction scale measures how satisfied a patient is with their treatment for their thumb arthritis. Patients score satisfaction on a scale of 0 to 10, where 0 is not satisfied and 10 is extremely satisfied.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Decision Regret Scale After 6 Weeks and 6 Months</measure>
    <time_frame>6 week and 6 month follow up</time_frame>
    <description>Change in the Decision Regret Scale, which measures distress or remorse after a health care decision. The scale consists of 5 questions, which range from strongly agree to strongly disagree, scoring 0-100 with higher scores indicating more regret.</description>

    <description>Cohort I will be managed with a decision aid (henceforth &quot;DA&quot;), and Cohort II will be managed without one. The patients in Cohort I will receive the DA, which they can complete in a separate room and take home. The decision aids include information on the disease/condition, treatment options, benefits, risks, scientific uncertainties, and probabilities of potential outcomes tailored to the patient's health risks factors. Additionally, it includes values clarifications such as describing outcomes in functional terms, asking patients to consider which benefits and risks matter most to them, and guidance in the steps of decision making and discussing their decision with family/friends. It is interactive and dynamic, helping patients clarify their preferences and come to a decision that feels best to them.</description>

        <title>Decision Conflict Scale (DCS)</title>
        <description>This scale measures patients' perception of uncertainty in making health-related decisions and consists of 3 subscales: (1) uncertainty choosing between different options, (2) modifiable factors contributing to this uncertainty—feeling uninformed, unclear about personal values, and feeling unsupported, and (3) perceived effectiveness of the decision—making an informed and values-based choice and expressing satisfaction with the decision. We used the validated statement format Decisional Conflict Scale, consisting of 16 items with 5 response options. Total scores range from 0 (no decisional conflict) to 100 (extremely high decisional conflict).</description>

Decision Aid: Cohort I will be managed with a decision aid (henceforth &quot;DA&quot;), and Cohort II will be managed without one. The patients in Cohort I will receive the DA, which they can complete in a separate room and take home. The decision aids include information on the disease/condition, treatment options, benefits, risks, scientific uncertainties, and probabilities of potential outcomes tailored to the patient's health risks factors. Additionally, it includes values clarifications such as describing outcomes in functional terms, asking patients to consider which benefits and risks matter most to them, and guidance in the steps of decision making and discussing their decision with family/friends. It is interactive and dynamic, helping patients clarify their preferences and come to a decision that feels best to them.</description>

          <title>Decision Aid</title>
          <description>Cohort that will receive a decision aid.
Decision Aid: Cohort I will be managed with a decision aid (henceforth &quot;DA&quot;), and Cohort II will be managed without one. The patients in Cohort I will receive the DA, which they can complete in a separate room and take home. The decision aids include information on the disease/condition, treatment options, benefits, risks, scientific uncertainties, and probabilities of potential outcomes tailored to the patient's health risks factors. Additionally, it includes values clarifications such as describing outcomes in functional terms, asking patients to consider which benefits and risks matter most to them, and guidance in the steps of decision making and discussing their decision with family/friends. It is interactive and dynamic, helping patients clarify their preferences and come to a decision that feels best to them.</description>
