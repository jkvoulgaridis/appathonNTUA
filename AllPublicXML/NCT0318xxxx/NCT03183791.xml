  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this research is to assess the utility of smartphone-based progressive muscle
      relaxation (PMR) for the treatment of headaches. While there are many commercially available
      electronic diary and mind-body intervention apps for headache, there is little data showing
      their efficacy. RELAXaHEAD app incorporates the electronic PMR that was successfully used in
      an earlier epilepsy study and beta tested with headache specialist and migraine patient
      input. It also is an electric headache diary. This 2-arm randomized controlled study will
      evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of RELAX for use with headache patients. One arm
      will be the RELAX group (the RELAXaHEAD app) and the other arm will be a monitored usual care
      (MUC) group (this group receives standard of care and uses the electronic daily symptom
      reporting diary). The goals are to assess the feasibility and adherence of the RELAX
      intervention in persons with headache (Aim 1) and to gather exploratory data on the effects
      of the RELAX intervention on headache related outcome measures (Aim 2).

    <description>The Research Volunteers (RV) will explain the rationale for PMR and load the RELAXaHEAD app onto the patients' smartphones. The RV will review the app with the subject, focusing on user knowledge, usability, and engagement. The patient will perform a 15 minute session of PMR during the study enrollment and discuss the optimal time and place to practice PMR at home. Subjects will also be taught to enter their headache log daily on the app.</description>
