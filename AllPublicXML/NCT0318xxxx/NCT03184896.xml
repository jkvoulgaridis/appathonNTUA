  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hip fracture is a osteoporosis-related fracture with higher mortality, and is a major public
      health issue in China. The British Orthopedic Association and the British Geriatric Society
      have published the UK Blue Book, which summarizes current evidence and best practice in the
      hip fracture care and secondary prevention, but this kind of standardized practice in hip
      fracture care is not yet existed in China. The Blue Book standards will be used as the most
      contemporary evidence-based guidelines for management of hip fracture.This study is to
      prospectively examine the barriers and facilitators in the current management of hospital in
      China by comparing the Blue Book standards.
