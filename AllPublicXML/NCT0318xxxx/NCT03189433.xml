  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ryanodex is being investigated as a potential adjuvant treatment for people suffering from
      psychostimulant drug-induced toxicity (PDIT), a life-threatening medical condition that
      results mainly from the abuse of certain illicit drugs, most notably methamphetamine, and
      related forms (MDMC or &quot;Molly&quot;; MDMA or &quot;Ecstasy&quot;). Ryanodex is approved for the treatment of
      malignant hyperthermia in conjunction with appropriate supportive measures and for prevention
      of malignant hyperthermia in patients at high risk and in this study, will be investigated
      for the treatment of PDIT. The hypothesis of this study is that administration of Ryanodex as
      adjuvant treatment to Standard of Care (SOC) will improve the clinical outcome compared with
      SOC alone, in subjects with psychostimulant drug induced toxicity. Current SOC is defined as
      body cooling and supportive measures.

      This study will be conducted at pre-hospital emergency care (PHEC) facilities. The PHECs are
      medical units that are fully equipped and staffed to provide adequate emergency medical care
      to patients with PDIT. The study is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Ryanodex
      in an on0site pre-hospital emergency setting where subjects are anticipated to be treated
      over a short period of time and then transferred to another medical facility or released.
      After screening and diagnosis of PDIT, SOC treatment will be initiated. Subjects eligible for
      the study will be randomized to either receive SOC + Ryanodex or to receive SOC only. Study
      subjects are expected to remain at the study site for a maximum of 6 hours post-baseline.

    <description>Ryanodex (dantrolene sodium) 50 mg/mL suspension to be administered as a rapid IV push of 2.5 mg/kg, added to Standard of Care (SOC). SOC is defined as efficient body cooling by physical methods and supportive measures [ice packs, evaporative cooling(application of room temperature water via mist with use of a fan], benzodiazepines to ameliorate shivering, IV fluids, respiratory support, and other treatments deemed necessary to treat complications or comorbidities]. Administer a single dose of Ryanodex. If a subject does not show an adequate clinical response within 10 - 30 minutes post-dose, a second IV bolus dose of 2.5 mg/kg may be administered.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria: Male and non-pregnant subjects diagnosed with psychostimulant drug
        induced toxicity as evidenced by all of the following: core body temperature of greater
        than or equal to 39.5 degrees C; organ dysfunction, as evidenced by a Logistic Organ
        Dysfunction System score of greater than or equal to 6 (In the event of any delay in
        obtaining the results for baseline LODS score determination, subject may be enrolled. After
        enrollment, if the pending baseline LODS score turns out to be less than 6, the subject
        will be withdrawn from the study and replaced); known or suspected us of a psychostimulant
        drug in the judgment of the Investigator; negative blood pregnancy test for females (in the
        event of any delay in obtaining pregnancy test result, subject may be enrolled and
        randomized if all of the other eligibility criteria are met).

        Exclusion Criteria: Diagnosed with or is suspected to have an acute, clinically severe
        infection, which may, in the opinion of the Investigator, may increase the subject's risk
        for participating in the study an/or may impair the ability of performing and/or
        interpreting study assessments; severe hyperthermia secondary to a condition other than a
        psychostimulant drug-induced toxicity; likelihood of head trauma in the past 3 months, or
        other systemic disease that might increase the subject's risk for participating in the
        study and/or may impair the ability of performing and/or interpreting study assessments;
        positive pregnancy test or evidence of active lactation; known history of allergy or
        hypersensitivity to dantrolene; known history of seizure disorders or epilepsy; current or
        prior use (within the past 2 weeks) of calcium channel blockers.
