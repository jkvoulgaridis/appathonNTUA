    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy works in
      improving quality of life in patients with stage IIIC-IV ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary
      peritoneal cancer. In hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy, the chemotherapy is warmed
      before being used and may help the drugs get into the cancer cells better, minimize the
      toxicity of the drugs on normal cells, and help to kill any cancer cells left over after
      surgery.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare quality of life in patients with advanced ovarian cancer treated with standard
      of care (SOC) neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) followed by cytoreductive surgery (CRS) with
      hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) at 6 weeks post-treatment versus quality of
      life (QOL) patients treatment with intravenous-therapy (IV) chemotherapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe quality of life in patients with advanced ovarian cancer treated with NAC
      followed by CRS with HIPEC at 3 and 6 months post-treatment.

      II. To describe neurotoxicity in patients with advanced ovarian cancer treated with NAC
      followed by CRS with HIPEC.

      III. To describe abdominal discomfort in patients with advanced ovarian cancer treated with
      NAC followed by CRS with HIPEC.

      IV. To describe toxicities in patients with advanced ovarian cancer treated with NAC followed
      by CRS with HIPEC.

      V. To describe the response rate in patients with advanced ovarian cancer treated with NAC
      followed by CRS with HIPEC.

      VI. To describe progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with advanced ovarian cancer
      treated with NAC followed by CRS with HIPEC.

      OUTLINE: Beginning 4-8 weeks after completion of chemotherapy, patients undergo CRS. Patients
      then receive carboplatin intraperitoneally (IP) over 90 minutes immediately following CRS.

      After completion of chemotherapy, patients are followed up at 30 days, and 3, 6, and 12
      months.

    <measure>Quality of life (QOL) assessed using Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Ovarian questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>At 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The longitudinal data of QOL will be displayed graphically with individual trajectories. Repeated measures analysis of covariance models will be used for the primary analysis. The baseline QOL visit (as a categorical variable), randomization assignment, and a randomization by visit interaction will be included in the model. The test for the randomization effect at the 6-week post-treatment will be performed using a contrast of the 6-week randomization means. An unstructured covariance matrix will be used.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Abdominal discomfort assessed using Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy/Gynecologic Oncology Group-Abdominal Discomfort questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Abdominal discomfort will be compared between the two treatment arms. The data will be analyzed using Poisson model with GEEs to account for the dependency between repeated measures. This approach will be treated as a sensitivity analysis.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of toxicities evaluated according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 1 year after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The toxicities will be measured by the number and severity of adverse events defined by CTCAE version 5.0. The count data will be compared assuming a Poisson distribution.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Neurotoxicity assessed using Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy/Gynecologic Oncology Group-Neurotoxicity questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Neurotoxicity will be compared between the two treatment arms. The data will be analyzed using Poisson model with generalized estimating equations (GEEs) to account for the dependency between repeated measures. This approach will be treated as a sensitivity analysis.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression free survival</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>Progression free survival will be compared between the two treatment arms using survival analysis. The follow-up time will be calculated from the date of end of treatment. Survival will be measured up to the time until progression, date of last contact, or death, whichever comes first. Kaplan-Meier survival curves will be used to estimate the survival probabilities by treatment arms. Cox proportional hazards models will be used to calculate the hazards ratio and its confidence interval for the treatment effect.</description>

    <description>The best response using RECIST criteria will be compared between the two treatment arms over time using GEEs to account for the dependency between repeated measures. Logit link and binomial distribution will be applied. The randomization assignment, visit (as a categorical variable), and interaction between randomization and visit will be included in the model. Contrasts will be used to compare the best response at each time point.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed non-mucinous, epithelial
             stage 3 or 4 carcinoma of the ovary, fallopian tube or peritoneum

          -  Patients must not have received treatment for another malignancy within 3 years of
             enrollment

          -  Patients must have received at least 3 but not more than 6 cycles of
             carboplatin-doublet based IV neoadjuvant chemotherapy and achieved at least stable
             disease (radiographically confirmed) at the conclusion of this therapy.

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status =&lt; 2

          -  Patients must have adequate organ and marrow function as defined below (within 30 days
             of registration):

          -  Absolute neutrophil count &gt;= 1,500/mcL (within 30 days of registration)

          -  Platelets &gt;= 75,000/mcL (within 30 days of registration)

          -  Total bilirubin =&lt; 1.5 mg/dL (within 30 days of registration)

          -  Creatinine clearance &gt;= 50 mg/dL (within 30 days of registration)

          -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase
             [SGOT])/alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase [SGPT]) =&lt;
             3 x institutional upper limit of normal (within 30 days of registration)

          -  Alkaline phosphatase =&lt; 3 x institutional upper limit of normal (within 30 days of
             registration)

          -  The effects of HIPEC on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason, and
             because carboplatin doublet therapy consists of pregnancy category D agents, women of
             child-bearing potential must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier
             method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of
             study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while
             participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign an institutional review board
             (IRB)-approved informed consent document.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents.

          -  Patients with extra-abdominal metastatic disease.

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to carboplatin doublet agents.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because carboplatin doublet therapy
             consists of pregnancy category D agents with the potential for teratogenic or
             abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse
             events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with carboplatin
             doublet therapy, breastfeeding should be discontinued.
