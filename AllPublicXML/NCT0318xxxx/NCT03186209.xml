    <textblock>
      This is a randomised, double-blind, parallel group, placebo-controlled study designed to
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of a fixed 30 mg dose of benralizumab administered
      subcutaneously for patients with a history of asthma exacerbations and uncontrolled asthma
      receiving medium to high-dose inhaled corticosteroid plus long-acting β2-agonist (ICS-LABA)
      with or without oral corticosteroids and additional asthma controllers.

      Approximately 666 patients will be randomised. Patients will be stratified by country/region,
      age group (adult or adolescent), and peripheral blood eosinophil count at time of Visit 1
      (&lt;300 or ≥300 cells/μL).All the patients will be randomised to either placebo or benralizumab
      (1:1 ratio) for a 48-weeks treatment, every 4 weeks for the first 3 doses and then every 8
      weeks thereafter.

    <time_frame>Immediately following the first administration of study drug through Study Week 48</time_frame>
    <description>The SGRQ is a 50-item PRO instrument developed to measure the HRQoL of patients with airway diseases. The questionnaire is divided into two parts: part 1 consists of 8 items pertaining to the severity of respiratory symptoms in the preceding 4 weeks; part 2 consists of 42 items related to the daily activity and psychosocial impacts of the individual's respiratory condition. The SGRQ yields a total score and three domain scores (symptoms, activity, and impacts). The total score indicates the impact of disease on overall HRQoL. This total score is expressed as a percentage of overall impairment, in which 100 represents the worst possible HRQoL and 0 indicates the best possible HRQoL. Likewise, the domain scores range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicative of greater impairment.</description>

        Key Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Written informed consent, and assent when applicable for study participation must be
             obtained prior to any study related procedures being performed (local regulations are
             to be followed in determining the assent/consent requirements for children and
             parent[s]/guardian[s]) and according to international guidelines and/or applicable
             local guidelines.

          2. Female and male aged 12 to 75 years, inclusively, at the time of Visit 1. For those
             patients, who are 17 on the day of Visit 1 but will turn 18 after this day, will be
             considered an adolescent for the purposes of this trial.

          3. History of physician-diagnosed asthma requiring treatment with medium-to-high dose ICS
             (&gt;250μg fluticasone propionate dry powder formulation equivalents total daily dose)
             and a LABA, for at least 6 months prior to Visit 1.

          4. Additional maintenance asthma controller medications that are locally approved in a
             country for the treatment of asthma (e.g., leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRAs),
             tiotropium, chromone, theophylline, oral corticosteroid), and have been used for at
             least 30 days prior to Visit 1 are allowed.

          5. At least 2 documented asthma exacerbations in the 12 months prior to the date informed
             consent, and assent when available, during the treatment of medium-to-high dose
             ICS-LABA that required use of a systemic corticosteroid or a temporary increase from
             the patient's usual maintenance dose of oral corticosteroid. For patients who are
             re-screened within 30 days of their screen failure date, the calculation of the 12
             month period should be done from the original informed consent, and assent when
             applicable date.

          6. Documented post-bronchodilator (post-BD) reversibility in FEV1 of &gt;12% and &gt;200 mL in
             FEV1 within 12 months prior to Visit 1. If historical documentation is not available,
             reversibility must be demonstrated and documented at Visit 2.

          7. Fulfilment of at least 1 of the following conditions over the 7 days prior to
             randomization:

               -  &gt;2 days with a daytime or night time symptoms score &gt;1

               -  Rescue Short-acting β2 agonist (SABA) use on &gt;2 days

               -  ≥1 nocturnal awakening due to asthma

          8. Pre-bronchodilator (Pre-BD) FEV1 of &lt;80% predicted (&lt;90% predicted for patients aged
             12 to 17 years) at Visit 2.

          9. ACQ-6 score &gt; = 1.5 at Visit 2.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Known history of clinically important pulmonary disease other than asthma (e.g.,
             active lung infection, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchiectasis,
             pulmonary fibrosis, cystic fibrosis, hypoventilation syndrome associated with obesity,
             lung cancer, alpha 1 anti-trypsin deficiency, and primary ciliary dyskinesia) or ever
             been diagnosed with pulmonary or systemic disease, other than asthma, that are
             associated with elevated peripheral eosinophil counts (e.g,. allergic bronchopulmonary
             aspergillosis/mycosis, Churg-Strauss syndrome, hypereosinophilic syndrome).

          2. Known history of any disorder, including, but not limited to, cardiovascular,
             gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal, neurological, musculoskeletal, infectious,
             endocrine, metabolic, haematological, psychiatric, or major physical impairment that
             is not stable in the opinion of the Investigator and could:

               -  Affect the safety of the patient throughout the study

               -  Influence the findings of the studies or their interpretations

               -  Impede the patient's ability to complete the entire duration of study.

          3. Acute upper or lower respiratory infections requiring antibiotics or antiviral
             medication within 30 days prior to the date informed consent, and assent when
             applicable, is obtained or during the screening period.

          4. Any clinically significant abnormal findings in physical examination, vital signs,
             haematology, clinical chemistry, or urinalysis during screening period, which in the
             opinion of the Investigator, may put the patient at risk because of his/her
             participation in the study, or may influence the results of the study, or the
             patient's ability to complete entire duration of the study.

          5. Current smokers or former smokers with a smoking history of &gt; 10 pack-years.
