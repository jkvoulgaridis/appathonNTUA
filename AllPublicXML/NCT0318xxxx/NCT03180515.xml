  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Continuous deep brain stimulation (cDBS) is an established therapy for the major motor signs
      in Parkinson's disease, however some patients find that it does not adequately treat their
      freezing of gait (FOG). Currently, cDBS is limited to &quot;open-loop&quot; stimulation,without
      real-time adjustment to the patient's state of activity, fluctuations and types of motor
      symptoms, medication dosages, or neural markers of the disease. The purpose of this study is
      to determine if an adaptive DBS system,responding to patient specific, clinically relevant
      neural or kinematic feedback related to FOG, is more effective than continuous DBS on the
      motor Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS III) and gait measures of PD.

    <measure>Aim 1: Alpha Power</measure>
    <time_frame>30 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Subthalamic nucleus (STN) local field potentials (LFP) recordings demonstrate oscillatory neuronal activity in both the alpha (8-12 Hz) and beta (13-30 Hz) bands in the resting state in PD. Spectrograms were generated using a short-time Fourier transform, with a 1 second Hanning window and a 0.5 second overlap, creating a frequency resolution of 1 Hz. Power spectral densities were calculated using the Welch method with the same window and overlap parameters. Power was summed in the beta and alpha bands. This power can be representative of the magnitude of oscillatory activity in this frequency band occurring in this brain region.</description>

    <measure>Aim 1: Alpha Sample Entropy</measure>
    <time_frame>30 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The predictability of the local field potentials (band-pass filtered between 8-12 Hz for alpha) was analyzed using Sample Entropy (SampEn), a nonlinear measure suitable for physiological time series. SampEn may be a more consistent measure and more suitable to shorter time series data than approximate entropy, partially due to the elimination of counting self matches. SampEn is calculated as the negative logarithm of the estimated conditional probability that if consecutive subseries of length m are similar according to some preset tolerance r, the consecutive subseries of length m+1 will be similar too. Here the length of the vector pairs, m, denotes the embedding dimension.</description>

    <description>The predictability of the local field potentials (band-pass filtered between 15-30 Hz for beta) was analyzed using Sample Entropy (SampEn), a nonlinear measure suitable for physiological time series. SampEn may be a more consistent measure and more suitable to shorter time series data than approximate entropy, partially due to the elimination of counting self matches. SampEn is calculated as the negative logarithm of the estimated conditional probability that if consecutive subseries of length m are similar according to some preset tolerance r, the consecutive subseries of length m+1 will be similar too.

    <measure>Aim 2: Asymmetry</measure>
    <time_frame>30 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Asymmetry during both forward walking and stepping in place was calculated using periods of walking or stepping when the subject was not freezing. According to previous studies, asymmetry is defined as: 100*(absolute value of the natural log of the shorter average swing time over the longer average swing time) or mathematically: 100*| ln (SSWT/LSWT) |
where SSWT = shorter mean swing time LSWT = longer mean swing time</description>

    <measure>Aim 2: Arrhythmicity</measure>
    <time_frame>30 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Arrhythmicity during both forward walking and stepping in place was calculated using periods of walking or stepping when the subject was not freezing. According to previous studies, arrhythmicity is defined as the mean stride time coefficient of variation of both legs, and a greater stride time CV implies less rhythmic gait or stepping. Higher arrhythmicity corresponds to more arrhythmic, or more impaired, gait.</description>

    <description>Freezing of gait episodes during stepping in place were identified using a validated computerized algorithm, and during forward walking by a blinded rater. The percent time freezing was calculated by dividing the time spent freezing by the total time to complete the task then multiplying by 100 to get a percent. If no freezing was observed, then the percent time freezing reported was 0.0%.</description>

          <description>For Aim 1, all participants participated in the same &quot;state&quot; - off dopaminergic medication and off deep brain stimulation (DBS), so that we could characterize the two groups (freezers and non-freezers, respectively people who experience freezing of gait and those who do not) at baseline.
For Aim 2, all participants underwent randomized presentations of OFF, 60 Hz DBS and 140 Hz DBS while completing several walking tasks. (So all participants had walking trials off stimulatoin, all had walking trials at 60 Hz DBS, all had walking trials at 140 Hz DBS).
For Aim 3, due to technological limitations and resources, only one subject completed the stepping in place task while on continuous DBS (cDBS), and completed the stepping in place task again while on adaptive DBS (aDBS).
For Aim 3, Aim 1 Arms: Freezers vs. non-freezers Aim 2 Arms: OFF vs. 60 Hz DBS vs. 140 Hz DBS Aim 3 Arms: OFF vs. cDBS vs. aDBS</description>

          <description>The Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale or UPDRS Part III is the motor examination of the standard clinical rating scale used to gauge the course of Parkinson’s disease in patients. Total score is reported as the sum of the subscores, and higher values indicate greater disease severity. The range for the total score of the UPDRS III Motor Examination is between 0-108.</description>

        <title>Aim 1: Alpha Power</title>
        <description>Subthalamic nucleus (STN) local field potentials (LFP) recordings demonstrate oscillatory neuronal activity in both the alpha (8-12 Hz) and beta (13-30 Hz) bands in the resting state in PD. Spectrograms were generated using a short-time Fourier transform, with a 1 second Hanning window and a 0.5 second overlap, creating a frequency resolution of 1 Hz. Power spectral densities were calculated using the Welch method with the same window and overlap parameters. Power was summed in the beta and alpha bands. This power can be representative of the magnitude of oscillatory activity in this frequency band occurring in this brain region.</description>

        <description>The predictability of the local field potentials (band-pass filtered between 8-12 Hz for alpha) was analyzed using Sample Entropy (SampEn), a nonlinear measure suitable for physiological time series. SampEn may be a more consistent measure and more suitable to shorter time series data than approximate entropy, partially due to the elimination of counting self matches. SampEn is calculated as the negative logarithm of the estimated conditional probability that if consecutive subseries of length m are similar according to some preset tolerance r, the consecutive subseries of length m+1 will be similar too. Here the length of the vector pairs, m, denotes the embedding dimension.</description>

        <title>Aim 1: Beta Sample Entropy</title>
        <description>The predictability of the local field potentials (band-pass filtered between 15-30 Hz for beta) was analyzed using Sample Entropy (SampEn), a nonlinear measure suitable for physiological time series. SampEn may be a more consistent measure and more suitable to shorter time series data than approximate entropy, partially due to the elimination of counting self matches. SampEn is calculated as the negative logarithm of the estimated conditional probability that if consecutive subseries of length m are similar according to some preset tolerance r, the consecutive subseries of length m+1 will be similar too. Here the length of the vector pairs, m, denotes the embedding dimension.</description>

        <description>Asymmetry during both forward walking and stepping in place was calculated using periods of walking or stepping when the subject was not freezing. According to previous studies, asymmetry is defined as: 100*(absolute value of the natural log of the shorter average swing time over the longer average swing time) or mathematically: 100*| ln (SSWT/LSWT) |
where SSWT = shorter mean swing time LSWT = longer mean swing time</description>

        <description>Freezing of gait episodes during stepping in place were identified using a validated computerized algorithm, and during forward walking by a blinded rater. The percent time freezing was calculated by dividing the time spent freezing by the total time to complete the task then multiplying by 100 to get a percent. If no freezing was observed, then the percent time freezing reported was 0.0%.</description>
