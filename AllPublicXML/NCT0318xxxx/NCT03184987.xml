  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite availability of treatments and published guidelines, subjects may have asthma that is
      inadequately controlled. GlaxoSmithKline is currently developing a once-daily 'closed' triple
      therapy of an Inhaled Corticosteroids/Long-Acting Beta-2-Agonists/Long-Acting Muscarinic
      Antagonist (ICS/LAMA/LABA) combination (Fluticasone Furoate/Umeclidinium Bromide/Vilanterol
      Trifenatate [FF/UMEC/VI]) in a single device, with the aim of providing a new treatment
      option for the management of asthma by improving lung function, health-related quality of
      life (HRQoL) and symptom control over established combination therapies. This study has 3
      study periods: Run-in, Treatment period and a Follow-up period. Eligible subjects who meet
      the pre-defined criteria at screening (Visit 1) will enter into a 2-week run-in period.
      Subjects will continue their pre-screening inhaled medications for asthma (ICS+LABA or
      ICS+LABA+LAMA) without any change in regimen/dosage until day before Visit 2. At Visit 2
      subjects will be allocated to either FF/UMEC/VI 100/62.5/25 or FF/UMEC/VI 200/62.5/25
      micrograms (mcg) treatment depending on the asthma control status for 52 weeks. Switching
      medication from FF/UMEC/VI 100/62.5/25 to FF/UMEC/VI 200/62.5/25 will be permitted in
      accordance with the control status of the subject assessed by Asthma Control Questionnaire
      (ACQ)-7 at Week 24 of the treatment period. A follow-up visit will be conducted for
      approximately 1 week. Subjects will be provided with salbutamol as a rescue medication
      throughout the study.

             Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD 2016) guidelines,
             including history of exposure to risk factors (i.e., especially tobacco smoke,
             occupational dusts and chemicals, smoke from home cooking and heating fuels) (for
             tobacco smoke); post- salbutamol Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second (FEV1)/forced
             vital capacity (FVC) ratio of &lt;0.70 and a post- salbutamol FEV1 of less than or equal
             to 70% of predicted normal values (diagnosis prior to Visit 1 acceptable);Onset of
             disease greater than or equal to 40 years of age.

          -  Concurrent respiratory disorders: Subjects with current evidence of pneumonia, active
             tuberculosis, lung cancer, significant bronchiectasis, sarcoidosis, lung fibrosis,
             pulmonary hypertension, interstitial lung diseases or other active pulmonary diseases
             or abnormalities other than asthma.

          -  Risk Factors for Pneumonia: Immune suppression (e.g., HIV, lupus) or other risk
             factors for pneumonia (e.g., neurological disorders affecting control of the upper
             airway, such as Parkinson's disease, myasthenia gravis). Patients at potentially high
             risk (e.g., very low body mass index (BMI), severely malnourished, or very low FEV1)
             will only be included at the discretion of the Investigator.

          -  Other diseases/abnormalities: Subjects with historical or current evidence of

             sensory, endocrine (including uncontrolled diabetes or thyroid disease) or
             hematological abnormalities that are uncontrolled. Significant is defined as any
             disease that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would put the safety of the subject
             at risk through participation, or which would affect the efficacy or safety analysis
             if the disease/condition exacerbated during the study.

          -  Unstable liver disease as defined by the presence of ascites, encephalopathy,
             coagulopathy, hypoalbuminemia, esophageal or gastric varices or persistent jaundice,

             asymptomatic gallstones).Note: Chronic stable hepatitis B and C are acceptable if the
             subject otherwise meets entry criteria.

          -  Clinically significant ECG abnormality: Evidence of a clinically significant
             abnormality in the 12-lead ECG performed during screening. The Investigator will
             determine the clinical significance of each abnormal ECG finding in relation to the
             subject's medical history and exclude subjects who would be at undue risk by
             participating in the trial. An abnormal and clinically significant finding is defined
             as a 12-lead tracing that is interpreted as, but not limited to, any of the following:

                  greater than or equal to 530 msec in patients with QRS greater than or equal to
                  120 msec.

          -  Unstable or life threatening cardiac disease: subjects with any of the following at
             screening (Visit 1) would be excluded:

               -  Myocardial infarction or unstable angina in the last 6 months

               -  Unstable or life threatening cardiac arrhythmia requiring intervention in the
                  last 3 months

             period if the subject has been considered cured by treatment.

          -  Questionable validity of consent: Subjects with a history of psychiatric disease,
             intellectual deficiency, poor motivation or other conditions that will limit the
             validity of informed consent to participate in the study.

          -  Medication prior to spirometry: Subjects who are medically unable to withhold their

          -  Tobacco use: Subjects who are: Current smokers (defined as subjects who have used
             inhaled tobacco products within the 12 months prior to Visit 1 [i.e., cigarettes,
             e-cigarettes/vaping, cigars or pipe tobacco]); Former smokers with a smoking history
             of greater than equal to 10 pack years (e.g., greater than equal to 20 cigarettes/day
             for 10 years).

          -  Non-compliance: Subjects at risk of non-compliance, or unable to comply with the study
             procedures. Any infirmity, disability, or geographic location that would limit

          -  Asthma maintenance therapy: No changes in asthma maintenance therapy (excluding
             salbutamol inhalation aerosol provided at Visit 1) and control status during the
             run-in period. Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ-6 at screening and ACQ-7 at the end
             of the run-in period) will be used for the assessment of control status of asthma,
             i.e., 0.75 points shows controlled and &gt;0.75 shows not well controlled.

          -  Concurrent conditions/medical history: Liver function test at Visit1

               -  ALT &lt;2 x upper limit of normal (ULN)

               -  ALP less than or equal to 1.5 x ULN

               -  Bilirubin less than or equal to 1.5 x ULN (isolated bilirubin &gt;1.5 x ULN is

             viral infection of the upper or lower respiratory tract, sinus or middle ear during
             the run-in period that led to a change in asthma management or, in the opinion of the
             Investigator, is expected to affect the subject's asthma status or the subject's
             ability to participate in the study.

          -  Severe asthma exacerbation: Evidence of a severe exacerbation during screening or the
             run-in period, defined as deterioration of asthma requiring the use of systemic
             corticosteroids (tablets, suspension, or injection) for at least 3 days or an
             in-patient hospitalization or emergency department visit due to asthma that required
             systemic corticosteroids.

          -  Laboratory test abnormalities: Evidence of clinically significant abnormal laboratory
             tests during screening or the run-in period which are still abnormal upon repeat
             analysis and are not believed to be due to disease(s) present. Each Investigator will
             use his/her own discretion in determining the clinical significance of the
             abnormality.

        <description>An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in clinical study participant, temporally associated with the use of study treatment, whether or not considered related to the study treatment. A SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose: result in death, life threatening, requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent disability/incapacity, congenital anomaly/birth defect, other important medical events that may jeopardize the participant or require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcome mentioned before.

        <title>Change From Baseline in Chemistry Parameters: Calcium, Glucose, Potassium, Sodium, Urea</title>
        <description>Blood samples were collected to analyze the chemistry parameters: calcium, glucose, potassium, sodium and urea. Baseline is the latest pre-dose assessment with a non-missing value, including those from unscheduled visits. Change from Baseline was calculated as relevant visit value minus Baseline value.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Worst Case Post-Baseline Urinalysis Results Relative to Baseline</title>
        <description>Urine samples were collected for analysis of presence of occult blood and protein in urine using dipstick method. The dipstick test gives results in a semi-quantitative manner, and results for urinalysis parameter of occult blood and protein can be read as Trace, 1+, 2+ and 3+ indicating proportional concentrations in the urine sample. Baseline is the latest pre-dose assessment with a non-missing value, including those from unscheduled visits.</description>
