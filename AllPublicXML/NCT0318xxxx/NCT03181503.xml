    <measure>Percent Change From Baseline in Weekly Average of the Peak Pruritus Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) Score at Week 4 Using Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF) Approach</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>Pruritus NRS is a scale used by the participants to report the intensity of their pruritus (itch) during the last 24 hours. Participants completed the assessment once daily at home in the evening. Participants were asked the following questions in their local language: 1) For average itch intensity: &quot;on a scale of 0 to 10, with 0 being 'no itch' and 10 being 'worst itch imaginable', how would you rate your itch overall during the previous 24 hours?&quot;; 2) For maximum itch intensity: &quot;on a scale of 0 to 10, with 0 being 'no itch' and 10 being 'worst itch imaginable', how would you rate your itch at the worst moment during the previous 24 hours?&quot;. Where, higher score indicated worst imaginable itch. Missing values including those who took rescue medication were replaced by LOCF approach.</description>

        <title>Percent Change From Baseline in Weekly Average of the Peak Pruritus Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) Score at Week 4 Using Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF) Approach</title>
        <description>Pruritus NRS is a scale used by the participants to report the intensity of their pruritus (itch) during the last 24 hours. Participants completed the assessment once daily at home in the evening. Participants were asked the following questions in their local language: 1) For average itch intensity: &quot;on a scale of 0 to 10, with 0 being 'no itch' and 10 being 'worst itch imaginable', how would you rate your itch overall during the previous 24 hours?&quot;; 2) For maximum itch intensity: &quot;on a scale of 0 to 10, with 0 being 'no itch' and 10 being 'worst itch imaginable', how would you rate your itch at the worst moment during the previous 24 hours?&quot;. Where, higher score indicated worst imaginable itch. Missing values including those who took rescue medication were replaced by LOCF approach.</description>

        <population>Intent-to-treat (ITT) population included all randomized participants and were analyzed ‘as randomized’ regardless of the treatment they received.

          <description>Pruritus NRS is a scale used by the participants to report the intensity of their pruritus (itch) during the last 24 hours. Participants completed the assessment once daily at home in the evening. Participants were asked the following questions in their local language: 1) For average itch intensity: &quot;on a scale of 0 to 10, with 0 being 'no itch' and 10 being 'worst itch imaginable', how would you rate your itch overall during the previous 24 hours?&quot;; 2) For maximum itch intensity: &quot;on a scale of 0 to 10, with 0 being 'no itch' and 10 being 'worst itch imaginable', how would you rate your itch at the worst moment during the previous 24 hours?&quot;. Where, higher score indicated worst imaginable itch. Missing values including those who took rescue medication were replaced by LOCF approach.</description>
          <population>Intent-to-treat (ITT) population included all randomized participants and were analyzed ‘as randomized’ regardless of the treatment they received. Here, 'N' (overall number of participants analyzed) signifies number of participants evaluable for this outcome measure.</population>

        <title>Absolute Change From Baseline in Weekly Average of the Peak Pruritus Numeric Rating Scale Score at Each Visit Using LOCF Approach</title>
        <description>Pruritus NRS is a scale used by the participants to report the intensity of their pruritus (itch) during the last 24 hours. Participants completed the assessment once daily at home in the evening. Participants were asked the following questions in their local language: 1) For average itch intensity: &quot;on a scale of 0 to 10, with 0 being 'no itch' and 10 being 'worst itch imaginable', how would you rate your itch overall during the previous 24 hours?&quot;; 2) For maximum itch intensity: &quot;on a scale of 0 to 10, with 0 being 'no itch' and 10 being 'worst itch imaginable', how would you rate your itch at the worst moment during the previous 24 hours?&quot;. Where, higher score indicated worst imaginable itch. Missing values including those who took rescue medication were replaced by LOCF approach.</description>

          <description>Pruritus NRS is a scale used by the participants to report the intensity of their pruritus (itch) during the last 24 hours. Participants completed the assessment once daily at home in the evening. Participants were asked the following questions in their local language: 1) For average itch intensity: &quot;on a scale of 0 to 10, with 0 being 'no itch' and 10 being 'worst itch imaginable', how would you rate your itch overall during the previous 24 hours?&quot;; 2) For maximum itch intensity: &quot;on a scale of 0 to 10, with 0 being 'no itch' and 10 being 'worst itch imaginable', how would you rate your itch at the worst moment during the previous 24 hours?&quot;. Where, higher score indicated worst imaginable itch. Missing values including those who took rescue medication were replaced by LOCF approach.</description>

        <title>Percent Change From Baseline in Weekly Average of the Average Pruritus Numeric Rating Scale Score at Each Visit Using LOCF Approach</title>
        <description>Pruritus NRS is a scale used by the participants to report the intensity of their pruritus (itch) during the last 24. Participants completed the assessment once daily at home in the evening. Participants were asked the following questions in their local language: 1) For average itch intensity: &quot;on a scale of 0 to 10, with 0 being 'no itch' and 10 being 'worst itch imaginable', how would you rate your itch overall during the previous 24 hours?&quot;; 2) For maximum itch intensity: &quot;on a scale of 0 to 10, with 0 being 'no itch' and 10 being 'worst itch imaginable', how would you rate your itch at the worst moment during the previous 24 hours?&quot;. Where, higher score indicated worst imaginable itch. Missing values including those who took rescue medication were replaced by LOCF approach.</description>

        <title>Absolute Change From Baseline in Weekly Average of the Average Pruritus Numeric Rating Scale Score at Each Visit Using LOCF Approach</title>
        <description>Pruritus NRS is a scale used by the participants to report the intensity of their pruritus (itch) during the last 24 hours. Participants completed the assessment once daily at home in the evening. Participants were asked the following questions in their local language: 1) For average itch intensity: &quot;on a scale of 0 to 10, with 0 being 'no itch' and 10 being 'worst itch imaginable', how would you rate your itch overall during the previous 24 hours?&quot;; 2) For maximum itch intensity: &quot;on a scale of 0 to 10, with 0 being 'no itch' and 10 being 'worst itch imaginable', how would you rate your itch at the worst moment during the previous 24 hours?&quot;. Where, higher score indicated worst imaginable itch. Missing values including those who took rescue medication were replaced by LOCF approach.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16 and 18</time_frame>
        <population>ITT population included all randomized participants and were analyzed ‘as randomized’ regardless of the treatment they received. Here, 'N' (overall number of participants analyzed) signifies number of participants evaluable for this outcome measure and 'n' (number analyzed) signifies number of participants evaluable at each time point.</population>

        <description>VRS consists of a list of adjectives describing different levels of symptom intensity used by participants to report intensity of their pruritus (itch) over last 24 hours. Participants marked on a 5-point VRS (0=no itch, 1=mild itch, 2=moderate itch, 3=severe itch, 4=very severe itch), a response that best described their pruritus intensity in last 24 hours. Participants were asked following questions in their local language: 1) For average itch intensity: &quot;on a scale of 0-4, with 0 being 'no itch' and 4 being 'very severe itch', how would you rate your itch overall during previous 24 hours?&quot;; 2) For maximum itch intensity: &quot;on a scale of 0-4, with 0 being 'no itch' and 4 being 'very severe itch', how would you rate your worst itch during previous 24 hours?&quot;. Where, higher score indicated very severe itch. Missing values including those who took rescue medication were replaced by LOCF approach.</description>

        <title>Absolute Change From Baseline in Weekly Average of the Peak of Pruritus Verbal Rating Scale Score at Each Visit Using LOCF Approach</title>
        <description>VRS consists of a list of adjectives describing different levels of symptom intensity used by participants to report intensity of their pruritus (itch) over last 24 hours. Participants marked on a 5-point VRS (0=no itch, 1=mild itch, 2=moderate itch, 3=severe itch, 4=very severe itch), a response that best described their pruritus intensity in last 24 hours. Participants were asked following questions in their local language: 1) For average itch intensity: &quot;on a scale of 0-4, with 0 being 'no itch' and 4 being 'very severe itch', how would you rate your itch overall during previous 24 hours?&quot;; 2) For maximum itch intensity: &quot;on a scale of 0-4, with 0 being 'no itch' and 4 being 'very severe itch', how would you rate your worst itch during previous 24 hours?&quot;. Where, higher score indicated very severe itch. Missing values including those who took rescue medication were replaced by LOCF approach.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, 12,16 and 18</time_frame>
        <population>ITT population included all randomized participants and were analyzed ‘as randomized’ regardless of the treatment they received. Here, 'N' (overall number of participants analyzed) signifies number of participants evaluable for this outcome measure and 'n' (number analyzed) signifies number of participants evaluable at each time point.</population>

        <title>Percent Change From Baseline in Weekly Average of the Average Pruritus Verbal Rating Scale Score at Each Visit Using LOCF Approach</title>
        <description>VRS consists of a list of adjectives describing different levels of symptom intensity used by participants to report intensity of their pruritus (itch) over last 24 hours. Participants marked on a 5-point VRS (0=no itch, 1=mild itch, 2=moderate itch, 3=severe itch, 4=very severe itch), a response that best described their pruritus intensity in last 24 hours. Participants were asked following questions in their local language: 1) For average itch intensity: &quot;on a scale of 0-4, with 0 being 'no itch' and 4 being 'very severe itch', how would you rate your itch overall during previous 24 hours?&quot;; 2) For maximum itch intensity: &quot;on a scale of 0-4, with 0 being 'no itch' and 4 being 'very severe itch', how would you rate your worst itch during previous 24 hours?&quot;. Where, higher score indicated very severe itch. Missing values including those who took rescue medication were replaced by LOCF approach.</description>

        <title>Dynamic Pruritus Score (DPS) at 24, 48, and 72 Hours After First Injection and Before Second Injection (Week 4)</title>
        <description>The 9-point DPS is a dynamic scale used by participants to evaluate the change of their pruritus compared with an earlier time point. The scale ranges from 0 (strongly worsened pruritus) to 8 ([almost] no pruritus anymore), including intermediate marks for slightly improved/worsened, moderately improved/worsened, and rather improved/worsened. Participants recorded their DPS score in their local language, and completed the assessment 24, 48 and 72 hours after the first injection at baseline and at week 4 before the second injection.</description>

          <description>PAS includes 7-descriptive items; 1) lesions type (papules nodules/plaques/umbilicated ulcers/ulcers/hypo-/hyperpigmented maculae); 2) number (prurigo lesions on whole body); 3) distribution (disseminated/localized [only 1/2 areas affected]/neither of them); 4) affected areas (forearm/upper arm/lower and upper leg/trunk/head); 5) number of prurigo lesions in selected area; 6) activity (prurigo lesions with excoriations/crusts and healed prurigo lesions compared to all prurigo lesions) and 7) front and back, areas of marked monitor lesions to recognize on next visit. Item 6 has 5 stages (0-4) where each stage represents percentage of prurigo lesions with excoriations/crusts and healed prurigo lesions compared to all prurigo lesions: excoriations/crusts lesions; stage 0=0%, 1=1-25%, 2=26-50%, 3=51-75%, 4=76-100%; for healed lesions; stage 0=100%, 1=75-99%, 2=50-74%, 3=25-49%, 4=0-24%.</description>
          <population>ITT population included all randomized participants and were analyzed ‘as randomized’ regardless of the treatment they received. Here 'n' (number analyzed) signifies number of participants evaluable at each time point for specified category.</population>

        <description>Pruritus NRS is a scale used by the participants to report the intensity of their pruritus (itch) during the last 24 hours. Participants completed the assessment once daily at home in the evening. Participants were asked the following questions in their local language: 1) For average itch intensity: &quot;on a scale of 0 to 10, with 0 being 'no itch' and 10 being 'worst itch imaginable', how would you rate your itch overall during the previous 24 hours?&quot;; 2) For maximum itch intensity: &quot;on a scale of 0 to 10, with 0 being 'no itch' and 10 being 'worst itch imaginable', how would you rate your itch at the worst moment during the previous 24 hours?&quot;. Where, higher score indicated worst imaginable itch.</description>
