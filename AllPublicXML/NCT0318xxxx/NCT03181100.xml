      This phase II trial studies how well atezolizumab in combination with chemotherapy works in
      treating patients with anaplastic or poorly differentiated thyroid cancer. Immunotherapy with
      monoclonal antibodies, such as atezolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the
      cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Vemurafenib and
      cobimetinib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for
      cell growth. Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, may interfere with the ability of
      cancer cells to grow and spread. Drugs such as nab-paclitaxel and paclitaxel work in
      different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping
      them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. This trial is being done to see if
      atezolizumab in combination with chemotherapy works better in treating patients with
      anaplastic or poorly differentiated thyroid cancer compared to standard treatments.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To determine if targeted therapy + atezolizumab (cohorts 1-3) will lead to improved
      overall survival (OS) in patients with anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the safety and efficacy (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST]
      response rate, progression-free survival [PFS]) of targeted therapy + atezolizumab (cohorts
      1-3) in ATC and poorly differentiated thyroid cancer (PDTC).

      II. To determine the OS in patients with PDTC treated with targeted therapy + atezolizumab
      (cohorts 1-3).

      III. To determine the efficacy (RECIST/immune-related Response Criteria [irRC] response rate,
      progression-free survival [PFS]) and OS of ATC and PDTC patients treated with taxanes +
      atezolizumab (cohort 4).

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate changes in the tumor-associated and systemic immune system biomarkers in ATC
      and PDTC patients treated with immunotherapy.

      II. To report radioactive iodine (RAI) uptake in patients who have a diagnostic whole body
      scan and therapeutic I-131 in cohort 2.

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 4 cohorts.

      COHORT I (BRAF MUTATION): Patients receive vemurafenib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days
      1-21, cobimetinib PO once daily (QD) on days 1-21, and atezolizumab intravenously (IV) over
      30-60 minutes on days 1 and 15. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease
      progression and unacceptable toxicity.

      COHORT II (RAS, NF1, OR NF2 MUTATION including patients with MAPK activating mutations at or
      above MEK): Patients receive cobimetinib PO QD on days 1-21 and atezolizumab IV over 30-60
      minutes on days 1 and 15. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression
      and unacceptable toxicity.

      COHORT III (NON-BRAF/NON-RAS MUTATION): Patients receive atezolizumab IV over 30-60 minutes
      and bevacizumab IV over 60-90 minutes on day 1. Cycles repeat every 21 days in the absence of
      disease progression and unacceptable toxicity.

      COHORT IV: Patients receive nab-paclitaxel IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15 and
      atezolizumab IV over 30-60 minutes on day 1. Patients may receive paclitaxel IV over 30
      minutes on day 1 as a substitute for nab-paclitaxel. Cycles repeat every 21 days in the
      absence of disease progression and unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for years 1-2,
      every 6 months for years 3-4, then yearly thereafter.

          -  Pregnant or lactating women. All pre-menopausal women being screened must have a
             negative serum pregnancy test within 14 days prior to commencement of dosing. Women of
             non-childbearing potential may be included if they are either surgically sterile or
             have been postmenopausal for &gt;= 1 year. Fertile men and women must use an effective

          -  Chemotherapy within 21 days of enrollment with the exception of paclitaxel or
             nab-paclitaxel (Abraxane). Patients who have received one course of these agents prior
             to study entry are eligible. (One course of weekly paclitaxel or nab-paclitaxel is 3
             doses. One course of every 3 week dosing of paclitaxel or nab-paclitaxel is 1 dose).
             Patients who have received prior radiosensitizing chemotherapy are eligible.

          -  The use of corticosteroids is not allowed for 10 days prior to initiation of
             atezolizumab except patients who are taking steroids for physiological replacement.
             Inhaled or topical steroids, and adrenal replacement steroid doses are permitted in
             the absence of active autoimmune disease. This does not apply to patients receiving
             steroids as pre-medications for paclitaxel administration.

          -  Grade &gt;= 2 uncontrolled hypertension (patients with a history of hypertension
             controlled with anti-hypertensive medication to Grade =&lt; 1 are eligible).

          -  ADDITIONAL EXCLUSION CRITERIA FOR non-BRAF/non-RAS MUTATION (COHORT 3):

               -  Patients with clinically significant hemoptysis or tumor bleeding within two
                  weeks prior to first dose of targeted therapy.

               -  Patients with suspected tracheal or esophageal invasion are excluded from cohort
                  3 due to the high risk of trachealesophageal fistula. Patients excluded from
                  cohort 3 may be enrolled on taxane + atezolizumab cohort (cohort 4).

          -  ADDITIONAL EXCLUSION CRITERIA FOR COHORTS 1 and 2: Ocular Exclusion Criteria for
             vemurafenib and cobimetinib containing cohorts—cohorts 1 and 2. (However, these
             patients may be assigned other cohorts if they do not meet the ocular exclusion
             criteria): History of or evidence of retinal pathology on ophthalmologic examination
             that is considered a risk factor for neurosensory retinal detachment, central serous
             chorioretinopathy, retinal vein occlusion (RVO), or neovascular macular degeneration
             Patients will be excluded from participation in cohorts 1 and 2 if they currently are
             known to have any of the following risk factors for RVO unless a retinal specialist
             has determined that the risk of retinal detachment is low:

               -  History of serous retinopathy.

               -  History of retinal vein occlusion.

               -  History of ongoing serous retinopathy or RVO at baseline.

          -  ADDITIONAL EXCLUSION CRITERIA FOR PATIENTS IN COHORT 1
             (vemurafenib+cobimetinib+atezolizumab): History of clinically significant cardiac
             dysfunction, including the following:

               -  Mean (average of triplicate measurements) QTc interval corrected using
                  Fridericia's method &gt;= 480 ms at screening, or uncorrectable abnormalities in
                  serum electrolytes (sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus).

          -  ADDITIONAL EXCLUSION CRITERIA FOR PATIENTS IN COHORTS 1 and 2 (cobimetinib-containing
             cohorts):

               -  Unstable angina, or new-onset angina within 3 months prior to initiation of study
                  treatment.

               -  Symptomatic congestive heart failure, defined as New York Heart Association Class
                  II or higher.

               -  Myocardial infarction within 3 months prior to initiation of study treatment.

               -  Left ventricular ejection fraction below the institutional lower limit of normal
                  or below 50%, whichever is lower.
