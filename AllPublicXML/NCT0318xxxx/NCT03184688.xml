  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is the most common peripheral entrapment neuropathy with
      involving compression of the median nerve in the carpal tunnel. Although many conservative
      managements of CTS, the effectiveness of these methods is insignificant or only persist for a
      short duration. The platelet rich plasma (PRP) is a new and potential treatment for patients
      with kinds of musculoskeletal disorders and recent reports showed being beneficial for
      peripheral neuropathy in animal studies. Since 2014, four small clinical trials showed the
      positive effect of PRP in peripheral neuropathy. Among these studies, two small trials showed
      beneficial effect of PRP for patients with mild CTS. However, the definite clinical effect of
      PRP for peripheral neuropathy from currently published studies is unclarified because these
      studies enrolled a few patients and lacked long-term follow-up (no more than 6 months
      follow-up).

      After obtaining written informed consent, patients of clinically diagnosed with bilateral CTS
      were randomized into intervention and control side. Intervention group received one-dose
      ultrasound-guided PRP injection and control group received one-dose ultrasound-guided normal
      saline injection. No additional treatment after injection through the study period. The
      primary outcome is Boston Carpal Tunnel Syndrome Questionnaire (BCTQ) and secondary outcomes
      include visual analog scale (VAS), cross-sectional area (CSA) of the median nerve, sensory
      nerve conduction velocity of the median nerve, and finger pinch strength. The evaluation was
      performed pretreatment as well as on the 2nd week, 1st, 3rd, 6th month and one year after the
      treatment.

    <description>Boston carpal tunnel syndrome questionnaire (BCTQ) is a frequently used patient-based questionnaire for measurement of carpal tunnel syndrome which encompasses symptom severity and functional status. Each question ranges from 1 to 5 with a higher score indicating severer symptom or a higher degree of disability. Total score ranges from 19 to 95 and the mean of total scores divided with each item score were used for further analysis.</description>

    <description>The antidromic sensory nerve conduction velocity of the median nerve was performed on all subjects according to the protocol reported by the American Academy of Neurology (USA). The median nerve was stimulated at the wrist between the palmar longus and flexor carpal radialis tendon at a distance of approximately 14 cm from the active electrode.</description>

    <description>The finger pinch strength was measured using dynamometer (Fabrication Enterprises Inc., USA). The subject was seated with shoulder adducted and neutrally rotated with the elbow flexed at 90Â°. The forearm and wrist were positioned in a neutral position for the palmar pinch</description>
