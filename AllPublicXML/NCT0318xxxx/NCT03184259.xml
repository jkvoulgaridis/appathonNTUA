      A new lower-limb training system is introduced to enhance the clinical service for
      post-stroke lower limb rehabilitation and to assist the establishment of public clinical
      trial in different settings and share experiences on the robot-assisted functional training.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is caused by intracranial haemorrhage or thrombosis, which cuts off arterial supply to
      brain tissue and usually damages the motor pathway of the central nervous system affecting
      one side of the body. Reduced descending neural drive to the affected side could lead to
      hemiplegia, which significantly influences the activity of daily living (ADL) of stroke
      survivors (Singam, Ytterberg, Tham &amp; von Koch, 2015). While the upper-limb motor impairment
      could be compensated using the contralateral side for picking up or manipulating objects, the
      loss of motor functionality on the lower limb would substantially limit the mobility and body
      balance. Many stroke survivors are dependent on walking aids or manual support from
      caregivers for standing and walking, otherwise they would have great risk of falling with
      serious consequences (Tasseel-Ponche, Yelnik &amp; Bonan, 2015).

      Recent studies suggest stroke patients could relearn walking ability by developing
      alternative neural circuitries through long-term adaptation process, known as
      neuroplasticity. High-intensity, repetitive, and task-specific gait training is the key to
      enhance gait recovery of hemiplegic stroke patients (Kreisei, Hennerici &amp; BÃ¤zner, 2007; Kleim
      &amp; Jones, 2008). The development of robot-assisted lower-limb exoskeleton devices has great
      clinical potential in stroke rehabilitation. Many lower-limb exoskeleton robots are
      clinically-available for non-ambulatory stroke patients to practice walking with passive
      assistance on body-weight-supported treadmill training (BWSTT) (Morone, et al., 2017).

      Existing robot-assisted gait training (RAGT) such as Lokomat and electromechanical Gait
      Trainer provide automatic, rhythmic, and repetitive powered assistance to major lower-limb
      joints at hips and knees bilaterally (Poli, Morone, Rosati &amp; Masiero, 2013). Large-scale
      randomized controlled trials (RCT) of these RAGT in combination with conventional therapies
      show significantly more chronic stroke patients improved functional gait independency and ADL
      than receiving conventional therapies alone (Pohl, et al., 2007; Schwartz, et al., 2009;
      Hidler, et al., 2009; Mehrholz, et al., 2013). However, Hesse, Schmidt, Werner &amp; Bardeleben
      (2003) suggest the integration of robots into gait rehabilitation could merely be an
      auxiliary tool for therapists to enhance training intensity and safety without increasing
      their workload. Most clinically-available RAGT are bounded to treadmill with passive
      assistance (van Peppen, et al., 2004; Morone, et al., 2017), but researches show
      task-variations and active participation in gait training could improve retention of
      newly-learnt skills and could promote generalization of training effects (Salbach, et al.,
      2004; Kwon, Woo, Lee &amp; Kim, 2015). Portable RAGT that allows active over-ground gait training
      would be more promising especially for ambulatory stroke patients.

      Robot-assisted ankle foot orthosis (AFO) and knee brace are good candidates of portable
      exoskeleton devices for RAGT of hemiplegic stroke patients (Duerinck, et al., 2012; Zhang,
      Davies &amp; Xie, 2013; Mehrholz, et al., 2017). Conventional AFO is mainly designed for treating
      foot drop gait abnormality with passive support in ankle dorsiflexion for foot clearance in
      swing phase and shock absorption in loading response. Conventional knee brace is mainly
      designed for body support in stance phase. The integration of robot assistance in the
      affected ankle and/or knee joint could provide active power assistance that synchronises to
      patients' voluntary residual ankle and/or knee movement. Long-term active power assistance
      might stimulate experience-driven gait recovery or develop compensatory gait pattern to
      facilitate gait (Kleim &amp; Jones, 2008).

      In order to translate robotic rehabilitation research into clinical application,
      evidence-based clinical research should be carried out to test the safety and effectiveness
      of the new devices or interventions on stroke patients (Backus, Winchester &amp; Tefertiller,
      2010). Many designs of robot-assisted AFO and knee braces have been proposed by different
      research groups, but most of them reported only the results of feasibility tests, mainly on
      healthy subjects with small sample sizes (Dollar &amp; Herr, 2008; Shorter, et al., 2013; Alam,
      Choudhury &amp; Bin Mamat, 2014). Majority of previous studies concerned about the immediate
      effects of wearing the robot-assisted AFOs and knee braces during walking, but few studies
      investigated the long-term therapeutic effects of wearing the devices for RAGT of stroke
      patients (Lo, 2012). In particular, systematic review by Mehrholz, et al. (2017) shows only
      one RCT has evaluated the efficacy of ankle training using robot-assisted AFO but in seated
      position, no RCT evaluated gait training using robot-assisted AFO on both over-ground walking
      and stair ambulation.

      In this study, the Exoskeleton Ankle Robot and Knee Robot have been proposed and evaluated as
      a robot-assisted AFO and knee brace for gait training of stroke patients with foot drop gait
      abnormality. Clinical application of robot-assisted AFO and knee brace on stroke patients has
      to overcome some important challenges, such as to reduce weight loading on the leg, and to
      achieve portability and adaptability to various walking environments. The Exoskeleton Ankle
      Robot and Knee Brace aims: (1) to provide synchronised active ankle and/or knee power
      assistance to facilitate walking, (2) to develop accurate and reliable method to classify
      user walking intention in over-ground walking and stair ambulation, (3) to deliver training
      protocol for RAGT of stroke patients with foot drop gait abnormality. The feasibility tests
      and RCT of the Exoskeleton Ankle Robot and Knee Brace could validate the clinical value of
      this new rehabilitation robot, and could potentially establish a new intervention of gait
      rehabilitation for stroke patients.

    <measure>Functional Ambulatory Category (FAC)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Post-Training, 3-month follow up</time_frame>
    <description>Functional Ambulatory Category (FAC) is a reliable measurement of independent walking ability on level-ground walking and stair ambulation, which is a good prediction of independent community walking post-stroke (Mehrholz, et al., 2007). FAC consists of 6-level scale: patients with FAC=4 requires supervision in level ground walking, FAC=5 requires supervision only when walking on non-level surface such as stairs.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Fugl-Meyer Assessment for Lower-Extremity (FMA-LE)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Post-Training, 3-month follow up</time_frame>
    <description>Fugl-Meyer Assessment for Lower-Extremity (FMA-LE), consists of 34-level cumulative scoring system to examine lower-limb functions of hemiplegic stroke patients quantitatively through a set of lower-limb movement tasks in reflex, flexor/extensor synergy, volitional movement, coordination and speed (Fugl-Meyer, et al., 1975). All assessment items are either scoring &quot;full&quot;, &quot;partial&quot;, or &quot;none&quot; functionality in the affected side, which minimizes ceiling and floor effects. FMA-LE demonstrated high internal consistency and a reliable assessment tool for a group of 140 hemiplegic community dwelling patients (Park &amp; Choi, 2014).</description>

    <measure>Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Post-Training, 3-month follow up</time_frame>
    <description>Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS), consists of 4-level scale to examine joint spasticity based on muscle tone and resistance detected during passive stretching with good inter-rater reliability (ICC =0.85) (Bohannon &amp; Smith, 1987).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Berg Balance Scale (BBS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Post-Training, 3-month follow up</time_frame>
    <description>Berg Balance Scale (BBS), consists of 56-level measures to examine balance ability and to predict falling risk with high reliability (ICC=0.98) (Steffen, Hacker &amp; Mollinger, 2002). Stroke patients were assessed based on their performance on 14 simple mobility tasks, including transfer, standing, and reaching.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Timed 10-Meter Walk Test (10mWT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Post-Training, 3-month follow up</time_frame>
    <description>Timed 10-Meter Walk Test (10mWT), measures comfortable and fast walking speeds in short distance. The ability to increase walking speed above a comfortable pace suggests the capability to adapt to varying environments, such as crossing street, with high reliability (ICC=0.90-0.96) (Flansbjer, et al., 2005). Average walking speed of healthy elderly subjects ranges in 0.6m/s-1.4m/s, and can increase to 21%-56% above the comfortable pace for faster walking speed.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>6-minute Walk Test (SMWT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Post-Training, 3-month follow up</time_frame>
    <description>Six-Minute Walk Test (SMWT), measures the maximum walking distance covered in fixed duration as a sub-maximal test of endurance and aerobic capacity. The measurement of 6MWT is highly correlated to FAC (Mehrholz, et al., 2007) with good reliability (ICC=0.94-0.96) (Steffen, Hacker &amp; Mollinger, 2002).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Gait Analysis with EMG Collection</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Post-Training</time_frame>
    <description>The spatial-temporal, kinetic, and kinematic gait parameters of the stroke patients were collected at the hip, knee, and ankle joints. In addition, the foot tilt angle was computed using the absolute angle between the affected foot and the ground, which is negative when the foot is pointing downwards. This angle measurement can help identifying abnormality in foot orientation during walking, such as foot slapping at initial contact or dropped foot pointing downwards after mid-swing (Zhang, Davies &amp; Xie, 2013). Electromyography (EMG) of the lower limb muscles were also collected to investigate the muscle recruitment during walking with the robotic assistance.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Subjective Feedback from Participants</measure>
    <time_frame>Post-Training</time_frame>
    <description>Subjective feedbacks were collected from participated stroke patients using questionnaire, with three 10-point Likert scale rating asking them about safety, effectiveness, and overall satisfaction of the gait training with the Exoskeleton Ankle Robot, with reference to the other conventional physiotherapy they had received before participating in this trial. Likert scale has been shown to measure satisfaction with good reliability (Wittink &amp; Bayer, 1994).</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), assesses the cognitive capability of the subject to make sure they understand the purpose of participation in the clinical trial.</description>
