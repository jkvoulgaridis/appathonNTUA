    <description>The Cutaneous Dermatomyositis Disease Area and Severity Index (CDASI), a skin-based outcome measure, was developed to systematically assess the extent of cutaneous disease in patients with DM.
The CDASI scale is a validated DM-specific instrument designed to capture the extent of cutaneous disease. Disease involvement in 15 different anatomical locations is rated using three activity (erythema, scale, erosion/ulceration) and two damage (poikiloderma, calcinosis) measures. The presence and severity of Gottron's papules, periungual changes and alopecia are also captured. The resulting activity and damage scores range from 0 to 100 and 0 to 32, respectively. Higher scores indicate greater disease severity.</description>
