  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to determine the burden of pertussis infection among adolescents and adults
      with prolonged cough in four Asian countries, namely Malaysia, Philippines, Taiwan and
      Thailand. This study also aims to assess the health economic (HE) impact of pertussis.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Data from this cross-sectional study will be useful in reviewing the need for introduction of
      booster doses of pertussis vaccines in adolescent and adult population in Malaysia,
      Philippines, Taiwan and Thailand.

      This study will enrol patients with prolonged cough of 2 weeks or more and detect pertussis
      with serological tests in order to estimate the prevalence of pertussis infection among such
      patients. No vaccine will be administered during this study.

    <description>Serological evidence of pertussis infection was defined as anti-pertussis toxin (PT) immunoglobulin G (IgG) level indicative of active or recent infection. The parameters presented were defined as follows: Seropositive = Subjects with anti-PT IgG ELISA levels ≥10 IU/ml , Seronegative = Subjects with anti-PT IgG ELISA levels &lt; 10 IU/ml , Sero-confirmed infection = Subjects with anti-PT IgG ELISA levels ≥62.5 IU/ml , Active infection 1= Anti-PT IgG ELISA levels ≥ 100 IU/ml indicative of active or recent infection, Active infection 2 = Anti-PT IgG ELISA levels ≥ 125 IU/ml indicative of active or recent infection</description>

    <time_frame>At time of questionnaire administration (Day 0)</time_frame>
    <description>Health-related quality of life of pertussis patients was assessed using the EQ-5D Questionnaire. The EQ-5D is composed of 5 dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression), with 3 levels of severity within each dimension. The EQ-5D levels were further dichotomised into &quot;no problems&quot; (level 1) and &quot;with problems&quot; (level 2 &amp; 3). The number of participants within these 2 levels are reported.</description>
