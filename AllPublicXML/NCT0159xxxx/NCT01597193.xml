SAE was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death, initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization, life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying), persistent or significant disability or incapacity, congenital anomaly. Treatment-emergent are events between first dose of study drug and up to 30 days after last dose of study drug that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pretreatment state. AEs included both serious and non-serious adverse events.</description>

        <population>PK analysis population included all participants who had at least 1 dose of Enzalutamide and had sufficient PK data to calculate at least 1 of the PK parameters of interest in at least 1 treatment period. Here, number of participants analyzed signifies those participants who were evaluable for this outcome measure.</population>
