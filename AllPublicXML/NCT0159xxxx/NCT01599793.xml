  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done to help researchers understand more about prostate cancer that has
      spread to the bones by using the newest magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques and to
      better understand the effect of an experimental drug called XL184 (or cabozantinib) on bone
      disease. The other purposes of the study are to better understand the effect of XL184 on
      prostate cancer progression, bone pain, and on any cancer cells that patients may have
      circulating within the blood (called circulating tumor cells)

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine effect of XL184 on the functional MRI metrics Ktrans and apparent diffusion
      coefficient (ADC) within castrate resistant prostate cancer bone metastases.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To quantify progression free survival in men with castrate resistant prostate cancer
      (CRPC) treated with XL184 according to Prostate Cancer Working Group criteria.

      II. To correlate and changes in MRI based functional metrics with bone scan, prostate
      specific antigen (PSA), Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) response
      criteria, circulating tumor cells (CTC) number and with changes in pain.

      III. To explore c-MET, phospho-c-MET staining on circulating tumor cells as a predictive
      biomarker for response and duration of response to XL-184.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive cabozantinib orally (PO) once daily (QD). Treatment continues in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.

    <description>Ktrans is a measurement calculating the volume transfer constant of the contrast reagent and essentially is a measurement of vascular perfusion.
To determine the effect of XL184 on the functional MRI metrics Ktrans, Ktrans parameters were measured at baseline, two week time-point, 12 weeks, and 24 weeks for disease monitoring. Change between baseline and 2 weeks reported.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Association of Progression Free Survival (PFS) With Ktrans and ADC</measure>
    <time_frame>From start of treatment to time of progression or death, whichever occurs first, assessed up to 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Time to progression or progression-free survival (PFS) is defined as the duration of time from start of treatment to time of progression or death, whichever occurs first.
The approximate survival after standard therapies in this setting is bleak and in the order of months.
Too few events for a meaningful statistical analysis; no significant results were obtained in Cox regression analyses.
Therefore, we calculated the median PFS time and its 95% confidence interval.</description>

    <description>Bone Scan Response at weeks 2, 12, and 24 were collected. Change between baseline and 2 weeks are reported Bone Scan Response were measured as increase, decrease, or stable of bone lesions and scored as 1, -1, or 0, respectively, where higher values represent a worse outcome.</description>
