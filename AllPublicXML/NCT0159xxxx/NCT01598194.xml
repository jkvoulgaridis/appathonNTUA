  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to compare the performance of a newly available
      needle with reverse bevel design (called the EchoTip® Procore™ needle) with standard needles
      to see which needle gives better diagnostic information for pancreatic lesions.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      An endoscopic ultrasound-guided needle biopsy or FNA is a special endoscopic procedure used
      to sample lesions within or next to the digestive tract, including the pancreas. The needle
      is used to collect material for diagnosis. A special lighted, flexible tube called an
      endoscope is inserted through the mouth, into the stomach and small intestine. The endoscope
      also has an ultrasound probe at its tip which can be used to see the pancreas, which is
      located behind the stomach. The doctor will then use the ultrasound to guide the needle
      biopsy or FNA.

      In this procedure, an average of 4 needle passes (needle sticks) is needed to collect enough
      tissue for diagnosis. However, the number of passes can be higher or lower, depending on the
      individual lesion and success of the needle passes.

      If participant agrees to take part in this study, 2 different needles (the standard straight
      hollow-core needle and the new EchoTip® Procore™ needle) will be used to sample the pancreas
      lesion. Two (2) passes will be performed with each needle type and compared. If additional
      passes are needed for diagnosis, they will not be included in this study. After the first set
      of needle passes, the doctor may decide that more passes are needed.

      Final test results will be taken from the diagnostic results from each needle pass. The
      results from both types of the needle will be included in the participant's medical record.

      This is an investigational study. All needles used in this study are FDA approved and
      commercially available. Comparing the needles is investigational.

      Up to 60 participants will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.

    <measure>Comparison of Diagnostic Adequacy Scores With SST vs. CST for Cytologic Diagnosis Using a 22G Core Needle.</measure>
    <time_frame>Each EGD EUS-FNA endoscopy procedure takes about 1 hour. Each needle pass takes about 1-2 minutes.</time_frame>
    <description>The main outcome measure of the study was the diagnostic adequacy of the 22Gpc using SST and CST. The cytologic diagnostic adequacy of 22Gpc was also compared to the standard 25 G needle. Each participant underwent 4 study passes, 2 passes with a standard 25 G needle using SST, plus a random assignment to one of two groups for 2 passes with the 22Gpc (1 pass for cytologic and 1 pass for histologic analysis) using SST (group 1) or CST (group 2). Diagnostic adequacy was defined as the ability to procure cytological aspirates or histological core tissue samples that were sufficient for diagnostic interpretation.</description>

    <description>The main outcome measure of the study was the diagnostic adequacy of the 22Gpc using SST versus CST on EUS-FNA. The cytologic diagnostic adequacy of 22Gpc was also compared to the standard 25G needle. Diagnostic adequacy was defined as the ability to procure cytological aspirates or histological core tissue samples that were sufficient for diagnostic interpretation. Two cytopathologists, blinded to needle type and technique, reviewed and graded all the study slides. Cytologic diagnostic adequacy of each pass was graded on a semiquantitative scale from 0 to 3 based on sample cellularity. A score of 2 (estimated cell count &gt; 500 cells) or 3 (estimated cell count &gt; 1000 cells) was considered adequate for diagnosis; a score of 3 was most desirable. A score &lt; 2 was considered inadequate. Histologic diagnostic adequacy was graded as either an adequate (score 2 or 3) or inadequate specimen for diagnosis.</description>

        <title>Comparison of Diagnostic Adequacy Scores With SST vs. CST for Cytologic Diagnosis Using a 22G Core Needle.</title>
        <description>The main outcome measure of the study was the diagnostic adequacy of the 22Gpc using SST and CST. The cytologic diagnostic adequacy of 22Gpc was also compared to the standard 25 G needle. Each participant underwent 4 study passes, 2 passes with a standard 25 G needle using SST, plus a random assignment to one of two groups for 2 passes with the 22Gpc (1 pass for cytologic and 1 pass for histologic analysis) using SST (group 1) or CST (group 2). Diagnostic adequacy was defined as the ability to procure cytological aspirates or histological core tissue samples that were sufficient for diagnostic interpretation.</description>
        <time_frame>Each EGD EUS-FNA endoscopy procedure takes about 1 hour. Each needle pass takes about 1-2 minutes.</time_frame>

        <title>Comparison of Diagnostic Adequacy Scores With SST vs. CST for Histologic Diagnosis Using a 22G Core Needle.</title>
        <description>The main outcome measure of the study was the diagnostic adequacy of the 22Gpc using SST versus CST on EUS-FNA. The cytologic diagnostic adequacy of 22Gpc was also compared to the standard 25G needle. Diagnostic adequacy was defined as the ability to procure cytological aspirates or histological core tissue samples that were sufficient for diagnostic interpretation. Two cytopathologists, blinded to needle type and technique, reviewed and graded all the study slides. Cytologic diagnostic adequacy of each pass was graded on a semiquantitative scale from 0 to 3 based on sample cellularity. A score of 2 (estimated cell count &gt; 500 cells) or 3 (estimated cell count &gt; 1000 cells) was considered adequate for diagnosis; a score of 3 was most desirable. A score &lt; 2 was considered inadequate. Histologic diagnostic adequacy was graded as either an adequate (score 2 or 3) or inadequate specimen for diagnosis.</description>
