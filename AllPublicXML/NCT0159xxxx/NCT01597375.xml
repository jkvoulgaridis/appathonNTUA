  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are doing this research study to find out if giving a drug called
      prasugrel, which is used to prevent blood clots, can reduce reactions to aspirin in people
      with aspirin exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD), and to learn why taking aspirin every
      day can work as a treatment for people with AERD. People with AERD have symptoms of asthma,
      severe runny nose, polyps in the nose, and develop allergic reactions if they take
      medications like aspirin.

      People with AERD can be desensitized to aspirin in order to be able to safely use it daily,
      but the investigators do not know if prasugrel may prevent reactions to aspirin and provide a
      safer way for people with AERD to tolerate aspirin.

      The investigators also want to understand what is different about the cells and urine from
      subjects who have AERD, in comparison to subjects who have asthma but do not have AERD and
      subjects who have allergic rhinitis but do not have asthma. Lastly, the investigators want to
      understand how aspirin acts differently in subjects who have AERD, in comparison to subjects
      who have asthma but do not have AERD.

    <measure>Difference in PD2 (Provocative Dose of Aspirin That Elicits an Increase in Nasal Symptom Score of 2 During an Aspirin Challenge) on Prasugrel Versus Placebo</measure>
    <time_frame>Difference in PD2 (provocative dose of aspirin that elicits an increase in nasal symptom score of 2 during an aspirin challenge) between Visits 2 and 3 (weeks 8 and 14), calculated at visit 3</time_frame>
    <description>The PD2 is the provocative dose of aspirin that elicits an increase in nasal symptom score of 2 during an aspirin challenge. The PD2 is calculated by:
inverse〖log〗_10 (((2-(PrevTNSS-BaselineTNSS))×(〖log〗_10 ProvocDose-〖log〗_10 PrevDose))/((MaxTNSS-BaselineTNSS)-(PrevTNSS-BaselineTNSS) )+(〖log〗_10 PrevDose))</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline Expression Levels of COX-2 Transcript and Protein in Peripheral Blood Leukocytes of Subjects With AERD After 8 Weeks of Treatment With Aspirin.</measure>
    <time_frame>Evaluated at visits 1 and 4 (weeks 4 and 22)</time_frame>
    <description>This study will compare this outcome within each participant between baseline (established at Visit 1, prior to initiation of prasugrel therapy) and at the completion of 8 weeks of aspirin therapy.</description>

    <measure>Difference in Participant's Provocative Dose of Aspirin When Pretreated With Prasugrel Versus Placebo</measure>
    <time_frame>Evaluated at visits 2 and 3 (weeks 8 and 14)</time_frame>
    <description>We will monitor the dose of aspirin at which the participant shows symptoms (increased discomfort, 15% drop in FEV1) during the aspirin challenge/desensitization. We will compare the provocative aspirin dose obtained from the aspirin challenge occurring after pretreatment with prasugrel to the dose obtained after pretreatment with placebo.</description>

    <measure>Change in Total Nasal Symptom Score(TNSS)From Baseline to Peak During Aspirin Challenge on Placebo Versus Prasugrel.</measure>
    <time_frame>Data obtained at visits 2 and 3 (weeks 8 and 14) and change calculated at visit 3</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome in Part 1 will be the maximum Total Nasal Symptom Score (TNSS) attained for subjects with AERD during the clinical reaction to aspirin challenge. The primary analysis will compare this outcome within each participant after treatment with prasugrel versus placebo. Nasal symptoms including congestion, rhinorrhea, runny nose, itchy nose, sneezing, itchy eyes, teary eyes, itchy ears/throat, and eye redness were assessed on a 0- to 5-point scale (0, none-5, very severe) in response to the provocative dose of aspirin during aspirin challenge/desensitization and summed together to generate the TNSS score (range 0-40).</description>

        <description>The primary outcome in Part 1 will be the maximum Total Nasal Symptom Score (TNSS) attained for subjects with AERD during the clinical reaction to aspirin challenge. The primary analysis will compare this outcome within each participant after treatment with prasugrel versus placebo. Nasal symptoms including congestion, rhinorrhea, runny nose, itchy nose, sneezing, itchy eyes, teary eyes, itchy ears/throat, and eye redness were assessed on a 0- to 5-point scale (0, none-5, very severe) in response to the provocative dose of aspirin during aspirin challenge/desensitization and summed together to generate the TNSS score (range 0-40).</description>
