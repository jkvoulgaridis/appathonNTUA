    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of EphA2 siRNA in treating patients
      with solid tumors that have spread to other places in the body and usually cannot be cured or
      controlled with treatment (advanced) or have come back after a period of improvement
      (recurrent). EphA2-targeting DOPC-encapsulated siRNA may slow the growth of tumor cells by
      shutting down the activity of a gene that causes tumor growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety and tolerability (toxicity profile) of EphA2-targeting
      DOPC-encapsulated siRNA (EphA2 siRNA) delivered via neutral liposome
      (1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine or DOPC) administered intravenously in
      patients with advanced/recurrent malignancies.

      II. To determine the maximal tolerated dose (MTD) or maximal administered dose (MAD) using a
      modified toxicity probability interval (mTPI) design.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine efficacy (EphA2 expression modulation) at the MTD or MAD. II. To evaluate the
      effect of EphA2 siRNA-DOPC on tumor and endothelial cell apoptosis.

      III. To record the clinical activity (objective response, duration of response, and time to
      treatment progression) of intravenous (IV) EphA2 siRNA -DOPC.

      IV. To describe the symptom burden of patients receiving siRNA-EphA2-DOPC treatment.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the pharmacokinetic profile of siRNA-EphA2-DOPC in blood. II. To determine
      the effect of EphA2 siRNA-DOPC on tumor perfusion, apparent diffusion, and metabolism by
      radiographic imaging (dynamic contrast-enhanced-magnetic resonance imaging [DCE-MRI],
      diffusion weighted [DW]-MRI and fludeoxyglucose F-18-positron emission tomography
      [18FDG-PET]).

      III. To determine the impact of EphA2 siRNA-DOPC on surrogate biomarkers in blood (cell-free
      deoxyribonucleic acid [DNA], plasma/serum markers [vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF),
      caveolin 1 (CAV1), soluble EphrinA1], and exosomes).

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive EphA2-targeting DOPC-encapsulated siRNA IV over 120 minutes on days 1 and 4.
      Cycles repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.
