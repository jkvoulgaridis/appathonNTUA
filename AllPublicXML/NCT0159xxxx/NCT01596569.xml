  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study investigates the efficacy of a novel neurorehabilitation program combining
      noninvasive brain stimulation (transcranial magnetic stimulation or TMS) and cognitive
      therapy, on cognitive function and quality of life in individuals with blast-induced
      traumatic brain injury (bTBI).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The most common blast-induced traumatic brain injury (bTBI)-associated problems are cognitive
      deficits, such as executive functioning and memory. This study evaluates a combined
      rehabilitation program: transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and cognitive therapy for
      treatment of patients with bTBI. TMS is a noninvasive way of stimulating the brain, which is
      not painful and does not involve any needles or any form of surgery. It acts by delivering a
      magnetic stimulation to a particular brain region. Half of the study participants will
      receive cognitive intervention with active TMS, and a control group will receive cognitive
      intervention with sham TMS. This study takes place in Boston, Massachusetts: at the VA Boston
      Healthcare System and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.

    <description>Neurobehavioral Symptoms Inventory (NSI) is a 22-item measure that assesses the post-concussive symptoms in patients with TBI.The NSI asks the patient to rate each of the symptoms according to how much the symptom has disturbed him/her using a five point scale. Patient ratings are based on descriptions of the frequency of the symptom, the extent to which the symptom disrupts the patient's activities, and the patient's perceived need for help with the symptom. A total score will be summated. Lower scores are more favorable.</description>

    <description>Dysexecutive Questionnaire (DEX) is a 20-item self-report measure of real-life deficits relevant to cognitive/executive function that measures four domains: emotional, motivational, behavioral and cognitive. All items are rates in terms of frequency on a 5-point scale: 0 (never), 1(occasionally), 2 (sometimes), 3 (fairly often), 4 (very often). Scores are summed and the total scores range from 0 to 80, with higher scores indicating greater problems with executive functioning.</description>
