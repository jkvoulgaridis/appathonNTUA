    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of aerosolized aldesleukin and
      to see how well it works in treating patients with cancer that has spread from the original
      tumor to the lungs. Biological therapies, such as aerosolized aldesleukin, may stimulate or
      suppress the immune system in different ways and stop tumor cells from growing.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate toxicity in patients with lung metastases during aerosol interleukin (IL)-2
      (aldesleukin) therapy using self-report, remote spirometry and pulse oximetry.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine dose and schedule of an acceptable aerosol IL-2 regimen and correlate with
      absolute lymphocyte count (ALC).

      II. To determine serum IL-2 levels on day 1 of therapy for evidence of spillover into
      circulation and correlate with absence or presence of toxicity.

      III. To evaluate the efficacy of aerosol IL-2 treatment using Response Evaluation Criteria in
      Solid Tumors (RECIST).

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the histology in post-surgical specimens in patients who undergo surgery for
      lung metastases following aerosol IL-2 treatment as an optional procedure.

      II. To evaluate immune correlates from optional pre-treatment biopsy and post-surgical
      specimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study followed by a phase II study.

      Patients receive aerosolized aldesleukin once daily (QD) on days 1-21. Courses repeat every
      28 days in the absence of disease progression of unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.

    <time_frame>Up to 4 years</time_frame>
    <description>Response analysis will be performed on intent-to-treat, that is, any patient who enrolled into the expansion cohort. Patients who withdraw before the end of 2 months without responding will be considered non-responders. The two-sided 95% Clopper-Pearson confidence intervals will be calculated for the proportion of patients with responses.</description>

    <measure>IL-2 levels in serum</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 of therapy</time_frame>
    <description>Serum IL-2 levels will be compared with maximum grade of toxicity to determine whether our hypothesis of &quot;spillover&quot; of IL-2 in the circulation - i.e. some escaping the receptor gauntlet of IL-2 receptor bearing cells in pulmonary lymphatics.</description>

    <measure>Changes in biomarker levels</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in biomarker levels between pre- and post-treatment tissue samples will be assessed using paired t-tests (if the data are normally distributed) or Wilcoxon signed-rank tests (otherwise). Will graph the data using histograms, box plots and dot plots. With 20 patients, using a 2-sided 5% alpha, there would be 80% power to detect an effect size of 0.66 (where the effect size is the mean difference divided by the standard deviation of the differences).</description>
