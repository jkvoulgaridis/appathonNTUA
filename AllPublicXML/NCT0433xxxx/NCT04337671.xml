  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study investigated the effect of 12 weeks of aerobic training on sleep quality and
      aerobic fitness in patients with Pulmonary arterial hypertension(PAH).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Thirty male PAH patients were included in the study. They were randomized into two equal
      groups; Training group (A) and Control group(B). Right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP)
      measured using Doppler Echocardiography , Pittsburg sleep quality index (PSQI) questionnaire
      with the wrist worn actigraph used for the assessment of sleep disturbance, and
      Cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) measurements included maximal heart rate and VO2max
      .All were measured before and after the study period for both groups.The training was a
      moderate intensity aerobic training on a bicycle ergometer (corresponding to 60% to 70% of
      the maximal heart rate they reach during peak oxygen uptake in the initial exercise test) for
      30 to 45 min/day, 3 sessions/week for 12 weeks (36 sessions).
