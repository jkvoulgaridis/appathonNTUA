  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multicenter clinical study designed to facilitate the collection and
      evaluation of surgical workflow efficiency, patient pain and function outcome and adverse
      events data. This study might include Persona, Nexgen and Vanguard product families using the
      ROSA Total Knee Robotic system or conventional instrumentation. The primary objective is to
      evaluate the accuracy of implant alignment for ROSA Total Knee robotic instrumentation
      compared to conventional instrumentation.

    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to collect and compare clinical outcomes data using the
      commercially available ROSA Total Knee robotic instrumentation and conventional
      instrumentation. This will be achieved by assessing: planned vs actual component positioning,
      operative workflow efficiency, patient safety based on incidence and frequency of adverse
      events, clinical performance measured by overall pain and function, health-related quality of
      life data and radiographic parameters.

      The primary endpoint will report on the accuracy of implant alignment for ROSA Total Knee
      robotic instrumentation compared to conventional and the secondary endpoints will record
      surgery time points and evaluate the change of clinical outcomes scores between baseline and
      post operative follow up for performance and clinical benefits

    <measure>Evaluate the change of the Oxford Knee Score between baseline and each post-operative follow up</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Oxford Knee Score is a patient-reported form and consists of 12 questions on the influence of the knee (surgical side) on daily activities or pain. The patient scores each question (item) from 0 to 4 with 0 being the worst outcome and 4 being the best outcome. The scores are then summed to produce an overall score running from 0 (worst possible) to 48 (best outcome).</description>

    <measure>Evaluate Health related quality of life at baseline and each post-operative follow up</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>EQ-5D-5L health questionnaireEuroqol-5 dimensions by the EuroQol Group consists of a descriptive system of health-related quality of life by a questionnaire and a thermometer scale. The Questionnaire comprises five dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression) with each 5 levels: no problems (level 1), slight problems (level 2), moderate problems, (level 3) severe problems (level 4) and extreme problems (level 5). The digits for the five dimensions can be combined into a 5-digit number and may be converted to a score (maximum is 1), defined by the health state classification.The Thermometer generates a self rating of current health-related quality of life and has end points of 100 (best imaginable health state) at the top, and 0 (worst imaginable health state) at the bottom. It should be used with the 5-digit health state classification to build a composite picture of the respondent's health status.</description>

    <measure>Evaluate awareness of patients affected knee joint at baseline and each post operative follow up</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>FJS-12 is a patient-reported form and consist of 12 questions to assess awareness of patients affected knee joint in daily activities.all responses are summed (never, 0 points; almost never, 1 point; seldom, 2 points; sometimes, 3 points; mostly, 4 points) and then divided by the number of completed items. This mean value is subsequently multiplied by 25 to obtain a total score range of 0 top 100. A high score indicate a high degree of &quot;forgetting&quot; the artificial joint, i.e. a lower degree of awareness.</description>
