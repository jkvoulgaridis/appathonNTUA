  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 3-part Phase 1 dose-ranging study to evaluate the safety, tolerability,
      pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of single (Part 1) and multiple (Part 2) ascending
      doses of BCX9930 in healthy subjects and in subjects with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria
      (PNH; Part 3). Pharmacokinetics is an analysis of how the body handles the study drug BCX9930
      and pharmacodynamics is an analysis of the activity that the study drug BCX9930 may have in
      the body.

      Up to 6 sequential ascending dose cohorts are planned to be dosed in a sequential manner in
      Part 1 of the study. Eight subjects will be treated with a single dose of the study drug per
      dose cohort (6 subjects per cohort will receive BCX9930 and 2 subjects per cohort will
      receive matching placebo). Escalation to the next higher dose level will occur only after
      completion of a review of clinical safety and pharmacokinetics by the Sponsor and PI.

      Up to 7 ascending, multiple dose cohorts will be enrolled in a sequential manner in Part 2 of
      the study. In Cohorts 1 through 3, twelve subjects will be treated with either a 7-day or
      14-day course of study drug (10 subjects per cohort will receive BCX9930 and 2 subjects per
      cohort will receive matching placebo) administered orally. In Cohorts 4 through 7, twelve
      subjects will be treated with a 3-day course of study drug (10 subjects per cohort will
      receive BCX9930 and 2 subjects per cohort will receive matching placebo) administered orally.
      The daily dose may be split into 2 times daily (BID) or 3 times daily (TID) dosing for the
      multiple ascending dose part as needed. Escalation to the next higher dose level in Part 2
      will occur only after completion of a review of clinical safety and pharmacokinetics by the
      Sponsor and PI.

      Part 3 of the study consists of up to 2 sequential ascending multiple dose cohorts of up to 8
      subjects; each cohort may enroll up to 4 subjects with PNH who are na√Øve to both eculizumab
      and ravulizumab and up to 4 subjects with PNH who are currently being treated with either
      eculizumab or ravulizumab. In each cohort, subjects will receive one daily dose of BCX9930 on
      Days 1 to 14 and a higher daily dose on Days 15 to 28. Cohort 2 will start after independent
      data monitoring committee (DMC) review of Cohort 1 data and communication of their evaluation
      to Part 3 investigators. In South Africa, subjects that have clinical benefit from BCX9930
      will be allowed to continue dosing for up to 48 weeks.
