          8. Any chemotherapy, targeted therapy, major surgery, or irradiation must have been
             completed at least 4 weeks before enrollment (6 weeks for mitomycin C or nitrosurea);

             pain) must be completed 2 weeks before enrollment and subjects must have recovered
             from all toxicities incurred as a result of previous therapy except alopecia; use of
             targeted therapy or antibody therapy should have been completed for at least 5
             half-lives of the respective therapy before enrollment. Use of narcotic analgesics
             such as dihydrocodeine and medicinal herbs such as St. John's Wort, which may act as
             inhibitors/inducers of CYP2C8 and CYP3A4, must have been discontinued at least 2 weeks
             and 4 weeks respectively before enrollment

          9. Subjects of child bearing potential must practice an acceptable method of birth
             control as judged by the investigator

               -  Medically acceptable methods of birth control include the use of either a

                  intrauterine device, same sex partner or vasectomized partner or an oral
                  contraceptive taken continually within the past three months and which the
                  subject agrees to continue using during the study

               -  To adopt another birth control method, or a double-barrier method which consists
                  of a combination of any two of the following:

             diaphragm, cervical cap, condom, or a spermicide at least 2 months prior to study
             entry and must continue to use contraception for the duration of the study

             discretion, or who are surgically sterile (bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral
             oophorectomy, or hysterectomy has been performed on the subject)

         11. Male subjects enrolled in the trial cannot father a child and are advised to prevent
             passage of semen to their sexual partner during intercourse using acceptable methods
             as judged by the investigator for the duration of the study

          3. Presence of clinically symptomatic active CNS metastases, including leptomeningial
             involvement, requiring steroid or radiation therapy

          4. Pre-existing clinically significant peripheral neuropathy (Grade 2 or higher according
             to CTCAE, Version 5.0)

          5. Any other severe concurrent disease which in the judgment of the investigator would
             make the subject inappropriate for entry into this study or confound the study

          6. Presence of pleural/ascitic fluid which cannot be definitively treated prior to dosing
             and during the PK blood draws in each period (Period 1 and Period 2) and if there is
