    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate the potential benefits of Monopolar Capacitive Resistive
      Radio-frequency (448 kHz) on the sports performance of Paralympic swimmers.

    <textblock>
      A randomized, double-blind, crossover, controlled and sham-controlled clinical trial

      Evaluate the effectiveness of resistive capacitive diathermy as sports performance
      enhancement of Paralympic elite swimmers compared with a &quot;sham&quot; diathermy treatment and with
      a control group. The resistive capacitive diathermy is a medical device supplying low (448
      kHz) radiofrequency with a maximum output power of 200 W, used to improve physiological
      aspects and theoretically allowing improvement in swimming performance. The sham diathermy
      treatment is administered with the device set on &quot;on&quot; but not active (not supplying energy)
      and control group will not receive anything, randomly assigned to either resistive capacitive
      diathermy treatment (group 1), sham-treatment (group 2) or control (group 3) athletes are
      submitted to a twenty minutes session prior swimming performance. The main outcome measures
      are the simulate swimming time trial (seconds) to assess time completing the presented course
      and Borg Scale for perceived exertion. Outcome measures are administered at completing each
      time trial.
