  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), which causes abnormal pauses in breathing during sleep, is
      common in patients with vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD), and
      exacerbates the cognitive deficits seen in these conditions. OSA is typically treated with
      continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), which has been shown to improve cognition in VCI
      and slow cognitive decline in AD. Despite the need to identify OSA in patients with VCI/AD,
      these patients often do not undergo testing for OSA. One major barrier is that in-laboratory
      polysomnography (iPSG), the current standard for diagnosing OSA, is inconvenient for patients
      with VCI/AD who may be reliant on others for care or require familiar sleep environments. A
      convenient and cheaper alternative to iPSG is home sleep apnea testing (HSAT), which has been
      validated against iPSG to diagnose OSA and has proven feasible for use in VCI/AD. Our primary
      objective is to determine whether the use of HSAT is superior to iPSG in terms of the
      proportion of patients who complete sleep testing by 6 months post-randomization. We will
      also investigate cost-effectiveness, patient satisfaction, proportion of patients treated
      with CPAP, changes in cognition, mood, sleep-related and functional outcomes between HSAT and
      iPSG at 6 months.
