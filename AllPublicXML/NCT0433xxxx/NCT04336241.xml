  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      RP2-001-18 is a Phase 1, multicenter, open label, single agent dose escalation and
      combination treatment study of RP2 in adult subjects with advanced solid tumors, to determine
      the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D), as well as to evaluate
      preliminary efficacy.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      RP2 is a genetically modified herpes simplex type 1 virus (HSV-1) that expresses an
      anti-CTLA-4 antibody and is designed to directly destroy tumors and to generate an anti-tumor
      immune response. This is a Phase 1, multicenter, open label, dose escalation and expansion,
      first-in-human (FIH) clinical study to evaluate the safety and tolerability, biodistribution,
      shedding, and preliminary efficacy of RP2 alone and in combination with nivolumab in adult
      subjects with advanced solid tumors.

      The study will be conducted in two parts. The first part of the study is an open-label, dose
      escalation FIH Phase 1 study to assess the safety and tolerability of RP2 and to determine
      the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) to be used in the second part of the study. The second
      part of the study is an open label design to further investigate safety of RP2 in combination
      with nivolumab. It will also assess the biological activity of multiple doses of RP2 in
      combination with nivolumab.
