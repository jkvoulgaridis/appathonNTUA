    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the effect of high-fat diet on
      pharmacokinetics of healthy Chinese male adult subjects after oral administration of SHR2554
      tablets.

      The secondary objective of the study is to evaluate the safety of single dose of SHR2554
      orally in healthy subjects.
