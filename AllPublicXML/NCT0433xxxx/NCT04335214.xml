  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Advance care planning (ACP) enables individuals to define goals and preferences for future
      medical treatment and care, to discuss these goals and preferences with family and
      health-care providers, and to record and review these preferences if appropriate. Research
      has shown that most Western patients express the need about what ACP entails. Ethnicity
      creates an important cultural impact on how people look at life and death, so that there is
      an influence on making decisions about end-of-life care.

      The moroccan ethnic group is one of the largest visible non-Western minority groups in
      Western countries. Studies on how ACP is perceived among patients from moroccon origin are
      lacking. The objective of this study is exploring the knowledge, experiences, point of views,
      preferences, attitudes, facilitators and barriers concerning advance care planning of older
      people from moroccan origin in Belgium. Semi-structured interviews (in the native
      moroccan/arabic language) will be used.

    <description>This is a qualitative study. We've developed a semi-structured interview guide with the folowing questions: What do you know in relation to advance care planning? Have you yourself ever thought or looked up about your future healthcare? What do you think about advance care planning now for future? What are the advantages and disadvantages? In your opinion, what makes it easier or harder to talk about advance care planning?</description>
