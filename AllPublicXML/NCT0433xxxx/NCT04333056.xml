  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Since recently a second swept-source optical coherence tomography (ss-OCT) optical biometry
      device was launched (Anterion, Heidelberg Engineering). Aim of this study is a retrospective
      data collection of patients who were measured with both ss-OCT optical biometry devices and
      to assess the limits of agreement of the two devices.

      Retrospective comparison of two ss-OCT biometry devices concerning comparability of
      measurements of axial eye length, anterior chamber depth, lens thickness and keratometry.

      This a retrospective study including data acquired from patients that attended pre-surgical
      examination as it is the standard in the investigator's hospital.

      The IOL Master 700 (Carl Zeiss Meditec AG, Jena) and the Heidelberg Anterion (Heidelberg
      Engineering, Germany) are biometry devices that use swept-source optical coherence tomography
      technology in combination with a multidot-keratometer, that obtain two-dimensional images of
      ocular structures.

      The difference between the two devices resides in the wavelength of the infrared laser:
      1200-1400nm for the Anterion and 1050nm for the IOL Master 700.

      The SS-OCT devices provide a scan depth of 44mm and a resolution in tissue of 22 μm for the
      IOL Master 700 and of 14x16.5 mm and 30 μm for the Heidelberg Anterion.
