  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Researchers are doing this study to find out if the combination of the drugs axitinib and
      talazoparib is a safe and effective treatment for people with your previously treated
      advanced kidney cancer. Researchers will look for the highest dose of talazoparib that causes
      few or mild side effects when given in combination with a standard dose of axitinib.
