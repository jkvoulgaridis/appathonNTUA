  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to determine the safety and tolerability of PH100, a purified
      phlorotannins from a brown alga Ecklonia cava and the pharmacokinetics of its major compounds
      8,8'-bieckol, dieckol, and phlorofucofuroeckol A (PFF-A), after single, ascending, oral doses
      of PH100 Capsules (over-encapsulated tablets) in healthy adult volunteers.

  <detailed_description>

      This was a single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single ascending dose
      study in healthy volunteers in which subjects received either placebo or a 100 mg, 200 mg,
      400 mg, 800 mg, 1200 mg, or 1600 mg dose of PH100 capsules (over-encapsulated tablets
      containing purified Ecklonia cava phlorotannins as an active ingredient) in escalating dose
      groups (six cohorts). A total of 48 subjects were enrolled. Each cohort comprised eight
      subjects. Within each cohort, six subjects received PH100 and two subjects received placebo.
      The first cohort was dosed as a single group with PH100 (100 mg) or placebo. The subsequent
      five cohorts were dosed sequentially with 200 mg, 400 mg, 800 mg, 1200 mg, and 1600 mg of
      PH100 or placebo. Safety and pharmacokinetic data were collected and evaluated following each
      cohort. Dose escalation occurred after review of the safety and pharmacokinetic data from the
      preceding cohort(s). Doses were administered with subjects in the fasted condition.

    <description>Subjects were instructed to inform the study physician and/or research personnel of any AEs that occurred at any time during the study. Subjects were monitored for AEs from the beginning of confinement through the end-of-study visit (96 hours after dose administration). Reported or observed AEs were documented and followed to resolution.</description>
