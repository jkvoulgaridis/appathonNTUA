  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot study is to evaluate whether a decrease in endometrial thickness
      (compaction) prior to progesterone exposure (endogenous or exogenous) to the day before a
      single frozen embryo transfer has an impact on the clinical pregnancy rate with euploid
      embryos in exogenous hormone and modified natural thaw cycles. Information derived from this
      study may give insight on ways to improve pregnancy rates in cryo-thaw cycles.

      Methods:Study participation will not influence any element of IVF treatment and all
      participants will be receiving the standard of care at Boston IVF. Potential participants
      will be identified by a member of the research team, who will review the appointment log and
      medical records to ensure eligibility. Eligible participants interested in participating in
      the study will have a transvaginal ultrasound scheduled by the medical care team the day
      prior to the participants embryo transfer (T2). This ultrasound will be performed for
      research purposes. The eligible participant will provide verbal consent to a member of the
      research team prior to undergoing the ultrasound. Baseline demographic data will be obtained
      from the electronic medical record including: age, race, body mass index, partner status,
      height, weight, gravidity, and parity.

      Two groups of thaw cycles will be included: (1) exogenous hormone replacement thaw cycles and
      (2) modified natural thaw cycle. Both groups will follow the standard of care for cycle
      preparation at Boston IVF. Ultrasound measurements of the endometrial lining (T1) will only
      be used if they were within 1 day of the initiation of progesterone (group 1) or ovulation
      trigger injection (group 2). All transvaginal ultrasounds will be performed by the same
      ultrasonographer. Multiple endometrial lining measurements will be made per standard
      protocol, but only the optimal image and measurement will be saved. This image should include
      a longitudinal view of the endometrium and cervix. The images selected by the
      ultrasonographer will be reviewed independently by three different infertility physicians who
      will be blinded to the outcomes and participants. If 2 of the 3 physicians disapprove of the
      image, that select participant will be excluded from the final analysis. Measurements from
      the research ultrasound will be blinded from the participant and from the embryo transfer
      physician, and will not be used to make any clinical decisions. Both groups will have a
      comparison of the difference in endometrial thickness between T1 and T2.

      Sample Size Justification: Given the limited data on this specific topic, the study will be
      an observational pilot study. Given the available resources, the researchers will aim to have
      100 participants per cycle preparation group, for a total of 200 participants.

      Data Analysis: Descriptive data will be presented as the proportion, mean with standard
      deviation, or median with interquartile range. Comparisons will be made using the chi-square
      or Fisher's exact test for categorical variables and parametric or non-parametric tests for
      continuous variables based on data distribution. Logistic regression analysis will be
      performed for multivariate analysis. All data will be analyzed with SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute
      Inc., Cary, NC, USA). All tests will be two sided and a P value &lt; 0.05 will be required to
      confer significance.

    <arm_group_label>Exogenous hormone replacement thaw cycle</arm_group_label>
    <description>Participants in this group will follow Boston IVF's standard exogenous hormone replacement protocol. Participants will take Estrace 3mg twice daily by mouth for endometrial preparation. After 16-18 days of Estrace, endometrial thickness will be measured by transvaginal ultrasound but medication and ultrasounds will be continued until the endometrial lining is ≥ 7 mm. Once the final endometrial lining is ≥ 7 mm (T1), the doctor of record will start the participant the following day with intramuscular progesterone daily or intramuscular progesterone every 3 days with daily vaginal progesterone. Frozen embryo transfers would occur on the sixth day of progesterone.</description>

    <description>Participants in this group will follow Boston IVF's standard natural thaw cycle protocol. Participants will be coming for blood and transvaginal ultrasound monitoring around day 11 of the participants cycle. Once the participant has a final measurement of the endometrial lining ≥ 7 mm (T1), a 17mm ovarian follicle, and a progesterone &lt; 1.2 ng/mL, the doctor of record will schedule the patient to receive a trigger injection to induce ovulation followed by an embryo transfer 6-7 days later. Participants may be started on vaginal progesterone 4 days after the trigger injection for added supplementation per the doctor of record.</description>
