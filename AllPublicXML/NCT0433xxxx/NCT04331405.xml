      Study evaluates the safety and primary efficiency of systemic (i.v.) allogeneic human
      umbilical cord blood mononuclear cell infusions in patients with severe acute contusion
      spinal cord injury (ASIA A/B). 20 patients were included. Half of patients received cell
      therapy in addition to standard therapy, while the other half received standard therapy only.

      Present study was prospective randomized open-label clinical study, Phases I/IIa.
      Randomization was performed using envelope method (50 envelopes including Cell Therapy and
      Standard Therapy, 25 of each).

      20 patients with severe scute contusion spinal cord injury (cervical, thoracic and lumbar
      cone segments) were included into the study. Patients were divided into 2 groups: pilot group
      (n = 10) obtaining standard conservative therapy and 4 i.v. infusions of Human Allogeneic
      Umbilical Cord Blood Mononuclear Cells (hUCBMCs) (~ 300 M in 100 mL) and control group (n =
      10) obtaining standard conservative therapy only. Cell Therapy was initiated in patients
      within 3 days after SCI episode after primary surgical decompression and/or stabilization was
      performed. Patients inclusion decision depended on meeting the inclusion/exclusion criteria
      and informed consent signed.

      hUCBMC samples were prepared in the specialized laboratory and transported to the hospital
      immediately within 2 hours. Cells infusions were performed following 3 tests for biological
      compatibility and potential intolerance for each patient.

      All four infusion were performed during in-hospital treatment. Observational period reached 1
      year after SCI. All included patients were examined daily during in-hospital treatment
      following 4 times within observational period (1 year).

      All adverse events and potential complications were analyzed within 1 year after SCI using
      CTCAE v5.0 classification.

      Outcome parameters were analyzed at the end of observation and examined using standard
      statistical instruments.

    <measure>Neurological Deficit Change [ASIA scale]</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline at 1 year after SCI</time_frame>
    <description>Dynamics of neurological deficit level within 1 year after SCI was analyzed using ASIA clinical scale: ASIA A - total motor and sensory impairment; ASIA B - total motor impairment and partial sensory impairment below SCI level or pelvic sensitivity preserved; ASIA C - incomplete motor (at least half of key muscle strength less than 3 points) and sensory impairment; ASIA D - incomplete motor (at least half of key muscle strength more than 3 points) and sensory impairment; ASIA E - normal. Neurological deficit level was compared between pilot and control groups.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of Life [FIM scale]</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year after SCI</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of life level was assessed within 1 year after SCI using FIM (functional impairment) scale. FIM scale evaluates 5 groups of parameters including motor functions and self-service, mobility, motion level, pelvic functions and intellectual functions (e.g. communication and social activity). Each group includes several parameters assessed using point system (maximum 7 points for each parameter). A total sum of points is counted and compared between pilot and control groups.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Motor Deficit Change [Muscle Strength]</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline at 1 year after SCI</time_frame>
    <description>A dynamics of motor deficit was assessed using standard scale of key muscle strength. Two groups of parameters were considered including upper extremities strength (UEMS) and lower extremities strength (LEMS). Since patients with different SCI levels were included into the study (both cervical and thoracic/lumbar cone) LEMS parameter is more significant.
Upper key muscles: C5 - biceps, ะก6 - wrist extensors, C7 - triceps, C8 - fingers flexors, Th1 - V finger abductor. Lower key muscles: L2 - m. psoas, L3 - quadriceps, L4 - m. tibialis anterior, L5 - I toe extensor, S1 - gastrocnemius.
Both LEMS and cumulative (UEMS + LEMS) parameters were compared.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Independent Verticalization Ability</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year after SCI</time_frame>
    <description>Patients ability to verticalize independently and mobility level were analyzed. First is determined by patient's ability to get up and stand more than 10 seconds without assistance. Second is determined by patient's ability to move without assistance depending on the distance: grade 1 - less than 10 m; grade 2 - less than 50 m; grade 3 - less than 100 m' grade 4 - 100 - 500 m; grade 5 - more than 500 m.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Lower Extremities Spasticity Level [Modified Asworth scale]</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year after SCI</time_frame>
    <description>Spasticity level of lower extremities muscles was assessed using modified Ashworth scale. Grade 0 - no spasticity. Grade 1 - slight elevation of muscle tone, minimal tension at the end of movement amplitude during flexion and extension; Grade 1+ - slight elevation of muscle tone, minimal tension at least at half of movement amplitude. Grade 2 - moderate elevation of muscle tone during whole movement, but passive movements are not obstructed. Grade 3 - significant elevation of muscle tone, passive movements are partially obstructed. Grade 4 - rigid limb position in flexion or extension (contracture).</description>

    <measure>Feeling of Bladder Filling</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year after SCI</time_frame>
    <description>Frequency of pelvic function disorders was assessed. Analysis included 2 parameters: (i) feeling of bladder filling and (ii) urinary inconsistence. First parameter is determined by patient's subjective feeling of bladder filling correlating to ultrasound confirmation of full bladder.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Urinary Inconsistence</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year after SCI</time_frame>
    <description>Frequency of pelvic function disorders was assessed. Analysis included 2 parameters: (i) feeling of bladder filling and (ii) urinary inconsistence. Second parameter is determined by patient's ability for passive self-urination without application of any devices (e.g. urinary catheters, medical condoms or cystostomy).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Spinal Cord Conductivity [Electrophysiological assessment]</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year after SCI</time_frame>
    <description>Spinal cord conductive function restoration was assessed using electrophysiological examination. Electroneuromyography supplemented with transcranial magnetic stimulation was performed to assess the level of signal conduction through the injured spinal cord. Significant diversity of SCI levels and baseline neurological deficit resulted in low significance of individual ENMG parameters comparison. Therefore only the parameters of conduction arrest was considered including (i) No conduction arrest (total or subtotal preservation of the overlay signal), (ii) Partial conduction arrest (decreased overlay signal) and (iii) Total conduction arrest (no overlay signal).</description>
