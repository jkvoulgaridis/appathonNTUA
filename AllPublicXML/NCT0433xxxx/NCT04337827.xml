  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate how effective rituximab and acalabrutinib are when
      given as a combination treatment for newly diagnosed B cell post transplant
      lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD). Currently there is no approved therapy for PTLD.
      Rituximab alone is commonly used and works in some cases, but not others. In addition,
      participants with PTLD have trouble tolerating therapies with large amounts of side effects
      due to their health conditions and medications for their transplant. Due to these reasons the
      study team is looking for a new treatment with novel targeted agents in order to improve
      outcomes and to minimize toxicity.

      Based on emerging data of clinical efficacy of acalabrutinib in B cell malignancies and an
      unmet need for novel therapies in PTLD, this study will investigate the use of rituximab and
      acalabrutinib in participants with newly diagnosed B cell PTLD.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-randomized phase II study of acalabrutinib plus rituximab in newly diagnosed
      B-cell PTLD in participants with both solid organ transplant (SOT) and Bone marrow transplant
      (BMT).

      Acalabrutinib is an inhibitor of Bruton Tyrosine Kinase (BTK). BTK is important in B cells
      and plays a role in the development of PTLD. Acalabrutinib is approved in the US for the
      treatment of adult participants with indolent lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma, and is being
      evaluated to treat other lymphomas.

      Rituximab has been approved for treatment of B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). While not
      approved for PTLD, it has become the mainstay of treatment.

      The primary objective of this study is to determine the overall response rate to combination
      treatment with rituximab and acalabrutinib in patients with PTLD.

      The secondary objectives of this study is to determine response rates, survival, failure
      rates, and safety elements in participants with PTLD treated with combination rituximab and
      acalabrutinib.

             rituximab (including active product or excipient components).

             disease).

          -  Uncontrolled AIHA (autoimmune hemolytic anemia) or ITP (idiopathic thrombocytopenic

             for enrollment to this study.

          -  History of significant cerebrovascular disease or event, including stroke or
             intracranial hemorrhage, within 6 months before the first dose of study drug.

          -  Major surgical procedure within 28 days of first dose of study drug. Note: If a
             subject had major surgery, they must have recovered adequately from any toxicity
             and/or complications from the intervention before the first dose of study drug.

          -  Hepatitis B or C serologic status: subjects who are hepatitis B core antibody
             (anti-HBc) positive and who are surface antigen negative will need to have a negative
             polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Those who are hepatitis B surface antigen (HbsAg)
             positive or hepatitis B PCR positive will be excluded. Subjects who are hepatitis C
             antibody positive will need to have a negative PCR result. Those who are hepatitis C
             PCR positive will be excluded.

          -  History of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML)

          -  Breastfeeding or pregnant. Pregnant or breastfeeding women are excluded from this
             study because it is unknown how acalabrutinib and rituximab can affect the fetus or
             infant. Rituximab can cross the placenta and is found in breast milk. Acalabrutinib
             has been found in the breast milk of animals and there is not significant data
             regarding its effect during pregnancy.

          -  Vaccination with live virus vaccines is not allowed within 4 weeks of study treatment
             of or during treatment.
