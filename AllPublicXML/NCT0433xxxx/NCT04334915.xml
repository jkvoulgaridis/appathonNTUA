    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the effects of cenicriviroc mesylate (CVC) on arterial inflammation
      in people living with HIV.

      Participants will be randomized to either the CVC arm (Arm A) or placebo for CVC arm (Arm B).
      CVC 150 mg or placebo for CVC will be added to the participants' pre-existing antiretroviral
      (ARV) regimens once a day for at least 24 weeks. For participants who are on an efavirenz
      (EFV)-based regimen, dosing will be 300 mg once a day.

      Study participants will remain on study treatment for approximately 24 weeks. Study visits
      may include blood collection, physical examinations, and FDG-PET/CT imaging.

          -  HIV-1 infection, documented by any licensed rapid HIV test or HIV enzyme or
             chemiluminescence immunoassay (E/CIA) test kit at any time prior to study entry and
             confirmed by a licensed Western blot or a second antibody test by a method other than
             the initial rapid HIV and/or E/CIA, or by HIV-1 antigen, plasma HIV-1 RNA viral load
             OR two HIV-1 RNA &gt;1,000 copies/mL.

               -  NOTE: The term &quot;licensed&quot; refers to a US Food and Drug Administration

               -  WHO (World Health Organization) and CDC (Centers for Disease Control and
                  Prevention) guidelines mandate that confirmation of the initial test result must
                  use a test that is different from the one used for the initial assessment. A
                  reactive initial rapid test should be confirmed by either another type of rapid
                  assay or an E/CIA that is based on a different antigen preparation and/or
