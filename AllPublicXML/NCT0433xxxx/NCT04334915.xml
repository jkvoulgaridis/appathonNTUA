    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the effects of cenicriviroc mesylate (CVC) on arterial inflammation
      in people living with HIV.

      Participants will be randomized to either the CVC arm (Arm A) or placebo for CVC arm (Arm B).
      CVC 150 mg or placebo for CVC will be added to the participants' pre-existing antiretroviral
      (ARV) regimens once a day for at least 24 weeks. For participants who are on an efavirenz
      (EFV)-based regimen, dosing will be 300 mg once a day.

      Study participants will remain on study treatment for approximately 24 weeks. Study visits
      may include blood collection, physical examinations, and FDG-PET/CT imaging.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  HIV-1 infection, documented by any licensed rapid HIV test or HIV enzyme or
             chemiluminescence immunoassay (E/CIA) test kit at any time prior to study entry and
             confirmed by a licensed Western blot or a second antibody test by a method other than
             the initial rapid HIV and/or E/CIA, or by HIV-1 antigen, plasma HIV-1 RNA viral load
             OR two HIV-1 RNA &gt;1,000 copies/mL.

               -  NOTE: The term &quot;licensed&quot; refers to a US Food and Drug Administration
                  (FDA)-approved kit, which is required for all investigational new drug (IND)

               -  WHO (World Health Organization) and CDC (Centers for Disease Control and
                  Prevention) guidelines mandate that confirmation of the initial test result must
                  use a test that is different from the one used for the initial assessment. A
                  reactive initial rapid test should be confirmed by either another type of rapid
                  assay or an E/CIA that is based on a different antigen preparation and/or
                  different test principle (e.g., indirect versus competitive), or a Western blot
                  or a plasma HIV-1 RNA viral load.

               -  NOTE A: Stable is defined as no within-class changes in ART regimen within 12
                  weeks prior to study entry and no between-class changes for 24 weeks prior to
                  study entry.

               -  NOTE B: Unboosted ART is defined as an ART regimen that does not include the

             quantification limit of 75 copies/mL or lower performed by any laboratory that has a
             Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) certification or its equivalent
             within 90 days prior to study entry.

          -  All HIV-1 RNA levels within 48 weeks prior to study entry below the limit of
             quantification (e.g., &lt;20, &lt;40, &lt;50, or &lt;75 copies/mL, depending on the assay) using
             an FDA-approved assay with a quantification limit of 75 copies/mL or lower performed
             by any laboratory that has a CLIA certification or its equivalent.

               -  NOTE A: Up to two HIV-1 RNA determinations that are between the assay
                  quantification limit and 500 copies/mL (i.e., &quot;blips&quot;) are allowed as long as the
                  preceding and subsequent determinations are below the level of quantification.
