    <textblock>
      Surgical treatment of peri-implantitis can be regenerative or resective, depending on defect
      configuration. The aim of resective therapy of peri-implantitis is to reduce the severity of
      soft tissue inflammation and stabilize crestal bone levels whilst reducing probing
      depths.This will be a multicenter randomized controlled trial in which two resective
      peri-implantitis protocols will be assessed. The aim of this trial is to compare a resective
      approach in the surgical treatment of peri-implantitis (decontamination performed with
      titanium brushes and sterile saline) with a resective approach combined with implantoplasty.

      The aim of the present multicenter randomized controlled trial is to compare a resective
      approach in the surgical treatment of peri-implantitis (decontamination performed with
      titanium brushes and sterile saline) with a resective approach combined with implantoplasty.

      Primary outcome:

      Probing depth (PD) dicrease is defined as the primary pitcome of this study.

      Research Hypothesis Based upon previous evidence, our research hypothesis is that the test
      group (implantoplasty + resective approach) will perform better than the control group
      (resective surgery alone), namely the alternative hypothesis, in terms of defect resolution
      (probing depth decrease, absence of bleeding and/or suppuration and absence of progressive
      bone loss), 18 months after the surgical treatment.

      Material and methods The present study has a prospective, multicenter, randomized controlled
      clinical trial design in which subjects will be consecutively enrolled according to defined
      inclusion and exclusion criteria. Two centers participating in this study are: Department of
      Periodontics and Oral Medicine, School of Dental Medicine, University of Belgrade and
      Department of Periodontology and Protshodontics, Eastman Dental Hospital, Policlinico Umberto
      I, Rome, Italy.

      28 patients diagnosed with severe peri-implantitis and requiring surgical treatment of
      peri-implantitis will be included in this study.

      14 patients with peri-implantitis will be treated in each center. The subjects willing to
      participate in the study will be given a detailed description of the procedure and follow-up
      appointments, and will sign a written informed consent form. CONSORT (Consolidated Standards
      of Reporting Trials) guidelines for clinical trials will be followed.

      Treatment groups

      The patients will be randomly divided into two groups:

        -  Test group: resective surgery with bone recontouring + implantoplasty

        -  Control group: resective surgery with bone recontouring+ decontamination protocol (Ti
           brush and sterile saline) The randomization- and therefore the group assignment of the
           patient- will be disclosed after flap reflection. The randomization sequence will be
           generated by a computer program.

      Blinding: due to the nature of the implantoplasty procedure, it is not possible to blind the
      outcome assessors because the plastied surface is easily recognizable compared to a rough,
      non-plastied surface.

      Treatment protocol:

        -  Consent followed by clinical examination, evaluation of inclusion and exclusion
           criteria.

        -  If the patient is included, diagnosis, radiographic and photographic documentation
           collection. Diagnosis will be assigned after a complete periodontal chart of all teeth
           and implants is performed. This will be executed once the prosthetic restoration is
           removed. Once the clinical visit is concluded the prosthesis will be replaced.

        -  Baseline examination with clinical parameters' recording. Clinical parameters will be
           recorded by a single examiner, different from the surgeon.

        -  Non-surgical treatment of peri-implantitis by means of professional cleaning of teeth
           and implants, scaling and root planing, and CHX mouth rinse, to decrease inflammation.

        -  Collection of clinical parameters and evaluation of the study defect. Initially the
           defect will be evaluated pre-surgically. If the surgical inspection of the defect
           reveals that it does not have the desired characteristics (Class II, eventually Class
           IIIa and Class IIIb), the defect will be treated according to a regenerative surgical
           protocol, (the patient will therefore be excluded from the study and exempted from all
           future study procedures). In alternative, if deemed hopeless the implant may also be
           removed.

        -  Removal of prosthesis and placement of healing abutments, to be kept after the surgical
           procedure unless the implant is visible, and it is esthetically mandatory to deliver the
           prosthesis.

        -  Surgical procedure:

      Following local anesthesia application, intrasulcular incisions will be performed, and
      full-thickness flaps shall be reflected on the buccal and lingual aspects of the affected
      implants. After the exposure of the implants, thorough degranulation of the defect by means
      of titanium and carbon curettes will be performed, followed by sterile saline rinses.

      Test group implants will be treated by means of implantoplasty. Exposed threads of the
      implant will be removed by the protocol proposed by Ramel et al: diamond burs (106-, 40-,
      15-mm) followed by Arkansas stone. Copious sterile saline irrigation will follow. Following
      the implantoplasty procedure, CHX gel 0.2% will be applied for 2 minutes.

      In the control group, a decontamination protocol containing mechanical debridement with
      Ti-brush, followed by sterile saline solution on cotton pellets and CHX gel 0.2% for 2
      minutes, followed by thorough rinsing with saline will be applied.

      Think about local antimicrobial application, there is a product called GelCide, we started
      using it here at the Department The suprabony component in both groups will be removed and
      bone recontouring will be performed, when indicated. Mucoperiosteal flaps will be adjusted
      and closed with single interrupted sutures. Prosthetic constructions will be reconnected.
      Patients will be prescribed systemic antibiotic (Augmentin 1 g twice per day) for 1 week and
      0.2% CHX rinse, twice daily, for 14 d following surgery. If the patient is allergic to
      penicillins, clindamycin 300 mg TID will be used instead). The duration of the surgery (time
      in minutes) will also be recorded.

      Clinical measurements:

      At baseline, as well as 6, and 12, and 18 months following the surgical treatment, following
      data will be acquired:

        1. Clinical attachment level (CAL), distance in millimeters from:

           In the case of bone-level implants implant-abutment connection to the deepest probing
           point (mm). In the case of tissue level implants, CAL will be measured as the distance
           between the smooth-rough surface interface to the deepest probing point (mm)

        2. Probing depth (PD), measured as distance from the mucosal margin to the bottom of the
           probeable pocket (mm).

        3. Bleeding on probing (BOP), evaluated as present if bleeding was evident within 30 s
           after probing, or absent, if no bleeding was noticed with- in 30 s after probing.
           Profuse bleeding will be recorded based upon recent evidence that many implant have
           pinpoint bleeding even if healthy, which could possibly be due to tissue trauma.

        4. Plaque index by Silness and Loe.

        5. Mucosal recession on buccal aspect of the implant; bone level implants: distance from
           the implant platform to the gingival margin; Tissue level implants: distance between the
           smooth-rough surface interface to the gingival margin (mm).

        6. Keratinized tissue width (KTW), as the distance from mucosal margin to the mucogingival
           line at the buccal and lingual aspect of each implant, 4 sites per implant (mm).

        7. Keratinized tissue thickness (KTT). This will be measured clinically, with an endodontic
           file with silicon disc stop and a digital caliper. The measurement will be conducted in
           the mesial line angle (m), distal line angle (d) and mid-buccal (b), in mm.

      Radiographic analysis: radiographs will be conducted at baseline/ pre-surgical, 6 months, 12
      months, 18 months, 24 months. Intraoral radiographs will be performed with a standardized
      technique to ensure that the periapicals are comparable for each patient between consecutive
      time-points.

      Photographic documentation: photographs will be conducted at baseline/ pre-surgical, 3
      months, 6 months, 12 months, 18 months, 24 months.

      Expected outcomes - Success criteria The resolution of peri-implant disease, treatment
      success, will be defined as probing pocket depth ≤5 mm, absence of bleeding and/or
      suppuration on probing, and no additional bone loss (when comparing the 2 week radiograph and
      the 6-, 12- and 18-month radiograph).

      The success criteria proposed by Buser et al. and Cochran et al. will be followed as well at
      each recall after the treatment. An implant will be considered successful if shows:

      i. absence of clinically detectable mobility ii. absence of pain or any other subjective
      sensation iii. absence of recurrent peri-implant infection iv. absence of continuous
      peri-implant radiolucency.
