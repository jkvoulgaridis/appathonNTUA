      The Vividness of Visual Imagery Questionnaire-2 (VMIQ-2) is originally developed in English
      to determine the vividness of visual imagery. The purpose of this study is to translate and
      cross-culturally adapt the VMIQ instrument into Turkish and investigate its psychometric
      properties.

      The Vividness of Visual Imagery Questionnaire-2 (VMIQ-2) was originally developed in English
      to determine the vividness of visual imagery. The purpose of this study is to translate and
      cross-culturally adapt the VMIQ-2 instrument into Turkish and investigate its psychometric
      properties. One hundred fifty healthy participants will be included. For cross-cultural
      adaptation, two bi-lingual translators will use the back-translation procedure. Within a
      5-to-7-day period after the first assessment, the participants will complete the Turkish
      version of VMIQ (VMIQ-2-T) to evaluate test-retest reliability. Cronbach's alpha (α) will use
      to assess internal consistency. The correlation with the Turkish version of Kinesthetic and
      Visual Imagery Questionnaire-20 will be determined to check the validity.

    <description>This questionnaire is composed of 12 items - walking, running, kicking a stone, bending down to pick up a coin, running up stairs, jumping sideways, throwing a stone into water, kicking a ball in the air, running downhill, riding a bike, swinging on a rope, and jumping off a high wall. It requires individuals to imagine themselves performing the 12 items, from three imagery perspectives: internal visual imagery (a first-person perspective), external visual imagery (a third-person perspective), and kinesthetic imagery (feeling the movement).</description>
