      The purpose of the study is to collect data on the NobleStitch EL suture mediated closure
      system to safely and effectively close a Patent Foramen Ovale (PFO) to reduce the risk of
      recurrent Ischemic Stroke. The data collected will be compared to PFO closure using the FDA
      approved Amplatzer Occluder device.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Provision of signed and dated informed consent form

             duration of the study

          -  Male or female ages 18 - 60 years old

          -  A PFO and a Cryptogenic Stroke verified by a neurologist

          -  Stroke is defined as an acute focal neurological deficit, presumed to be due to focal
             ischemia, and either:

               -  Symptoms persisting â‰¥24 hours, or

               -  Symptoms persisting &lt;24 hours with Magnetic Resonance or CT findings of a new,
