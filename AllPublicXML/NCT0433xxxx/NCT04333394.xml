  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To study the effects of probiotic supplement in children with Attention-deficit hyperactivity
      disorder (ADHD),40 patients will be randomly allocated to two groups of intervention and
      placebo. The intervention and the placebo group will be prescribed with 1 capsule of
      probiotics and placebo for 8 weeks, respectively. Treatment efficacy will be assessed via
      administrating the Conners's rating
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Both probiotics and placebo groups will receive medication with Ritalin in a dose-dependent
      manner, starting at the onset of the study and simultaneous with probiotic supplementation.
      Children weighed 30 Kg or less receive 0.3 mg/kg of Ritalin in 3 separate intervals and after
      four weeks the dosage will increase to 0.5mg/kg. Those who weighed more than 30 kg receive
      0.5 mg/kg with the same pattern that reaches the highest point of 0.7 mg/kg by week four.
      Each dosage will be administrated trice a day with breakfast, lunch, and dinner. In the
      middle of the study patients who consumes less than 80% of their supplements will be omitted
      from the study.

    <intervention_model_description>The present study will be conducted as a phase 3, randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial on 40 attention deficit hyperactivity disorder patients allocated in 2 parallel groups each consisted of 20 patients who will receive Probiotic or placebo. From the beginning of the study, A and B codes are available to researchers to recruit the patients using ten 4-Block Randomization.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>Both patients and researchers won't be aware of the treatments patients receiving in this study (unaware of the quiddity of A and B capsules), so the study has a double-blind design. Only one of the staff of the company that supplied the Probiotic supplement is aware of the type of assigned intervention for each patient. After collecting the data, he will unseal the codes for researchers, the statistical analyst, participants and those who prepare the manuscript.</masking_description>
