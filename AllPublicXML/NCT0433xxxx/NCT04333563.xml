  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Strategies to prevent lung injury, facilitate lung development, and to support the preterm
      infant's capacity to breathe are decisive. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is the
      gold standard in non-invasive breathing support in preterm infants with a positive pressure
      that keeps the alveoli slightly inflated during expiration. Non-invasive neurally adjusted
      ventilator assist (NIV NAVA) is a novel method of breathing support and uses the electrical
      activity from the diaphragm to trigger the ventilator and synchronize with the breathing
      cycle. During NIV NAVA the preterm infant controls the onset of the inspiration, the
      respiratory rate, inspiratory time and peak pressure. This method has the potential to
      improve the positive pressure transmission to the infant's lower airways, accurate
      synchronization with the breathing pattern and be a comfortable breathing support system for
      the preterm infant.

      The investigators will compare the effect on breathing effort in preterm infants during
      continuous positive airway pressure and non-invasive neurally adjusted ventilatory assist
      measured by electrical activity in the diaphragm, respiratory vital signs, systematic
      clinical scoring of breathing effort and comfort, and parent reported outcomes.

      This is a randomized cross-over study with AB/BA sequences. The infants will receive both
      interventions in 4 hours intervals, and a 30 min wash out period to change the breathing
      support and stabilization at the beginning of both interventions. Initially positive end
      expiratory pressure are set to 5 cm H2O and can be adjusted up to 7 cm H2O if needed decided
      by the medical team for both interventions. The neurally adjusted level will be set to obtain
      average Edi peak &lt; 15 microvolt. Back-up setting and apnea time in the ventilator assist
      intervention (NIV NAVA) will be individualized according to clinical parameters in each
      preterm infant.
