  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of ultrasound-guided injection of
      platelet-derived lyophilized growth factors in treatment of subacromial impingement.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A new patented product named lyophilized Growth Factors has been developed. It is a novel
      advanced and refined form of conventional platelet-rich plasma. Effectiveness of
      intra-articular lyophilized Growth Factors injection has been studied in thirty patients with
      symptomatic primary knee osteoarthritis and has shown encouraging results regarding
      improvement of pain, stiffness and function in addition to decreasing knee effusion.

      The lack of good quality evidence to support the efficacy of injecting platelet-derived
      lyophilized growth factors in treatment of subacromial impingement highlights the need for
      thorough evaluation of the outcome of this novel therapeutic option in patients with
      subacromial impingement.

    <description>An index measuring the impact of shoulder pathology in terms of pain and disability.
Total pain score: / 50 x 100 = % Total disability score: / 80 x 100 = % Total Spadi score: / 130 x 100 = % (Note: If a person does not answer all questions divide by the total possible score, eg. if 1 question missed divide by 120) The means of the two subscales are averaged to produce a total score ranging from 0 (best) to 100 (worst).
A higher score indicates a worse outcome.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Clinically:

               1. Anterolateral shoulder and/or lateral upper arm pain.

               2. Painful arc of motion between 70° and 120°.

               3. Positive impingement sign (Neer's test or Hawkins-Kennedy test).

          -  Ultrasonographically:

        The elicitation of a transient arc of pain during shoulder abduction which coincides with
        passage of the supraspinatus insertion beneath the coraco-acromial arch.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of shoulder surgery, fracture, dislocation or subluxation.

          -  Patients with full-thickness rotator cuff tear, weakness on arm elevation, or positive
             &quot;drop arm sign&quot;.

          -  Patients who have been diagnosed with a frozen shoulder or degenerative arthropathy of
             the glenohumeral joint.

          -  Patients with disorders of the cervical spine or upper extremity that have a
             significant impact on the shoulder

          -  Patients with diabetes mellitus, rheumatoid arthritis, hypothyroidism or other painful
             or function limiting disorders of the shoulder.

          -  Significant cardiovascular, renal or hepatic disease.

          -  Active infection in the area to be treated.
