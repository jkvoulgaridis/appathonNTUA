  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal of this study is to assess how successfully SHARE-S can be implemented in a
      clinical setting that already consistently provides survivorship care planning documents to
      improve guideline concordant survivorship care.

      Primary Objectives:

      â€¢ To evaluate how successfully SHARE-S can be implemented into clinical care as characterized
      by rates of enrollment. Investigators hypothesize &gt;30% of patients e-referred to SHARE-S will
      enroll.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To assess additional implementation outcomes that evaluate preliminary implementation
           success (i.e., further assessment of adoption, acceptability, appropriateness, further
           assessment of feasibility, and fidelity).

        -  To describe service outcome variability to inform future studies. Investigators will
           assess service outcomes relevant to Commission on Cancer requirements by reporting
           annual estimates for: (1) the estimated number of patients impacted by SHARE-S; (2) the
           cancer sites impacted by SHARE-S; and the (3) resources/processes utilized to enhance
           each of the chosen services if barriers were encountered. We will also assess safety and
           perceived patient-centeredness of care.

        -  To describe patient health outcome variability to inform future studies (i.e., social
           role, physical functioning, anxiety, depression, fatigue, sleep disturbance, pain,
           cancer-specific quality of life, health behaviors, patient autonomy, self-efficacy for
           managing cancer, engagement with the survivorship care plan document, and satisfaction
           with care).

        -  To evaluate the Implementation Program we will assess key milestones and processes for
           this pilot study of the Implementation Stage measured at the clinic level.

        -  To qualitatively assess implementation barriers and facilitators using semi-structured
           interviews that will be audio-recorded.

        -  To examine how study results vary by cancer type.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adults â‰¥18 years of age

          -  Visit scheduled in a cancer survivorship clinic

          -  Have a texting enabled telephone

          -  Cognitively able to complete study procedures as judged by the study team

          -  Able to understand, read and write English

        Children under the age of 18 with cancer will be excluded due to the potentially different
        self-management support intervention needs of this population that will likely include
        parental involvement. Results from this research may inform future studies in children with
        cancer under 18 who should be researched separately.
