  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Resistant hypertension is defined as blood pressure that remains above goal despite
      concurrent use of three antihypertensive agents of different classes including diuretics.
      Patients with resistant hypertension has at least 1.5-fold higher cardiovascular risk than
      those with non-resistant hypertension. Therefore, controlling blood pressure is crucial in
      patients with resistant hypertension.

      It has been unclear which antihypertensive agent should be added in patients who cannot reach
      target blood pressure despite use of three antihypertensive agents. There have been three
      randomized clinical trials that proved the efficacy of spironolactone in resistant
      hypertension, but they were small sized, comparison study to placebo. Recently published
      PATHWAY-2 study which compared the efficacy of spironolactone with placebo, doxazosin, and
      bisoprolol showed superiority of spironolactone in blood pressure lowering in patients with
      resistant hypertension. Thus, revised ACC/AHA and ESC/ESH guideline for arterial hypertension
      recommended spironolactone as the fourth agent for resistant hypertension. However, in real
      world, adherence to spironolactone may not be adequate because of adverse effect such as
      gynecomastia, hyperkalemia, and so on.

      Recently, sub-study of PATHWAY-2 revealed that amiloride changes systolic blood pressure by
      -22.2 mmHg (95% CI, -24.7 to -19.7) which is comparable with the effect of spironolactone
      (-21.8 mmHg; 95% CI, -24.2 to -19.3). However, it was not randomized clinical trial to
      compare the effect between spironolactone and amiloride in patients with resistant
      hypertension.

      This study aims to compare the effect of spironolactone and amiloride on home blood pressure
      in resistant hypertensive patients and to compare the rate of target blood pressure
      achievement between spironolactone and amiloride in resistant hypertensive patients.

      The subjects with office SBP of 140-180 mmHg with 3 antihypertensive medications of different
      classes including thiazide or thiazide-like diuretics and daytime average daytime SBP of ≥
      135 mmHg are enrolled in the 4-week run-in period. During run-in period, subjects will
      receive sevikar HCT (5/20/12.5 mg). After a 4-week run-in period, subjects who have
      uncontrolled average home SBP, defined as average of &gt;135 mmHg, will be randomized to either
      spironolactone or amiloride. 118 subjects will be randomly assigned to one of the two
      treatment groups. Subjects randomly assigned to one of the two treatment groups will receive
      12.5 mg of spironolactone and the other group will receive 5 mg of amiloride. Subjects who
      did not reach the target blood pressure after 4 weeks of treatment should be increased to 25
      mg of spironolactone or 10 mg of amiloride. After 12 weeks of treatment, study will be end.
