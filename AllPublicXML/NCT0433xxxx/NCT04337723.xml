  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this project is to assess the fidelity and sustainability of in improving
      provider performance with Ankle Brachial Index (ABI) assessment and ulcer staging with the
      would ischemia foot infection (WIfI) tool for new patients with lower extremity ulcers due to
      peripheral artery disease (PAD) and diabetes mellitus (DM) at RHCs in the telemedicine
      network through a rural provider education program that is aligned with preexisting
      continuing medical education activities.

    <description>This outcome is a binary (yes/no) outcome of whether a clinic is performing ABI and WIfI testing 6 months after the original training and implementation assistance</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>ABI/WIFI adaption and fidelity</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>This outcome is a qualitative outcome. The outcome is based on the use a modified Program Assessment Fidelity Tool developed by Cummins. This tool tracks programmatic and evaluative changes over time. The tool asks respondents to determine the What, How, To Whom, Where, and Who program changes occur with definitions for each category. The tool classifies changes by cause.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>ABI/WIFI sustainability</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>To assess sustainability, we will collect the number of patients seen with lower extremity ulcers over a one-year period and the number of patients with ABI measurement performed. We will review charts for the number of patients with WIfI classification documentation at the clinical encounter.</description>

    <description>The initial ABI training workshop will be coordinated by the non-physician clinic staff champion, and all non-provider clinic staff will be asked to participate. The PI and a research assistant will conduct a 1.5-hour telemedicine training session instructing clinical staff in ABI measurement and WIfI and scoring, using the clinical scoring sheet. Following didactic teaching, participants will perform ABI tests under the guidance of the PI/research assistant and with the support of other participants. During each part of the workshop, specific attention will be directed to pitfalls and technical errors of the test. A pre-post assessment will be used to ensure comprehension of key concepts and performance of the ABI and WIfI tools.</description>
