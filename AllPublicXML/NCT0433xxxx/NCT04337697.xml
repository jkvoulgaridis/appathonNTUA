  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The NSR-DEV study is a longitudinal cohort study of around 280 Neonatal Seizure Registry
      participants that aims to evaluate childhood outcomes after acute symptomatic neonatal
      seizures, as well as examine risk factors for developmental disabilities and whether these
      are modified by parent well-being.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Neonatal seizures due to brain injury (acute symptomatic seizures) are associated with high
      risk of neurodevelopmental disability in infancy. Although prognosis in early childhood is a
      critical question for parents and providers, outcomes beyond infancy are largely unknown.
      Further, parents of infants with neonatal seizures are at risk for mental health disorders,
      which can undermine their ability to care for a child with medical complexity and may
      contribute to impaired child development.

      The NSR-DEV study is a longitudinal cohort study of around 280 Neonatal Seizure Registry
      participants enrolled at one of nine sites across the USA. Participants will be evaluated
      using developmental questionnaires and in-person neurodevelopmental testing. Parent
      well-being will be assessed at each time point.

    <time_frame>At age 5.5 years during in-person study visit</time_frame>
    <description>The WPPSI-IV is an in-person assessment administered by a psychologist or psychometrician that will be used to measure neurocognitive ability. Full Scale IQ (FSIQ) will be generated for each participant from the following subtests: Verbal Comprehension Index (VCI), Visual Spatial Index (VSI), Fluid Reasoning Index (FRI), Working Memory Index (WMI), Processing Speed Index (PSI), Receptive Vocabulary and Picture Naming.</description>

    <time_frame>At enrollment study visit and annual visits when the child is age 3, 4, 5.5, 7, and 8</time_frame>
    <description>The Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales Parent Form measures adaptive behavior and intellectual and developmental function. Adaptive behavior is predictive of functional performance in school and is linked to both cognitive and executive function. Scores for each participant at each timepoint are generated based on parent reports in the following categories: Communication, Daily Living Skills, Socialization, Motor Skills, Adaptive Behavior Composite (ABC). We will look at the change in score over time for each participant during the study period after the Vineland-3 is administered at each timepoint.</description>
