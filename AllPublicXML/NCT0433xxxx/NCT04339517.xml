  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For early breast cancer, local surgery followed by breast radiation is a standard local
      treatment. It has been found that the original primary tumor site, the lumpectomy site, is
      the commonest location of local relapse. The researchers think that such relapse occurs
      because of persistent tumor cells (PTCs) at the lumpectomy site even when conventional
      pathology reports indicate complete resection with clear margins. The researchers propose to
      analyze the lumpectomy fluid (seroma) of patients who are one to six weeks post-surgery for
      the presence or absence of tumor cells using new technology. Results of this study may help
      identify women who may have increased local relapse risk beyond that suggested by
      conventional pathology and clinical features; it may also help identify women at very low
      risk of local relapse who could avoid any additional treatment after local surgery.
