  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Within our institution, the principal investigator have acquired expertise in endorectal
      brachytherapy, a localized treatment for colorectal cancer. Until now a modality which uses
      an endorectal applicator has been used, which has certain limitations. In the context of this
      study, a new applicator will be used which is already approved by Health Canada for
      endorectal brachytherapy, thereby improving the participant's quality of life and optimizing
      treatment time.

      The main goal of this study is to treat patients using external beam radiotherapy followed by
      endorectal brachytherapy using a new applicator. Validating the feasibility of this new
      applicator, assessing the treatment time required when using it, the necessary workload
      required and ultimately avoid the need for surgery are our main priorities. Currently, this
      option is still experimental, although several patients have been treated with this method
      during the last ten years.

      In this pilot study, 45 patients will be recruited, whom have medical conditions
      (co-morbidities) that make surgery very difficult, or patients that are refusing surgery.

    <description>To measure the percentage (%) of clinical complete responders versus non-complete clinical responders and compare it to the percentage of an already proven device to determine if the new device can be used to treat rectal cancer patients.

    <measure>Toxicity using the new device</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years post treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Use the CTCAE guidelines to measure the percentage (%) of toxicity (G3 and above) of this novel X-Ray device. All grade 3 post-treatment complications will be reported (Proctitis, rectal bleeding, diarrhea). The toxicity will be assessed by the clinician during the follow-up visits.
An early stopping rule for possible severe toxicity during and post treatment toxicity will be used in this study.
The following early stopping rules will be applied to test the null hypothesis that the proportion of severe toxicity is less or equal to 25 % at 0.05:
3 severe toxicities (G3-4) out of the first 12 evaluable patients or
5 severe toxicities (G3-4) out of the first 22 evaluable patients or
7 severe toxicities (G3-4) out of the first 36 evaluable patients.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with histologic diagnosis by proctoscopic biopsy of invasive rectal
             adenocarcinoma will be considered for entry in this study.

          -  Patient in whom the diagnosis of invasive rectal cancer has been obtained by
             incisional biopsy (surgical or endoscopic biopsy) that the majority of the tumor has
             not been removed .

          -  The tumor should be either palpable by clinical rectal exam or accessible via a rigid
             proctoscope, and its proximal border should be located no more than 15 cm from the
             anal verge.

          -  Rectal cancer clinically stage as T2-T3 N1+ by MRI or endoscopic ultrasound.

          -  Patient who are curable by standard of care with either surgery or eligible for the
             Morpheus study.

          -  Patient who have received any previous therapy (radiation , chemotherapy) for rectal
             cancer.
