  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A Phase 1, first-in-human, dose escalation, safety, and tumor biopsy expansion study of
      SRF617, an antibody that inhibits CD39 activity, in patients with advanced solid tumors.
      Inhibition of CD39 activity may improve the ability to mount an immune response against tumor
      cells.

      A Phase 1, open-label, first-in-human, monotherapy dose escalation, safety, and tumor biopsy
      expansion study of SRF617 in patients with advanced solid tumors. The monotherapy dose
      escalation portion of the study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics
      (PK), pharmacodynamics, and preliminary efficacy of SRF617 as monotherapy in patients with
      advanced solid tumors. The monotherapy tumor biopsy expansion portion of the study will
      further evaluate the safety and intratumoral pharmacodynamics of SRF617 monotherapy.

    <intervention_name>SRF617</intervention_name>
    <description>SRF617 prevents CD39 mediated conversion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and adenosine diphosphate (ADP) to adenosine monophosphate (AMP) and phosphate, leading to an increase in extracellular ATP and a reduction in adenosine levels within the tumor microenvironment (TME). There is an important role for extracellular ATP and adenosine in cancer maintenance and progression, and maintaining high levels of ATP (and low levels of adenosine) in the TME may have anticancer therapeutic activity.</description>
