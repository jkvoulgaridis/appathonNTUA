  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A limitation of current approaches to peripheral lesions may be the caliber of bronchoscope
      used to reach them. As peripheral airways taper further in size, the ability of the
      bronchoscopist to approximate peripheral lesions diminishes using conventionally sized
      bronchoscopes of 5 or 4mm in outer diameter. Because of this limitation, the bronchoscopist
      may be unable to cannulate peripheral airways that lead directly to targeted lesions, thereby
      significantly compromising the diagnostic yield of the procedure. Ultrathin bronchoscopy
      utilizing bronchoscopes of 3mm in outer diameter may allow bronchoscopists better access to
      the lung periphery, thereby allowing access to peripheral airways that may lead directly into
      targeted lesions, resulting in a concentric anatomical position, where diagnostic yields may
      be improved.

    <description>Following airway inspection, the radial endobronchial ultrasound probe will be inserted through the working channel of the 4mm bronchoscope and will be advanced into the targeted bronchial segment towards the targeted lesion. Bronchoscopy will be performed using monoplanar fluoroscopic guidance until the peripheral lesion is located and confirmed using radial probe EBUS.
a. If a concentric view is obtained, biopsy will proceed using conventional instruments (TBNA) through the 4mm bronchoscope.
b. If an eccentric view is obtained, the 4mm bronchoscope will be withdrawn and the 3mm bronchoscope with the radial ultrasound probe will be advanced to the target lesion. Attempts will be made using the 3mm bronchoscope to obtain concentric views and ability to do so will be recorded. Biopsies will be obtained using conventional instruments (TBNA)through the 3mm bronchoscope regardless of the final ultrasound image (concentric or eccentric).</description>
