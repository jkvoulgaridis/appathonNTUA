      Brief summary Left ventricular apical hypoplasia (LVAH) is a rare cardiomyopathy
      characterized by a spherical, truncated LV with some degree of systolic dysfunction, an
      elongated, normally functioning right ventricle that wraps around the distal left ventricle,
      deficiency of the myocardium within the LV apex with adipose tissue infiltrating the apex and
      origin of the papillary muscle in the flattened anterior apex. This condition presents with
      different clinical presentation, ranging from no symptoms to congestive heart failure or
      malignant tachycardia. The etiology of this condition is currently unknown. The aim of this
      study is to evaluate the clinical and genetic characteristics of patients with LVAH.

      Background Left ventricular apical hypoplasia (LVAH) is described as congenital heart disease
      with an unusual type of cardiomyopathy that was first described in 2004 by Fernandez-Valls et
      al. It is an extremely rare disease; to date, only more than twenty cases were described.

      The typical imaging features of this cardiomyopathy include: a spherical, truncated LV with
      some degree of systolic dysfunction; an elongated, normally functioning right ventricle that
      wraps around the distal left ventricle; deficiency of the myocardium within the LV apex with
      adipose tissue infiltrating the apex; origin of the papillary muscle in the flattened
      anterior apex. A 2D echocardiogram and cardiac MRI can successfully indicate different
      morphological features This rare phenomenon frequently presents with different clinical
      manifestations according to the age of the disease, from no symptoms in children to
      congestive heart failure, pulmonary edema, or even malignant tachycardia in adults.
      Congenital or genetical etiology was proposed to explain the development of this rare
      cardiomyopathy.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate the clinical and genetic characteristics of patients
      with LVAH.

      Methods Study population

      The study population is composed by consecutive patients with diagnosis of LVAH. Diagnosis of
      LVAH is based on echocardiographic or cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) evidence of all the
      following diagnostic criteria:

        -  a spherical, truncated LV with some degree of systolic dysfunction;

        -  an elongated, normally functioning right ventricle that wraps around the distal left
           ventricle;

        -  deficiency of the myocardium within the LV apex with adipose tissue infiltrating the
           apex;

        -  origin of the papillary muscle in the flattened anterior apex. Patients enrolled
           followed a common protocol designed by GL (Monaldi Hospital, AORN Colli, University of
           Campania &quot;Luigi Vanvitelli&quot;). The study protocol was approved, and written informed
           consent was obtained from each subject, according to the procedure established by the
           Ethic Committee of our institution.

      Study protocol Patients enrolled underwent a comprehensive clinical-genetic evaluation
      commonly practiced in our cardiology division. In particular, the basal evaluation, consisted
      family and personal history, physical examination, blood tests, 12-lead electrocardiogram
      (ECG) at rest, conventional M-mode, two-dimensional and Doppler echocardiography, 24-hour
      Holter ECG, and cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR), and genetic testing with whole exome
      sequencing (WES). Moreover, all patients are clinically revaluated every 6-12 months.
