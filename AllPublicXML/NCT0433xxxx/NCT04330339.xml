  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done to examine whether fasting for 13 hours every night is feasible and
      if it can help breast cancer survivors lose weight and improve their health.

        -  Previous studies have found that women who are overweight or obese when their breast
           cancer is found (diagnosed) have a greater risk of their breast cancer recurring. Recent
           research suggests that prolonged nighttime fasting (&gt;13 hours) may improve the risk of
           recurrence for breast cancer.

        -  This study will examine if fasting for 13 hours per night is doable for participants and
           will also study what the effect of fasting is on quality of life, mood, fatigue, body
           size, and markers of health in the blood.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study involves fasting (not eating any food or drinking fluids that contain
      calories) for 13 hours nightly for 12 weeks.

        -  It is expected that about 40 people will take part in this research study.

        -  Eligible participants will undergo baseline assessments prior to starting the
           intervention.

             -  Baseline assessments include measurements of weight, height, quality of life,
                fatigue, mood, levels of physical activity, and blood markers.

             -  Assessments will be repeated at the completion of the 12-weeks

      This is a a Feasibility Study, which means this is the first time that investigators are
      examining prolonged nightly fasting and its effect on breast cancer survivors body size,
      blood markers, quality of life, emotional regulation, fatigue and level of physical activity.
