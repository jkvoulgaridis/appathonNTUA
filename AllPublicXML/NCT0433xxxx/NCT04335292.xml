  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II single-armed study will examine the clinical utility of retreating patients
      with osimertinib, in the third-line, following first-line treatment with osimertinib and
      second-line treatment with platinum and pemetrexed chemotherapy. The current standard of care
      for first-line Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) mutated Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung
      Cancer (aNSCLC) is osimertinib, followed by cytotoxic chemotherapy.

      The repeat of osimertinib following previous treatment failure is investigational, although
      supported by scientific rationale. The dosing and scheduling of osimertinib follows its use
      in approved settings. The investigators examine its tolerability and efficacy in this setting
      to ensure osimertinib is a safe third-line option for patients with Epidermal Growth Factor
      Receptor mutated (EGFR+) Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer(aNSCLC).

             if no demonstrable liver metastases or greater than 5 times ULN in the presence of
             liver metastases; aspartate aminotransferase greater than 2.5 times ULN if no
             demonstrable liver metastases or greater than 5 times ULN in the presence of liver
             metastases; total bilirubin greater than 1.5 times ULN if no liver metastases or
             greater than 3 times ULN in the presence of documented Gilbert's Syndrome
             [unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia] or liver metastases; serum creatinine greater than
             1.5 times ULN concurrent with creatinine clearance less than 50 mL/min [measured or
             calculated by Cockcroft and Gault equation]—confirmation of creatinine clearance is
             only required when creatinine is greater than 1.5 times ULN.

             requirements.

          -  Previous adjuvant cytotoxic chemotherapy within the 6 months prior to enrollment.

             death-ligand 1 (anti-PD-L1) therapy within 90 days prior to enrollment.

          -  For patients enrolling prior to first-line treatment with osimertinib:

          -  Any previous systemic therapy for Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor mutated (EGFR+)
             advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (aNSCLC).

          -  Any of the following cardiac criteria:

               -  Mean resting corrected QT interval (QTc) greater than 470 msec obtained from 3
                  electrocardiograms (ECGs), using the screening clinic ECG machine derived QTc
                  value

               -  Any clinically important abnormalities in rhythm, conduction or morphology of
                  resting ECG e.g. complete left bundle branch block, third degree heart block and
                  second degree heart block.

               -  Any factors that increase the risk of QTc prolongation or risk of arrhythmic
                  events such as heart failure, electrolyte abnormalities [including serum/plasma
                  potassium less than the Lower Limit of Normal (LLN), serum/plasma magnesium
                  greater than the Lower Limit of Normal (LLN), serum/plasma calcium less than the
                  Lower Limit of Normal (LLN)], congenital long QT syndrome, family history of long
                  QT syndrome or unexplained sudden death under 40 years of age in first degree
                  relatives or any concomitant medication known to prolong the QT interval and
                  cause Torsades de Pointes.

          -  For patients enrolling after progression on first-line osimertinib and prior to
             second-line chemotherapy all patients must have:

          -  Received osimertinib in the first-line and no other systemic therapy for their
             Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor mutated (EGFR+) Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
             (aNSCLC).

          -  For patients enrolling at the time of third-line osimertinib rechallenge all patients
             must have:

          -  Received osimertinib in the first-line followed by second-line platinum
             (carboplatin/cisplatin) with pemetrexed (pemetrexed maintenance is permitted), and no
             other systemic therapy for their Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor mutated (EGFR+)
             advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.

          -  Received a minimum of 1 dose of platinum (carboplatin/cisplatin) with pemetrexed.

               -  AND

          -  At least 90 days have lapsed since the last dose of first-line osimertinib.
