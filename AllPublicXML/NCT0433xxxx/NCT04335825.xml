      Trabeculectomy and implantation of the Ex-Press device belong to the same group of
      anti-glaucoma procedures improving subconjunctival outflow. The most frequently performed
      glaucoma surgery of choice is still trabeculectomy, although the less invasive implantation
      of the Ex-Press device is also an effective alternative. Despite the wide application of
      these two techniques, their impact on postoperative refraction is not entirely known. Quite
      often, in the early postoperative period there is a decrease in visual function, which is
      short-term, although there are reports that it can last up to a year after surgery. It can be
      caused by a reduction in IOP, as well as the direct effect of trabeculectomy on corneal
      topography, and thus on postoperative astigmatism and refractive error. The occurrence of
      astigmatism after trabeculectomy has been widely documented Combined operations of implanting
      the ExPress implant with cataract phacoemulsification differ from phacotrabeculectomy in
      that, they do not require cutting of the sclera, cutting the limbus and using a punch.

      The purpose of our research was to compare the phacotrabeculectomy and phacoemulsification
      combined with Express device implantation in terms of incidence of postoperative astigmatism
      in a prospective randomized study, and to attempt to determine what factors determine its
      size.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Glaucoma with coexisting cataract graded Nuclear-Cortical 1 (NC1) and Nuclear-Cortical
