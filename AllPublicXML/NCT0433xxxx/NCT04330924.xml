  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nurse-physician communication skills can be improve through inter-professional team training.
      Simulation is often used to conduct these training. However, constraints to conduct these
      sessions such as scheduling and logistic arrangements have been widely reported. Thus with
      the advancement of technology in education, the use of virtual environment to conduct the
      team training is being explored and evaluated.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All recruited participants underwent a 3-hour nurse-physician communication training prior to
      the simulation session. Team Strategies and Tools to Enhance Performance and Patient Safety
      (TeamSTEPPS) curriculum and pre-learning videos were introduced to the participants. Pre-test
      questionnaires were administered after the training. Participants were then randomized to the
      control (live simulation) or intervention group (virtual simulation).

      Intervention group participants will undergo a virtual simulation session training via the
      multi-user virtual world by logging in into the 3D virtual environment while participants in
      the control group performed the simulations in a physical simulated ward setting. Each pair
      of 1 medical student and 1 nursing student participate in two role-playing simulation
      scenarios (15-20 minutes each) along with a facilitator who will provide a debrief
      (30-minutes). Prior to the simulation, participants were given a smart-watch to monitor their
      physiological parameters such as heart rate. Post-test questionnaires were administered after
      the simulation sessions.

      After the simulation training, a 30-minutes team-based assessments were conducted based on a
      inter-professional bedside care scenario in pairs of one medical and one nursing student
      within their randomized group. The assessments were video recorded for evaluation by
      assessors who are blinded to the groupings. All participants were then invited to complete a
      follow-up questionnaire 2 months after the simulation training.
