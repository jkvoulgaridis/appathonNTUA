      This is a multicenter, randomized, open parallel controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy
      and safety of camrelizumab combined with albumin-bound paclitaxel and cisplatin versus
      albumin-bound paclitaxel combined with cisplatin in resectable stage IIIA -IIIB NSCLC (IIIB
      is limited toT3N2).
