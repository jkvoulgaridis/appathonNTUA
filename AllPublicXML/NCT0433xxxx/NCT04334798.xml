  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to compare the efficacy of different modalities ofof motor
      learning of pelvic floor muscle contraction in women with pelvic floor dysfunctions,
      considering the efficacy of the treatment as improving the specific quality of life related
      to pelvic floor dysfunctions and improvement of the muscular properties of the pelvic floor
      muscles.

    <measure>Change in life impact of pelvic floor dysfunction</measure>
    <time_frame>5 assessments to evaluate change from baseline: at baseline, after the intervention period (2 months from baseline), 3 months, 6 months and 12 months after the intervention.</time_frame>
    <description>It will be assessed by the Pelvic Floor Impact Questionnaire-7 (PFIQ-7) Spanish version. The PFIQ-7 consists of 3 scales of 7 questions each taken from the Urinary Impact Questionnaire, the Pelvic Organ Prolapse Impact Questionnaire, and the Colorectal-Anal Impact Questionnaire. The 3 scales are scored from 0 (least impact) to 100 (greatest impact) and an overall summary score (0 to 300).</description>

    <measure>Change in symptoms and quality of life</measure>
    <time_frame>5 assessments to evaluate change from baseline: at baseline, after the intervention period (2 months from baseline), 3 months, 6 months and 12 months after the intervention.</time_frame>
    <description>It will be assessed by the Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory-20 (PFDI-20) Spanish version that is both a symptom inventory and a measure of the degree of bother and distress caused by pelvic floor symptoms. The PFDI-20 includes 20 questions and 3 scales. Each of the 3 scales is scored from 0 (least distress) to 100 (greatest distress). The sum of the scores of these 3 scales serves as the overall summary score of the PFDI-20 and ranges from 0 - 300 and the higher the score, the worse quality of life. The 3 scales include questions taken from the following widely used outcome measures: Urinary Distress Inventory - 6 questions, Pelvic Organ Prolapse (POP) Distress Inventory - 6 questions, and Colorectal-Anal Distress Inventory - 8 questions collecting data about Urinary Incontinence (UI), POP and colorectal and anal symptoms.</description>

    <time_frame>5 assessments to evaluate change from baseline: at baseline, after the intervention period (2 months from baseline), 3 months, 6 months and 12 months after the intervention.</time_frame>
    <description>It will be measured by Modified Oxford Scale to rate pelvic floor muscle contraction on a scale of 0-5: 0 = no contraction; 1 = minor muscle; 'flicker'; 2 = weak muscle; contraction; 3 = moderate muscle contraction; 4 = good muscle contraction and 5 = strong muscle contraction.</description>
