  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The mental health sector is being called upon to develop and implement interventions for
      youth that attend to gender, age and cultural diversity (Mental Health Commission of Canada,
      2016). The proposed project outlines the development and feasibility testing of a culturally
      driven transdiagnostic psychosocial intervention for South Asian women aged 16-24 years. We
      will recruit 30 participants to complete the 12 week psychosocial intervention. Pre, midpoint
      and post evaluations will be completed to asses change in mental health, self esteem and
      values, and also qualitative feedback on participant experiences of the intervention.

    <description>The 12 week intervention has four major components:
Relational theory (Belgrave, 2002) &amp; South Asian identity development (Inman et al., 2001). These foundational components focus on strengthening cultural identity through the exploration of values, navigation and reconciliation of two cultures.
Transdiagnostic treatment of mood disorders (Ehrenreich-May et al., 2017). This component will focus on skill building in the areas of emotion awareness, resilience, adaptability, self-compassion and healthy coping strategies (Farchione et al., 2012; Bilek &amp; Ehrenriech-May, 2012; Ritschel, Noriel &amp; Lindsay, 2015).
Psychoeducation on mental health, sexual health, and substance use.
Peer support is a critical component of the intervention and will be provided by the peer researcher on the team. Participants will have access to optional individual peer support for 30 minutes to one hour per week for the duration of the intervention, this can be in person or telephone support.</description>
