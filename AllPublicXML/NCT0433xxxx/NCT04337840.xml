  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nosocomial infections are increasing rapidly both internationally and domestically,
      especially carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae infections. However, there were still
      lack of evidence about the risk and prognosis in Taiwan. The choice of drug and related
      sensitivity test was also limited. We would analyze the infection risk, prognosis, and drug
      sensitivity of Klebsiella pneumoniae and focus on strategy to manage carbapenem-resistant
      Klebsiella pneumoniae infections.

        This study was conducted at the National Taiwan University Hospital (NTUH), a medical
        center with 2400 beds in Taipei City. We studied patients with K. pneumoniae bloodstream
        infection between October 2017 and December 2019.

        All adult patients (â‰¥18 years) with K. pneumoniae bloodstream infection were included.
        Patients were excluded if there was other recognized bacteremia within two weeks before or
        after the first episode of K. pneumoniae bloodstream infection.
