  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate if music listening relieves pain and discomfort during
      Extracorporeal Shock-Waves Lithotripsy (ESWL).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients undergoing ESWL and interested in music listening are randomly divided in two
      groups: patients in group A listen to music during the first part of the treatment (first
      1800 SW), patients in group B during the second part.

      At the end of the treatment patients are asked to fill in a questionnaire. They are asked if
      they were pleased to have had the opportunity to listen to music during ESWL, if they would
      like to listen to music again in case of further treatments, if they consider music helpful
      in relieving pain and discomfort during ESWL. Patients are also asked to mark their level of
      pain during each part of the treatment on a visual analogue scale (VAS) for pain.
