  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pragmatic, non-inferiority clinical trial, enrolling heart failure patients who
      will be randomized to a 12-week exercise training program either centre-based or home-based
      with telemonitoring. The impact of this intervention will be assessed on established
      surrogate markers in HF such as maximal exercise capacity, plasma biomarkers and quality of
      life. The cost-effectiveness and overall satisfaction with the treatment will also be
      studied. In addition to measure the clinical and economic impact of this innovative way of
      delivering exercise, it is intended to unravel new molecular pathways and assess a pool of
      biomarkers that provide a wide mechanistic picture underlying the clinical effects of
      exercise.

    <description>Health status will be evaluated by the 5-level EQ-5D version (EQ-5D-5L) questionnaire. The questionnaire comprises five dimensions, each describing a different aspect of health (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression). Each dimension has five response levels of severity which range from 0 (no problems) to 5 (extreme problems/ unable to do). In addition, there is a score of overall health range from 0 to 100%.</description>

Total scores from the D-12 range from 0 to 36, with higher scores corresponding to greater severity.</description>
