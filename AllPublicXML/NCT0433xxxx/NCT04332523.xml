  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of the study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetc (PK) of a single oral dose of
      JNJ-53718678 in participants with varying degrees of impaired hepatic function (mild,
      moderate, and severe) when compared with participants with normal hepatic function.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  A woman of childbearing potential must have a negative serum (beta human chorionic
             gonadotropin [beta-HCG]) test at screening and on Day -1 of the treatment period

          -  Contraceptive use by female participants or women should be consistent with local
             regulations regarding the use of contraceptive methods for participant participating
             in clinical studies

          -  If a woman, must agree not to donate eggs (ova, oocytes) for the purposes of assisted
             reproduction during the study and for 30 days after receiving the study drug

          -  A male participant must agree not to donate sperm for the purpose of reproduction from
             Day -1 of the study and for a minimum of 90 days after receiving the study drug

          -  For participants with mild, moderate or severe hepatic impairment: the participants
             must have a total Child-Pugh score of 5 to 6, inclusive (mild); or 7 to 9, inclusive
             (moderate); or 10-15, inclusive (severe). The Investigator will determine degree of
             hepatic impairment

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Known allergies, hypersensitivity, or intolerance to JNJ-53718678 or its excipients

          -  Donated blood or blood products or had substantial loss of blood (more than 500
             milliliter [mL]) within 90 days before the administration of study drug or intention
             to donate blood or blood products during the study

          -  Received an experimental drug (including investigational vaccines) or used an
             experimental medical device within 30 days or within a period less than 5 times the
             drug's half-life, whichever is longer, before the dose of the study drug is scheduled

          -  Any condition for which, in the opinion of the investigator, participation would not
             be in the best interest of the participant or that could prevent, limit, or confound
             the protocol-specified assessments

          -  Preplanned surgery or procedures that would interfere with the conduct of the study
