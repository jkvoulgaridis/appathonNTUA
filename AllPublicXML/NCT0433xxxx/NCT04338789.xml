  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was conducted to compare the rate of second molar protraction, level of
      Interleukin1-β in gingival crevicular fluid, periodontal health (gingival index, plaque
      index, and periodontal pocket depth) and root resorption in patients treated by molar
      protraction with piezocision performed early at the time of protraction (Group 1),
      piezocision performed 3 months after molar protraction (Group 2), and no piezocision molar
      protraction (Group 3).

      Detailed Description: Thirty-five subjects who presented with bilaterally extracted
      mandibular first molar were selected to participate in the study. The subjects were
      subdivided into one of 3 groups as follows: group 1 consisted of 20 subjects /20 molars where
      piezocision was performed immediately before molar protraction; group 2 consisted of 20
      subjects/ 20 molars where molar protraction was carried on after 3 months of molar
      protraction with no piezocision; group 3 consisted of 20 subjects (40 molars) where
      protraction was carried out with no piezocision.

      After reaching 0.019X0.025&quot; SS arch wire, NiTi coil spring was used for space closure
      (protraction force was 150g) attached from the lower second molar hook to the head of the
      mini-screw. Piezocision was performed by making 2 vertical incisions mesial and distal to the
      extraction space. Piezotome was inserted in the incisions previously made and bone cuts were
      done with a length up to mucogingival line and depth of 3 mm. Gingival crevicular fluid (GCF)
      sample was obtained from the mesiogingival side of the lower second permanent molar with use
      of Periopaper. GCF sample was repeated 1 day, 1 week and 4 weeks after molar protraction with
      piezocision or with no piezocision. Periodontal parameters were measured and lower molar root
      resorption was assessed using Perapical radiographs.

    <intervention_model_description>Split mouth design where piezocision will be performed at the time of molar protraction on the right or left side of the bilateral first molar extraction subjects and 3 months of molar protraction on the other side. A third group of subjects will act as a control where molar protraction will be done with no piezocision.
- Comparison between the 3 groups of subjects; Early piezocision, late piezocision and no piezocision molar protraction groups.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking>Single (Outcomes Assessor)</masking>
    <masking_description>Blinding of either patient or clinician was not possible during treatment. However, partial blinding was possible. Orthodontic molar protraction was carried out by the clinician without knowing the GCF levels and the lab was blinded to the clinical findings. Also, periapical radiographs and study casts were masks during data collection.</masking_description>
