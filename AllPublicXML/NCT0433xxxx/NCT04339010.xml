      Aim: To verify the effects of the abdominal hypopressive technic (AHT) associate or not with
      pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) in urinary incontinence (UI) symptoms and pelvic floor
      muscle strength. Methods: Randomized controlled trial. Thirteen incontinent women were
      randomly divided into an AHT group or AHT+PFMC group. Outcome assessment was carried out
      using digital palpation (modified Oxford grading scale), Peritron perineometer, and the
      International Consultation Incontinence Questionnaire-Short Form (ICIQ-SF) questionnaire. The
      treatment protocol consisted of five twice-weekly, 40-min one-on-one sessions. The
      participants were assessed only at baseline and after the intervention. Results: It is
      expected that the group who performed PFMC will improve the maximal voluntary contractions
      (MVC) and improve urinary incontinence symptoms, while the hypopressive exercise does not.

      This was a single-blind randomized controlled trial comparing the effect of AHT versus AHT
      associated with PFM contraction in incontinent women. The study was approved by the Research
      Ethics of Santa Catarina State University (number 3.712.850) and each participating provided
      the written informed consent signed. Women were randomly assigned to either an AHT group or
      the AHT associated with PFM contraction (AHT + PFMC) group. The first group underwent a
      hypopressive exercise program that does not stimulate the PFM contraction, while the other
      group receives the AHT associated with PFM contraction stimulated by the physiotherapist
      during the sessions. Following eligibility screening by the research, the women were
      allocated in an of the two groups. Group allocation results were concealed by opaque, sealed
      envelopes with serial numbers, and the participants were assigned at the second visit by
      opening envelops in a sequential manner, after their eligibility was assessed at the first
      visit. Study investigators were blinded to treatment allocation. Participants underwent a
      five weeks intervention after the first evaluation, and the final evaluation occurred one
      week later on a date according to the participant availability.

      The first three sessions were designated to learn how to perform the exercises and your
      variations correctly were part of the five weeks intervention. The intervention was performed
      in a forty-minute training session in two-week meetings during five consecutive weeks. All
      women included in this trial, independently of the group, received standardized lifestyle
      advice including, when appropriate, instructions about weight loss, constipation, hydration
      and the avoidance of heavy lifting. It is very important to emphasize that the time dedicated
      to performing the daily exercises was similar. The therapist applying the protocol was
      appropriately trained especially for the trial and it was not the same professional who
      conducted the evaluations.

    <description>Will be assessed by evaluating the ICIQ-SF questionnaire that assesses the frequency, severity, and impact on the quality of life of urinary incontinence (UI). The three scored items of the ICIQ-UI SF are: [1] ''How often do you leak urine?'' (0 ''Never&quot; 1 ''About once a week or less often,'' 2 ''Two or three times a week,'' 3 ''About once a day,'' 4 ''Several times a day,'' 5 ''All the time''), [2] ''How much urine do you usually leak?'' (0 ''None,'' 2 ''A small amount,'' 4 ''A moderate amount,'' and 6 ''A large amount''), and [3] ''Overall, how much does leaking urine interfere with your everyday life?'' (Visual analog scale ranging from 0 ''Not at all'' to 10 ''A great deal''). The answers result in a sum, with a minimum score of 0, and a maximum score of 21. Preliminary cut-off scores were set to 0 as ''continent status'' and 1 or more as ''incontinence status&quot;.</description>

    <description>Peritron 9300® manometer will be used to assess the maximum voluntary contraction (MVC). An MVC of PFM will be asked to the participant and the peak value was recorded, this process was repeated 3 times. The mean value of these three pressure peaks corresponded to MVC of the PFM.</description>

    <description>The Peritron manometer will be inserted into the vaginal canal and a rest period was given to control the influence of possible voluntary and involuntary contractions, in order to obtain the vaginal resting pressure measurement . The vaginal resting pressure value will be determined by the lowest pressure value during rest.</description>

    <description>st session: the meetings were provided by a physiotherapist, who also discussed the location and function of the pelvic organs, PFM, and the transversus abdominis (TrA) muscles. The participants learned how to activate TrA muscles. The training was performed during full expiration, the physiotherapist check and coordinate the group to maintain the Tra contraction. The women were also trained to inhale through the nose and exhale through the mouth maintaining an apical breathing pattern.
nd session: The contractions were executed during six different positions the ones which they will keep following through the whole treatment.
rd session: The patients were exposed to all the six positions (supplementary material) and their three variations (positions 1, 3, 5 and 6 ). Every meeting obeyed the same schedule through the five weeks of treatment and was accompanied by two physiotherapists.</description>
