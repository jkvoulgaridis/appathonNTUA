  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A multi center randomized controlled study including 3 arms (wearable device group, control
      group 1, control group 2). This study is to investigate clinical feasibility of heart rate
      monitoring using wearable devices to detect disease recurrence in the patients who
      discontinue anti-thyroid drugs in remission state.

      A multi center randomized controlled study including 3 arms (wearable device group, control
      group 1, control group 2).

      Study participants: Patients with Graves' disease who are planned to discontinue anti-thyroid
      drugs in remission state Wearable device group: Participants use wearable device and their
      heart rate and activity are monitored. If their resting heart rate (rHR) increase beyond the
      set range or they have hyperthyroid symptoms and signs, they should come to the hospital and
      get tests for thyroid function. If their rHR stay within set range and they have no symptoms
      and signs, they come to hospital and get tests for thyroid function 6 months after
      discontinuing anti-thyroid drugs.

      Control group 1: Participants don't use wearable devices. If they have hyperthyroid symptoms
      and signs, they should come to the hospital and get tests for thyroid function. If they have
      no symptoms and signs, they come to hospital and get tests for thyroid function 6 months
      after discontinuing anti-thyroid drugs.

      Control group 2: Participants don't use wearable devices. If they have hyperthyroid symptoms
      and signs, they should come to the hospital and get tests for thyroid function. If they have
      no symptoms and signs, they come to hospital and get tests for thyroid function 3 and 6
      months after discontinuing anti-thyroid drugs.

      A period to detecting disease recurrence, thyroid function test and Hyperthyroid Symptom
      Scale (HSS) at the time of disease recurrence, and the number of hospital visit and medical
      cost until detecting disease recurrence will be compared among 3 groups.
