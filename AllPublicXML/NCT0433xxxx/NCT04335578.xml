  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of Stage 1 in this study is to investigate the safety and tolerability of
      UCB7858 in kidney transplant recipients with deteriorating kidney function associated with
      chronic allograft injury (CAI) and to determine the dose level for Stage 2. The main purpose
      of Stage 2 is to further investigate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of repeat dosing
      with UCB7858 in kidney transplant recipients with deteriorating kidney function associated
      with CAI.
