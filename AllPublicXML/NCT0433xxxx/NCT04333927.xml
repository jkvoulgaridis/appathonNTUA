  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a multicenter phase II randomized controlled trial. The purpose is to
      investigate the efficacy and safety of adjuvant immunotherapy combined with chemoradiation
      for patients with high-risk resectable extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma and gallbladder
      cancer.

      The trial will recruit 92 patients, and they will be randomized (1:1) into two groups
      (chemoradiation+immunotherapy group, observation group) after operation. Patients in
      chemoradiation+immunotherapy group will receive camrelizumab 200mg intravenously every 3
      weeks until clinical or radiographic disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, death,
      termination of the study or withdrawal. After 1 or 2 courses of camrelizumab, patients went
      on to receive capecitabine (1,330 mg/m2 per day, in divided doses twice daily, 7 days per
      week) concurrent with radiotherapy (45 Gy to regional lymph nodes and 54 to 59.4 Gy to
      preoperative tumor bed). Patients in observation group will not receive any anti-cancer
      therapy.
