      The investigators will be administering oral high dose interval vitamin D, concurrently when
      participants are receiving biologic therapy for their inflammatory bowel disease. The
      investigators will be collecting some additional bloodwork and questionnaires at the time of
      participants infusions.

      The investigators will be administering oral high dose interval vitamin D3 concurrently when
      participants with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are receiving biologic therapy every 4-8
      weeks. The investigators will collect additional bloodwork when participants are getting
      clinical labwork in order to assess markers of bone health and inflammation in response to
      vitamin D treatment. The investigators will serially assess with questionnaires associated
      measures, including dietary vitamin D and calcium intake, sunlight exposure, physical
      activity, fracture history, IBD disease activity, and overall health.
