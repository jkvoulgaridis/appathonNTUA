  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD) is the most common genetic cause of
      renal failure. For several decades, ADPKD was regarded as an adult-onset disease. In the last
      decade, it has become more widely appreciated that the disease course begins in childhood.
      However, evidence-based guidelines on how to manage and approach children diagnosed with or
      at-risk for of ADPKD are lacking. Overall, there is insufficient data on the clinical course
      during childhood. The study intends to get more information on Autosomal Dominant Polycystic
      Kidney Disease (ADPKD) and other hepato/renal fibrocystic diseases. Additionally, the study
      intends to expand web-based resources so anyone can learn about ADPKD or other hepato/renal
      fibrocystic diseases. Individuals diagnosed with the dominant form of a hepato/renal
      fibrocystic condition are invited to be in the study.

      This study will ask the subject's permission to see past, current, and future medical
      information related to the disease. Some information that is collected, would be clinic
      notes, lab results, and physician consult reports. The subject will be asked to sign a
      release of medical information form to allow the study team access to medical
      information.This study does not require a clinic visit to the center.

      When the research study receives the information, the research study team will be able to
      enter the medical data into the Hepato/Renal Fibrocystic Diseases clinical database.

      There will be initial data entry in the database and follow up data entries lasting for the
      duration of this study or until the subject chooses to not participate in the study anymore.
      The study team will remove the subject's name or any other identifiable health information
      from the received records before entering medical data into the Hepato/Renal Fibrocystic
      Diseases clinical database.
