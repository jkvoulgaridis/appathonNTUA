  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although the benefits of supervised walking training in patients with peripheral arterial
      disease (PAD) and symptoms of intermittent claudication (IC) are well established, one of the
      main problems found in this type of protocol is low adherence to training, which is possibly
      related to pain during training. In addition, little is known about the impact of performing
      exercise with pain on cerebral blood flow and cardiovascular health indicators. Thus, the
      objective of the present study will be to analyze the acute effects of walking exercise with
      self-selected intensity on the cardiovascular health indicators of patients with PAD.
      Therefore, 17 patients with PAD will undergo three experimental sessions: exercise with
      self-selected intensity, exercise until maximum pain and control. The responses of the
      cardiovascular variables (heart rate variability, blood pressure, heart rate, arterial
      stiffness and endothelial function) will be obtained before and after the sessions. In
      addition, during the session cardiovascular responses (cerebral blood flow, blood pressure
      and heart rate), perceptual and affective responses, as well as information about the
      exercises performed during the session will be obtained. The responses before and after
      exercise will be analyzed using the two-way analysis of variance for repeated measures
      (ANOVA) and the Newman-Keuls post-hoc test. The value of P &lt;0.05 will be considered
      significant.

    <measure>Cerebral perfusion</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline at 30 minutes after the beginning of the exercise.</time_frame>
    <description>The cerebral perfusion at rest will be obtained by a transcranial doppler (TCD, Spencer Technologies, United States). To this end, patients will wear a helmet (Marc 600; Spencer Technologies, United States) capable of bilaterally attaching two 2 MHz ultrasound probes to the temporal window. With a method similar to that of an extracranial doppler, the transcranial doppler is capable of capturing the speeds of brain flows. The flow velocities of the middle cerebral artery will be measured bilaterally for 5 minutes, with patients at rest.</description>

    <measure>Central blood pressure</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline at post-intervention, after 10 minutes.</time_frame>
    <description>The measurement of central arterial pressure will be performed by analyzing the pulse wave of the radial artery using the applanation tonometry technique (SphygmoCor, AtCor Medical, Australia).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Heart rate variability</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline at post-intervention, after 20 minutes.</time_frame>
    <description>Heart rate variability will be assessed in order to estimate the autonomic modulation of the cardiovascular system. Therefore, after 20 minutes of rest, patients will remain in the supine position for 10 minutes, during which time RR intervals will be recorded, using a heart rate monitor valid for this function (V8000, Polar Electro, Finland).</description>

    <measure>Arterial Stiffness</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline at post-intervention, after 30 minutes.</time_frame>
    <description>The estimate of central arterial stiffness will be obtained from the evaluation of the pulse wave velocity following the guidelines of the Clinical Application of Arterial Stiffness, Task Force III (43). For that, the applanation tonometry technique will be used. The carotid-femoral pulse waves will be recorded sequentially by transcutaneous transducers positioned above the arteries using an applanation tonometry device (SphygmoCor, AtCor Medical, Australia).</description>

    <description>The measurements of basal blood flow and flow-mediated vasodilation will be obtained by means of ultrasound according to the most recent recommendations (11, 44). Images of the brachial artery will be recorded by a two-dimensional ultrasound device with spectral Doppler and linear transducer (Smart 3300, Terason, United States).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Feeling Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline at 35 minutes after the beginning of the exercise.</time_frame>
    <description>A feeling scale is a single-item scale with a 11-point bipolar dimensional model, ranging from +5 to -5, commonly used to measure affective valence (pleasure / displeasure) during exercise.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Subjective perceived effort</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline at 35 minutes after the beginning of the exercise.</time_frame>
    <description>The perceived effort will be evaluated using the scale adapted from subjective perception of effort (0-10 points). The perceived effort will be defined as the intensity of effort, tension and subjectively perceived fatigue that the individual feels during the exercise.</description>

    <measure>Cognitive function</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline at post-intervention, after 1 hour.</time_frame>
    <description>Moca is a screening instrument were evaluating seven cognitive domains of a person and had the score between 0 and 30, where 0 is the worst score and 30 the best one. The domains will be: Visuospatial/executive functions, verbal memory, registration and learning, naming, 5-minute delayed verbal memory, attention, abstraction and orientation. A experienced researcher will explain how cognitive testes work and will apply to the patient.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cognitive function 2</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline at post-intervention, after 1 hour and 10 minutes.</time_frame>
    <description>The Stroop test is an important tool to the assessment of the cognitive flexibility, cognitive inhibition, selective attention and information processing speed of the patient. The test consists in three phases, the first one is naming time of nonconflicting stimuli (naming colors of colored square), the second one is naming time of conflicting (where naming colors words that are printed in a different color than their meaning). The third one is to name colors of color words printed in a different color. An experienced researcher will explain how cognitive testes work and will apply to the patient.</description>

    <description>The control session will consist of resting on the treadmill for 30 min. It will be recommended that the patient do cycles in which he / she stands for 3 to 5 minutes and sits for 2 to 3 minutes in between, aiming to minimize the effect of body positioning on cardiovascular responses.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>In the self-selected exercise session, individuals will perform 30 min of exercise with self-selected intensity. This means that the duration of the series and the intensity (speed) of the treadmill are at the discretion of the patient. The important thing is that in the end it totals 30 minutes of exercise. This choice of intensity and duration of the series can be made regardless of the occurrence of pain.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>In the exercise until maximum pain session (current recommendation of walking exercise prescription for patients with PAD), individuals will perform series of 3 to 5 minutes with adjusted intensity so that they feel moderate to maximum pain. This means that the patient will start walking and the Physical Education professional, experienced and able to prescribe exercises for patients with PAD, will adjust the treadmill speed so that the patient walks with moderate pain or even maximum pain. There will be rest intervals of 2 to 3 minutes. The patient will be encouraged to complete a total of 30 minutes of exercise.</description>
