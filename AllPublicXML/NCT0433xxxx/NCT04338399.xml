    <textblock>
      The BURAN study is a randomized, open-label phase III study to assess the treatment effect of
      once-daily buparlisib in combination with weekly paclitaxel compared to weekly paclitaxel
      alone in patients with refractory, recurrent, or metastatic head and neck squamous cell
      carcinoma (HNSCC) that have progressed after prior platinum-based therapy with or without
      prior anti PD 1/anti PD L1 therapy.

      This study is to assess the impact on overall survival of the combination of Buparlisib and
      paclitaxel compared to paclitaxel alone in patients who have failed cisplatin based treatment
      or cisplatin based treatment and anti-PD1 based treatment.
