  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hospital-at-home models seek to address the impending shortage of hospital beds by
      reimagining the way we deliver acute hospital-level care - substituting the ward for a
      patient's home. Such programmes have been well established in other countries such as
      Australia, Europe and USA to be a less costly way to provide inpatient care as a result of a
      reduction of fixed costs of building and running hospitals, with equivalent variable costs
      and comparable clinical outcomes. Acute services are provided at home, including regular
      visits by doctors, nurses and therapists, intravenous therapy, simple investigations and 24/7
      access to doctors. The clinical service is tech-enabled, by remote monitoring and
      telecommunication technologies.

      Although overseas experience suggests that hospital-at-home programmes are an effective, safe
      and scalable substitute for inpatient beds, and promising strategy to meet the bed demands of
      our ageing population, the outcomes in the local environment is unclear. Singapore has a
      unique healthcare system compared to primarily insurance driven (USA) or publicly funded (UK
      and Australia), which favours subsidies of inpatient care compared to community-based care.
      In addition, cultural beliefs of hospitals as a source of comfort and healing and
      unfamiliarity with healthcare providers performing home visits may provide unique challenges
      which may affect outcomes of a hospital-at-home programme in Singapore. In an Asian setting,
      family and informal caregivers are heavily involved in the care of patients and may pose
      unique barriers and facilitators to such care at home that may not be evident in similar
      models in Western countries.

      This study adopts a hybrid effectiveness-implementation approach comprising a pilot,
      multi-centre open-label randomised controlled trial followed by a mixed-method process
      evaluation to evaluate the effectiveness, cost, feasibility and processes of a pilot
      hospital-at-home programme in Singapore.

      1. Hypothesis

           The investigators hypothesise that care under NUHS@Home results in equivalent
           improvement in health-related quality of life compared to usual in-hospital care with
           other potential benefits such as reduced cost, improvements in patient experience,
           readmission, iatrogenic events, and patient activation.

        2. Specific Aims

      Primary Objective: Evaluation of Comparative Safety and Effectiveness through a Randomised
      Controlled Trial: in stable hospitalised patients with a suitable home environment, how does
      hospital-at-home care compare to usual care in inpatient wards with respect to improvement in
      health-related quality of life, cost, patient-reported outcomes, patient satisfaction and
      clinical outcomes?

      Secondary Objective: Process Evaluation - in the implementation of hospital-at-home,

        1. Is the programme feasible?

        2. Is the programme acceptable to patients and providers?

        3. What are the experiences, perceptions and needs of patients and their caregivers in a
           hospital-at-home programme?

        4. What are the healthcare providers' experiences and opinions of this service?

        5. What are the barriers and facilitators to implementation?

        6. What modifications can be made to maximise scaling and sustainability?

        7. How can the investigators maximise cost effectiveness when scaling the programme?

           3. Study population

           3.1 Setting

           The investigators will recruit 30 patients in the intervention group and 30 patients in
           the control group from 2 sites: National University Hospital (NUH) and Alexandra
           Hospital (AH). Patients will be recruited from both AH and NUH with no restrictions of
           proportion from each center. There are no restrictions based on race of the subject. The
           investigators will exclude children as this is an adult medical service.

           3.2 Recruitment

           3.2.1 Recruitment Process

           Research assistants from the study will screen through the electronic health record of
           all patients newly admitted overnight in the following settings:

             -  NUH Extended Diagnosis and Treatment Unit (EDTU) who are not able to be discharged
                the same day

             -  NUH Acute Medical Unit (AMU)

             -  NUH wards 42, 54, 55 under general medicine (GM)

             -  AH Extended Diagnosis and Treatment Unit (EDTU) who are not able to be discharged
                the same day

             -  AH wards under General Medicine (GM)

           Patients thought to be suitable by the research assistant will be confirmed by the
           NUHS@Home consultant for clinical criteria, who will subsequently discuss with the
           primary physician regarding eligibility.

           For fluid overload cases from cardiology and nephrology wards, patients will be
           recruited on a referral basis only where the primary team contacts the NUHS@Home
           consultant for recruitment. Patients who are not identified through the screening
           process but are deemed to be appropriate by the primary team physician can be recruited
           on a referral basis in a similar manner.

           In this pilot trial, the investigators intend to recruit a maximum of 3 patients
           receiving the intervention at any one point in time. Recruitment will only take place on
           weekdays, excluding public holidays, to coincide with the admission processes for
           NUHS@Home.

           3.2.2 Confirmation of Eligibility and Consent

           Patients identified by the primary physician and deemed to be eligible by the study
           team, or patients identified by the study team's screening process with consent of the
           primary physician, will be approached by the study team to ask for interest in
           participating in the study. Once a patient has indicated interest in participating in
           the study, the study team will confirm eligibility using a screening checklist. If
           patients are confirmed to be eligible, the study team will assess the patient's capacity
           to consent to the trial and the intervention. If the patient has capacity, the study
           team will go through the study information with the patient and caregiver (which will
           cover the process for recruitment and the randomisation process) and take written
           informed consent. If the patient requests, their main spokespersons will be involved in
           the discussion. If the patient has no capacity to consent, the main spokesperson will
           represent them in this scenario.

           3.3.3 Inclusion and exclusion criteria are entered elsewhere in this protocol

           3.4 Withdrawal Criteria

           Patients may discontinue the intervention if they are transferred back to hospital
           during the treatment period.

           3.5 Subject Replacement

           Subjects who drop out will not be replaced.

           4 Methods and Assessments

           4.1 Randomisation

           Participants who have provided written consent will undergo randomisation stratification
           by patient profile as follows:

             -  Group 1: Episodic short stay patients - from NUH EDTU, AH EDTU and NUH AMU

             -  Group 2: Long stay patients requiring ongoing treatment or monitoring - general
                medicine admissions at NUH and AH

             -  Group 3: Specialty specific treatment and monitoring with a protocolised approach -
                fluid overload admissions from cardiology and nephrology.

           The randomisation sequence will be computer generated and revealed by phone call to a
           centralised hotline. The participant will then be informed about the arm of the trial to
           which they have been assigned and given appropriate information.

           4.2 Study Visits

           4.2.1 Screening Encounter

           Patients which are potentially eligible would be screened both using the electronic
           health record and in person using a screening checklist to confirm eligibility.

           4.2.2 Study Visits

           Patients or their proxies who consent will undergo a baseline questionnaire. This
           includes baseline demographics, Barthel's score, assessment of health literacy,
           mini-COG, EQ-5D-5L and EQ-VAS. If a proxy is used, the same proxy will need to complete
           all subsequent questionnaires

           They will also undergo a discharge questionnaire on the day of discharge. This includes
           EQ-5D-5L, EQ-VAS, Patient reported activity and Patient Activation Measure. Caregivers
           of patients will be asked to complete an optional questionnaire. This includes caregiver
           demographics, short version of Zarit Burden Inventory.

           4.2.3 Final Study Visits

           Patients will undergo a final questionnaire 14 days from enrolment. If a proxy was used
           for initial questionnaires, the same proxy will be used to complete the final
           questionnaire. This includes EQ-5D-5L, EQ-VAS, perception f care transitions and patient
           satisfaction survey.

           Caregivers of patients will be asked to complete an optional questionnaire. This
           includes caregiver perception of care transitions.

           Additionally, patients and caregivers in the intervention group will undergo an
           additional survey, coincident with a follow up visit. See Section 8.3.2 for interview
           guides.

           4.2.4 Post Study Follow up and Procedures

           During each day of stay, the study team will collect provider activity data, including
           the nurses and doctors involved in their care, as well as the number of patients that
           the same nurse or doctor are caring for. Only numbers of patients will be recorded, and
           their data not accessed.

           30 days from discharge, the study team will collect patient outcomes from the electronic
           medical record.

           Every 3 months, the study team will extract billing data for a list of itemised
           consumables and their associated cost to the patient.

           5.4.3 Intervention-specific Process Measures

           The following processes will also be measured to examine fidelity of the programme:

             -  Response time for out-of-hour home visits

             -  Number of unexpected telephone calls &amp; staff visits

             -  Number of medication reviews done with patient and family

             -  Number of patients transferred back to acute hospital

             -  Number of home visits by doctor and duration of each

             -  Number of home visits by nurse and duration of each

             -  Number of home visits by allied health and duration of each

             -  Number of home visits by caregivers and duration of each

             -  Number of virtual visits by doctor and duration of each

             -  Number of virtual visits by nurse and duration of each

             -  Number of virtual visits by allied health and duration of each

           5.4.4 Stakeholder Perspectives Using a Qualitative Approach

           A descriptive qualitative study design will be used and both the care receivers
           (patients and their care givers) and care providers (clinicians and other stakeholders)
           will be invited to participate in face-to-face in-depth interviews. The reflective
           lifeworld approach will be used where the researcher will uphold critical and reflective
           attitude throughout the data collection so as to capture the lived and subjective
           experiences of care receivers and care providers. A semi-structured interview guide will
           be developed and used to collect data. The guide will be validated by the clinicians and
           the experts in qualitative research. The guide will be pilot tested among care receivers
           and care providers before it can be used for the actual data collection.

           Once the patients in the intervention group receiving NUHS@Home are discharged from the
           programme (immediately after the intervention), the patients and their caregivers will
           be invited to participate in the one-to-one semi-structured interviews. All the 30
           patients and their caregivers (one of the main care giver) will be invited for the
           interviews however total number of interviews will be decided based on data saturation.

           The following themes will be explored:

             1. Why did participants choose for transfer to NUHS@Home?

             2. What was the experience of NUHS@Home like?

             3. What, if any, are the advantages and benefits of being admitted to NUHS@Home?

             4. What, if any, are the challenges and difficulties of being admitted to NUHS@Home?

             5. What improvements, if any, can be made to the NUHS@Home programme?

             6. Would they choose to be admitted to NUHS@Home if they needed hospitalisation in the
                future? Why or why not?

           Similarly, the care providers such as clinicians and other stake holders as well as
           referring clinicians will be invited to participate in the face-to-face focus groups to
           share their experiences and views of managing and referring to the NUHS@Home programme.
           The investigators may decide to follow up this with in-depth interviews based on data
           saturation. The focus groups will be audio-recorded and would last approximately 60
           minutes. The following themes will be explored:

             1. How would participants describe their work in caring for patients in NUHS@Home?

             2. What, if at all, professional competencies are needed for people to work in
                NUHS@Home?

             3. What, if any, is the effect of NUHS@Home care of patients, patient's family or
                caregivers?

             4. What, if any, are the advantages and benefits of the NUHS@Home programme?

             5. What, if any, are the disadvantages and drawbacks of the NUHS@Home Programme?

             6. What are potential barriers and facilitators of scaling the intervention?

             7. What potential modifications, if any, can be made to improve adoption and
                sustainability?

           5.4.5 Patients who declined enrolment

           In order to understand the reasons for declining enrolment, patients who are eligible
           but decline will be invited to participate in a survey and ask for consent to access
           their health records and hospital bill.

Itemised consumables
Labour cost of physicians, estimated by the average time spent delivering care multiplied by standard salary (plus benefits) estimates of physicians' respective paygrades.
Labour cost of nurses, estimated by the average time spent delivering care multiplied by standard salary (plus benefits) estimates of nurses' respective paygrades
Labour cost of allied health (e.g. phlebotomists, physiotherapists) will be estimated by the average time spent delivering care multiplied by standard salary (plus benefits) estimates of their respective paygrades.
Any additional costs incurred by the intervention group (e.g. telemonitoring, transport of blood tests) will be itemised as well.</description>

    <description>Once a patient has been randomised to the intervention group, the NUHS@Home team will be activated. Patients will be sent home via ambulance, where they will be reviewed by a NUHS@Home nurse. Intravenous therapies, pillboxes for medication, remote monitoring software, and telecommunication tools will be set up as indicated. NUHS@Home doctors will visit at least once daily, and nurses at least twice daily as required. Therapists will conduct home visits as necessary. The NUHS@Home team is available 24/7. When conventional discharge criteria are met, the patient will be discharged. The NUHS@Home clinical team will be under clinical governance of Division of Advanced Internal Medicine at NUH and patients will be considered 'inpatients' throughout the treatment period.</description>
