  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Osteoarthritis is a degenerative, chronic, and progressive joint disease considered as the
      most common joint disorder worldwide. In healthy joints, there is a continuous process of
      natural breakdown and repair of cartilage. This process becomes disrupted in OA, leading to
      degeneration and loss of articular cartilage, along with other joint changes, including
      subchondral bone remodeling, osteophyte formation, thickening of the capsule and sometimes
      inflammation of the synovia. JTA-004 is a plasma protein solution supplemented with HA and
      clonidine developed as a single IA injection for the treatment of knee OA. Local
      administration of JTA-004 into the joint cavity is intended to relieve chronic pain in
      subjects suffering from knee OA and discomfort associated with the IA administration.

      The JTA-004 Phase III study is a placebo and active-controlled, randomized, double-blind
      study to evaluate the potential of a single, intra-articular injection of JTA-004 to reduce
      osteoarthritic pain in the knee at 3 months compared to placebo or active comparator. The
      study is expected to enrol 676 patients with mild to moderate symptomatic knee osteoarthritis
      in 22 centres in 6 European countries and Hong Kong SAR.
