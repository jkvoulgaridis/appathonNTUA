  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Weight loss and lifestyle modifications are much required in women with Polycystic ovarian
      syndrome (PCOS). Yoga has gained great importance as an alternate medicine in recent years
      which is helpful in lifestyle modifications. Weight loss can be achieved by regular aerobic
      activity. In recent years, excessive production of anti-mullerian hormone (AMH) has been
      considered as the etiology of PCOS. AMH is also emerging as a diagnostic and screening tool
      for PCOS. Effect of yoga therapy on adolescent girls have proved to be effective. But,
      researches on young women undergoing yoga therapy and combined effect of aerobic exercise and
      yoga therapy are still lacking. Hence, the investigators aimed t o establish the benefits of
      yoga therapy and aerobic exercise on Anti-Mullerian Hormone and other biochemical markers in
      young women with polycystic ovary syndrome.

      A total of 128 female with PCOS will be recruited by the simple random sampling (random
      number generator) to participate in randomized, single blind randomized controlled, study.
      Recruited patients with 128 female with PCOS will be randomly divided into four groups, yoga
      therapy (YT) group, aerobic exercise (AE) group, combined YT and AE (cYTAE) group and control
      group. Duration of the intervention will be 60 minutes in one session for 6 days/week for 12
      weeks. Thus, each women with PCOS will receive 72 sessions in total, except in control group.
      Anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) and other biochemical markers such as, Follicle-stimulating
      hormone (FSH), Luteinizing hormone (LH), Testosterone, Prolactin, Thyroid-stimulating hormone
      (TSH) Ultrasensitive, Dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS), insulin fasting, glucose
      fasting, HOMA-IR (Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance) and the lipid profiles
      which includes, total cholesterol, High-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), Low-density
      lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and serum triglycerides. In addition to the above biochemical
      markers, transvaginal ultrasound to estimate antral follicle count (AFC) will be recorded at
      baseline and at the end of 12-week post-intervention period. Following the 12-week
      intervention, follow-up of another 12-week will be carried out to determine the retention of
      treatment effects.
