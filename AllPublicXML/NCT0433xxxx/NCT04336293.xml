      The purpose of this study is to determine if synchronized transcranial magnetic stimulation
      is safe and tolerable in individuals with cocaine, opioid, or alcohol use disorders.

      The goal of this proposal is to evaluate preliminary participant response to a pilot,
      controlled, feasibility study to evaluate changes in craving, substance use, and quality of
      life after 6 weeks of a low-risk non-invasive brain stimulation technique, called
      Synchronized Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (sTMS), compared to sham, in Veterans with a
      substance use disorder (SUD). An important focus of this application will be evaluating the
      acceptability, tolerability, and safety of sTMS in this population. To the investigators
      knowledge, sTMS has never been used for SUDs, and holds considerable promise as a future
      treatment option for these prevalent disorders. However initial work in the acceptability,
      tolerability, and safety of this approach must be conducted first.

      This project is the first step towards the investigators long-term goal, which is to combine
      non-invasive brain stimulation with individualized psychotherapy or pharmacotherapy to reduce
      SUD problems and improve quality of life for Veterans.

The Q-LES-Q-SF evaluates general activities that are assessed in the longer form of the Q- LES-Q. Each item uses a 5-point scale ranging from 1 (very poor) to 5 (very good). A total score is derived from 14 items with a maximum score of 70 and with higher scores indicating greater life satisfaction and enjoyment.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Eligible male and female Veterans

          -  between ages 18-70,

          -  Veterans who currently meet criteria for SUD, and, if applicable, have stable
             treatment regimen (i.e., medications and/or therapy) for at least 6 weeks prior to
             study procedures

          -  ongoing medications and psychotherapy will be allowed to continue unchanged during the
             study

          -  for safety, participants must also meet established criteria for MRI exposure, which
             is implemented as a conservative measure given the novel application of sTMS in this
             population

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  pregnancy/lactation,

          -  history of moderate or severe traumatic brain injury,

          -  current or prior neurologic disorder or lifetime history of

               -  seizure disorder

               -  CNS tumors

               -  stroke

               -  cerebral aneurysm,

          -  unstable medical condition,

               -  active suicidality as assessed with the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale

               -  primary psychotic disorder.
