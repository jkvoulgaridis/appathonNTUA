  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is to evaluate the effect of optimized 12-month step-down antiplatelet therapy
      (APT) compared with standard 12-month dual antiplatelet therapy in clinical net adverse
      events, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular adverse events and reducing clinical related
      bleeding events in the patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) who are not the
      predominant coronary artery disease after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).

      This is a prospective, multi- center, randomized, parallel-group trial designed to evaluate
      the effect of optimized 12-month step-down antiplatelet therapy compared with standard
      12-month dual antiplatelet therapy in clinical net adverse clinical events, cardiovascular
      and cerebrovascular adverse events and reducing clinical related bleeding events in the
      patients with acute coronary syndrome who are not the main coronary artery disease.2020
      subjects will be enrolled. After PCI,eligible patients will be randomly assigned in a 1:1
      ratio to either the optimized antiplatelet therapy group（O-APT）or the standard antiplatelet
      therapy group（S-APT）. The primary efficacy end points are clinical net adverse clinical
      events ,or the event rate of the composite of cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial
      infarction, stent thrombosis, ischemia driven coronary revascularization and stroke at 12
      months. The primary safety end point is the incidence of PLATO major bleeding or Bleeding
      Academic Research Consortium (BARC) type 2, 3 or 5 bleeding at 12 months.
