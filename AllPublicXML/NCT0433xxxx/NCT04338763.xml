  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, multi center study to evaluate the safety and efficacy and determine the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of RP72 as monotherapy and RP72 in combination with Gemcitabine
      in patients with pancreatic cancer.

      The study has two arms:

      Arm A: RP72 monotherapy

      Arm B: RP72 in combination with Gemcitabine

      Both treatment arms will follow a standard 3+3 design. Up to 48 adult patients with
      pancreatic cancer will be enrolled in this study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      RP72 (Rise Prot-72) is a small molecular weight protein which directly binds to CXCR1 and
      CXCR2, which are the receptors of CXCL8 [Interleukin 8 (IL-8) or chemokine (C-X-C motif)
      ligand 8] and ELR-CXC chemokine. Therefore, RP72 can inhibit the binding of CXCL8 to its
      receptors CXCR1/2 and further block CXCL8-mediated signal transduction. Nonclinical studies
      have demonstrated that RP72 binds to the receptors of CXCL8 and blocks activation of
      CXCL8-mediated signaling transduction pathways, which decreases proliferation of susceptible
      tumor cells, especially the pancreatic cancer cells.

      In this Phase I study, RP-72 will be used as monotherapy or in combination with gemcitabine
      in adult patients with pancreatic cancer. The study aims to to evaluate the safety and
      efficacy, and to determine the MTD and recommended Phase II dose of RP72 monotherapy and RP72
      in combination with Gemcitabine in patients with Pancreatic Cancer.
