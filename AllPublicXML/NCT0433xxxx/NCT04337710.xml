  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To test the hypothesis that early exclusive enteral nutrition with the minimal use of
      parenteral nutrition will improve preterm infants' nutritional outcomes when compared to
      delayed progression of enteral nutrition and prolonged use of parenteral nutrition.

      Qualifying participants will be randomly assigned to one of two study groups: 1) Exclusive
      Enteral Feeds or 2) Progressive Enteral Feeds with supplemental parenteral nutrition.
      Regardless of study group assignment, donor human milk will be offered if the mother's
      expressed breast milk is not enough to complete the intervention as assigned.

      Intervention group: Feeds will be initiated with a target volume of 60-80 ml/kg/day and then
      advanced by 20-30 ml/kg/day until the total volume of 150ml/kg/day is achieved.

      Control group: Enteral feeds will be initiated with a target volume of 20-30 ml/kg/day and
      then advanced by 20-30 ml/kg/day until the total volume of 150 ml/kg/day is achieved.

      If parent agrees, stool &quot;dirty&quot; diapers will be collected 2 times during this study.

      One time around the time of birth and one time at 28 days or discharge (whichever occurs
      first).
