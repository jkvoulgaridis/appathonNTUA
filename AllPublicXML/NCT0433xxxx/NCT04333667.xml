    <textblock>
      Intervention is going to take the form of a mindfulness-based internet intervention
      consisting of eight modules. The themes include awareness and nonjudgment of senses,
      emotions, and thoughts. These themes were chosen after considering topics that might be the
      most useful for individuals who experience post-traumatic disorder symptoms. Each module
      consists of psychoeducation and exercise (audio records mostly) parts. Psychologist can be
      reached on demand.

      The effect of the intervention will be compared against a waiting list control group.
      Intervention is in Lithuanian.
