  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the present study was to compare the efficacy of three different treatment methods
      in the management of myofascial pain: masseteric nerve block (MN), trigger point
      injection(TrP) with local anesthetic (LA) and dry needling (DN).Study Design: 45 subjects
      aged 18-54 years were randomly assigned to the MN group (n= 15), LA group (n=15) and DN group
      (n=15).

      The study sample consisted 45 patients with masseter muscle originated myofascial pain, were
      selected in accordance with the following criteria:

      Patients were grouped according to the treatment they received: dry-needling (DN), TrP
      injections with local anesthetic (LA) and masseteric nerve block (MNB). Localization of the
      masseteric trigger points (MTPs) was based on clinician's sense and patients' expressions of
      pain. Local twitch response was not observable in all case. This procedure was completed by
      using digital palpation (1.5 Kg), and the clinical examiner's palpation was calibrated using
      a pressure algometer.
