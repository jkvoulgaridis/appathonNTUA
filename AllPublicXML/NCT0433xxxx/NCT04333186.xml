  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inspiratory muscle weakness develops rapidly in ventilated critically ill patients and is
      associated with adverse outcome, including prolonged duration of mechanical ventilation and
      mortality. Surprisingly, the effects of critical illness on expiratory muscle function have
      not been studied.

      The main expiratory muscles are the abdominal wall muscles, including the external oblique
      (EO), internal oblique (IO) and transversus abdominis muscles (TRA). These muscles are
      activated when respiratory drive or load increases, which can be during e.g. exercise,
      diaphragm fatigue, increased airway resistance, or positive airway pressure ventilation. The
      abdominal wall muscles are also critical for protective reflexes, such as coughing. Reduced
      abdominal muscles strength may lead to decreased cough function and thus inadequate airway
      clearance. This will lead to secretion pooling in the lower airways, atelectasis, and
      ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP). Studies have shown that decreased cough function is a
      risk for weaning failure and (re)hospitalization for respiratory complications. Further, high
      mortality was found in patients with low peak expiratory flow.

      Considering the importance of a proper expiratory muscle function in critically ill patients,
      it is surprising that the prevalence, causes, and functional impact of changes in expiratory
      abdominal muscles thickness during mechanical ventilation (MV) for critically ill patients
      are still unknown.

      Ultrasound is increasingly used in the ICU for the visualization of respiratory muscles. In a
      recent pilot study the investigators confirmed the feasibility and reliability of using of
      ultrasound to evaluate both diaphragm and expiratory abdominal muscle thickness in ventilated
      critically ill patients (manuscript in preparation). Accordingly, the primary aim of the
      present study is to evaluate the evolution of abdominal expiratory muscle thickness during MV
      in adult critically ill patients, using ultrasound data.
