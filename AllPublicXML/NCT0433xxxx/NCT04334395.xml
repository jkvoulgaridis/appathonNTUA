  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In asymptomatic Stage 4 colorectal cancer, the treatment varies between many hospitals and
      countries. Some studies found that primary tumor resection had better survival rates and a
      lower risk of mortality. But many studies found significant benefits in survival in sub
      groups of the population such as age less than 70 years, WHO performance status &lt;2, no
      extra-hepatic metastasis, liver tumor burden &lt;50%. However some studies showed no survival
      benefits in primary tumor resection. So this study will focus on survival, adverse events,
      complications in primary tumor resection and no primary tumor resection in asymptomatic Stage
      4 colorectal cancer.

      The retrospective study of patients in asymptomatic Stage 4 colorectal cancer received
      treatment at Ramathibodi Hospital and excluded symptomatic primary tumors such as
      obstruction, perforation that required surgery, carcinomatosis peritoneii, and patients with
      secondary cancer diagnosis in the past 5 years.
