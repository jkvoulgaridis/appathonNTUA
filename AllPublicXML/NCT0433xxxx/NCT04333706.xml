  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will advance a novel and potent strategy to eliminate minimal residual disease
      (MRD) in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) present even after multimodal treatment,
      thereby improving survival and increasing cure rate in this aggressive cancer. Patients with
      locally advanced TNBC are at high risk of developing lethal metastatic disease within 2 years
      of diagnosis, especially for those without a pathologic complete response (pCR) after
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The high risk occurs despite surgical excision of the primary tumor
      and axillary lymph nodes to eliminate residual disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will consist of two phases, I and II. Phase I will be made up of 2 patient cohorts,
      Cohorts A and B.

        -  Cohort A, will include Stage I to III TNBC patients with less than a complete pCR after
           neoadjuvant therapy who will be treated with capecitabine (1000mg/m2/BID; for 14 days
           every 21 days) as standard of care. This cohort will be used to determine baseline bone
           marrow disseminated tumor cells (BM DTC) response to capecitabine alone.

        -  Cohort B, will include patients with metastatic TNBC, HER2/neu-negative and hormone
           resistant breast cancer. A total of 4 doses of sarilumab will be given with the starting
           dose of 150 mg SQ at 3-weeks cycles given 3 days prior to each of the first 4 of 8
           cycles of capecitabine (1000 mg/m2/BID; for 14 days every 21 days). If dose escalation
           is possible, sarilumab will be administered every 3 weeks at 200 mg SQ for 4 doses.

      Phase II is a single arm study in Stage I to III TNBC with less than a complete pCR after
      neoadjuvant therapy evaluating the combination of sarilumab with capecitabine (1000mg/m2/BID;
      for 14 days every 21 days) as compared to historical control patients treated with
      capecitabine alone. There are 8 cycles of capecitabine. The first 4 cycles will be combined
      with sarilumab. The Phase II sarilumab dose will be determined by the Phase I best tolerated
      dose. In patients without bone marrow DTC clearance after 4 doses of sarilumab, 4 more doses
      of sarilumab will be given in combination with the last 4 cycles of capecitabine.
