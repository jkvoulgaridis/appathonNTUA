  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A large retrospective study compared wound irrigation with antiseptic solution, with
      antimicrobial agent, and with normal saline in patients undergoing open appendectomy and
      concluded an evident superiority of antibiotic wound irrigation over both normal saline and
      antiseptic solution.

      The present trial aimed to assess the efficacy of layer-by-layer wound irrigation with
      gentamicin-saline solution versus saline solution in prevention of incisional SSI after open
      appendectomy for acute appendicitis. We postulated that irrigation of every layer of the
      surgical wound separately would help reduce the incidence of incisional SSI by eradication of
      bacterial contamination of each layer which may occur during delivery, manipulation, and
      removal of the inflamed appendix through the McBurney's incision.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The study included patients of both genders aging between 16 and 65 years who
             presented to the emergency department with acute appendicitis. Acute appendicitis was
             diagnosed by clinical examination and intraoperative findings and the diagnosis was
             confirmed with histopathologic examination of the removed appendix.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with appendicular mass, appendicular abscess, appendicitis associated with
             generalized peritonitis, acute abdomen due to other causes as revealed
             intraoperatively, patients with normal appendix as revealed intraoperatively and after
             histopathologic examination, patients taking long course of steroid therapy or
             immunosuppressive treatment, and patients unwilling to participate in the trial.
