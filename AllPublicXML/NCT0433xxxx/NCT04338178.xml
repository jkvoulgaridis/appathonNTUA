  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Since the 80's, the prevalence of obesity has more than doubled and despite progression of
      knowledge, interventions usually lead to a transient reduction in body weight that is not
      maintained in the long-term. These failures in weight management may be partly explained by
      an incomplete understanding of obesity risk and maintaining factors.

      Behavioral and neurobiological similarities between use of high palatable foods and addictive
      psychoactive drugs have led to the concept of food addiction. Addiction is defined as a loss
      of control of use, and its persistence despite accumulation of negative consequences.
      Craving, an uncontrollable and involuntary urge to use, has shown to be a core determinant of
      persistent use and relapse in addiction. Recent studies have established that food addiction,
      craving and emotional eating concern a large part of obese patients, and that food addiction
      may explain some negative outcomes of weight loss treatments, such as unsuccessful attempts
      to reduce calories and early termination of treatment programs.

      Recent advances in neuropsychiatry suggest that an imbalanced interplay between cognitive and
      affective processes impedes self-control and enhances over- or under-controlled behaviors. In
      the field of food intake and weight management, there is increasing evidence that besides
      environmental factors, inefficient executive functions and emotion regulation skills are
      salient phenomena underlying habit-forming processes that are present in eating disorder
      subtypes as well as obesity. This has led some authors to consider disordered eating
      behaviors as 'allostatic' reactions by which the modulation of food intake is used by
      vulnerable individuals to adjust to craving, maladaptive cognitive and/or emotional
      strategies.

      Current recommendations emphasize the need for translating these discoveries into treatments
      to promote healthy eating and weight management.

      Over the last 5 years, a growing base of clinical and behavioural studies have indicated
      that, individually, Cognitive-Behavioural Therapy (CBT), Emotional Skills Training (EST), and
      Cognitive Remediation Therapy (CRT) are promising techniques to decrease disordered eating
      behaviors, including craving.

      The investigators hypothesize that addition to treatment as usual (TAU) of a specific program
      targeting executive functions, emotional regulation, and addictive-like eating behaviors,
      could have a beneficial impact on reported food craving, and improve weight management among
      obese patients.

    <description>Eating Disorder Examination-Questionnaire (EDE-Q) includes 36-item assessing the frequency of disordered eating behaviors over the past 28 days. The EDE-Q provides subscale scores reflecting the severity of aspects of the psychopathology of eating disorders. The subscales are Restraint, Eating Concern, Shape Concern and Weight Concern. To obtain a particular subscale score, the ratings for the relevant items are added together and the sum divided by the total number of items forming the subscales. If ratings are only available on some items, a score may nevertheless be obtained by dividing the resulting total by the number of rated items as long as more than half the items have been rated. To obtain total score, the four subscales scores are summed and the resulting total divided by the number of subscales (i.e. four).

    <description>Addiction Severity Index (ASI) : is a semi-structured interview to assess impairments that commonly occur due to substance-related disorders . It explores seven areas that may be affected by addiction: medical status, employment/support status, substance and behavioral addiction, family and social relationships, legal status, and psychological status. For each area explored, an Interviewer Severity Rating (ISR) is established, from 0 to 9, reflecting the severity in the considered area. A score equal or above 4 reflects a need for additional treatment. ASI ISRs will be dichotomized to less than 4 or 4 and more (important need for additional treatment). The variables of interest will be the proportion of patients with need for additional treatment in each of the seven areas</description>

The map and rules have been constructed so that there are only four variations on a route through the zoo that can be followed in order that none of the rules of the test are infringed. There are two trials. A profile score is computed based on planning time, execution time and the number of errors for both trials. The maximum profile score is of 4.

    <description>Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS) is a 36-item measure that assesses individuals' typical levels of difficulties in emotion regulation with six subscale: (a) nonacceptance of emotional responses, (b) difficulty engaging in goal-directed behavior when distressed, (c) impulse control difficulties when distressed, (d) lack of awareness of emotions, (e) limited access to strategies for regulation, and (f) lack of emotional clarity. For each subscale, a score is calculated by summing responses from relevant items. A total score is obtained by adding each subscale score. The variable of interest will be the DERS total score</description>

    <measure>Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS-21) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (T0)</time_frame>
    <description>Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS-21) : is a 21-item measure of negative emotional symptoms that evaluates three dimensions: depression, anxiety and stress (7 items per subscale). A 4-point severity scale from 0 (did not apply to me at all) to 3 (applied to me very much or most of the time), measures the extent to which each emotional state has been experienced over the past week. Scores for Depression, Anxiety and Stress are calculated by summing the scores for the relevant items. Scores obtained will need to be multiplied by 2 to calculate the final score of each dimension. The variables of interest will be the three dimensions' scores.</description>

    <description>Multidisciplinary outpatient program including several consultations with endocrinologists, dietitians, psychologists, nutritionists and/or physical activity coaches. Patients are regularly followed and educated about the importance of lifestyle changes including healthy dietary habits and exercise in weight reduction and maintenance. Patients are also usually given information about nutritional value of various foods and few simple exercises for decreasing and maintaining body weight. This program is therefore planned as part of the usual care and responds to the recommendations of good practice for obesity</description>
