    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of anti-HER2 therapy plus
      Fulvestrant or Capecitabine in women with hormone receptor positive (HR+), human epidermal
      growth factor receptor 2 positive (HER2+), non-visceral metastases, stage IV breast cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized, 2-arm, multicenter study to compare the safety and
      efficiency of anti-HER2 therapy (Trastuzumab ± Pertuzumab) plus fulvestrant versus anti-HER2
      therapy (Trastuzumab ± Pertuzumab) plus capecitabine in women with hormone receptor positive
      (HR+), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 positive (HER2+), non-visceral metastases,
      stage IV breast cancer. Subjects will be randomized into one of two treatment arms. Arm A
      subjects will receive the anti-HER2 therapy plus fulvestrant. Arm B subjects will receive the
      anti-HER2 therapy plus capecitabine. The use of Pertuzumab depends on patients' choices.
