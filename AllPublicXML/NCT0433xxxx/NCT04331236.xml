  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Clinical symptoms that are often found to be comorbid with pediatric chronic pain include
      anxiety, depression as well as increased stress, obesity, and decreased physical
      conditioning. Integrative therapies have been increasingly offered at children's hospitals as
      part of an integrated approach to treatment. Limited research exits on the efficacy of
      mind-body practices (e.g., yoga) utilized in conjunction with evidenced-based
      non-pharmacological treatments like cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) to treat pediatric
      pain. Hence, this 7-week interventional pilot study was conducted to evaluate the impact of
      combining yoga and CBT for both pediatric patients with chronic pain and their caregivers.
