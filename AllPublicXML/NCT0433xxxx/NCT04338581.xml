    <description>The total body Vitiligo Area Scoring Index (T-VASI) is calculated using a formula that includes contributions from all body regions (possible range, 0-100).

    <description>The Vitiligo Extent Score (VES) is a measurement of the overall vitiligo involvement of the body (extent) and is used by clinicians for the assessment of disease activity. Methodology: Using the VES calculator ( www.vitiligo-calculator.com) , the clinician chooses the pictures that best represent the participant's skin lesions, then the percentage of depigmented area is calculated.</description>
