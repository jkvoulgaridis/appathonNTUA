      The main purposes of Phase 1b of this study are to determine the following in participants
      with advanced solid tumors:

        -  Safety and tolerability of NT-I7 in combination with pembrolizumab

        -  Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) and/or the Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D)

      The main purpose of Phase 2a of this study is to assess the preliminary anti-tumor activity
      of NT-I7 in combination with pembrolizumab in participants with checkpoint inhibitor (CPI)
      treated and naïve relapsed and refractory tumors.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label Phase 1b/2a study of NT-I7 in combination with
      pembrolizumab. The study consists of a dose escalation phase (Phase 1b) followed by a dose
      expansion phase (Phase 2a).

      The Phase 1b is designed to assess the safety and tolerability, including determination of
      the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) and/or the Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) of NT-I7.

      The main purpose of Phase 2a of this study is to assess the preliminary antitumor activity of
      NT-I7 in combination with pembrolizumab in participants with relapsed/refractory

        -  checkpoint inhibitor (CPI)-treated Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC), Non-small Cell
           Lung Cancer (NSCLC), and Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC)

        -  checkpoint inhibitor (CPI)-naïve Microsatellite Stable Colorectal Cancer (MSS-CRC), and
           Pancreatic Cancer (PC)
