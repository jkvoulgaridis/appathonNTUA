  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For participants with CD30 positive Mature T-cell lymphomas who have received brentuximab
      vedotin, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and prednisone (A-CHP) as induction (4 to 6 cycles)
      and achieved complete response (CR) or chemo-sensitive partial response (PR) and deemed
      suitable for autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) as consolidation, the investigators
      propose to add brentuximab vedotin after ASCT.

      There is currently no standard of care treatment to prevent relapse after upfront treatment
      or ASCT for CD30-positive peripheral T-cell lymphoma's (PTCL)s. An agent that could improve
      outcomes in this population would be a major contribution to the field and is likely to be
      practice changing. Therefore, in addition to studying the anti-lymphoma activity of A-CHP as
      induction therapy, for participants who respond to induction the investigators propose to add
      brentuximab vedotin consolidation after ASCT in participants treated with consolidative
      upfront ASCT.
