  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) utilizes 100% oxygen delivery at a pressure greater than 1
      atm for the treatment of various emergent medical conditions including carbon monoxide
      poisoning. The most commonly associated complication of HBOT is middle ear barotrauma (MEB)
      which occurs when the eustachian tube does not allow air to enter the middle ear space to
      equalize the pressure between the ambient environment and the inner ear. Patients
      experiencing MEB usually feel pressure or pain in their ear(s). The spectrum of symptoms
      ranges from sensation of ear fullness and muffled hearing to severe pain, vertigo and
      tympanic membrane rupture. The incidence of MEB, depending on the definition used is between
      2-45%. The severe discomfort associated with MEB sometimes causes HBOT to be postponed or
      abandoned. Last year 27/991 treatments at our Center for Hyperbaric and Dive Medicine were
      aborted due to MEB. Currently there is no objective criteria for predicting which patients
      will experience these complications, nor is there consensus on effective prevention measures.
      At our facility, oxymetazoline, a topical nasal decongestant, is the standard rescue
      medication administered for patients that have symptoms of MEB during HBOT. This is despite
      two negative studies showing that this medication does not work any better than placebo.
      Other studies involving scuba divers and airplane travelers showed that oral pseudoephedrine
      is effective in decreasing MEB. However, the use of pseudoephedrine for patients undergoing
      HBOT has not been studied. The investigators plan to perform a randomized double blind
      placebo control trial to determine if pseudoephedrine is effective in decreasing the rate of
      MEB during HBOT.

      Aim 1: To investigate the efficacy of pre-treatment with oral pseudoephedrine 60mg for
      decreasing MEB during HBOT.

      Hypothesis: Patients randomized to pseudoephedrine will have a lesser need for oxymetazoline
      rescue therapy while being compressed. They will also report less ear pain once at pressure
      compared to patients receiving placebo.

      Aim 2: To measure the incidence of MEB during HBOT. The investigators will also identify
      factors (age, gender, medical history) that could predispose an individual to developing MEB
      during HBOT.

      Hypothesis: The incidence of MEB defined as requiring stopping compression of the chamber and
      oxymetazoline rescue will be greater than 30%. Female sex, age above 60, and prior history of
      ear conditions will be associated with development of MEB.
