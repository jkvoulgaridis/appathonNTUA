  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The incidence and prevalence of kidney failure increases with age. Elderly people with
      chronic kidney disease may have factors of fragility (loss of independence, comorbidities,
      geriatric syndromes) that can complicate the choice and implementation of the nephrological
      therapeutic project. Joint and early assessment of these patients by a nephrologist and a
      geriatrician could help to optimize the definition of care objectives and patient pathway.

      There is little data on how nephrologists and geriatricians cooperate and on the description
      of frailties in elderly patients with renal impairment.

      In this context, the objective of this study is to describe in a French university hospital
      the reasons for the use of geriatricians by nephrologists, the modalities of geriatric
      evaluation and the socio-demographic and medical characteristics (including geriatric
      syndromes) of very elderly patients with renal insufficiency, and then to become so at one
      year.

      Year of implementation of this research: 2019 based on data from 2017 and 2019. Approximate
      number of people likely to be included in the research: 100 patients

      There is little data on how nephrologists and geriatricians cooperate and on the description
      of frailties in elderly patients with renal impairment.

      In this context, the objective of this study is to describe in a French university hospital
      the reasons for the use of geriatricians by nephrologists, the modalities of geriatric
      evaluation and the socio-demographic and medical characteristics (including geriatric
      syndromes) of very elderly patients with renal insufficiency, and then to become so at one
      year.

      Secondary objectives :

        -  describe the modalities of the geriatric evaluation

        -  describe the socio-demographic, medical characteristics (including fragilities and/or
           geriatric syndromes) of elderly patients with renal insufficiency

        -  describe how to become one year old.

      Origin and nature of the data collected:

      - Socio-demographic, medical and geriatric data (see attached document) based on geriatric
      assessment medical records (reports of external geriatric consultation and/or intervention by
      the mobile geriatric team).

      The approximate duration of the study will be 9 months. This time includes the time required
      for statistical analysis and writing an article.
