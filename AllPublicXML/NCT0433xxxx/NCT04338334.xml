    <textblock>
      Objective: To determine the effectiveness of cihesive bandage on the axillary web syndrome in
      improving pain, reducing swelling and increasing mobility of the shoulder. Design: randomized
      single-blinded controlled trial. Follow-up: five physical therapy assessments:
      pre-intervention; post-intervention, 3 months post-intervention, 6 and 12 months
      post-intervention. Participants: 90 consecutive women diagnosed with axillary web syndrome
      after undergoing unilateral breast cancer surgery with ALND or SLND at the Prıíncipe de
      Asturias Hospital in Alcalà de Henares, Madrid (Spain). Randomization: women will be randomly
      assigned to two groups by EpiData 3.1 software. Interventions: Control group: Physical
      Therapy composed of manual lymph-drainage technique in axilla, and proximal ipsilateral arm,
      specific thumb manual lymph-drainage on the taut cords to make them gradually more flexible,
      in conjunction with progressive active arm therapeutic exercises; Intervention group:
      progressive active arm therapeutic exercises with cohesive bandage.

    <description>Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI). The SPADI is a self-administered questionnaire that consists of two dimensions, one for pain and the other for functional activities. The pain dimension consists of five questions regarding the severity of an individual's pain. Functional activities are assessed with eight questions designed to measure the degree of difficulty an individual has with various activities of daily living that require upper-extremity use. To answer the questions, patients place a mark on a 10cm visual analogue scale for each question. For the pain dimension are 0='no pain at all' and 10='worst pain imaginable', and those for the functional activities are 0='no difficulty' and 10='so difficult it required help'. The scores from both dimensions are averaged to derive a total score.</description>

    <description>Cohesive bandage is a self-adherent lightweight bandage, made of a porous nonwoven polyester material. A single self-adherent inelastic bandage will be directly applied at full stretch on cleaned and dried skin (10cm 3M CobanTM Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Co, United States) in a spiral method around the limb, starting at the hand and a layer overlap of 50%, so that the greatest compression was located at the distal points, gradually decreasing toward the proximal shoulder part. Cohesive latex-free bandages will be available for those allergic women. Women will do progressive active arm therapeutic exercises with bandaging.</description>
