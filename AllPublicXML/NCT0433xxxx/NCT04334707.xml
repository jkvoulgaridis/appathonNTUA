    <textblock>
      Acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) impose a significant global health
      burden. Yet, no effective therapies currently exist for AKI, and only a few are available for
      CKD.

      Despite significant effort from industry and academia, development of pharmacologic therapies
      for AKI and CKD has been hampered by:

      Non-predictive animal models The inability to identify and prioritize human targets The
      limited availability of human kidney biopsy tissue A poor understanding of AKI and CKD
      heterogeneity Historically, AKI and CKD have been described as single, uniform diseases.
      However, growing consensus suggests that different disease pathways lead to different
      subgroups of AKI and CKD (AKIs and CKDs).

      Access to human kidney biopsy tissue is a critical first step to define disease heterogeneity
      and determine the precise molecular pathways that will facilitate identification of specific
      drug targets and ultimately enable individualized care for people with AKI and CKD.

      A number of research centers across the United States are collaborating to bring
      state-of-the-art technologies together to:

        -  Ethically obtain and evaluate kidney biopsies from participants with AKI or CKD

        -  Define disease subgroups

        -  Create a kidney tissue atlas

        -  Identify critical cells, pathways, and targets for novel therapies

      The KPMP is made up of three distinct, but highly interactive, activity groups:

        -  Recruitment Sites: The recruitment sites (RS) are responsible for recruiting
           participants with AKI or CKD into the longitudinal study and performing the kidney
           biopsy.

        -  Tissue Interrogation Sites: The tissue interrogation sites (TIS) are responsible for
           developing and using innovative technologies to analyze the biopsy tissue.

        -  Central Hub: The central hub is responsible for aggregating, analyzing, and visualizing
           the generated data and providing scientific, infrastructure, and administrative support
           for the KPMP consortium.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Kidney Precision Medicine Project (KPMP) is a prospective cohort study, whose goal is to
      use deep molecular phenotypes of kidney biopsies, along with longitudinally collected
      clinical phenotypic data, in order to develop new disease ontologies, classification systems,
      and treatments for acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease (CKD). Since its
      inception, the KPMP has sought out and included substantive patient-representative feedback
      regarding disease experience, lack of innovation in new kidney disease therapies and patient
      tolerance for risk levels in balance with potential benefits both to the individual and
      society.

      The KPMP Has publicly and operationally committed itself to always put participants and their
      best interests first and this foundational principle informs and undergirds every facet of
      the study. Both AKI and CKD are conditions that impose a significant global health burden.
      Yet, no effective therapies currently exist for AKI, and only a few are available for CKD.
      The network will utilize state-of-the-art methods to perform molecular interrogation of the
      tissue and to link the molecular data to kidney structure and clinical information in the
      form of a kidney tissue atlas.

      Molecular and imaging data derived from kidney tissue will be integrated with
      clinico-pathologic and genetic information, as well as other data derived from analyses of
      fluid biospecimens, including peripheral blood, urine, and stool. Using advanced analytics to
      integrate the data, KPMP will aim to define kidney disease subgroups in molecular terms by
      identifying critical cells, pathways and targets for novel therapies.

      Patients with AKI or CKD will be recruited from clinical care encounters (e.g., clinic visits
      for CKD patients, hospitalization or emergency room visits for AKI patients) and from
      electronic resources (e.g., existing registries, electronic health records). All study
      procedures are designed to optimize participant safety and will be ethically conducted,
      ensuring subjects fully understand the scope of the study and any possible risks.

      For each participant, kidney tissue will be obtained for molecular phenotyping and clinical
      diagnosis. The diagnostic interpretation will be returned to the participant's primary
      caregiver to inform clinical care, but no treatment interventions will be prescribed by the
      KPMP. In addition to kidney biopsy, the study will involve collection of baseline (time of
      biopsy) and longitudinal biospecimens (including urine, plasma, serum, DNA and stool) and
      demographic, clinical, and laboratory data. Participants will be followed through scheduled
      in-person and remote (telephone) study visits, as well as through periodic review of
      electronic health records.

        The KPMP will focus on participant populations that account for large proportions of the
        public health burden of acute and chronic kidney diseases as evidenced by research and
        federal data.

        For CKD, high priority populations include CKD in the setting of diabetes (diabetic kidney
        disease, DKD) and hypertension-associated CKD (H-CKD). A special population of people with
        long-standing type 1 diabetes (more than 25 years) who remain free of clinically-evident
        DKD will also be included.

        For AKI, the focus will be on acute intrinsic non-glomerular disease, primarily on acute
        tubular necrosis (ATN). KPMP will also include a special population of patients at risk for
        AKI or with early AKI captured by an open (surgical) kidney biopsy performed at the time of
        clinically indicated laparotomy. The rationale for including this special AKI population is
        that AKI often occurs early in the clinical course of conditions like sepsis, major surgery
        and trauma.
