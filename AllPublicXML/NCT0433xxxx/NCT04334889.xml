  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Participants will perform movements while receiving different visual cues. Spinal kinematics
      will be measured during these movements and compared between asymptomatic and CLBP
      participants. Participants will come for a unique session.

        CLBP patients will be recruited through a multimodal rehabilitation program at Lausanne
        University Hospital, medical doctors or physiotherapists' consultations.

        Healthy controls will be a convenience sample recruited using flyers and emails, notably
        posted at the Lausanne University Hospital, the University of Health Professions in
        Lausanne (HESAV) and at the University of Lausanne.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Participants should have a sufficient French level to understand the instructions for the
        tests, the information sheet, the consent form.

        All CLBP patients should present with non-specific low back pain (pain from lower ribs to
        gluteal folds) for more than 3 months.

        Asymptomatic participants should have had no history of LBP requiring medical attention
        during the last two years and no other concomitant pain or condition that could compromise
        the evaluation of lumbar kinematics.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        General exclusion criteria will be pregnancy, skin allergy to tape and a body mass index
        (BMI) that is above 32, since BMI has been suggested to influence lumbar kinematics and may
        provide supplementary difficulties to find the bony landmarks (Mitchell et al. 2008).

        Furthermore, to be invited to the study, patients should not have any sign of specific low
        back pain such as the presence of infection, rheumatological or neurological diseases,
        spinal fractures, any known important spinal deformities, previous back surgery that limits
        spinal mobility, tumours, high level of pain at the time of experiment that prevents
        repeated movements (severity and irritability), or other concomitant pain or condition that
        could compromise the evaluation of spinal kinematics.
