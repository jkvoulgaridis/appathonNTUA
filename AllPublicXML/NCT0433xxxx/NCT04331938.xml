      Researchers are trying to develop alternative means to help patients with headache pain
      secondary to aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (bleeding about the brain).

      This study is an open label, feasibility study that will consist of fifteen patients. This
      study will enroll only patients who have aneurysmal SAH that are secured by endovascular
      coiling. When a patient notes a severe headache which requires medical intervention on at
      least day 3 of the hospital admission, they will be asked if they would like to participate
      in an open label trial to use a bilateral SSPGB in addition to traditional medical management
      per unit protocol. The risks and benefits of the procedure will be explained to the patient.
      The patient will then either agree or disagree. If the patient disagrees, they will not be
      enrolled in the study. If the patient agrees, they will sign an informed consent and will be
      enrolled. Inclusion and exclusion criteria will be reviewed before enrolling a patient. The
      patients will first rate their pain from 0-10 on the numeric rating scale (NRS) (10 being the
      most severe). If their pain is at a level 5 or more and it is not responsive to traditional
      medical therapies, they will be a candidate for the study. The patients will receive
      bilateral injections as outlined below (5 mL: 4.5mL of 0.5% bupivacaine and 0.5mL of 10mg/mL
      dexamethasone on each side for total volume of 10 mL). Thirty minutes later and 24 hours
      following injection, the patient will rate their pain from 0-10 on the NRS. The description
      of the procedure is stated below. A success would be considered a drop in their pain score of
      at least 2.

      Adverse effects will also be recorded 30 minutes after the procedure and the following day.
      Chart review on both provider and nursing notes will be performed on subsequent days to
      evaluate for adverse effects.

    <description>Patients will receive a 5mL injection comprised of 4.5mL 1% bupivacaine and 0.5mL of dexamethasone (10mg/mL) directed towards the sphenopalatine ganglion. This will be performed on both sides. Patients will be asked to rate their pain pre- and 30 minutes post-procedure on a scale of 0-10. Patients will also be asked to rate their nausea and photophobia on a similar scale. Patients will be reevaluated at 24 hours and 48 hours post procedure.</description>
