  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to validate the continuous patch monitoring system to evaluate
      cardiac arrhythmias in patients receiving drugs that can cause cardiac complications and
      compare the continuous patch system with standard electrocardiograms (ECGs).

    <measure>Comparison of blinded, manual measurements of the ECGs to the patch monitor tracings as measured by the Bland-Altman Plot</measure>
    <time_frame>Through Day 30</time_frame>
    <description>The Bland Altman plot provides a graphical method to compare the question of interest, namely that the measurements derived from the patch monitor are accurate in relation to the gold standard of the ECG.
Each QT measured from the tracing will be plotted against the difference in QT between the tracing and the 12-lead ECG. The acceptable difference between measurement techniques will be set at 5 ms (primary, strict threshold based on FDA recommendations) with a clinically acceptable difference of 15 ms (based on known variability in 12-lead ECG recordings).</description>

    <measure>Trajectories of QT prolongation</measure>
    <time_frame>Through day 30</time_frame>
    <description>Will assess the QT interval every four hours for five days after drug initiation and after five days, the QTc will be assessed every 8 hours
With this data, the investigators will plot the QTc interval (Fridericia correction) over time and determine the time of expected peak effect. Outliers will be reviewed and verified manually.</description>

    <description>Participants will receive standard of care treatment with either arsenic trioxide or capecitabine. They will have continuous patch monitor system (BodyGuardian Heart) applied on or prior to the first day of therapy and will receive at least 5 ECGs for comparison during the first 30 days of treatment.
Twelve-lead ECGs are routinely performed in patients receiving arsenic trioxide at baseline and twice weekly during the first 4 weeks of therapy. These ECGs (total of up to 9) will be accessed for the purposes of this study. Patients who receive capecitabine do not routinely have ECGs performed after baseline, but for the purposes of this study, two serial ECGs will be conducted on Day 14 and Day 28 of Cycle 1 of treatment (total of 5 including baseline).</description>
