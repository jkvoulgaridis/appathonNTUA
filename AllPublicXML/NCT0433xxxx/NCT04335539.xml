      The primary objectives of this study are:

        -  To assess the safety and tolerability of cefiderocol after single-dose administration in
           hospitalized paediatric patients 3 months to &lt; 18 years of age with suspected or
           confirmed aerobic Gram-negative bacterial infections

        -  To assess the pharmacokinetics (PK) of cefiderocol after single-dose administration of
           cefiderocol in hospitalized paediatric patients 3 months to &lt; 18 years of age with
           suspected or confirmed aerobic Gram-negative bacterial infections

        -  To assess the safety and tolerability of cefiderocol after multiple-dose administration
           in hospitalized paediatric patients 3 months to &lt; 12 years of age with suspected or
           confirmed aerobic Gram-negative bacterial infections

        -  To assess the PK of cefiderocol after multiple-dose administration in hospitalized
           paediatric patients 3 months to &lt; 12 years of age with suspected or confirmed aerobic
           Gram-negative bacterial infections

    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, single-arm, open-label, single- and multiple-dose study to assess the
      safety, tolerability, and PK of cefiderocol in hospitalized paediatric patients.

      The single-dose phase will include 4 separate cohorts of patients, grouped according to age
      range:

        -  Cohort 1: 12 to &lt; 18 years

        -  Cohort 2: 6 to &lt; 12 years

        -  Cohort 3: 2 to &lt; 6 years

        -  Cohort 4: 3 months to &lt; 2 years Cohorts 1, 2, and 3 in the single-dose phase will be
           initiated in parallel. Cohort 4 will begin after safety and PK data from at least 6
           participants from the single-dose Cohorts 1, 2, and 3 (with a minimum of 3 participants
           from Cohort 3) have been assessed.

      The multiple-dose phase will include 3 cohorts according to age range (Cohorts 2, 3, and 4)
      and will begin after safety and PK data from 6 participants in the corresponding single-dose
      cohort have been assessed.

         10. Subjects has a life expectancy of &lt; 30 days due to severity of a concurrent illness

         11. Subject is a female who has a positive pregnancy test at Screening

         12. Subject is a female who is breastfeeding

         13. Subject has received any other investigational medicinal product (IMP) within 30 days

         14. Subject has any condition or circumstance that, in the opinion of the investigator,
             would compromise the safety of the subject or the quality of the study data, including
             acute trauma to the pelvis or urinary tract

         15. Subject is receiving vasopressor therapy at Screening.
