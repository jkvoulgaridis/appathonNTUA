  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Transsphenoidal surgery is considered safe and effective and is currently the procedure of
      choice for the removal of intrasellar lesions. Direct transnasal access to the sphenoid
      sinus, without the need for detachment of the nasal septum, provides less postoperative
      morbidity compared to traditional methods. Sphenopalatine ganglion block is known for its
      efficacy in otorhinolaryngological surgeries in which the sinuses are approached by
      transnasal endoscopy, as an important part of postoperative analgesia. However, in a
      neurosurgical environment, specifically in the treatment of tumors of the sella turcica, the
      use of the blockade of the referred ganglion to produce postoperative analgesia has been used
      in a scarce way in the literature. The primary objective of the study is to verify whether
      blocking the sphenopalatine nerve ganglion in the nasopharynx posterior wall provides better
      postoperative pain control in surgeries with nasal access for transsphenoidal approach,
      compared to the placebo group. As secondary objectives, the investigators will observe the
      consumption of opioids in the intraoperative period, in addition to the incidence of nausea,
      vomiting and postoperative headache also within 24 hours. Forty patients with physical status
      P1, P2 or P3 will be prospectively analyzed by the American Society of Anesthesiology (ASA)
      to undergo microsurgery for tumors with a sellar and / or suprasellar location, with
      transsphenoidal access, in patients with an age range between 18 and 64 years old, including
      men and women.

      men and women. As for the surgical technique, both the use of the microscope and the
      endoscope will be considered. They will be randomly allocated to a placebo group (group P;
      0.9% saline, n = 20) and a test group (group R; ropivacaine 1%, n = 20).

    <description>The block of the sphenopalatine ganglion will be performed bilaterally through a cotton bud soaked with the anesthetic solution ropivacaine, at a concentration of 1%, advancing it through the nasal cavities towards the posterior nasopharynx wall. A slight resistance in the progression of the cottonoid indicates its contact with the mucosa of the posterior pharyngeal wall. The cottonoid will remain in this position for 20 minutes, so that there is absorption of the anesthetic solution through the mucosa up to the sphenopalatine ganglion, which, in general, is found anatomically around 3 millimeters in depth from the surface. After the established time, the cotton buds are removed.</description>
