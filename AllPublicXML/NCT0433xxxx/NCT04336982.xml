    <textblock>
      CC-90009-AML-002 is an exploratory Phase 1b open-label multi-arm trial to evaluate the safety
      and efficacy of CC-90009 in combination with anti-leukemia agents in subjects with acute
      myeloid leukemia (AML).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Study CC-90009-AML-002 is an open-label, multi-arm, parallel multi-cohort, multicenter, Phase
      1b study to determine the safety, tolerability, PK, and efficacy of CC 90009 in combination
      with anti-leukemia agents used for the treatment of AML. CC 90009 will be given as a
      combination therapy to subjects with newly diagnosed (ND) or relapsed or refractory (R/R)
      AML.

      The dose and schedule finding part (Part A) of the study will evaluate the safety, PK and PD
      data, and preliminary efficacy information and determine the Part B dose and schedule for
      each arm.

      The expansion part (Part B) of the study will further evaluate the safety and efficacy of the
      CC-90009 containing combination at or below the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) in the selected
      cohorts in order to determine the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) for subjects with AML.
