  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Caregivers of adults with dementia report higher distress, including anxiety and depressive
      symptoms, burden, and existential suffering, than caregivers of people with other chronic
      diseases. Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) is a behavioral intervention designed to
      increase psychological flexibility in the face of challenges. Results from our recent
      proof-of-concept study suggest that ACT is effective in reducing anxiety and associated
      psychological distress in dementia caregivers. In this study, we will randomize N=50 dementia
      caregivers in equal numbers to receive either 6 weekly 1-hour telephone-based ACT sessions
      (TACTICs; experimental) or minimally-enhanced usual care (mEUC; control). We hypothesize that
      our TACTICs intervention will be feasible and acceptable in this population and will have a
      greater impact on reducing anxiety and secondary outcomes from baseline to post-intervention,
      and 3 and 6 months later.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Baseline Anxiety via Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale-7 (GAD-7)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, post-intervention (7-9 weeks post-baseline), 3 months post-intervention, 6 months post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in anxiety will be measured using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7), which contains 7 items with total scores ranging from 0 to 21. Scores of 5, 10, and 15 are cut-offs for mild, moderate, and severe anxiety, respectively. An add-on item assessing the patient's global impression of symptom-related impairment helps researchers understand the extent to which anxiety interferes in daily life. The GAD-7 has factorial validity for the diagnosis of general anxiety disorder and is sensitive to change.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Baseline Depressive Symptoms via Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, post-intervention (7-9 weeks post-baseline), 3 months post-intervention, 6 months post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in depressive symptoms will be measured using the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) to assess depressive symptoms. With total scores ranging from 0 to 27, scores of 5, 10, 15, and 20 represent mild, moderate, moderately severe, and severe depression, respectively. The PHQ-9 has factorial validity for the diagnosis of major depressive disorder.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Baseline Caregiver Burden via Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, post-intervention (7-9 weeks post-baseline), 3 months post-intervention, 6 months post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in caregiver burden will be measured using the Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI). This two-factor, 22-item scale measures personal strain and role strain in caregiving by summing responses to a total score (0-20 little or no burden; 21-40 mild to moderate burden; 41-60 moderate to severe burden; and 61-88 severe burden). The ZBI measures change over time resulting from the progression of the patient's symptoms or from interventions aimed at reducing burden.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Baseline Wellbeing via Experience of Suffering Scale (ESS)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, post-intervention (7-9 weeks post-baseline), 3 months post-intervention, 6 months post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in wellbeing will be measured using the Experience of Suffering Scale (ESS). With prior testing in ADRD caregivers, the ESS contains 33 items across 3 subscales: physical (9 items), psychological (15 items), and existential (9 items) suffering. Total scores for each subscale are calculated with higher scores indicating more suffering within each domain.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Baseline Coping via Brief COPE</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, post-intervention (7-9 weeks post-baseline), 3 months post-intervention, 6 months post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in coping will be measured with the 28-item Brief COPE, a measure of coping strategies used in response to stressors. Comprised of 28 coping strategies, the Brief COPE contains 14 two-item subscales, each analyzed separately: self-distraction, active coping, denial, substance use, use of emotional support, use of instrumental support, venting, behavioral disengagement, positive reframing, planning, humor, acceptance, religion, and self-blame.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Baseline Psychological Flexibility via Acceptance and Action Questionnaire-II (AAQ-II)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, post-intervention (7-9 weeks post-baseline), 3 months post-intervention, 6 months post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in psychological flexibility and its opposite, experiential avoidance, will be measured using the 7-item Acceptance and Action Questionnaire-II (AAQ-II). Respondents rate how true each statement (e.g., &quot;It is okay if I remember something unpleasant&quot;) is for them on a 7-point Likert-type scale anchored from 1=never true to 7=always true. Higher scores indicate greater psychological flexibility or acceptance.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Baseline Quality of Life via PROMIS Global Health measure</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, post-intervention (7-9 weeks post-baseline), 3 months post-intervention, 6 months post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in quality of life will be assessed with the 10-item PROMIS Global Health measure. On a 5-point scale, participants rate their mental and physical well-being with higher scores indicative of better health.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Baseline Anticipatory Grief via Anticipatory Grief Scale (AGS)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, post-intervention (7-9 weeks post-baseline), 3 months post-intervention, 6 months post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in anticipatory grief will be measured with the Anticipatory Grief Scale (AGS), a 27-item self-report tool designed to assess the bereavement experience of dementia caregivers. Items are scored on a 5-point Likert scale with responses ranging from &quot;strongly disagree&quot; to &quot;strongly agree.&quot;</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Intervention feasibility: accrual rate</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline</time_frame>
    <description>We will assess the number of eligibly-screened caregivers who choose to consent and enroll in the trial. This accrual outcome speaks to intervention feasibility.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Intervention feasibility: attendance rate</measure>
    <time_frame>post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>We will assess the total number of sessions that participants allocated to TACTICs attend (i.e., out of 6 sessions possible). This attendance outcome speaks to intervention feasibility.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Intervention feasibility: retention rate</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>We will assess the number of enrolled subjects completing the final outcome assessment at 6 months post-intervention. This retention outcome speaks to intervention feasibility.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Intervention acceptability</measure>
    <time_frame>post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>We will assess intervention acceptability using a brief investigator-created battery of quantitative and qualitative satisfaction items.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Health care and resource utilization</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, post-intervention, 3 months post-intervention, 6 months post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Health care and resource utilization will be measured using an investigator-created battery of items. Items will assess caregiver-reported health and mental care utilization (e.g., ED, inpatient, outpatient) and services accessed or used to support their caregiving (e.g., support groups, respite care, in-home aid).</description>
