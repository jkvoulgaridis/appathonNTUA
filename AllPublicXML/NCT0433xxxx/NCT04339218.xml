  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to compare the one-year survival benefit of the association of
      cryoablation-pembrolizumab-pemetrexed-carboplatin versus pembrolizumab-pemetrexed-carboplatin
      in metastatic lung adenocarcinoma patients.

      This is a multicenter, prospective, open-labeled, 2-arm comparative randomized (1:1) phase
      III trial.

      Patients will be randomized with a 1:1 ratio into:

        -  Arm A (experimental arm): cryoablation of one visceral lesion or bone metastasis
           excluding liver and sclerotic bone metastases combined with pembrolizumab and
           pemetrexed-carboplatin prescribed as per market authorization.

        -  Arm B (standard arm): pembrolizumab and pemetrexed-carboplatin prescribed as per market
           authorization.

      Pembrolizumab and pemetrexed-carboplatin will be prescribed and administered at the dose
      recommended by market authorization.

      Cryoablation treatment should be performed within 6 weeks after the first administration of
      pembrolizumab. No treatment switching permitted.

    <description>Cryoablation will be performed by a specialized radiologist, percutaneously, ie &quot;through the skin&quot;. The operation is performed under general anesthesia, under the guidance of the scanner. The images from the scanner make it possible to precisely insert and place a needle at the level of the tumor to be treated. Intense cold will be produced by the needle and will destroy the cancer cells by freezing (temperatures of -40 °C). Freezing is localized to the tumor, the rest of the organ will not suffer from the cold.
The aftermath of the intervention causes only minimal pain and in most cases does not require pain treatment. As the operation is minimally traumatic, the risk of complications is low. Hospitalization is around twenty-four hours and usual or professional activities can be resumed very quickly.</description>
