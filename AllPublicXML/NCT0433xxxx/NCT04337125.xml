  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      ADHD is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by the presence of persistent signs of
      associated hyperactivity-impulsivity and/or inattention that impair the child's functioning
      or development.

      The involvement of genetic factors has been shown in numerous studies. Other studies have
      also highlighted the contributions of parent-child interaction in the development, expression
      and persistence of symptoms.However, the mechanisms by which parenting practices and
      attachment may influence ADHD symptoms remain unclear.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate the influence of attachment style of the child, the
      educational practices and the presence of attentional/executive disorders of parents on the
      expression of ADHD in children aged 7 to 10.

      This prospective empirical research will compare children with ADHD and their parents to a
      matched control group.
