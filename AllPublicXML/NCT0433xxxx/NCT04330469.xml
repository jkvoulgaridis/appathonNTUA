  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Periodontitis is common in patients with cirrhosis and may lead to systemic sepsis. 1
      Grønkjær et al demonstrated that severe periodontitis predicted higher mortality in patients
      with cirrhosis. 2 In India, the wide use of oral tobacco, smoking and poor dental hygiene
      fosters a dual hit to the outcomes of liver disease especially in the setting of liver
      transplantation. However, a causal relationship between the oral microbiome and liver disease
      and outcomes is a matter of conjecture. Oral bacterial diseases, such as caries and
      periodontitis are caused by a consortium of bacteria rather than a single species. These
      constitute opportunistic infections that occur under the proper circumstances and conditions,
      e.g., diet, host immune response, complicating systemic or genetic disorders, pH, poor oral
      hygiene and lifestyle. It is well known that specific bacterial taxa that colonize the oral
      cavity are associated with oral health and oral diseases or afflictions, such as dental
      caries, periodontal diseases, endodontic lesions, dry socket, halitosis, and odontogenic
      infections.

      Bajaj et al have demonstrated systematic periodontal therapy in cirrhotic outpatients
      improved endotoxemia, as well as systemic and local inflammation, and modulated salivary and
      stool microbial dysbiosis over 30 days. Bajaj et al performed another study on comparison of
      oral and gut microbiota in patients with and without hepatic encephalopathy.

      There were differences in salivary microbiota composition and inflammatory markers between
      controls and cirrhotics. The association between periodontitis, oral dysbiosis and the
      prognosis of cirrhosis remains crucial with relevance to situations like acute-on-chronic
      liver failure and other inflammation-related adverse events.

      The aim of this study is to prospectively determine the association of generalised Stage I
      &amp;amp; II (initial to moderate) with all-cause and cirrhosis-related mortality in patients
      with cirrhosis. We also plan to evaluate the oral microbiome and association of oral
      dysbiosis with complications of cirrhosis to assess if early treatment by dental
      interventions may improve nutrition and outcomes in cirrhosis. Lastly this prospective
      randomized controlled trial will provide insight into whether manipulation of the oral
      microbiome by dental procedures and oral hygiene training, antibiotics- local and systemic,
      use of probiotics etc can alter adverse outcomes, nutrition and health related quality of
      life in cirrhosis.

    <description>Treatment will be performed by a periodontist.
Intensive removal of subgingival and supragingival calculus and plaque biofilm by scaling, root-planing and polishing. The procedures will be carried out with the use of hand scalers and a piezoelectric ultrasonic scaler with universal tips. Disclosing solution will be used to visualize the plaque for the clinician.
One to four sessions of subgingival scaling and root planing by quadrant, under local anesthesia as may be deemed necessary during the study period.
Subgingival irrigation using an antiseptic mouth rinse (chlorhexidine 0.12%).
Polishing of the coronal and radicular surfaces of the teeth.</description>
