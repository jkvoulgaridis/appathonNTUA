  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to develop a test of cerebral vessel function by inducing a
      reactive hyperemia that will elicit a rapid and profound increase in cerebral vessel shear
      stress. The results of this project may lead to development of a test with
      prognostic/predictive utility for individual risk assessment of a future cerebrovascular
      event/disease. This information will be of vital importance to the medical community in
      regards to cerebrovascular health in aging individuals, and testing of interventions and
      therapies that may ameliorate these effects.
