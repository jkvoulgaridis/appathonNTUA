  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      80 young adult men will complete an initial survey and receive 1 of 2 types of alcohol and
      sexual health education and information to encourage prevention of alcohol-related problems,
      HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Participants will then take
      pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for HIV prevention and complete a daily 5-minute,
      telephone-based interactive voice response (IVR) assessment of alcohol/substance use, sexual
      behavior and PrEP taking for 30 days. Medication will all be active PrEP. There is no placebo
      control in this study. Follow-up will occur after 30-days and 6-months later.
