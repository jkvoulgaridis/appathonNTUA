      Although the success of total hip arthroplasty, many patients were dissatisfied
      postoperatively. Patient's reported outcome measures become of a great importance in
      assessment of the results after joint replacement. The aim of this prospective study is to
      evaluate and compare postoperative patient's satisfaction after implantation of two commonly
      used different designs of total hip arthroplasty.

      The investigators conducted a prospective comparative study carried out on 180 patients
      suffering of hip arthritis between 2011 and 2018. They were randomized into two groups of
      homogenous demographic and clinical data. Group A was treated by cementless T.H.A. with a
      large head while group B received cementless T.H.A. with a dual mobility cup. Clinical
      evaluation and preoperative patient's expectation were assessed and compared to the
      postoperative satisfaction.

    <intervention_model_description>This is prospective study was carried out on 180 patients with a unilateral arthritic hip between January 2011 and August 2018. Patients were divided into two groups, each group included 90 patients. Group A included patients received total hip with a large head (32-36mm.) made of cobalt-chrome. The femoral component was a cementless porous coated stem. The cup was a cementless porous coated Trilogy cup and was inserted press fit with primary additional one to three screws. Group B included those received total hip with a dual mobility cup</intervention_model_description>
