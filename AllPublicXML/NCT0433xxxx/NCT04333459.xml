  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A randomized 4 cohort study that is comparing the data collected during the earlier phase
      study and to determine if immunogenicity can be retained with a 1 mg dose of Hantaan DNA
      vaccine.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will enroll 4 randomized groups of 33 subjects each for a total of 132 subjects.
      Every subject will receive a total of 4 vaccinations. Subjects and study personnel will be
      blinded to the group that they are randomized to (double-blind). The study is intended to
      substantiate the Phase 1 results with the 2 mg dose and to also determine if immunogenicity
      can be retained with a 1 mg dose (for HTNV DNA vaccine).

      For the 2 mg dose, each vaccination consists of 2 administrations of 1 mg (left and right
      deltoid) for a total of 2 mg/vaccination. For the 1 mg dose, each vaccination consists of 2
      administrations of 0.5 mg (left and right deltoid) for a total of 1 mg/vaccination.

      Group 1 will be vaccinated with the HTNV DNA vaccine, pWRG/HTN-M(co) at the 2 mg/vaccination
      dose. Group 2 will be vaccinated with the HTNV DNA vaccine, pWRG/HTN-M(co) at the 1
      mg/vaccination dose. Group 3 will be vaccinated with the PUUV DNA vaccine, pWRG/PUU-M(s2) at
      the 2 mg/vaccination dose. Group 4 will be vaccinated with the PUUV DNA vaccine,
      pWRG/PUU-M(s2) at the 1 mg/vaccination dose. Each group will be vaccinated on Days 1, 29, 57
      and 169. All doses will be administered with the PharmaJet Stratis device, which is FDA
      cleared for IM administration of vaccines. All subjects will be followed until 1 month after
      the last vaccination with Day 197 being the final study visit. Subjects will complete
      post-injection memory aids for 7 days after each vaccination.

             military ID, or U.S. passport) &amp; be able to pass a background check in order to gain
             access to the base &amp; participate.

          5. Free of clinically significant health problems, as determined by pertinent medical
             history and clinical examination with ECG and laboratory assessments prior to entry
             into the study

          6. Available and able to participate for all study visits and procedures

          7. Females subjects must have had a hysterectomy or bilateral oopherectomy or must be
             using an effective method of contraception** from 30 days prior to the first study
             vaccination until 90 days after the last study vaccination.

             ** For this study, we define an effective contraceptive method as one that results in
             a failure rate of less than 1% per year when it is used consistently and correctly.
             This includes, but is not limited to, abstinence from sexual intercourse with a male
             partner, monogamous relationship with a vasectomized partner, bilateral tubal
             ligation, or intrauterine devices.

          8. Female subjects who have not had a hysterectomy or bilateral oopherectomy must have a
             negative serum pregnancy test at screening and a negative urine pregnancy test within
             24 hours prior to each study vaccination.

          9. Sexually active male participants whose partner is a woman who has not had a
             hysterectomy or bilateral oopherectomy and has not had a vasectomy** must agree not to
             father a child until 90 days after the last vaccination.

             vaccine.

         13. Have acceptable screening laboratories* within 90 days prior to enrollment. Refer to
             Appendix A for range of acceptable laboratory values. Screening laboratory values that
             are outside acceptable range but are thought to be due to an acute condition or due to
             laboratory error may be repeated once. [see Manual of Procedures (MOP)]

         14. Negative HIV testing (HIV Ab / antigen 4th generation screen with reflex confirmatory
             RNA testing).

         15. Negative hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and hepatitis C antibody testing.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Subjects meeting any of the following criteria will be excluded from the study:

             live vaccines)

          5. Any use of investigational drugs or vaccines within 30 days before starting the study.

          6. Ability to observe possible local reactions at the eligible injection sites (deltoid

             physical condition or permanent body art

          7. Acute or chronic, clinically significant hematologic, pulmonary, cardiovascular, or
             hepatic or renal functional abnormality as determined by the investigator based on
             medical history, physical exam, and/or laboratory screening test

         12. Have an acute illness*, as determined by the site PI or appropriate sub-investigator,
             within 72 hours prior to study vaccination.

             *An acute illness which is nearly resolved with only minor residual symptoms remaining
             is allowable if, in the opinion of the site PI or appropriate sub-investigator, the
             residual symptoms will not interfere with the ability to assess safety parameters as
             required by the protocol. Subjects may re-screen after an acute illness is resolved

         13. Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition or use of
             anticancer chemotherapy or radiation therapy (cytotoxic) within 3 years prior to study

             a single febrile seizure as a child and intermittent non migraine headaches

         16. Have any diagnosis, current or past, of schizophrenia, bipolar disease, or other
             psychiatric diagnosis that may interfere with subject compliance or safety
             evaluations.

         17. Have any plan to have surgery between enrollment and the end of the study.

         18. Have been hospitalized for psychiatric illness, history of suicide attempt, or
             confinement for danger to self or others within 10 years prior to study vaccination.

         19. Have received any antiviral within 3 days of study vaccination.

         20. A diagnosis of Type I or II diabetes.

         21. Suspected or known current alcohol or drug abuse. Alcohol abuse defined by an alcohol
             intake of greater than 3 drinks a day on average for a man, and greater than 2 drinks
             a day on average for a woman.

         22. Unwilling to allow storage and use of blood for future hantavirus-related research
