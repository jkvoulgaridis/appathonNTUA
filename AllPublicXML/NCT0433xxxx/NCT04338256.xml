  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the acceptability, appropriateness, feasibility,
      and preliminary effectiveness of a college course grounded in skills from dialectical
      behavior therapy (DBT) titled, &quot;Wellness and Resilience for College and Beyond.&quot; The study
      takes place on 5 college campuses in Pennsylvania and West Virginia offering the Wellness
      Course during the 2020 calendar year (Spring and Fall 2020 semesters). The Wellness Course is
      an undergraduate college course that includes 14 two and a half hour long lessons, weekly
      homework assignments and tracking of skills use via a &quot;diary card,&quot; and a cumulative final
      exam at the end of the semester. Students who choose to enroll in the wellness course are
      offered the opportunity to enroll in the study and a comparison sample of students not
      enrolled are recruited from each site.

    <description>The course, &quot;Wellness and Resilience for College and Beyond&quot; was originally developed by James Mazza, PhD and colleagues at the University of Washington as a 10-week course. The course developers adapted their course materials to fit the needs of a 16-week semester for the purpose of this study. The Wellness Course teaches students evidence-based skills for improving mental health from dialectical behavior therapy, acceptance and commitment therapy, and the field of positive psychology. Classes meet for 2.5 hours weekly with approximately half of class time spent on teaching new content (lecture) and the other half spent with students working in small groups on practice and discussion exercises.</description>
