      Participants that meet screening criteria will be eligible for randomization providing all
      other criteria are met. Participants enrolled will receive treatment based on randomization
      into 1 of 3 treatment arms for up to 3 days. The participants will have an additional
      follow-up period beyond the treatment period to assess scarring of both Granexin® gel and
      Vehicle gel incisions through end of study at Month 12.

         14. Known inability to complete required study visits during study participation

         15. A psychiatric condition (e.g., suicidal ideation), chronic alcohol consumption, or
             drug abuse problem determined from the subject's medical history, which, in the
             opinion of the Investigator, may pose a threat to subject compliance

         16. Use of any investigational drug or therapy within the 28 days prior to screening
