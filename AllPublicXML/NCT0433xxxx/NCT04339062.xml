  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this research study, Cemiplimab is being evaluated as a treatment for advanced cutaneous
      squamous cell carcinoma in participants who have previously received an allogeneic
      hematopoietic stem cell transplant or kidney transplant.

      - This research study involves the following drug(s):

        -  Cemiplimab

        -  Everolimus or Sirolimus

        -  Prednisone
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      -  This an open-label, two cohort, phase I/II research study to evaluate the safety and
           effectiveness of Cemiplimab as a treatment for advanced cutaneous squamous cell
           carcinoma in participants who have received allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell or kidney
           transplants.

        -  The research study procedures include screening for eligibility, study treatment,
           participant evaluations and safety follow-up visits. It is expected that about 12 people
           will take part in this research study.

             -  Participants will be divided into two groups (cohorts) of allogeneic hematopoietic
                stem cell recipients or kidney transplants recipients.

             -  Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell recipients will only receive the study treatment
                drug of Cemiplimab.

             -  Kidney transplant recipients will receive the study treatment drug of Cemiplimab
                along with the immunosuppressant drugs of Everolimus or Sirolimus and Prednisone to
                prevent kidney rejection.

      The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved Cemiplimab as a treatment option for
      patients with advanced cutaneous squamous cell cancer, but the FDA has not approved the use
      of Cemiplimab in participants who have received allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell
      transplants or kidney transplants in the past.

      -- Cemiplimab is a type of drug called a monoclonal antibody. Antibodies are proteins
      naturally found in your blood that fight infections. A monoclonal antibody is a special kind
      of antibody that is manufactured as a medication to target specific proteins in the body that
      may be involved this type of cancer.

      Cemiplimab is a human monoclonal anti-PD-1 antibody that works by blocking the programmed
      death-1 (PD-1), a cell receptor on immune cells that is involved in preventing immune cells
      from destroying other cells. Blocking the receptor is expected to help immune cells attack
      cancer cells.

          -  Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must agree to use at least 1 highly effective
             form of contraception (refer to Appendix C for examples). WOCBP should plan to use an
             adequate method to avoid pregnancy for up to 7 months (30 days plus the time required
             for cemiplimab to undergo five half-lives) after the last dose of investigational
             drug.

        &quot;Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP)&quot; is defined as any female who has experienced
        menarche, who has not undergone surgical sterilization (hysterectomy or bilateral
        oophorectomy), who is not postmenopausal, who is sexually active with a male partner.
        Menopause is defined clinically as 12 months of amenorrhea in a woman over 45 in the
        absence of other biological or physiological causes. In addition, women under the age of 55
        must have a documented serum follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level less than 40 mIU/mL.

          -  Women of childbearing potential, as defined above, must have a negative serum or urine
             pregnancy test (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of HCG) within 24
             hours prior to the start of cemiplimab.

          -  Men who are sexually active with WOCBP must agree to use any contraceptive method with
             a failure rate of less than 1% per year. Men who are sexually active with WOCBP will
             be instructed to adhere to contraception for a period of 7 months after the last dose
             of investigational product. Women who are not of childbearing potential as defined
             above, and azoospermic men) do not require contraception. See Appendix C for further
             guidance on contraception

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 3 weeks (6 weeks for
             nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those who have unresolved
             toxicities from prior anti-cancer therapy more than 4 weeks earlier, defined as not
             resolved to National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse
             Events (CTCAE, version 5.0), grade 0 or 1.

          -  Participants who are receiving any other investigational agents.

          -  For Cohort 1 allo-HSCT patients enrolling to the study, corticosteroid doses &gt; 10 mg
             of prednisone daily or equivalent within 4 weeks of the first dose of PD-1 inhibitor
             are prohibited. For Cohort 2 renal transplant patients enrolling to the study,
             corticosteroid use is permitted if used as part of their immunosuppressive regimen for
             graft protection prior to enrollment.

          -  Existing significant autoimmune conditions. Patients with a history of Hashimoto
             thyroiditis who are stable on replacement hormone therapy are not excluded.

          -  Known human immunodeficiency virus carrier or a diagnosis of immunodeficiency. Any
             positive test result for hepatitis B virus or hepatitis C virus indicating presence of
             virus, e.g., Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg, Australia antigen) positive, or
             Hepatitis C antibody (anti-HCV) positive (except if HCV-RNA negative).

          -  Kidney transplant recipients with active acute rejection.

          -  Allergy to cemiplimab or any of its components.

          -  Any prior exposure to the phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibitor idelalisib.

          -  Subject who has been treated with immunotherapy. This includes prior treatment with
             anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, anti-PD-L2, anti-CTLA-4 antibody, or any other antibody or drug
             specifically targeting T-cell co-stimulation or checkpoint pathways (including
             chimeric antigen receptor [CAR] T cell therapies). Prior topical or intralesional
             immunotherapies (e.g. imiquimod, talimogene laherparepvec) are allowed.

          -  Subject with known and untreated brain metastases should be excluded from this
             clinical trial because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop
             progressive neurologic dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic
             and other adverse events. However, baseline brain imaging is not required prior to
             enrollment in the study if patients are asymptomatic. Patients at least 4 weeks out
             from metastatic central nervous system (CNS) treatment are permitted to enroll, if
             they are asymptomatic, radiographically stable per the investigator, and on stable
             doses of anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) and oral corticosteroids (for Cohort 1 only, the
             patient must be on 10 mg of prednisone daily equivalent dosing or less, see 3.2.2) at
             the time of enrollment.

          -  Participants receiving any medications or substances that are strong inhibitors or
             inducers of CYP3A4 are ineligible. Because the lists of these agents are constantly
             changing, it is important to regularly consult a frequently-updated list such as
             http://medicine.iupui.edu/clinpharm/ddis/table.aspx; medical reference texts such as
             the Physicians' Desk Reference may also provide this information. As part of the
             enrollment/informed consent procedures, the patient will be counseled on the risk of
             interactions with other agents, and what to do if new medications need to be
             prescribed or if the patient is considering a new over-the-counter medicine or herbal
             product.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, or cardiac
             arrhythmia.

          -  Known non-infectious pneumonitis or any history of interstitial lung disease.
