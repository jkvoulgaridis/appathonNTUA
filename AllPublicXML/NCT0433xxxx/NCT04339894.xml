  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Venous thrombosis of the upper limb is one of the manifestations of venous thromboembolic
      disease.

      The epidemiology and management of upper limb venous thrombosis is much less well documented
      than that of lower limb venous thrombosis.

      We wished to provide epidemiological data concerning upper limb venous thrombosis in the
      hospital setting.

      We would like to know the prevalence of this pathology among patients hospitalized in a
      university hospital center. In order to obtain this prevalence, we wish to carry out a
      monocentric cross-sectional descriptive study.

      Venous thrombosis of the upper limb is one of the manifestations of venous thromboembolic
      disease.

      The epidemiology and management of upper limb venous thrombosis is much less well documented
      than that of lower limb venous thrombosis.

      We wished to provide epidemiological data concerning upper limb venous thrombosis in the
      hospital setting.

      We would like to know the prevalence of this pathology among patients hospitalized in a
      university hospital center. In order to obtain this prevalence, we wish to carry out a
      monocentric cross-sectional descriptive study.

      The main objective of the study is to define the prevalence of upper limb venous thrombosis
      in patients hospitalized at the Nantes University Hospital.

      The secondary objectives are to describe the epidemiology according to the patient's
      hospitalization sector or the endovenous medical devices used. Another secondary objective is
      to describe the clinical signs associated with thromboses and their characteristics.

      We wish to include major patients hospitalized at the Nantes University Hospital in different
      sectors (medical, surgical, intensive care units). After collecting the patient's
      non-opposition, we will carry out a venous duplex ultrasonography of the upper limbs.

      Data concerning the hospitalization unit, the patient's comorbidities, the presence of venous
      tracts or other endo-venous devices, clinical signs and duplex ultrasonography data will be
      collected using a standardized collection grid.
