  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The first study goal is to compare the outcomes between Posterior Stabilized and Bicruciate
      Retaining TKA. Additionally, the second goal is to evaluate the effect of robot assisted
      surgery in both Posterior Stabilized and Bicruciate Retaining TKA.

    <measure>Alignment</measure>
    <time_frame>Preoperative and postoperatively at 6 weeks and 6 months.</time_frame>
    <description>Coronal alignment on xrays. The lateral distal femoral angle (LDFA) will be evaluated. This is the angle between the mechanical femoral axis and the line between the distal articular surface of the femur. Additionally the medial proximal tibial angle (MPTA) will be evaluated. This is the line between the condylar surface and the mechanical axis of the tibia on a coronal radiograph.</description>

    <measure>Knee laxity</measure>
    <time_frame>Preoperative and postoperatively at 1 year.</time_frame>
    <description>Coronal knee laxity will be evaluated with stress examination. Coronal stress will be evaluated with a stress radiograph. The deviation between the neutral position and position under stress will be measured on a coronal radiograph. The angle between the joint lines will be measured on the coronal radiograph.</description>

    <measure>Knee laxity</measure>
    <time_frame>Preoperative and postoperatively at 1 year.</time_frame>
    <description>Sagittal knee laxity will be evaluated with stress examination. Sagittal knee laxity will be measured with an AP laxitymeter (GENOUROB; CE Marked). With a standardized setup, anteroposterior laxity can be obtained by measuring the anteroposterior deviation from the neutral position with up to 300N of force.</description>

    <measure>Knee kinematics in 3D after squat, knee flexion/extension, stair ascend and descend.</measure>
    <time_frame>Postoperatively at 1 year.</time_frame>
    <description>Knee kinematics in 3D obtained with fluoroscopy. Patients will be asked to perform squats, a flexion/extension movement, ascend and descend stairs. 3D motion of the prosthesis components can be obtained by projecting the 3D file of the prosthesis components onto the fluoroscopy images.</description>
