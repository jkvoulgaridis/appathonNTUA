  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to evaluate whether the amount of morphine intake in acute postoperative pain
      following minimally invasive Transforaminal Lumbar Interbody Fusion (TLIF) can be decreased
      with an Open-Label Placebo (OLP) intervention (comprising the administration of sodium
      chloride (NaCl) injections and an evidence-based treatment rationale) in comparison to a
      &quot;Treatment As Usual&quot; (TAU) control group.

    <time_frame>starting on the first day post-surgery at 09:00 am (T1) and ending on the third day of surgery at 09:00 am (T5). morphine records will be read out twice a day (9:00 am and 16:45)</time_frame>
    <description>cumulative dose (i.e., total amount) of self-administered morphine within 48 hours starting on the first day post-surgery at 09:00 am (T1) and ending on the third day of surgery at 09:00 am (T5)</description>

    <measure>Difference in morphine request rates</measure>
    <time_frame>between T1 (9:00 am day post surgery) and T5 (9:00 am, 3rd day post surgery) (48 hours, morphine records will be read out twice a day (9:00 am and 16:45)</time_frame>
    <description>Morphine demand behaviour will be measured by the total number of successful and unsuccessful clicks on the Patient Controlled Analgesia (PCA) pump between T1 and T5 (48 hours)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Difference in pain intensity at rest</measure>
    <time_frame>The two &quot;at rest&quot; scales (for leg and back pain) will be administered every two hours starting after transport to normal ward on the day of surgery (T0) until 09:00 am on the third day post-surgery (T5) and as well before surgery (T-1)</time_frame>
    <description>back and leg pain intensity at rest will be measured separately by two 11-point Numeric Rating Scales (NRS, i.e., back / leg pain intensity at rest), which assesses pain intensity by asking participants to rate their pain intensity on a 0 to 10 scale, where 0 is &quot;no pain&quot; and 10 is &quot;worst pain possible&quot;</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Difference in pain intensity while walking</measure>
    <time_frame>The two &quot;while walking&quot; scales will be administered the day before surgery (T-1), after transport to normal ward (i.e., at T0), at T2 (16:45, 1st day after surgery), T4 (16:45 2nd day post surgery), respectively.</time_frame>
    <description>back and leg pain intensity while walking will be measured separately by two 11-point Numeric Rating Scales (i.e., back / leg pain intensity while walking), which assesses pain intensity by asking participants to rate their pain intensity on a 0 to 10 scale, where 0 is &quot;no pain&quot; and 10 is &quot;worst pain possible&quot;</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Difference in comprehensive pain assessment and patients' perception of postoperative pain management</measure>
    <time_frame>The scale will be administered on the day before surgery (T-1), in the morning of the first day post-surgery (i.e., between 07:00 and 09:00; T0) , after the pain nurse visit 09:00 am day 2 (T3) and 09:00 am day 3 (T5) post-surgery</time_frame>
    <description>will be assessed by the German version of the International Pain Outcomes (IPO) Questionnaire. The IPO assesses patients pain experience and outcomes regarding patient reported aspects</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Difference in requested rescue analgesics</measure>
    <time_frame>After trial completion of participants, study team members will extract the data from hospital records for the time periods of: the day of surgery (T0) till first day post-surgery at 09:00 am (T1) and T1 to T5 (09:00 am day 3 post-surgery)</time_frame>
    <description>will be regularly assessed as part of standard procedures of the hospital and will be documented in the electronic hospital record of each patient</description>
