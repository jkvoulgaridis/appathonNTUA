    <textblock>
      Inflammation of the plantar fascia is known as plantar fasciitis and is commonly seen in
      active or overweight individuals. It can be treated via conservative or surgical therapies.
      Extracorporeal shockwave therapy has shown promise in the treatment of plantar fasciitis.
      Several studies have compared the effects of different types of extracorporeal shockwave
      therapy (radial and focused) with other forms of conservative treatment in patients with
      chronic plantar fasciitis. No study has yet compared the effect of radial vs. focused
      shockwave therapy on pain in this population.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Plantar fasciitis is a common foot problem that affects 3.8 per 1,000 persons in the United
      States. It is characterized by inflammation of the plantar fascia, a fibrous tissue which
      connects the calcaneus to the metatarsal heads, and is often seen in individuals who are
      overweight and/or participate frequently in weight-bearing endurance activities such as
      running. Pain is typically at its highest during the first steps in the morning, although it
      can also occur with prolonged weightbearing. Plantar fasciitis can be treated via
      conservative or surgical measures, although surgery is considered as the last resort. In
      recent years, extracorporeal shockwave therapy has emerged as an alternative conservative
      method for treating plantar fasciitis. There are two types -- radial and focused shockwave
      therapy. Focused therapy creates deeper-penetrating, higher-energy shockwaves, whereas radial
      therapy produces more superficial shockwaves that can treat a wider area of pathology.

      Randomized controlled trials have compared focused and radial shockwave therapy to placebo
      and other conservative measures in the treatment of chronic plantar fasciitis and overall
      demonstrated benefit. Only one study has directly compared radial and focused shockwave
      therapy in this population, although pain was not an outcome of focus in the study. The
      current study aims to collect patient-reported outcomes on both pain and function following
      radial vs. focused shockwave therapy vs. control therapy.
