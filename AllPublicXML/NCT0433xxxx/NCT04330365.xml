  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overarching goal of this Pain Management Collaboratory Demonstration project is to test a
      new Whole Health paradigm for chronic pain care, emphasizing non-pharmacological pain
      self-management that is hypothesized to reduce pain symptoms and improve overall functioning
      and quality of life in Veterans. In UH3 Aim 1, the investigators will conduct a 12-month
      pragmatic effectiveness trial at 5 VA sites across the country to test whether veterans with
      moderate to severe chronic pain randomized to receive the Whole Health Team (WHT)
      intervention are more likely than those receiving Primary Care Group Education (PC-GE) to:
      Hypothesis 1: Experience improved pain interference (primary outcome), pain intensity,
      functioning and quality of life (secondary outcomes); Hypothesis 2: Decrease use of
      higher-risk pain medications, including opioids, or high-risk combinations; Hypothesis 3:
      Engage in a greater number of non-pharmacological pain management activities; and Hypothesis
      4: Experience improved mental health-related symptoms, including sleep problems and
      suicidality. In addition, both the WHT and PC-GE arms will be compared to a third group of
      veterans randomized to Usual Primary Care (UPC, Control) on the same primary and secondary
      outcomes above. After the baseline assessment, masked telephone assessments will be
      administered to participants at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. UH3 Aim 2 is to conduct a process
      evaluation of the two active interventions (WHT and PC-GE) and a budget impact analysis that
      includes costs to implement and execute the two active interventions as well as the control
      condition (UPC) to inform the development of an implementation toolkit for scaling and
      dissemination. Eligible participants are veterans reporting moderate to severe chronic pain
      present every day or nearly every day for â‰¥ 6 months. The total sample size for the
      population is based on our main study aim/hypothesis and is N=745. This breaks down to n=341
      in each of the active interventions (WHT and PC-GE) and N=63 in the Usual Primary Care arm
      (Control). Results of this UG3/UH3 Pain Management Collaboratory Demonstration project will
      contribute to the overall mission of the NIH/VA/DoD initiative to build national-level
      infrastructure that supports non-pharmacologic pain management in veterans and military
      service personnel.

    <description>In VA, patient-aligned care teams (PACTs) or primary care is step 1 of VA's Stepped Care Model in the treatment of chronic pain. PCPs are expected to possess the requisite skill set for management of common chronic pain-causing conditions, which includes biopsychosocial assessment, multi-modal treatment, and coordination of specialty pain care after shared-decision making that incorporates patient preferences and values. Participants randomized to this arm will continue to have their PCP and PACT serve in this role.</description>

    <description>Participants will be randomly assigned at the individual level to either WHT, PC-GE or Usual Primary Care, stratified by site, sex, and use of prescribed opioids for chronic pain. The follow-up period for the three arms will be 12 months. The primary outcome is change in pain interference. Secondary outcomes include change in pain intensity, functioning, quality of life, changes in use of pain medications, including opioids (if applicable) and changes in nonpharmacological pain self-management activities. After the baseline assessment, masked telephone assessments will be administered to participants at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months.</description>
