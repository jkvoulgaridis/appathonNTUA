    <textblock>
      Peripheral nerve blocks are becoming increasingly popular for hip surgery anesthesia. Modern
      regional anesthesia for major hip surgery includes the use of a single shot and continuous
      epidural or spinal injections, continuous lumbar plexus blockade and continuous peripheral
      blockade of the femoral nerve (FN), fascia iliaca (FI) block, 3-in-1 FN block and sciatic
      nerve. The use of either single shot or continuous peripheral nerve blocks are becoming
      increasingly popular.

      This study will be conducted to evaluate the effect of ultrasound guided pericapsular nerve
      group block in hip arthroplasty surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hip joint is richly innervated, and the pain following hip arthroplasty is particularly
      severe. Effective postoperative analgesic technique especially in an elderly with significant
      comorbidities is challenging. (1) Peripheral nerve blocks are becoming increasingly popular
      for hip surgery anesthesia. Modern regional anesthesia for major hip surgery includes the use
      of a single shot and continuous epidural or spinal injections, continuous lumbar plexus
      blockade and continuous peripheral blockade of the femoral nerve (FN), fascia iliaca (FI)
      block, 3-in-1 FN block and sciatic nerve. The use of either single shot or continuous
      peripheral nerve blocks are becoming increasingly popular. (2) These techniques have shown
      effective and safe postoperative pain control, resulting in lower opioid consumption,
      improved earlier rehabilitation and high patient satisfaction. (3) Pericapsular nerve group
      (PENG) block has been recently recommended by Giron-Arango et al. for use as postoperative
      analgesia in hip surgeries. It is a new regional anesthesia method based on blocking the
      articular branches of femoral nerve (FN) and accessory obturator nerve(AON) and obturator
      nerve in the region between the anterior inferior iliac spine (AIIS) and ilio-pubic eminence
      (IPE).The anterior capsule is the most richly innervated section of the joint suggesting
      these nerves should be the main targets for hip analgesia. (4)

    <description>The regional block will be performed with the patient in the supine position under complete sterile technique. A low frequency curvilinear ultrasound probe will be initially placed in a transverse plane over the anterior inferior iliacspine (AIIS) and then aligned with the pubic ramus by rotating the probe counterclockwise approximately 45 degrees. In this view, the iliopubic eminance(IPE), the iliopsoas muscle and tendon, the femoral artery, and pectineus muscle will observed.
A 22-gauge, 80-mm needle will be inserted from lateral to medial in an in-plane approach to place the tip in the musculofascial plane between the psoas tendon anteriorly and the pubic ramus posteriorly after local infiltration of the site of the block with 3 ml lidocaine 2%. Following negative aspiration,the normal saline solution will injected in 5-mL increments while observing for adequate fluid spread in this plane.</description>
