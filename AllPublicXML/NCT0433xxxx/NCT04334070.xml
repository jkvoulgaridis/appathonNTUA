  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lamprene®/Clofazimine, is a product of the pharmaceutical company named Novartis
      Pharmaceuticals Corporation. Lamprene®/Clofazimine is approved by FDA (the U.S Food and Drug
      Administration) for the treatment of leprosy. It is no longer available through pharmacies in
      the US. It is being tested in non-Novartis clinical studies for drug resistant tuberculosis
      and non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM).

      To be eligible for participation in this expanded access program, patients must have an NTM
      diagnosis. The treating physician has decided that this infection can be treated with
      Lamprene®/Clofazimine. This medicine is provided to the physician in an expanded access
      program. This means that this medicine is not registered for the treatment of NTM, but it can
      be used in special situations where there are no other possible treatments. For example, this
      may be because the patient has a type of Mycobacterial infection that is resistant or failed
      to respond optimally to other drugs, or because the patient has had side effects that prevent
      the use of other drugs. The physician must submit a patient registration form to initiate the
      patient approval process.

    <description>All participants will receive Lamprene/clofazimine 50 mg capsules. The recommended dose of clofazimine for this program is 100 mg once daily, administered orally, preferably with meals. Duration of treatment will be decided by the treating physician. When considering clofazimine for the treatment of NTM infection, clofazimine is to be administered as part of a multi-drug regimen.</description>

             performed.

          3. Patients previously diagnosed with NTM infection with local or disseminated
             infection(i.e. patients with any NTM species at any site of infection)

          4. Patients who failed or are intolerant of prior therapies or who have baseline
             macrolide resistance or for whom an appropriate regimen cannot otherwise be devised

          5. Male patients (including vasectomized patients) who agree to use a condom during
             intercourse while taking clofazimine treatment and for at least 4 months after
             stopping treatment with clofazimine

          6. Female patients of child-bearing potential with negative pregnancy test before
             clofazimine treatment initiation and who confirm no intention to become pregnant
             during the treatment with clofazimine, by using highly effective methods of
             contraception (methods that result in less than 1% pregnancy rates) while taking
             clofazimine treatment and for at least 4 months after stopping treatment with
             clofazimine

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. History of hypersensitivity to any drugs or metabolites of similar chemical classes as
             clofazimine

          2. History or current diagnosis of clinically significant ECG abnormalities that pose a
             safety risk for the patient, such as clinically significant cardiac arrhythmias
             (e.g.,sustained ventricular tachycardia, second or third degree heart block without a
             pacemaker)

          3. History or additional risk factors for Torsades de Pointes such as heart failure,
             clinically relevant hypokalemia, familial long QT syndrome or known family history of
             Torsades de Pointes

          4. Confirmed demonstration of resting QTcF &gt;500 msec at screening

          5. Any condition (social, psychiatric, or medical) which in the opinion of the treating
             physician would make participation in this MPP unsafe

          6. Unable to swallow capsules

          7. HIV-infected patients with disseminated NTM infection

          8. Life expectancy less than 6 months
