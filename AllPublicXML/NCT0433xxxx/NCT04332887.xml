  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This RCT study aims to examine effects of a multidimensional exercise program in heart
      surgical patients. The following hypotheses were tested: patients who received the exercise
      program will report significant improvement in frailty, social support, anxiety and
      depression, quality of life after the 12-week program. Subjects are randomly assigned to the
      intervention or control group. Patients in the intervention group will receive a 12 week
      exercise program. Data are collected by physical indicators and a structural questionnaire to
      measure frailty, social support, anxiety and depression, quality of life, and nutritional
      assessment at baseline, 6 weeks, 12 weeks and 24 weeks after surgery.

      This study aims to develop multidimensional exercise program, and examine the effects of an
      exercise program in heart surgical patients. An experimental design is used. Subjects are
      selected using a purposeful sampling and are randomly assigned to the intervention or control
      group by using block size randomization method. Patients in the intervention group will
      receive a 12 week exercise program including: individual consultation, teaching exercise
      which contain walking and resistance exercise by using elastic bands and elastic balls. Data
      are collected by physical indicators and a structural questionnaire to measure frailty,
      quality of life, social support, anxiety and depression, symptom distress at baseline, 6
      weeks, 12 weeks and 24 weeks after surgery . Data analysis includes descriptive statistics,
      Pearson correlation coefficient, independent t test, chi square, one way ANOVA and
      generalized estimating equation.

    <time_frame>baseline, 6week, 12 week, 24week</time_frame>
    <description>Changes from baseline Fried's Phenotype of Frailty scores including five indicators: weight loss, exhaustion, weakness, slowness, and low physical activity, at 6 weeks, 12 weeks, 24 weeks. Each indicator was identified as positive and negative. Frailty was defined if more than 2 indicators were positive. Pre-frailty was defined if one indicator was positive.</description>

    <measure>Changes in symptoms distress scores</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 6week, 12 week, 24week</time_frame>
    <description>Changes from baseline symptoms distress scale at 6 weeks, 12 weeks, 24 weeks. Symptoms distress scale contains 17 common symptoms items, each item use Likert scale five point scoring, the total scores ranged from 17 to 85, the higher scores indicate worse symptom distress.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in health related quality of life (SF-12) scores</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 6 weeks, 12 weeks, 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Changes from baseline SF-12 divide into Physical Health Composite scale(PCS) and Mental Health composite scale(MCS), and the total scores ranged from 0 to 100, the higher scores indicate better quality of life at 6 weeks, 12 weeks, 24 weeks.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in anxiety and depression scores</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 6 weeks, 12 weeks, 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Changes from baseline hospital anxiety and depression scale at 6 weeks, 12 weeks, 24 weeks. The hospital anxiety and depression scale contains 14 questions(7 for assess anxiety and 7 for assess depression), each item use Likert scale four point scoring, the total scores ranged from 0 to 21, the higher scores indicate more severe anxiety and depression level.</description>
