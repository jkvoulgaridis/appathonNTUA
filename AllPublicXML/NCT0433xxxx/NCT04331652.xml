      This study aimed to the feasibility of polypectomy without anesthesia using a 15 Ch.
      resectoscope in women with uterine polyps.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Endometrial polyps are frequent gynecological pathologies leading to metrorrhagia,
      infertility, miscarriages and the risk of transformation into malignant pathology. The
      discovery of an endometrial polyp requires its removal.

      The treatment of endometrial polyps is conventionally carried out by hysteroscopic resection
      under general anesthesia with a bipolar resector of 22 Charrières (Ch) or more after dilation
      of the uterine cervix in the operating room.

      Following the recent appearance of a 15 Ch. bipolar mini-resectoscope, it seems that uterine
      dilation and anesthesia could be avoided by reducing the caliber of the instrument.

    <description>Premedication: paracetamol 1g oral. Patient will undergo polypectomy without anesthesia. During the procedure, pain will be monitored using a pain assessment scale from 0 to 10 (0 meaning no pain and 10 meaning maximum pain imaginable). At any time, if the patient express a pain strictly superior to 4 an analgo-sedation will be proposed and/or general anesthesia.
Pulse and blood pressure will be monitored. Assessment of patient satisfaction after the intervention.</description>
