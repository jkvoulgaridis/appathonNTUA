  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a retrospective, translational, proof-of-concept study on tumor biopsies done on
      patients affected by mCRC and exhibiting RAS mutation.

      For each patient it will be selected the tissue biopsies of primary tumour and of paired
      resected metastasis.

      the study implies the subdivision into three groups with a 1:1:1 ratio.

        -  The first group includes patients treated with surgery of the primary tumor, neoadjuvant
           chemotherapy plus bevacizumab and, finally, the surgical resection of liver metastasis.

        -  The second group is similar to group one, with the exception that patients were not
           treated with a bevacizumab-based regimen.

        -  The third group, the control group, includes patients presenting with synchronous
           primary tumour and metastasis resected without any preoperative systemic therapy

      Genomic DNA from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues from the primary tumor and
      metastatic lesions will be extracted. The genomic DNA will be assessed for the RAS mutational
      status in a quantitative and qualitative manner using two different approaches: a real-time
      PCR approach using the SensiScreen® kit (PentaBase Aps) and a next-generation sequencing
      approach using the Ion Torrent platform by applying the Ion AmpliSeq™ Cancer Hotspot Panel v2
      (ThermoFisher Scientific). The real-time PCR is able to provide the relative quantification
      of the RAS mutant allele by comparing the Ct value of the mutation with respect to the Ct of
      the reference gene. This ratio will be calculated for both the primary tumor and for the
      metastasis and then compared. Ion Torrent gives directly the percentage of the mutant allele
      in each sample. Furthermore, the Cancer Hotspot Panel v2 provides data (both quantitative and
      qualitative) about the mutational status of additional 49 genes, including the most relevant
      and frequently mutated genes in CRC (i.e.: APC, TP53, PIK3CA, BRAF and PTEN) and the relative
      mutational pattern of the primary tumor and the one of the distant metastasis will be
      compared.

               -  first-line chemotherapy without bevacizumab before resection of liver
                  metastastes;
