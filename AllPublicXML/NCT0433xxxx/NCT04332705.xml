  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It has been reported that Cryptosporidium parvum, a species of a protozoan frequently
      isolated from humans and animals, is able to induce digestive adenocarcinoma in a rodent
      model. Consistently, some epidemiological studies have reported an association with
      cryptosporidiosis in patients with colorectal adenocarcinoma. However, the correlation
      between cryptosporidiosis and human digestive cancer remains unclear at this time, and it is
      not known whether this intracellular parasite, considered an opportunistic agent, is able to
      induce gastrointestinal malignancies in humans. In order to add new arguments for a probable
      association between cryptosporidiosis and digestive human cancer, the main aim of this study
      is to determine prevalence and to identify species of Cryptosporidium among a French
      digestive cancer population.

    <time_frame>3 years</time_frame>
    <description>Because Cryptosporidium is an opportunistic agent that causes significant morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised patients, it is possible that individuals with malignancies, have a higher risk of developing infection with this parasite, especially when their immunosuppression is more severe. To rule out this possibility this association will be determined.</description>
