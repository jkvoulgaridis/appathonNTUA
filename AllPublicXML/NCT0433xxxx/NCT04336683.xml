  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Brachytherapy treatment in gynecological cancers is an essential component to delivering
      adequate doses of radiation to a tumour while sparing normal tissue. Interstitial and
      intracavitary brachytherapy is often needed in advanced or recurrent disease, in cases where
      intrauterine brachytherapy may not deliver the optimal outcome. Interstitial brachytherapy is
      based on a defined template-and-needle system, and the procedure relies on clinical
      examination and pre-treatment imaging to guide needle insertion. There is currently no
      standard image-guided process to help direct needles in the pelvis. The investigators propose
      a 3D ultrasound device that will provide real-time imaging for the brachytherapy procedure
      which will aid in avoiding needle insertion into pelvic organs and result in optimal dose
      coverage to the tumour.

      This is an efficacy study to optimize the use of three-dimensional ultrasound imaging for
      interstitial and intracavitary brachytherapy. In this study, 3DUS images will be acquired
      during the regular clinical procedure to assess the quality of the images, anatomical detail
      and location of needles. The acquired images will be analyzed post-treatment and fused with
      pre-treatment MRI, and post-treatment CT scans to develop a virtual simulated radiation
      treatment plan, and to verify the applicator positions.

    <description>Standard of care in interstitial or intracavitary brachytherapy is to insert the brachytherapy needle and applicator with no standard real-time image guidance. Interstitial brachytherapy is done under general anesthesia. Trans-abdominal and trans-rectal standard 2D ultrasound is used in some cases, but is typically not consistent and therefore its value is limited. Pre-procedure imaging in the form of MRI is used to help guide needles insertion as well as the clinical exam. Post-procedure CT is done for radiation planning</description>

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with locally advanced or recurrent gynecological malignancies who are offered
             interstitial or intracavitary brachytherapy treatment. These typically would include
             patients with primary or recurrent vaginal cancers, endometrial cancers or cervical
             cancers. Histologies of these cancers are typically adenocarcinomas or squamous cell
             carcinomas

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Above patients who are not offered interstitial or intracavitary brachytherapy as a
             treatment modality
