  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The use of virtual reality technology in a telerehabilitation service is not well established
      in Singapore. This feasibility trial aims to evaluate the benefits of using Jintronix to
      deliver a clinic-to-home, caregiver-supervised and individualised exercise telerehabilitation
      program to complement outpatient services and improve clinical outcomes for post-stroke
      users.

B. Additional comments with regards to participants' experiences in the study, if any, were also collected.</description>

    <description>2 consecutive phases of intervention for all participants using Jintronix virtual reality telerehabilitation software.
Phase 1 consisted of 9 (3/week for 3 weeks) 45-min/session clinic-based sessions conducted by study team therapist, with concurrent caregiver training.
Phase 2 consisted of 20 (5/week for 4 weeks) 45min/session home-based sessions supervised by trained caregiver, with telemonitoring by study team therapist.</description>

    <intervention_name>Jintronix Virtual Reality Telerehabilitation System</intervention_name>
    <description>System consists of an internet-based rehabilitation software linked to a Microsoft Kinect camera for motion detection.
Study team therapist prescribed a list of guided exercises and therapeutic activities (games) for training of whole body, lower and upper extremities. These can be done in sitting or standing, depending on individual participant's capacity.
Telemonitoring is done by study team therapist during each of the training day (Mondays-Fridays) of the home-based training phase. Training performance results are reviewed and training games are adjusted or changed to optimise home training.</description>
