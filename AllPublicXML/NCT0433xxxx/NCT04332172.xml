  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to find out if a technology-delivered, brief,
      interactive, motivational intervention helps pregnant women reduce their alcohol use, and if
      it helps them to have a healthier pregnancy. The single baseline brief intervention session
      uses interactive motivational strategies such as normed feedback, eliciting &quot;change talk,&quot;
      and identifying specific change goals. The investigators also hope to identify whether
      additional sessions, and/or follow-up text messages, can make the brief intervention more
      effective.

    <textblock>
      Participants will be 384 pregnant women age 18 or older who score positive on a frequently
      used and well-validated screening tool for alcohol use risk in pregnancy (the T-ACE). In
      addition, participants must report either (a) any drinking since becoming pregnant, or (b)
      having 4 or more drinks at a time at least once in the month before becoming pregnant. To be
      eligible for the study, participants must also report smartphone ownership, willingness to
      receive study-related text messages and to use their smartphone for remote
      follow-ups/boosters, and being at 20 weeks gestation or less. Participants will be excluded
      if they are not planning to carry the pregnancy to term, plan to deliver at a hospital not
      associated with the Henry Ford or Yale-New Haven Health Systems, are pregnant with more than
      a single fetus, or are unable to communicate in English. Participants will be recruited from
      either the Henry Ford New Center One clinic in Detroit, or from the Women's Center/Obstetrics
      Clinics at the Long Wharf Medical Center, which are part of Yale University.

      At the Detroit site, women presenting for care at the study site (a Women's Health Clinic)
      are currently being asked to complete electronic self-screening under a separate program.
      Those who meet inclusion criteria will be asked if they are willing to meet with an RA to
      learn more about the study. At the New Haven site, the RA will directly introduce the study
      to women in the waiting area. All those expressing interest at either site will be brought by
      the RA to a private room to be screened for nonsensitive inclusion and exclusion criteria
      (age, planning to deliver at a study-affiliated hospital, etc.). Women meeting initial
      criteria and expressing continued interest will be given an iPad mini (with disposable
      earbuds, to enhance privacy) that will present a voice-enabled screening consent information
      sheet. For those who click &quot;I agree&quot; at the end of this information sheet, the iPad will
      present a brief screener consisting of the T-ACE and questions about drinking prior to
      pregnancy as well as in the past month. Patients who meet the final inclusion criteria (T-ACE
      positive and either drinking weekly or more in the past month, or having 4 or more drinks at
      a time at least monthly in the 12 months before becoming pregnant) will be offered the full
      trial, consent for which will again be presented via iPad and which again will proceed only
      if participants click that they agree to participate. Participants who meet all eligibility
      criteria and who provide consent will then be randomly assigned to condition by the software,
      which will aid in blinding of study staff. The iPad will then present the assigned
      condition/content directly.

      This trial includes varying levels of two separate interventions. The interactive and
      tailored baseline single-session brief intervention was built on principles of Motivational
      Interviewing and Self-Determination Theory, and is presented to participants directly via the
      iPad, which interacts with them through an animated talking narrator. The e-SBIRT booster
      sessions will be sent to participants as a text message that includes a link to the booster
      content. Participants will be texted these links on two occasions: 6 weeks following the
      baseline session, and at 30 weeks gestation. Participants assigned to the text messaging
      intervention will receive a test message at the conclusion of their baseline session, in
      order to confirm that the software has the correct cellphone number. These participants will
      then begin receiving text messages twice weekly until they give birth, or until they text
      back &quot;STOP&quot; to end the messages.

      Following the baseline session, participants will be asked to complete brief online follow-up
      assessments at 4 weeks post baseline, at 27 weeks gestation, and at 4 weeks postpartum, in
      addition to a longer in-person follow-up assessment while they are still in the hospital
      after having given birth.

    <description>Interactive brief motivational intervention delivered via an iPad. Provides an introduction, describing the purpose and duration, emphasizing the non-judgmental nature of the brief intervention (BI). Uses a high-quality video featuring gain-framed messaging, quit recommendation, and testimonial from a race-matched woman; tailored on race-ethnicity, efficacy, binge frequency, and level of concern regarding her own alcohol use. The e-BI poses a question regarding the participant's willingness to avoid alcohol throughout her pregnancy. Responses to this question will sort participants into one of three major branches, each using motivational principles to promote alcohol abstinence during pregnancy.</description>

A brief (1-2 minute) video tailored on her current status and prior goal will be provided. Finally, the boosters will contain optional goal-setting regarding reaching or maintaining abstinence.</description>
