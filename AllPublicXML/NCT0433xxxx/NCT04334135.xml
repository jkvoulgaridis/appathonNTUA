  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Black individuals are at increased cardiovascular disease risk. The central goal of the study
      is to determine if mitochondrial reactive oxygen species influence blood vessel function and
      nervous system regulation of blood pressure differentially in black, compared to white
      individuals. These findings may help to explain a potential mechanism that contributes to
      racial disparities in blood pressure and cardiovascular disease risk. A secondary goal is to
      determine if mitochondrial reactive oxygen species improves blood pressure and vascular
      function in individuals with elevated blood pressure and stage 1 hypertension.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of hypertension in black adults is higher than in any other race/ethnicity in
      the US, and among the highest in the world. Hypertension is a risk factor for several major
      cardiovascular diseases. Racial disparities in blood vessel function are well documented.
      Moreover, racial disparities in hypertension persist despite advances in pharmacotherapies.
      Therefore, a major knowledge gap remains in identifying the mechanism(s) underlying racial
      disparities in hypertension, and ultimately cardiovascular diseases.

      Our goal is to investigate reasons for the higher prevalence of blood vessel dysfunction and
      hypertension in black individuals, and to identify effective preventive strategies. Excess
      free radicals contribute to blood vessel dysfunction, kidney dysfunction, and thus
      hypertension as both blood vessel health and the kidneys contribute to blood pressure
      regulation. Moreover, excess free radicals contribute to blood vessel dysfunction in black
      adults. Mitochondria are a major source of free radicals. Mitochondria antioxidants improve
      blood vessel function in rodents and in human trials. A prior aging study demonstrated that
      acute MitoQ (single 160mg-dose mitoquinone) restored blood vessel function in older adults,
      however, the role of mitochondrial free radicals in blood vessel disparities is unclear. Our
      central hypothesis is that mitochondrial free radicals play a role in reduced blood vessel
      function and kidney in black adults. We will test our hypothesis using a randomized,
      placebo-controlled, crossover design, acute MitoQ supplement study in black and white adults
      (we will not exclude other races though). We will also measure blood pressure and urine
      biomarkers that are indicative of kidney injury in this proposal.

      Regrading methodology, we will perform blood draws, vascular testing, and record nervous
      system activity before and one hour after acute MitoQ and placebo consumption. We will also
      measure urine biomarkers of kidney function and blood pressure in the hours following acute
      MitoQ and placebo consumption in adults (19-75 years old).

    <measure>Changes in flow-mediated dilation (FMD)</measure>
    <time_frame>Before and one hour after supplementation or placebo</time_frame>
    <description>Flow-mediated vasodilation will be assessed using continuous measures of brachial artery diameter and velocity via duplex Doppler ultrasound (Hitachi Arietta 70). The brachial artery will be imaged in the longitudinal plane proximal to the medial epicondyle using a high-frequency (6-12 MHz) linear-array probe. The ultrasound probe will be stabilized using a custom-built clamp. Shear rate (sec-1) will be calculated as [(blood flow velocity (cm*s-1) *4)/blood vessel diameter (mm)] The image will be recorded throughout a 60-s baseline, a 300-s ischemic stimulus (250 mmHg), and 180 seconds post deflation. FMD will be expressed as % dilation (final diameter-baseline diameter/baseline diameter x 100) and also normalized to the shear stimulus. Allometric scaling will be used if appropriate, including if there are baseline differences in artery diameter by race or condition.</description>

    <measure>Changes in indices of arterial stiffness</measure>
    <time_frame>Before and one hour after supplementation or placebo</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will use the SphygmoCor XCEL system to assess pulse wave analysis (PWA) and pulse wave velocity (PWV). A high-fidelity strain-gauge transducer is used to obtain the pressure waveform at the carotid and radial pulse. Distances from the carotid artery sampling site to the femoral artery (upper leg instrumented with a thigh cuff for oscillometric sphygmomanometry), and from the carotid artery to the suprasternal notch will be recorded. The investigators will also assess forward and reflective wave magnitudes. PWV will be expressed as cm/s and PWA will be expressed as % (calculated as augmentation pressure divided by the pulse pressure).</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) and sympathetic transduction</measure>
    <time_frame>Before and one hour after supplementation or placebo</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will directly record MSNA using an active tungsten microelectrode inserted into a nerve near the fibular head or popliteal fossa using standard microneurography techniques. The raw signal will be amplified, band-pass filtered, rectified, and integrated using a nerve traffic analyzer. The presence of MSNA will be confirmed by a pulse-synchronous signal that responds to an end-expiratory breath-hold and stimulation of muscle (tendon tapping), but not skin afferents (gentle skin stroke and/or startle stimulus). MSNA will be expressed as bursts per minute and per 100 cardiac cycles. Further, the investigators will measure common femoral artery blood flow using ultrasound and mean arterial pressure using photoplethysmography. This will allow determination of sympathetic transduction (the vasoconstrictor and pressor effects of MSNA) expressed as changes in blood pressure (mmHg) or changes in vascular conductance (ml blood flow/mmHg).</description>

    <measure>Changes in blood pressure reactivity</measure>
    <time_frame>Before and one hour after supplementation or placebo</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will measure systolic and diastolic pressure using photoplethysmography at the finger. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure will be assessed at rest and during handgrip exercise. Blood pressure reactivity will be expressed as a change in pressure (mmHg) from baseline to a predetermined time during the stressor (e.g., minute one average and minute two average).</description>
