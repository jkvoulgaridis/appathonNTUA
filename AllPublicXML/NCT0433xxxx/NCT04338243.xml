        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Can fully understand and sign informed consent form(ICF) voluntarily Male and female
             patients 18-80 (inclusive) years of age

          -  Stage: IIIb/IIIc/IV (AJCC version 8)

          -  ECOG Performance Status (PS): 0-1

          -  At least one measurable lesion as per RECIST 1.1

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with characterizedALK or ROS1 activating mutations that predict sensitivity
             to anti-ALK-therapy or anti-ROS1-therapy; T790 mutations is uknown or positive

          -  Patients who have symptomatic CNS metastasis which is neurologically unstable or those
             who have CNS disease requiring increase in the dose of steroid. (Note: Patients with
             controlled CNS metastasis can participate in the trial. Before entering the study,
             patients should have finished radiotherapy, or have received operation for CNS tumor
             metastasis at least two weeks before. Patients' neurological function must be in a
             stable state; no new neurological deficit is found during clinical examination and no
             new problem is found during CNS imaging examinations. If patients need to use steroids
             to treat CNS metastasis, the therapeutic dose of steroid should be stable for ≥3
             months at least two weeks prior to entering the study.)

          -  Prior exposure to MET-directed or third generation EGFR inhibitors therapy Anticancer
             therapy (including chemotherapy, targeted therapy, biotherapy, hormone therapy or
             other investigational agents) within 4 weeks or 5 times of half-lives (whichever is
             shorter) prior to the first dose of the study drug or who have not recovered from the
             side effect of such therapy

          -  Major surgery or had significant traumatic injury within 28 days prior to the first
             dose of the investigational product
