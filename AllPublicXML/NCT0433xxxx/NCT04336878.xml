  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      More than 50% of pregnant women are considered to have a BMI that is classified as overweight
      or obese when they present for antenatal care. Overweight and obesity in pregnancy is
      associated with complications and poorer health outcomes for mothers and their babies, as
      well as risk for excessive gestational weight gain and postpartum weight retention,
      increasing the likelihood of long-term obesity for these women. There is also evidence that
      excess maternal weight and weight gain in pregnancy is associated with obesity in the
      offspring from early childhood through to adolescence. There is an urgent need for simple,
      effective interventions targeting lifestyle which can be delivered during routine healthcare.

      The overall aim of this study is to pilot test the delivery of a brief, habit-based weight
      management intervention, 'Healthy Habits In Pregnancy and Beyond', for pregnant women with
      overweight and obesity (body mass index between 25.0 &amp; &lt;38.0 kg/m2) in early pregnancy, to
      gather preliminary information on the intervention and to establish the feasibility and
      acceptability of delivering this intervention into routine antenatal care and existing
      antenatal care pathways across four geographical locations in Northern Ireland and the
      Republic of Ireland.

      This study is a two-arm randomised controlled feasibility study. Healthcare staff in four
      partner sites will be trained in introducing the study to the target sample and in delivering
      the intervention. 80 women will be recruited and randomised to control (n=40) or intervention
      group (n=40) (20 at each site). Women randomised to the intervention group will receive a
      brief intervention to encourage the development of ten healthy habits in relation to diet,
      physical activity and weight management, plus their local routine antenatal care. The
      intervention will be delivered by a designated midwife at each site or a member of the
      research team, and is aimed to be integrated into appointments already attended by women as
      part of routine antenatal care. Women randomised to the control group will receive their
      local routine antenatal care.

      The primary objective of the feasibility study is to provide a decision on whether to proceed
      to a full-scale, multicentre RCT.

      The two-arm randomised controlled feasibility study will:

        1. Assess the numbers of eligible pregnant women accessing the healthcare services at each
           partner healthcare site;

        2. Assess screening, recruitment and attrition rates;

        3. Assess willingness of healthcare staff to recruit women and deliver the HHIPBe
           intervention as part of routine antenatal clinical care;

        4. Assess indicators of engagement with the intervention by women (self-reported logbooks/
           app data/ qualitative post-intervention interviews);

        5. Assess the acceptability of randomisation to a 'usual care' group and women's views on
           completion of study measures at each time-point;

        6. Assess the acceptability of the intervention to women;

        7. Assess fidelity of intervention implementation across each partner site i.e. was HHIPBe
           delivered as intended;

        8. Trial the outcome measures that would be used in a full trial of HHIPBe (and gather data
           to inform a power calculation for a full trial) including assessment of: GWG,
           habit-formation and diet and activity behaviours up to 6 weeks postpartum; and health
           economics measures, alongside an exploration of the potential for data linkage to
           maternal and neonatal outcomes in each jurisdiction.

    <masking_description>Due to the nature of the trial, it will not be possible to blind participants or intervention facilitators to group allocation. Researchers involved in collecting outcome data will not have access to details of group allocation and we will attempt to retain this blinding throughout.

    <description>Intervention delivered in early pregnancy during an existing antenatal appointment. 1:1 intervention session (15-20 minutes) with the intervention facilitator (clinician/researcher). Participants provided with a self-guided leaflet for weight management focusing on making 10 simple diet and activity behaviours habitual, including advice on food choice &amp; purchasing, portion size, eating behaviour &amp; keeping active. The tips promote habit formation, nutrition awareness, avoidance of behavioural relapse, and reiterate guidance for pregnant women. Participants provided with a record-keeping logbook and access to an 'app' to self-monitor their weight and behaviours against the 10 target behaviours, during pregnancy and up to 6 weeks postpartum.</description>
