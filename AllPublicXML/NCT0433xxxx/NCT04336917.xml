  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative analgesia after breast cancer surgery is a challenge for anesthesiologists due
      to the complex innervation of the breast. Interfascial plane blocks of the chest are gaining
      widespread popularity with the introduction of ultrasonography into the regional anesthesia
      practice. We aimed to investigate the efficacy of Rhomboid intercostal and subserratus plane
      block (RISS) for postoperative analgesia in patients undergoing breast cancer surgery.

      This prospective randomized controlled trial will be carried out on female patients who
      scheduled for breast cancer surgery. Our hypotesis is that this new interfascial plane block
      technique will able to provide postoperative analgesia in breast cancer surgery.
