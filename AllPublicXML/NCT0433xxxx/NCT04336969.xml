  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The 4Ts program encompasses: Teamwork, Targets, Technology, and Tight Control. These methods
      will help patients better manage their condition of Type 1 Diabetes with improved patient
      reported outcomes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the 4T study is to implement proven methods and emerging diabetes technology into
      our clinical practice to sustain tight glucose control from the onset of type 1 diabetes
      (T1D) and optimize patient reported and psychosocial outcomes. We will define a program (4T -
      Teamwork, Targets, Technology, and Tight Control) translatable to Pediatric Diabetes clinics
      in the United States that reduces HbA1c and T1D burden and improves patient well-being.
