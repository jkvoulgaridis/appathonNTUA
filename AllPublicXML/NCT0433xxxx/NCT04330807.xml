  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) induces many metabolic troubles especially for the advanced CKD
      (stage 3b-5) patients and their prevalence and importance grow with the deterioration of the
      glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Among them, muscle wasting is common and multifactorial,
      partially explained by an imbalance between protein catabolism and synthesis. Muscular
      strength is also affected beyond the reduction of the lean body mass, resulting in profound
      fatigue.

      The present study seeks to quantify the prevalence of low muscular strength production
      (dynapenia) in a cohort of elderly patients with advanced CKD, through a maximal voluntary
      contraction (MVC) handgrip test compared to control data available in the literature, matched
      in term of age and sex. It also aims to investigate the link between the reported fatigue
      (subjective) and the evolution of the MVC, called critical force (fcrit) during a fatiguing
      task (objective fatigability).

    <description>The main outcome of the study is to defined the prevalence of dynapenia for advanced CKD elderly patients. Dynapenia will be established when the mean of the first three MVC of the protocol is lower compared to the reference values appaired for age and sex. For reference values of elderly, please see Ramírez‐Vélez et al., (2019).</description>

    <measure>EMG signal</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>To analyze the amplitude of the EMG signal recorded, it will be rectified with the Root Mean Square (RMS) method. Frequency analysis will be performed with the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT).</description>

    <measure>Objective fatigue</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>The nmF is an indicator of the objective fatigue, it is identified by measuring the Fcrit during the fatigability period of the protocol (Figure 1). The value of Fcrit is the asymptote of the MVC curve plotted. This value is calculated for each individual.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Subjective fatigue</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>The symptom of fatigue will be assessed with two questionnaires, the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue (FACIT-F) and the Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI-20). FACIT-F is a validated questionnaire in French language (Kwakkenbos et al., 2014), slightly short, including 13 pragmatically and simple affirmations (e.g., I am too tired to eat) with Likert scale (0: &quot;Not at all&quot; to 4: &quot;enormously&quot;). The questionnaire depicted 4 dimensions (i.e., General fatigue, mental fatigue, reduced activities, motivation) and the final score ranges from 0 to 52, with an elevated score depicted a low fatigue. MFI-20 is a validated questionnaire in French language (Gentile et al., 2003) focused about fatigue. It is built with a balance between positive trend questions (e.g., Physically I feel I am in an excellent condition) and negative trend question (e.g., Physically I feel only able to do a little). An elevated score depicted a higher fatigue.</description>
