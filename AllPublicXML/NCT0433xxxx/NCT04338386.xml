  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      From December 6, 2019 to March 23, 2020, the research group of Qingkun Fan found a novel
      protein(temporarily named protein F) in heparin anticoagulant plasma of three patients with
      heart disease. One patient was diagnosed with multiple myeloma.However, protein F cannot be
      detected by serum protein electrophoresis. Preliminary studies have shown that this novel
      protein F have an obvious absorption peak at about 600nm. Placed at 2-8 degrees for 7 days,
      protein F will be isolated from heparin plasma. To the naked eye, protein F appear to be
      transparent jelly between the red blood cells and the plasma. The specific protein F, how it
      is produced, how it causes disease are still unknown. This study will explore how to detect
      protein F and how it is produced.

    <textblock>
      Protein F screening was performed on anticoagulant blood plasma with heparin Lithium or blood
      serum by in-house turbidimetric method in Automatic biochemical analyzer.

      All patients were followed-up for 3 years by telephones, routine appointment out-patient
      clinic or returning visit.
