      TITLE: Desing and validation of a Immersive Virtual Reality exercise program to improve
      balance in older people

      INTRO: Older people grow around the world at a faster rate than any other age group,
      resulting in an accelerated aging of the population and an increase in life expectancy. In
      response to this new reality, active aging programs and strategies are especially relevant
      and it based in physical activity practice, whose main objective is to maintain or improve
      the functionality of the person, even though the loss of balance in the elderly represents a
      significant difficulty in their lives, since this aspect reduces their postural control,
      increasing the risk of falls and injuries. Our project REVIEM (Inmersive Virtual Reality
      Exergaming in Olders) is a new strategy to improve the balance in older people, using a
      exercise program with Virtual Reality glasses for this purpose.

      HYPOTHESIS: The practice of REVIEM protocol based on balance training in older adults
      collaborates in the maintenance and improvement of functional capacities, reducing the number
      of falls and increasing their personal autonomy.

      GENERAL GOALS:

      1.1 Design and validate a REVIEM exercise program / protocol to improve balance in older
      people 1.2 Analyze the effects of this REVIEM program / protocol, in the short and long term
      in institutionalized individuals.

      1.3 Identify if there is a relationship between the variables that induce fragility and
      functional dependence and the REVIEM protocol

      SPECIFIC GOALS:

      2.1 Determine the REVIEM protocol based on balance training differential effects for 6
      minutes a day (3 days a week for 3 months)

      2.1.1 The improvement of the functional independence of individuals by improving balance,
      reducing the risk of falls and proper development in activities of daily living.

      2.1.2 The improvement of gait. 2.1.3 The improvement of quality of life.

      METHODS:

      Design: Randomized controlled trial. The institutionalized elderly from the geriatric center
      Saraiva Senior Center in Pontevedra, Spain, will be invited to take part in the study. After
      they meet the selection criteria, they will be assigned to on experimental group and one
      control group. Information regarding sociodemographic characteristics and a clinical
      anamnesis of the participants will be collected.

      Intervention: Two groups (experimental and control). Experimental group will perform the
      REVIEM protocol sessions (6 min) focused on the upper and lower limbs. (3 sessions per week
      for 3 months). All sessions will begin with a warm-up focused on the stimulation of
      coordination and joint mobilization, so that the body is predisposed both centrally and
      peripherally for the performance of the session and will end with a stretching routine
      accompanied by breathing cycles calm and controlled. The session will be supervised by the
      physiotherapist, occupational therapist or expert in physical exercise of the center.

      Control group will participate in the usual activities proposed by the center management.

      Assessments: 4 evaluations will be carried: initial, intermediate (at 1 month), final (at 3
      months) and follow-up (1 month after to end the program).

      The contents of the assessmentens will be:

        1. Characteristics of patients: &quot;ad hoc&quot; record sheet that will include data on age, sex,
           associated pathologies and pharmacological treatment.

        2. REVIEM protocol. Safety (Simulator Sickness Questionnaire), Usability (System Usability
           Scale) and personal experiences (Game Experience Questionnaire and &quot;ad hoc&quot; interview
           notebook)

      2. Balance, gait and fall risk (Tinetti Test) 3. Functional balance (Berg Balance Scale) 4.
      Functional autonomy (Timed Up and Go Test) 5. Quality of life (SF-12 Scale)

      Hypothesis : our findings aim to support the use of new health technologies in the field of
      rehabilitation and healthcare for the elderly, achieving a feasible and safety Immersive
      Virtual Reality exergaming program.

    <description>SSQ is used for measuring users' level of sickness symptoms and is highly appreciated in VR research. Each item is rated with the scale from none, slight, moderate to severe. Through some calculations, four representative scores can be found. Nausea-related subscore (N), Oculomotorrelated subscore (O), Disorientation-related subscore (D) are the scores for the symptoms for the specific aspects. Total Score (TS) is the score representing the overall severity of cybersickness experienced by the users of virtual reality systems.</description>

    <measure>Tinetti Test</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Tinetti Assessment Tool is a simple, easily administered test that measures a resident's gait and balance. The test is scored on the resident's ability to perform specific tasks. Scoring of the Tinetti Assessment Tool is done on a three point ordinal scale with a range of 0 to 2. A score of 0 represents the most impairment, while a score of 2 represents independence. The individual scores are then combined to form three measures; an overall gait assessment score, and overall balance assessment score, ad a combined gait and balance score. The maximum score for the gait component is 12 points. The maximum score for the balance component is 16 points. The maximum total score is 28 points. In general, residents who score below 19 are at a high risk for falls.</description>
