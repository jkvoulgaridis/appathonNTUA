  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ready-to-use therapeutic food (RUTF) is the standard of care for the treatment of SAM. UNICEF
      requires that there be no oil separation in these products necessitating the use of
      emulsifiers. The effect of emulsifiers on gut health and integrity in children receiving an
      exclusive diet of RUTF is unknown. The PIs have recently completed a randomized,
      triple-blind, controlled, clinical equivalency trial in Sierra Leone comparing the
      alternative oat RUTF (oat-RUTF) to standard RUTF on recovery rates in children with SAM. This
      study demonstrated higher rates of recovery among children receiving the oat-RUTF. The
      investigators hypothesize that this benefit may be due to the lack of emulsifier in the
      oat-RUTF resulting in improved intestinal health.This research project is a double-blind,
      randomized, controlled clinical effectiveness trial comparing a novel RUTF containing oats
      and no emulsifier and standard RUTF on recovery from severe acute malnutrition (SAM) and
      effects on intestinal health. The trial will be conducted in up to 40 PHUs in Western Rural
      and Pujehun Districts where supplementary feeding programs (SFP) are not currently available.
