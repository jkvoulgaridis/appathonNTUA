    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, Phase 1 dose escalation and expansion study of NOV140201 (JPI-547) to
      evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and the anti-tumor
      efficacy of JPI-547 in patients with advanced solid tumors after failure of standard of care.

      Patients will be enrolled in two stages: a dose-escalation stage and an expansion phase. DLTs
      will be assessed as the primary endpoint in this trial.
