    <textblock>
      CVM-1118 Immediate-release (IR) Capsule and CVM-1118 Extended-release (ER) Capsule are
      proprietary oncology products developed by TaiRx, Inc. for the treatment of patients
      suffering from advanced cancer. Due to the short elimination half-life of CVM-1118 IR
      capsules, the extended release (ER) formulation, containing mini-tablets in hard capsule, has
      been developed to prolong the drug absorption and longer exposure after oral administration.
      The designed dose of CVM-1118 ER was 200 mg per capsule to provide a more patient-compliant
      and safe dosage of CVM-1118. The clinical study CVMEX-001 is therefore designed to evaluate
      the safety and pharmacokinetics of CVM-1118 extend release (ER) Capsule (200 mg/capsule) in
      patients with advanced cancer.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The CVM-1118 ER Capsule will be orally administered BID or TID before meal in 28-day
      treatment cycles. Patients will receive 400, 600, 800 to 1,200 mg of CVM-1118 ER Capsule in
      sequential cohort based on safety and dose tolerability. A single-patient cohort per dose
      level (accelerated titration design) will be applied to the first two cohorts, 400 and 600 mg
      daily, and followed by the conventional 3+3 dose escalation design from the dose level of 800
      mg/day. Within the first two cohorts, if any Grade 2 or greater toxicity at least possibly
      attributable to CVM-1118 ER capsule is reported in the first patient during first cycle, a
      single-patient cohort will be converted to conventional 3+3 study design once and expand to a
      minimum of 3 evaluable patients for assessment of toxicity within the first cycle. Dose
      escalation will occur until DLT occurs in 2 or more patients within a dose level. In any
      cohort, if 1 patient experiences a DLT, 3 additional patients will be enrolled to that dose
      level. If 2 or more patients experience a DLT, no further dose escalation will occur. Plasma
      pharmacokinetics samples will be collected at pre-determined time-points for all patients
      participating in the dose-escalation study.

      This study will be completed and closed once the MTD is determined for CVM-1118 ER capsules.
      However, at the end of 4 cycles, it is recommended that some patients should continue
      receiving the clinical benefit from CVM-1118 ER capsules. Thus, patients may be continuously
      treated at the assigned dose level or next higher dose level provided it has been shown to be
      safe in a previously treated cohort by safety committee, until the treating physician feels
      the patient is no longer benefiting from the treatment, or CVM-1118 ER Capsule becomes
      commercially available, as applicable in the country in which the patient lives. In the event
      of unacceptable toxicity at a given dose, CVM-1118 can be reduced to the previous dose level
      or suggested lower dose by PI. If unacceptable toxicity persists despite 2 dose reductions,
      the patient should be removed from study.

             prior to enrollment.

          6. Willingness and ability to comply with scheduled visits, treatment plans, laboratory
             tests, and other study procedures.

                  patients with lymphoma

               3. Current treatment on another clinical study.

               4. Brain metastases, spinal cord compression, carcinomatous meningitis, or
                  leptomeningeal disease unless appropriately treated and neurologically stable for
                  at least 4 weeks.

          2. Any of the following within 12 months prior to starting study treatment: myocardial
             infarction, severe/unstable angina, coronary/peripheral artery bypass graft,
             congestive heart failure, or cerebrovascular accident including transient ischemic
             attack; within 6 months prior to starting study treatment for pulmonary embolus.
             However, upon agreement between the investigator and sponsor, the 6-month
             post-event-free period for a patient with a pulmonary embolus can be waived if due to
             advanced cancers. Appropriate treatment with anticoagulants is permitted.

          3. Hypertension that cannot be controlled by medications (&gt;160/100 mmHg despite optimal
             medical therapy).

          4. Current treatment with therapeutic doses of warfarin (low dose warfarin up to 2 mg PO
             daily is allowed).

          5. Known human immunodeficiency virus infection.

          6. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV) with evidence of chronic active
             disease or receiving/requiring antiviral therapy.

             immunosuppressant agent therapy.

          8. Pregnancy or breastfeeding. Female patients must be surgically sterile or be
             post-menopausal or must agree to the use of effective contraception during the period
             of therapy. All female patients with reproductive potential must have a negative
             pregnancy test (serum or urine) prior to enrollment. Male patients must be surgically
             sterile or must agree to use effective contraception during the period of therapy. The
             definition of effective contraception will be based on the judgment of the principal
             investigator or a designated associate.

          9. Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric conditions or laboratory
             abnormalities that would impart, in the judgment of the investigator and/or sponsor,
             excess risk associated with study participation or study drug administration, which
             would make the patient inappropriate for entry into this study.
