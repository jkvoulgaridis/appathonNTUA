  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will conduct a fully-powered, comparative effectiveness randomized
      controlled trial that includes up to 600 patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and 600 of their
      family members. Patients with T2D will be randomly assigned to either the Family-DSMES arm or
      the Standard-DSMES arm, with 300 patients in each arm. In the Family-DSMES arm, one of each
      patient's family members will take part in the educational sessions (family members defined
      below). Baseline and follow-up data (immediate post-intervention, 6 months post-intervention,
      and 12 months post-intervention) will be collected from patients and family members in both
      study arms. In the Standard-DSMES arm, data will be collected from family members, but they
      will not participate in educational sessions. In both arms, the investigators will obtain a
      medical records release to abstract outcomes at 18 months post-intervention.

    <measure>Change in mean HbA1c (NGSP%) from baseline to immediate post-intervention, 6 months post-intervention, 12 months post-intervention, and 18 months post-intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, immediate post-intervention, 6 months post-intervention, 12 months post-intervention, and 18 months post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>A Siemens analyzer will be utilized to calculate HbA1c (%) for each participant at every time point (except for 18 months post-intervention, which will be collected through medical record abstractions). Changes in the primary outcome measure will be assessed from baseline to each follow-up time point. The primary analytic approach will use general linear models, including mixed effects linear regression models for continuous repeated measures, to model the mean outcome difference and covariance structures between the treatment arms. Analyses will be adjusted for baseline differences in demographic, socioeconomic, and clinical variables, all within repeated mixed linear regression models. Clustering effects within the intervention delivery groups (i.e., within the DSMES classes) will be accounted for in the model as a random effect. We will adjust for potential clinic variations as a dummy coded variable in our model.</description>
