  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of non-invasive echotherapy for the
      treatment of varicose veins, within local population, using the Sonovein® device. The quality
      of life scores at baseline, 2 weeks, 3 months, 6 months and 12 months will be assessed using
      the EQ-50D, AVVQ and CIVIQ scores. Patient satisfaction at these time points will also be
      assessed.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sonovein® is a unique echotherapy solution, combining therapeutic ultrasound and ultrasound
      for monitoring. The high-intensity ultrasound beam is focused on the vein through a
      magnifying glass. As thermal energy is delivered, the thermocoagulation property of
      ultrasound energy affects the vein wall, causng shrinking and collapsing of the target vein.
      Thus creating a fibrotic seal and occluding the vessel. The treated vein is immediately
      closed after the procedure, and its diameter will continuously reduce over time, becoming a
      fibrotic chord. The treatment along the vein is steered automatically via a touch screen
      monitor. In-beam linear ultrasound probe allows visualisation of the vein in real-time and
      insures optimal accuracy. The study involves prospective data collection of 30 patients that
      will be undergoing HIFU as choice of treatment for their varicose veins / CVI. Questionnaires
      will be conducted at 5 timepoints - baseline before procedure, 2 weeks, 3 months, 6 months
      and 12 months. Subjects will be seen at outpatient clinic post-procedure. Besides
      questionnaires, physical examination and duplex ultrasound scan will be conducted at 2 weeks,
      3 months, 6 months and 12 months to ensure occlusion of treated vein.

    <description>EQ5D is used to assess quality of life based on Mobility, Self-Care, Usual Activities, Pain/Discomfort and Anxiety, rated at 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, unable to perform activity. Inputs from this questionnaire is used to observe for changes in quality of life overtime.</description>

    <description>CIVIQ is a questionnaire based on three dimensions - pain, physical and psychological, based on a scale from 1 to 5 (no trouble, slight, moderate, considerable, severe). Based on inputs, Global Index Score (GIS) will be tabulated, ranging for 0 to 100 - the higher the value, the poorer the quality of life.</description>
