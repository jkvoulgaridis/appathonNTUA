  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients who underwent anti-reflux surgery were divided into two groups. In the I group
      Nissen fundoplication was supplemented with suturing wrap to the crura or the body of stomach
      using two non-absorbable stitches on each side. Control group included patients who underwent
      classic Nissen fundoplication without wrap fixation. All patients were assessed before and
      after surgery using validated symptoms and quality of life (GERD-HRQL) questionnaires, 24-h
      impedance-pH monitoring and barium-swallow.

    <description>In this arm, which included 87 patients we performed the following manipulations: NF was supplemented with suturing wrap to the diaphragmatic crura (52 patients) on each side using two non-absorbable stitches. In case of weak conditions of crura or short esophagus (35 patients) fundoplication wrap was sutured to the body of stomach using two non-absorbable stitches on each side. .</description>

    <intervention_name>Nissen Fundoplication with wrap fixation</intervention_name>
    <description>Firstly, we performed left crural dissection, division of the short gastric vessels, right crural dissection, and esophageal mobilization. Then repair of HH were made by simple cruroraphy if the size of the defect was less then 10 сm² otherwise mesh for reinforcement of cruroraphy was used. Creation of the wrap was made by passing posterior fundus behind the esophagus from left to right, followed by stitching the edges of the stomach with three interrupted sutures. Wrap was fixated to both diaphragmatic crura or to the body of stomach using two non-absorbable stitches on each side.</description>
