  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the maximum dose per day of using mirror therapy for ankle
      exercise after stroke. The design is a 3+3 rule based, dose- finding study. Each cohort will
      consist of three participants. The first cohort will be assigned to do a dose of 15 minutes
      each day for two weeks. The second and subsequent cohorts will exercise at target dose set
      accordance to the nine preset rules and the modified Fibonacci sequence (mFBS).The study will
      continue until the stopping rule is triggered. The last dose tested will be identified as the
      maximum tolerable dose per day.

      Procedure:a 3+3 rule-based, dose-escalation design (Colucci et al,2017). recruitment process:
      the study will begin with a cohort of three participants (n=3). Each of the subsequent
      cohorts will also be of three participants. The start dose will be set at 15 minutes (cohort
      one). Participants will do ankle dorsiflexion exercise at the set dose with the mirror for
      two weeks. The second and subsequent cohorts will exercise at dose set in accordance to the
      nine preset rules and the modified Fibonacci sequence (mFBS) .

      Sample size: The target sample size is not usually predefined for a dose-finding study. The
      final sample size will be determined by the response of consecutive cohorts to the set dose.
      Usually, in pharmaceutical dose-finding studies, the sample size lies between 12 and 40.

      Data analysis : The data for each cohort will be analysed using descriptive statistics. No
      significance testing is involved.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants have had a stroke for six weeks or more before recruitment to this study,
             and are discharged from NHS statutory stroke rehabilitation.

          -  Participants will be at least 18 years of age

          -  Able to produce some voluntary contraction of paretic ankle ( motricity index between
             9 and 19).

          -  Ability to understand and follow simple verbal instructions (one-stage commands), i.e.
             sufficient communication, orientation, and memory to participate in mirror therapy
             ankle exercise.

          -  Participants will have had no lower limb injury in the last six months and were able
             to walk independently indoors before the index stroke.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Foot or ankle contracture that prevents 50% of the passive range of motion.

          -  Any condition that can be exaggerated by performing the therapy.
