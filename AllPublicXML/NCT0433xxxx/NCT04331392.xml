  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the behavioural and neurophysiological efficacy and feasibility of an
      online spatial navigation intervention for improving memory and brain health in individuals
      who have sustained moderate-severe traumatic brain injury.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The memory impairments associated with moderate to severe traumatic brain injury can be
      debilitating to younger and older adults, and can prevent a person's return to work, school
      and social life. The &quot;hippocampus&quot; is a ubiquitously compromised memory brain structure in
      moderate-severe TBI. Unfortunately, not only does the hippocampus sustain the damage at the
      time of injury, but researchers have identified that it shows continued atrophy in the months
      and years following injury. The investigators has developed a promising behavioural
      intervention for arresting this shrinkage, enhancing the integrity of the hippocampus - and
      improving memory function. It entails engagement in novel, continuous and challenging
      allocentric spatial navigation, that is, learning new routes of cities, and making a map in
      one's head of those routes for 1 hour/day, 5 days per week for a period of 16 weeks. N=87
      participants will be randomized to either the intervention group or an active control group
      that will watch 3 TedTalk videos per day, 5 days a week for the same duration. An MRI scan
      and cognitive measures focusing on memory and spatial navigation will be conducted before and
      after participation.

    <measure>Change in Navigational Strategies Questionnaire score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 1 week post-intervention.</time_frame>
    <description>Questionnaire measuring self-reported competence in cognitive mapping of routes and large-scale environments, and the formation of survey knowledge based on allocentric or environment-centered frames of reference. Questionnaire contains 14 questions with varying answers. Each response has an answer corresponding to a map-based navigation strategy or characteristic and one corresponding to a non-map/scene-based strategy. The mapping tendency is calculated as the difference between the number of map-based answers and non-map-based answers. Some questions have a third alternative, which is not coded. Final scores range from +14 to -14; the more positive, the more map-based navigation strategies a participant uses which is the better outcome.</description>

The responses are measured on a 7-point Likert scale (strongly agree = 1 - strongly disagree = 7), but is reversed for negative-worded questions. The final score is the average of all scores (between 1 and 7) where the higher the score, the better the perceived sense of direction. Increase in score is the better outcome.</description>

The response options have the following scores: Once or less in the last month=0; More than once a month but less than once a week=1; About once a week=2; More that once a week or less than once a day=3; Once or more in a day=4.
Final score for each participant is obtained by summing up all the scores from individual questions. Final score should range from 0-41, with higher the score, the better the memory. An increase in score is the better outcome.</description>

    <description>The 16-week intervention is completed daily, 5 days/week, remotely from home on a designated study website. Each week participants learn a new city through navigation tasks which increase in difficulty day-to-day and have a total of 4 levels of difficulty, with the goal of being able to independently navigate the city by the end of the week via Google Street View. Participants complete end-of-day multiple-choice tasks, testing what they learned with 3 types of allocentric questions: 1) predicting the next street/landmark, 2) distance judgement and 3) vector mapping. Participants also complete a map placement task, which involves reporting the locations of all studied landmarks/streets.
Participants are presented with auditory rewards in the forms of short audio clips about landmarks, written encouragement in the form pop-ups (e.g., &quot;Good work, keep it up!&quot;), and coffee card rewards based on adherence to the intervention (e.g.,$5 bi-weekly if 100% of intervention is completed).</description>

    <description>The 16-week active control, remote video intervention is completed daily, 5 days a week by participants on a designated website. Participants placed in the active control group are trained on educational topics by watching videos of Ted Talks, to control for the effects of generalized environmental enrichment of the same dose as targeted navigation training. For each day of training, participants are asked to select between an option of 2 possible videos, watching a total of three videos per day. To ensure compliance and sufficient attention to the videos, at the end of each video, participants are asked to rate 5 aspects of the content (relevance, interest, comprehensibility, complexity, informative), and speaker (persuasiveness, quality of delivery, facial expression, convincingness, captivation), on a scale of 1 (lowest) to 5 (highest). Additionally, as with remote navigation participants, they are given written and monetary rewards.</description>
