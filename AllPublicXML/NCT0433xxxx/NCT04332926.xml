      This study aims to better understand how e-cigarettes (ECIG) nicotine flux impacts several
      behavioral economic measures of abuse liability.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Breakpoint of Drug Purchase Task (DPT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Each DPT will be completed once per study session, about 75 minutes into the session.</time_frame>
    <description>The DPTs will yield measures of willingness to pay and measures of price sensitivity for session-specific tobacco products. Choices made during this task are not reinforced during the session.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Effort for Product Puffs with Progressive Ratio Task (PRT)</measure>
    <time_frame>The PRT is completed once per study session, about 90 minutes into the session.</time_frame>
    <description>The PRT will yield a measure of willingness to work for session-specific tobacco products (via number of times a space bar is pressed to earn puffs) through three outcome measures. 1) Breakpoint (maximum number of key presses completed to earn a puff), 2) number of puffs self-administrated, and 3) latency (seconds) to initiate key pressing.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Effort for Product Puffs with Cross Product Progressive Ratio Task (CP-PRT)</measure>
    <time_frame>The CP-PRT is completed once per study session (except it is not completed in the 5th, own brand session), at 185 minutes into the session.</time_frame>
    <description>The CP-PRT will yield a measure of willingness to work for either the session-specific ECIG or the participants own brand tobacco products (via bar presses/work requirement that increases for each of 10 trials for the own brand product while the session-specific product is available for a fixed work requirement). The main outcome of interest in the CP-PRT is the relative reinforcing value - defined as how hard a participant is willing to work for the session product compared to their own brand cigarette. The breakpoint, or highest trial number that a participant completed for a puff of the session-specific product will be used as the measure of relative reinforcing value.</description>

    <measure>Subjective measures of nicotine withdrawal</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 215 minutes into the session</time_frame>

    <measure>Subjective measures of nicotine side effects</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 215 minutes into the session</time_frame>

    <measure>Subjective measures of smoking experience</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 215 minutes into the session</time_frame>
