  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to assess the impact of a 12-week remote dietitian supervised
      dietary and physical activity weight loss intervention and mobile app for patients with
      morbid obesity prior to undergoing total joint arthroplasty of the hip or knee. The
      hypothesis is that that the intervention will result in: 1) greater weight loss than usual
      care, 2) a higher percentage of patients eligible to undergo surgery by having a body mass
      index (BMI) below the standard cutoff of 40 kg/m2, and 3) a higher percentage of patients
      undergoing surgery within six months of study enrollment.

      Recruitment: Patients of Dr. Antonia Chen, Dr. Jeffrey Lange, Dr. Vivek Shah, Dr. Richard
      Iorio and Dr. Wolfgang Fitz at the Brigham and Women's Hospital orthopaedic clinics will be
      identified as potentially eligible for the study based on BMI&gt;40kg/m2 and recommended
      primary, unilateral total knee or hip arthroplasty. For patients identified as potentially
      eligible while in clinic, an orthopaedic surgeon will introduce the patient to the study, and
      a member of the research team (research assistant or trainee) will conduct an eligibility
      screening (see eligibility criteria) and obtain verbal consent either in-person or by phone.
      For patients identified as potentially eligible after they have left clinic, a member of the
      research team will call the patient to introduce the study, and conduct eligibility screening
      and consent on the phone.

      Eligible, interested, and consented patients will be provisionally enrolled and randomized to
      the intervention arm or usual care arm via REDCap. This initial enrollment is provisional
      because subjects must have a baseline weight recorded at a Partner's healthcare facility
      within two weeks of provisional enrollment to verify their BMI &gt; 40 kg/m2 before subjects may
      begin the 12-week study. Subjects will be given a $40 check for enrolling, which includes 1)
      taking a baseline survey, 2) recording the baseline weight at a Partners facility, and 3)
      getting baseline labs within 2 weeks of the baseline weight. After provisionally enrolled
      subjects have a baseline weight verified, they are considered fully enrolled and the 12-week
      intervention or control group will begin. Baseline weights will be recorded without shoes or
      outer clothing (e.g. coats). Subjects may complete baseline weights and labs at the clinic
      when they are initially approached about the study, or they may do so if they schedule an
      appointment with clinic staff who routinely see orthopaedic patients with BMI &gt; 40 kg/m2 two
      weeks after initial visits as part of standard care. All subjects will be given a second $40
      check if they can verify a weight loss of at least 5 lbs within 6 weeks of their baseline
      weight by recording a weight at any Partners facility. All subjects will receive a third $40
      check for completing an end-of-study survey, weight, and labs.

      Arms: Intervention participants will download the Nutrimedy telemedicine online/smartphone
      app and be connected at enrollment with a certified registered dietitian who will contact
      intervention participants weekly or bi-weekly via video calls and unlimited in-app text
      messaging for up to three months. The first week will include either one 55-minute video
      session or two 25-minute sessions. Weeks 2-4 will have weekly 25-minute video calls, and
      weeks 5-12 will have biweekly 25-minute sessions for a total of 8-9 sessions over 12 weeks.
      Together, participants and dietitians will come up with goals for the 12 weeks, and
      dietitians will check on progress toward these goals using in-app tools such as food logs and
      messaging between video calls. All patients will be encouraged to lose at least 20 pounds
      with a goal BMI&lt;40 kg/m2 after 12 weeks. Intervention participants will additionally be asked
      if they would be interested in completing a brief 5-minute interview in-person or by phone at
      the end of the study (10-14 weeks after enrollment) to discuss qualitative feedback about the
      intervention. Responses will be transcribed verbatim during the interview for later analysis.

      Individuals randomized to the usual care group will receive standard care. This may include a
      physical therapist and/or nutritionist referral. Brigham and Women's Hospital offers several
      programs for patients interested in losing weight, including the Nutrition Wellness Service
      (NWS) and Program for Weight Management (PWM).
