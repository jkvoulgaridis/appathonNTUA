  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to learn more about the use of viral specific
      T-lymphocytes (VSTs) to treat viral infections that may happen after solid organ transplant
      (SOT). VSTs are cells specially designed to fight viral infections that may happen after a
      solid organ transplant. These cells are created from a blood sample collected from the study
      participant.

      Solid organ transplant and the use of immunosuppressive medications reduces the body's
      ability to fight infections. Viral infections are a common problem after transplant and can
      cause significant complications. Reduction of immunosuppression may put the organ at risk of
      rejection. Moreover, treatment of viral infections is expensive and time consuming, with
      families often administering prolonged treatments with intravenous anti-viral medications, or
      patients requiring prolonged admissions to the hospital. The medicines can also have side
      effects like damage to the kidneys or reduction in the blood counts, so in this study the
      investigators are trying to find a better way to treat these infections and minimize
      complications.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Blood adenovirus PCR ≥1,000

          -  Blood CMV PCR ≥ 500

          -  Blood EBV PCR ≥ 1,000

          -  Plasma BKV PCR &gt;1,000

          -  Plasma JC Virus PCR &gt; 1,000

          -  Evidence of invasive adenovirus infection. Adenovirus infection will be defined as the
             presence of adenoviral positivity as detected by PCR or culture from one site such as
             stool or blood or urine or nasopharynx. Adenovirus disease will be defined as the
             presence of adenoviral positivity as detected by culture or PCR from more than 2 sites
             such as stool or blood or urine or nasopharynx.

          -  Evidence of invasive CMV infection, e.g. pneumonitis, retinitis, colitis.

          -  Evidence of EBV-associated lymphoproliferation (EBV-LPD) defined as proven EBV-LPD by
             biopsy or probable EBV-LPD defined as an elevated EBV DNA level in the blood
             associated with clinical symptoms (adenopathy or fever or masses on imaging) but
             without biopsy confirmation.

          -  Evidence of symptomatic BK virus infection, which may include symptomatic hemorrhagic
             cystitis, BK viruria or BK nephropathy

          -  Evidence of PML or other CNS infection due to JC virus

          -  Clinical status must allow tapering of steroids to &lt; 0.5mg/kg prednisone or other
             steroid equivalent, or a clinically acceptable steroid dose at the discretion of the
             PI

          -  Age &gt; 1 day

          -  Must be able to receive VST infusion in Cincinnati

          -  Uncontrolled bacterial or fungal infection
