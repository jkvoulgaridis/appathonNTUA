  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multi-center expanded access program designed to provide access to
      Copper Cu 64 Dotatate for the detection, localization, and monitoring of NETs to patients
      that did not have access during the Phase 3 Trial.

      The objective of this trial is to provide patients with confirmed or suspicion of NET access
      to Copper Cu 64 Dotatate for the detection, localization, and monitoring of SSTR expressing
      NETs, bridging the gap between investigational product availability in clinical studies and
      marketed product availability following US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval.
