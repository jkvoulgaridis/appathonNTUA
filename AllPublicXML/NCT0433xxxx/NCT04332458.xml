  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate motivators and barriers for physical activity in
      patients discharged from hospital for a minor stroke or TIA. The study has a qualitative
      research design and will be conducted by focus group interviews.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Little is known about motivators and barriers for physical activity after hospital discharge
      for patients with a minor stroke or TIA. These patients have few and temporary symptoms and
      are therefore discharged early from the hospital or seen in a outpatient TIA clinic. Standard
      treatment are preventive medication and advice on self-managed lifestyle changes. Occurrence
      of one ischemic stroke or TIA predisposes to further ischemic strokes and patients are at
      risk of developing cognitive deficits or vascular dementia over time unless multiple
      preventive measures are taken including physical activity. The purpose is to investigate
      motivators and barriers for physical activity after hospital discharge by focus-group
      interviewing this potential fragile group of patients. The research team want to facilitate
      the patients to be physically active and thereby prevent a recurrent stroke and slow the
      progression of vascular diseases.
