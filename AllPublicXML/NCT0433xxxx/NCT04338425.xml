  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Communication between a surgeon and a patient in the immediate postoperative period is
      thought to influence patient satisfaction. There is currently no standard of care regarding
      the optimal form of postoperative communication, nor is there a consensus in our department
      as to which modality is preferred by patients.The purpose of this study is to determine which
      form of communication, if any, is preferred by patients. Furthermore, this study aims to
      evaluate the impact that various forms of communication during the immediate postoperative
      period have on patient (subject) satisfaction. The study hypothesizes that patient (subject)
      satisfaction with their surgeon will be highest among those who communicate with their
      surgeons via videotelephony (i.e., videoconferencing) and that the lowest satisfaction will
      be among patients (subjects) who did not communicate with their surgeon until their regularly
      scheduled postoperative office visit. The results of this study may help identify low cost
      methods for increasing patient satisfaction.

      This is a prospective, randomized study designed to evaluate the effects of different
      communication modalities between surgeons and patients (subjects) in the immediate
      postoperative period. Given the nature of the study, it is not possible for either the
      surgeons or the subjects to be blinded. To reduce bias that may occur due to each surgeon's
      personal preference for postoperative communication modality, the surgeons (rather than
      individual subjects) will be randomized to one of the three communication modality groups (no
      communication on the day of surgery, voice call, or videoconferencing).
