      This study aims to compare the time required for surgical planning using these two methods
      and to explore whether differences in surgical accuracy can be identified in a small study of

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients at least 18 years of age with upcoming cataract surgery. At least 25% of
             enrolled eyes must be post-refractive, and 25% must require astigmatic planning
             (arcuate incision or toric IOL)

          -  Patients with otherwise healthy eyes, not exhibiting any significant ocular morbidity
             that would be expected to influence refractive outcome or interfere with postoperative
             refraction accuracy.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with visually significant comorbidities (corneal, retina, optic nerve
             disease, not including prior refractive surgery) that could significantly affect their
             ability to have accurate preoperative biometry or postoperative refraction.

          -  Patients with surgical complications either during or after surgery (capsule tears,
             iris trauma, decentered IOL, cystoid macular edema, etc.) that would interfere with
             postoperative refraction.

          -  Patients with &gt; grade 2 or greater posterior capsule opacity
