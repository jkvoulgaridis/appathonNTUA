    <textblock>
      The investigator's aim in this study is to compare the results of tubal ligation surgery, one
      of the contraceptive methods, between different surgical techniques. 194 patients were
      included in the study. Of these patients, 104 had vaginal approach, 44 had laparotomic and 46
      had laparoscopic tube ligation surgery. These surgical techniques are statistically was
      compared; Visual Analog Pain Scale (VAS) after surgery, in terms of duration of surgery,
      length of hospital stay, cost to hospital and amount of blood loss. As a result of the
      analysis; tubal sterilization technique performed with vaginal colpotomy were found to be
      more successful than other techniques; Visual Analog Pain Scale score, postoperative hospital
      stay, operation time and cost.

      The study compared the peroperative effects and postoperative results of different surgical
      techniques with three different techniques in patients undergoing tubal sterilization.

      surgical techniques used:

        1. Mini Laparotomic tubal ligation

        2. Laparoscopic tubal ligation

        3. tubal ligation by posterior colpotomy

      A total of 194 patients were included in the study. Tubal ligation was performed in 44
      patients with mini laparotomy, 46 patients with laparoscopy and 104 patients with posterior
      colpotomy technique.

      The following parameters were evaluated in the study

        1. Parity

        2. How many of their previous births are vaginal delivery, how many are cesarian section

        3. 6th hour Visual Analog Pain Scale (VAS) score

        4. 24th hour Visual Analog Pain Scale (VAS) score

        5. Preoperative - postoperative hmg differences

        6. Surgery time

        7. Length of hospital stay

    <description>In patients undergoing spinal anesthesia, a suprapubic 3-5 centimeter incision was entered into the abdomen. After both tubes were isolated, bilateral tube ligation was performed by Pomeroy method. After bleeding control was achieved, it was repaired in accordance with the anatomy of the abdomen.</description>

    <description>In patients undergoing general anesthesia, Verres was inserted into the abdomen through the umbilicus. Pneumo peritoneum was created with carbon dioxide (CO2). Optical imaging was placed into the abdomen from the umbilicus with 10-trochar. Auxiliary trochars from 3 centimeter supero-medial of both spina iliaca anterior superior were placed in the abdomen. bilateral tubas were isolated. Bilateral tubal ligation was performed with the help of bipolar cautery. bleeding control was achieved. trochars were taken out of the abdomen. the skin was closed.</description>

    <description>The patient underwent spinal anesthesia and was placed in a high lithotomy position. cervical uteri was observed with the help of speculum. A 3 centimeter vertical incision was opened 2 centimeter below the cervix uteri. Peritoneal cavity was entered from this area. bilateral tubas were isolated. Bilateral tubal ligation was performed using the pomeroy method. bleeding control was achieved. peritoneal and posterior cervical incision line was repaired.</description>
