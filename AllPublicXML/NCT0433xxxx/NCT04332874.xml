  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out whether giving the study drug pembrolizumab in
      combination with the chemotherapy drugs melphalan and dactinomycin, delivered directly to the
      affected arm or leg using a technique called isolated limb infusion (ILI), is a safe
      treatment that can delay the time before your disease gets worse (progresses).

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Patients who fulfil any of the following criteria are not eligible for admission to the
        study:

          -  Have any other malignancy that requires active treatment

          -  Ineligible for ILI because of underlying physical conditions (e.g. coronary artery
             disease with inability to tolerate anesthesia) as determined by treating physician

          -  Has previously experienced hypersensitivity to pembrolizumab or any of its excipients

          -  Has uncontrolled intercurrent illness including active infection requiring systemic
             therapy or symptomatic congestive heart failure within the past 6 months

          -  Has known active central nervous system (CNS) metastases. Patients with previously
             treated brain metastases may participate provided they are stable (without evidence of
             progression by imaging for at least 4 weeks prior to study Day 1 and return to
             baseline of neurologic symptoms), have no evidence of new or enlarging brain
             metastases, and are not using steroids for at least 7 days prior to trial treatment.
             This exception does not include sarcomatous meningitis, which is excluded regardless
             of clinical stability.

          -  Shows evidence of clinically significant immunosuppression such as the following:

               -  Primary immunodeficiency state such as Severe Combined Immunodeficiency Disease

               -  Concurrent opportunistic infection

               -  Receiving systemic immunosuppressive therapy (&gt; 2 weeks) including oral steroid
                  doses &gt; 10 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent within 7 days prior to enrollment.
                  However, in the setting of non-immune mediated indications for use,
                  chronic/active low dose steroid use may be permitted at the discretion of the
                  principal investigator.

          -  Has a known active or chronic infection with HIV if CD4 count is less than 500.

             that has required systemic treatment (i.e., use of corticosteroids, immunosuppressive
             drugs or biological agents used for treatment of autoimmune diseases) in the past 2
             years. Replacement therapy (e.g., thyroxine for hypothyroidism, insulin for diabetes
             or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary
             insufficiency) is not considered a form of systemic treatment for autoimmune disease.

          -  For patients of childbearing potential, is unwilling to use acceptable method(s) of
             effective contraception during study treatment and through 4 months after the last
             dose of pembrolizumab.

        (Women not of childbearing potential are defined as: post-menopausal [age &gt; 55 years with
        cessation of menses for 12 or more months or less than 55 years but not spontaneous menses
        for at least 2 years or less than 55 years and spontaneous menses within the past 1 year,
        but currently amenorrhoeic (e.g., spontaneous or secondary to hysterectomy), and with
        postmenopausal gonadotropin levels (luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone
        levels &gt; 40 IU/L) or postmenopausal estradiol levels (&lt; 5 ng/dL) or according to the
        definition of &quot;postmenopausal range&quot; for the laboratory involved] or who have had a
        hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy, or bilateral oophorectomy.)

          -  Underwent prior chemotherapy, radiotherapy, biological cancer therapy, targeted small
             molecule therapy, or major surgery within 14 days prior to study Day 1 or has not
             recovered (i.e., to CTCAE &lt;/= grade 1 or at baseline) from adverse events due to
             previously administered therapy. Patients with &lt;/= grade 2 neuropathy and alopecia are
             an exception and may qualify for the study. If patients received major surgery, they
             must have recovered adequately prior to starting therapy.

          -  Is currently participating and receiving study therapy with another investigational
             device or study drug or has participated in a study of an investigational agent and

             dose of treatment
