  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis of this study is that the combination of cabiralizumab and nivolumab with
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy will decrease tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) and increase tumor
      infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) compared to neoadjuvant chemotherapy plus nivolumab in
      patients with early stage triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and improve clinical outcomes.
