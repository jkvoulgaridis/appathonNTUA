  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGID) are amongst the most common causes of abdominal
      pain and dysfunction seen in clinical practice, affecting between 10 to 15% of most
      populations (1). FGID are defined by symptoms without demonstrable underlying organic
      pathology (2). Within the currently used Rome definitions of FGID, there is a broad range of
      gastrointestinal and multi-organ symptoms, indicating heterogeneous underlying
      pathophysiological mechanisms (3). There is evidence of central nervous system and motility
      dysfunction, dysbiosis, as well as immune activation in various subgroups of patients with
      FGID (2). Most mechanistic studies have been performed in small and heavily selected groups
      of patients. Consequently, the link between different symptomatic subgroups of patients and
      underlying mechanisms is unclear and unconfirmed in larger and representative patient
      cohorts. FGID patients with different underlying pathologies are likely to benefit from
      divergent specific treatments, even if they fall within the same Rome classification of FGID.

      Discrete clusters of clinical characteristics in a large cohort of patients with FGID will be
      sought using hypothesis-free cluster analysis and latent-class analysis models. Associations
      to underlying mechanisms will be examined using data from fermentable sugar breath, blood and
      stool tests. This will allow recommendations regarding improved mechanistic-based
      classifications of patients with FGID, with potential for more effective mechanistic-based
      treatments.

      The investigators will use coded clinical and medical history characteristics obtained by
      standardized questionnaires and laboratory and breath test results from all successive
      patients above the age of 18 years referred to the Gastroenterology Group Practice in the
      last 10 years for diagnosis and treatment of FGID for statistical analysis The data is stored
      in a database, without any personal identifiers. Explorative statistical analysis will be
      performed in approximately 5000 patients.
