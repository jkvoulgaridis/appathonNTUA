    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized, open-label phase II study comparing cognitive outcomes
      between men with non-metastatic and metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC or
      M0CRPC) treated with darolutamide or enzalutamide. Approximately 132 patients will be
      enrolled. Eligible patients will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion to treatment with
      enzalutamide 160 mg orally daily or darolutamide 600 mg orally twice daily, in combination
      with standard LHRH agonist based treatment. Cognitive assessments will be performed using
      modules from Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) an internationally
      recognized software for assessing cognitive function and impairment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the trial is to assess cognitive and quality of life outcomes over the 52-week
      primary data collection period of the trial. This is a prospective, randomized, open-label
      phase II study comparing cognitive outcomes between men with metastatic or non-metastatic
      CRPC (mCRPC or M0CRPC) treated with darolutamide or enzalutamide. This will be a multicenter
      trial conducted at 12 sites across the US.

      The primary endpoint will be the percent change in the maximally changed cognitive domain by
      24 weeks in each study arm. Patients will be stratified by age (&lt;65, 65-80, &gt; 80). Patients
      will be allowed to cross over from either treatment to the opposite treatment arm at 12 and
      24 weeks if they meet any of the cross-over criteria as described in the protocol.

      Cognitive assessments will be performed using Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated
      Battery (CANTAB), an internationally recognized software for assessing cognitive function and
      impairment. Tests available in the CANTAB battery include tests of learning and executive
      function; working memory; visual, verbal and episodic memory; and attention, information and
      processing time. The maximally changed cognitive domain is defined as the domain most changed
      from baseline in each individual.

      Blood samples will be collected for exploratory genomic analyses (AR CAG repeat length, PHS,
      exosome analysis).

      Patients will have the option to opt into an additional separate MRI sub-study. A subset of
      40 patients (20 per arm) will undergo fMRI to measure percent signal change in the HP PFC
      circuit at baseline, 24 and 52 weeks or/and cross-over/end of treatment visit (if
      applicable).

          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the prostate without
             neuroendocrine differentiation or small cell features

          -  Progressive disease per PCWG3 criteria

          -  Metastatic CRPC or non-metastatic CRPC (M0CRPC)

               -  Castration-resistant prostate cancer demonstrated during continuous ADT, defined

                  OR for M0CPRC: no evidence of metastatic disease on standard imaging.

          -  Surgically or medically castrated, with testosterone levels of &lt;50 ng/dL. If the
             patient is medically castrated, continuous dosing with GnRHa must have been initiated
             at least 4 weeks prior to randomization and must be continued throughout the study.

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status ≤2

          -  Ability to swallow study tablets whole.

          -  Able to provide informed consent.

        Key exclusion criteria include:

          -  Prior chemotherapy for treatment of CRPC. Patients who received chemotherapy for
             castrate-sensitive prostate cancer are still eligible provided chemotherapy was
             completed &gt;6 months prior to study entry.

          -  Use of investigational agents for the treatment of prostate cancer within 4 weeks of

             enroll if no progression of disease during treatment with abiraterone (PSA or
             radiographic) and &gt;6 months since last exposure to abiraterone.

          -  Planned radiation treatment &gt; 21 days during enrollment in the study.
