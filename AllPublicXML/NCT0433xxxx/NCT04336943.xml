  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well durvalumab and olaparib work in treating prostate cancer
      in men predicted to have specific genetic mutations (a high neoantigen load). Immunotherapy
      with monoclonal antibodies, such as durvalumab, may help the body's immune system attack the
      cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. PARPs are
      proteins that help repair DNA mutations. PARP inhibitors, such as olaparib, can keep PARP
      from working, so tumor cells can't repair themselves, and they may stop growing. Giving
      durvalumab and olaparib may kill more tumor cells in patients with prostate cancer predicted
      to have a high neoantigen load.

      OUTLINE:

      All patients receive durvalumab IV over 1 hour on day 1 of each cycle. Patients with CDK12
      mutation and mismatch repair deficiency (MMRd)/microsatellite instability (MSI)-high also
      receive olaparib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1- 28 of cycles 3-6. Patients with
      homologous recombination mutation also receive olaparib PO BID on days 1-28 of cycles 1-6.
      Cycles repeat every 28 days for 6 cycles in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 2 weeks, 12 and 24 months.
