  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The impacts from diabetes are both patient related and healthcare based. Offloading is
      recognised as the priority treatment for healing neuropathic and neuro-ischaemic plantar foot
      ulcers. The new PulseFlow DF boot is a device which claims to off load but has little or no
      evidence on diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) subjects. Thus the primary aim of this study is to
      observe forefoot plantar pressures in a cross sectional purposively selected sample compared
      to usual standard of care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The impacts from diabetes are both patient related and healthcare based. DFU is associated
      with a high mortality rate at 34% at 1 year. There is an associated higher limb amputation
      rate from DFU than other causes. The high mortality rate, high amputation rate and increased
      socio-economic burden means providing high quality evidence based DFU service provision
      should be a NHS priority. Offloading is recognised as the priority treatment for healing
      neuropathic and neuro-ischaemic plantar foot ulcers. Since the provision of non removable
      devices or total contact casts (TCC) is poor, options have to be available that are
      equivalent in effectiveness at off loading and healing DFU. By improving the quality of
      offloading choices and acceptability for devices this will improve healing rates and reduce
      the cost burden where currently in the UK diabetic foot care in 2015 accounted for
      0.6%/585.5million pounds of the NHS budget. The evidence for effectiveness of non removable
      devices is poor. Therefore any device that offloads to the equivalent or more than previous
      devices and current usual standard of care must be evidenced. The new PulseFlow DF boot is
      such a device which claims to off load but has little or no evidence on DFU subjects. Thus
      the primary aim of this study is to observe forefoot plantar pressures in a cross sectional
      purposively selected sample compared to usual standard of care.
