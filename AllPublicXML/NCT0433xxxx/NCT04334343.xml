  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the study is to examine the ability of resistance or aerobic exercise training to
      &quot;imprint&quot; skeletal muscle cells in a manner which confers long-term changes in this tissue
      which in-turn contribute to improved metabolic health and functional capacity through
      epigenetic regulation of novel exercise response genes. This study will also provide primary
      human skeletal muscle cells to the Molecular Transducers of Physical Activity Consortium
      (MoTrPAC) (NCT03960827) repository for future use.

    <description>Subjects will be asked if an additional biopsy from an existing incision can be obtained (i.e. additional needle insertion). For each biopsy required in the main MoTrPAC study (NCT03960827), a small needle will be used to inject some numbing medication (similar to what a dentist uses) in your thigh. A small incision (about 1/4 inch) will be made and a special needle will be used to collect 1 or 2 muscle samples (about the size of a pea).</description>
