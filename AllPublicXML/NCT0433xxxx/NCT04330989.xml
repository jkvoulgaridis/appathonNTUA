  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is composed of two parallel, pilot randomized groups that will obtain preliminary
      data about the effectiveness and implementation of a multi-component adherence support
      strategy for HIV treatment and prevention among pregnant and breastfeeding women. The study
      will take place in Lusaka, Zambia and Lilongwe, Malawi.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      If the anticipated gains for the prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission (PMTCT)
      programs are to be realized, adherence to antiretroviral regimens will be critical. To date,
      however, there are few evidence-based approaches that are scalable and sustainable in busy,
      programmatic settings where HIV burden is high. The study seeks to implement the
      intervention, which includes patient-centered counseling and adherence supporter training,
      for both HIV-positive (for antiretroviral therapy, or ART) and HIV-negative (for pre-exposure
      prophylaxis, or PrEP) pregnant and breastfeeding women, thus providing a universal approach
      to support PMTCT programs holistically. The study will enroll pregnant women 18 years of age
      or older receiving antenatal care services at one of the designated study facilities. In
      Group 1, the study will enroll 100 HIV-positive women who started (or re-started, after a 6
      months or longer treatment interruption) a first-line ART regimen within the past 30 days. In
      Group 2, the study will enroll 200 HIV-negative women willing to initiate and continue oral
      PrEP, in the form of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and emtricitabine (TDF-FTC), and who
      report factors that place them at elevated risk for HIV acquisition.

    <intervention_name>iNSC and Adherence supporter training</intervention_name>
    <description>Integrated next step counseling: iNSC is a structured, patient-centered approach informed by motivational interviewing techniques, which aims to foster an environment for joint-problem solving in order that the participant may identify their individual needs to increase or sustain sexual health through biomedical and non-biomedical approaches. iNSC frames the counselling sessions as a non-judgmental discussion to explore the facilitators and challenges to sexual health and medication adherence.
Adherence supporter training: Participants will be asked to identify a partner, family member, or friend to whom they are willing to disclose their HIV status (for HIV-positive women) or their intent to initiate PrEP (for HIV-negative women). Participants may also select a clinic-based peer to serve this adherence supporter role. Trainings will emphasize basic HIV knowledge, importance of antiretroviral adherence, potential drug side effects, and practical strategies for supporting adherence.</description>
