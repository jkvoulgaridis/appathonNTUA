  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This protocol is an intervention study to determine the best education and monitoring
      strategy for children ages 2-20 years with pre-symptomatic type 1 diabetes (T1D) because
      there currently exists no clinical guidelines for management of these children in early-stage
      T1D. This study hypothesizes that the trajectory of T1D can be changed, substantially
      reducing HbA1c and risk of DKA at diagnosis, through (1) careful monitoring of children
      progressing from stage 2 to stage 3 T1D using continuous glucose monitor (CGM) technology,
      (2) staged education targeted to assist families in recognizing evolving dysglycemia, and (3)
      addressing glycemic abnormalities with early initiation of insulin.

      Specific Aims:

      Perform randomized controlled trial of intensive follow-up of stage 2 T1D participants
      utilizing continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) technology and early education of families to
      guide early insulin therapy with the goals of:

      maintaining HbA1c less than 7.0%. avoiding adverse outcomes: ER visits, hospitalizations, DKA
      and severe hypoglycemia improving diabetes knowledge through optimal planned education as
      opposed to `a crash course' at unexpected diagnosis event.

      evaluating patient/caregiver satisfaction with diabetes care received evaluating impact of
      activity on glycemic profile Collect longitudinal biomarkers of beta-cell stress and
      dysfunction in stage 2 T1D.

      Use longitudinal CGM data combined with &quot;gold-standard&quot; OGTT and HbA1c measures to provide
      evidence for CGM-based diagnostic criteria for stage 2 and stage 3 T1D.

      Perform cost-analysis of intensive follow up protocol.

    <measure>Parental anxiety regarding diabetes risk</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Items from a questionnaire to study the psychological impact of diabetes risk. A 6-item short form of the state portion of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) will be used to assess parent anxiety about the child's diabetes risk at a single point in time. For example, parents were asked how often they feel &quot;worried&quot; specifically when they think about their child's risk of developing diabetes. Responses were scored on a 4-point scale and the 6-item score was then converted to a total score comparable to the 20-item State Anxiety Inventory score. Parents with STAI scores &gt; 40 were considered to be highly anxious. STAI scores will be analyzed using linear mixed models incorporating data from all three time points, with an interaction between group and time to test for differences in change in outcome over time. Contrast statements will be used to test for comparisons of intervention vs controls.</description>

    <description>Items from a questionnaire to study the psychological impact of diabetes risk. A 6-item set of questions quering frequency of depressive symptoms will be used to assess parent depressive symptoms at a single point in time. For example, parents will be asked about frequency of crying spells on a 4 point scale from (1) Not at all to (4) All of the time. Responses are scored from 6 to 24, with higher score indicating increased depressive symptoms.</description>

Risk modification belief scoring is scored on 3-15 points with higher score indicating perception that risk of diabetes can be modified. Risk modification scores will be analyzed using linear mixed models incorporating data from all three time points, with an interaction between group and time to test for differences in change in outcome over time. Contrast statements will be used to test for comparisons of intervention vs control</description>
