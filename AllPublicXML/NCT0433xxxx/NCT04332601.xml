  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fatigue is commonly experienced in numerous pathologies, including schizophrenia. Research
      has shown that chronic fatigue can exacerbate clinical symptoms.

      Several evidence-based interventions for fatigue syndrome have been shown to be effective in
      other medical conditions, but up to this date no research has assessed interventions in
      fatigue management within psychotic populations.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate (in a multisite single blind randomized clinical trial)
      the efficacy of a cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) intervention of fatigue management in
      people diagnosed with schizophrenia. Secondary objectives include the examination of changes
      in fatigue scores as well as clinical symptoms, physical &amp; cognitive functioning, quality of
      life at 9-month post CBT intervention. Another aim in this study is to assess - MICROBIATE

      The investigators hypothesize that following the CBT treatment intervention, patients will
      demonstrate reduced level of fatigue. No change in the severity of fatigue is expected in the
      group receiving treatment as usual.
