    <textblock>
      The investigators are proposing a prospective, randomized, double blinded, placebo-controlled
      single center study evaluating the role of co-administration of oral sodium chloride (NaCl)
      with intravenous diuretics in patients hospitalized with acute decompensated heart failure.
      The investigators are approaching this study with the hypothesis that the use of oral sodium
      chloride leads to improved effective diuresis (as measured by weight loss) and renal function
      as compared to placebo in patients hospitalized with acute decompensated heart failure
      undergoing aggressive intravenous diuretic therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dietary sodium restriction is a common therapeutic intervention in the management of patients
      hospitalized with decompensated heart failure. This is despite limited supportive data and
      inconsistent society guidelines.1-3 Randomized clinical trial data has shown that dietary
      sodium restriction in patients hospitalized with heart failure was not associated with
      differences in weight, clinical congestion, time to clinical stability but was associated
      with increased thirst.4 Numerous studies demonstrate that sodium restriction is associated
      with increased Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System (RAAS) activation as well as increases in
      inflammatory markers.5,6 These findings challenge of the role of sodium restriction in
      hospital management of heart failure and have lead to trials that consider a therapeutic role
      of providing sodium to patients with acute heart failure for its effect in attenuating
      neurohormonal activation during aggressive diuresis. A central example is the SMAC-HF study
      from Italy, which showed that in 1771 patients with acute New York Heart Association (NYHA)
      class IV heart failure, the addition of hypertonic saline (150ml of 1.4%-4.6% NaCl twice a
      day in addition to diet liberalization led to statistically significant increased urine
      output and weight loss in addition to reductions in creatinine, length of stay, mortality and
      readmissions.7 These findings are controversial but similarly favorable results with the use
      of hypertonic saline in aiding diuresis have been seen in Japan with improved diuresis with
      continuous hypertonic saline infusions.8 Despite these results, use of sodium chloride
      supplementation in acute heart failure remains limited. This may be because the practice
      challenges ingrained clinical practice, but a more likely reason is that the manner of sodium
      chloride delivery in these trials (hypertonic saline) is often reserved for the Intensive
      Care Unit (ICU) setting and central venous access for delivery. While small volumes of
      hypertonic saline are likely safe to be administered in a non-ICU setting, the results would
      be more broadly applicable and utilized if the manner of sodium supplementation did not
      require intensive monitoring or central venous access, ie oral supplementation. Therefore,
      the purpose of the &quot;Oral Sodium to Preserve Renal EfficiencY in Acute Heart Failure&quot;
      (OSPREY-AHF) is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral sodium chloride supplementation
      compared to placebo in patients with acute decompensated heart failure. While the
      investigators are specifically interested in sodium chloride and its hypothesized role in
      attenuating a neurohormonally mediated diuretic resistance commonly seen in patients
      requiring high dose diuretic therapy, the investigators also intend that by focusing on oral
      sodium chloride supplementation the investigators may clarify the role of dietary sodium
      restriction in hospitalized patients with acute heart failure.
