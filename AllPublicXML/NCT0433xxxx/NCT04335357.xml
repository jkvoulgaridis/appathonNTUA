      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to assess the safety,
      tolerability, efficacy, PK, and PD of the chimeric dopamine-somatostatin receptor agonist,
      TBR-760, in adult patients with NFPA over 52 weeks.

        Key Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Confirmed diagnosis of NFPA (defined as lack of clinical and biochemical evidence of
             adenohypophyseal hormone excess), and be status-post one TSS with a NFPA remnant of â‰¥
             10mm (maximum diameter)

          -  Study subjects must be capable of giving informed consent and reading and signing the
             informed consent form after the nature of the study has been fully explained by the
             Investigator or Investigator designee

          -  Study subject must be willing and able to complete all study assessments and
             procedures and to communicate effectively with the Investigator and site staff.

        Key Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Has undergone more than one TSS, or had TSS &lt;6 months prior to screening, or is
             anticipated to require TSS within 6 months of Screening

          -  Has undergone radiation therapy to the head for any reason, or is already planned to
             have or anticipated to require radiation therapy during the study period;

          -  Has any contraindications to magnetic resonance imaging including allergy or
             intolerance to gadolinium or gadolinium-based contrast;

          -  In the opinion of the Investigator, the patient is unable to meet the requirements of
             the study.
