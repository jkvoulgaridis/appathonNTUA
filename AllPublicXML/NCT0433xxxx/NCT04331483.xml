  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To date, allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (aHSCT) is the only curative
      treatment for many paediatric and young adult haematological pathologies (acute leukaemia,
      myelodysplastic syndromes, haemoglobinopathies, bone marrow aplasia, severe combined
      immunodeficiency). Despite the major therapeutic progress made over the last 50 years,
      particularly in terms of supportive care, post-transplant morbidity and mortality remains
      high. Infectious complications, whose incidence varies between 30 and 60%, are the first
      cause of mortality in the immediate post-transplant period.

      In order to protect the patient from the occurrence of severe infectious episodes, aHSCTmust
      be performed in a highly protected environment (positive pressure chambers).

      This has implications for the experience and impact of hospitalization on the patient and
      family. This is particularly true in paediatrics, whether in children, adolescents or young
      adults, where it is not only the patient's quality of life that is at stake, but also their
      emotional and psychomotor development. In these patients, prolonged hospitalization (at least
      6 weeks) in a sterile room will be responsible for physical deconditioning accompanied by a
      decrease in muscle mass, itself concomitant with undernutrition, and an increase in sedentary
      lifestyle. This prolonged hospitalisation in a sterile room, associated with myeloablative
      treatments, is therefore the cause of social isolation of patients, but it is also often
      synonymous with physical inactivity leading to a rapid decrease in physical condition,
      quality of life and an increase in fatigue.

      Today, the benefits of physical activity (PA) during and after cancer treatment have been
      widely demonstrated.

      The objective is to evaluate the feasibility of an adapted physical activity program during
      the isolation phase for achieving aHSCT in children, adolescents and young adults. This is a
      prospective, interventional, monocentric cohort study conducted at the Institute of
      Paediatric Haematology and Oncology in Lyon. The intervention will take place during the
      isolation phase and consists of an adapted physical activity (APA) program defined at
      inclusion, integrating supervised sessions with an APA teacher, as well as autonomous
      sessions. The program is individualized according to age, aerobic capacity, and PA
      preferences. Sessions are also tailored to the biological, psychological, and social
      parameters of patients.

      The total duration of the intervention is 3 months. To date, no PA studies have been
      performed in patients under 21 years of age requiring aGCSH during the sterile isolation
      phase. EVAADE will therefore be the first study in this population to offer an innovative
      procedure with a connected device.

    <description>Supervised sessions of at least 15 minutes 4 times a Week combined with unsupervised sessions.
The supervised activities include moderate-intensity aerobic activities (exercise bike), muscle strengthening (dumbbells, elastic bands, medicine balls) and playful situations (ball games, cooperative games, body expression games).
Each patient can also do unsupervised sessions, autonomously, on the bike thanks to a smartphone application developed by the Kiplin company, with challenges to be carried out by teams of 2 to 5 people (team including several patients, possibility to include relatives) over periods of 1 to 3 weeks per challenge.</description>
