    <textblock>
      This study aims to enable delivery of a multi-component intervention comprising of strategies
      based on Disease Control Priorities 3rd edition for management of hypertension among
      hypertensive patients. The secondary objective is to test the feasibility, acceptability and
      adaptability of a multi-component intervention delivered at a tertiary level health-care
      facility in the cultural context of Pakistan. A formative research study was conducted before
      so as to develop and test the intervention in a tertiary care hospital setting. The
      investigators employed qualitative research methods to explore the feasibility,
      applicability, and acceptance of DCP3 based intervention comprising of strategies for
      hypertension management. Focus group discussions and in-depth interviews with selected study
      participants were conducted at Armed Forces Institute of Cardiology (AFIC/NIHD), Rawalpindi
      for which a prior written and verbal consent was obtained from all research participants. The
      study adhered to the ethical principles of involving human subjects in the research. All
      information provided by the participants was recorded and was kept strictly confidential.
