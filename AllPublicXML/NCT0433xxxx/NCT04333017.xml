  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Parietal endometriosis is the implantation of endometrial tissue in abdominal structures more
      superficial than the peritoneum. It is a rare form of the disease (incidence estimated
      between 0.04 and 12% among women operated on for endometriosis depending on the series) but
      is classically resistant to medical treatment and can be disabling. Surgical resection is
      currently the reference treatment in the event of failure of hormonal treatment, despite the
      sometimes significant skin scars and the risk of parietal fragility that may require a cure
      of venting by parietal prosthesis. The recurrence rate after surgical resection is 4.3%. The
      use of radiofrequency for therapeutic purposes is nowadays described in multiple applications
      such as cardiac arrhythmia, neurological and spinal disorders, as well as for the treatment
      of liver, kidney, prostate, breast, lung or skin cancers. Its use has already been reported
      in the field of benign gynecology with, in particular, demonstrated efficacy in the treatment
      of uterine fibroids by laparoscopic, trans-vaginal or percutaneous means. There are also
      large published series on radiofrequency for the treatment of adenomyosis, by the
      transvaginal and laparoscopic route.

      In the context of parietal endometriosis, this would be a minimally invasive, percutaneous
      treatment. Ultrasound guidance allowing good targeting of the lesions and the procedure would
      most often be carried out on an outpatient basis and under local anaesthesia. And in case of
      failure or partial effectiveness, the reference treatment would remain accessible for these
      patients.

      There is only one published case of the use of radiofrequency in parietal endometriosis (case
      reports). Despite results that seem encouraging in terms of a rapid and prolonged therapeutic
      effect on symptoms, no further cases or series have been published since.

      Our study aims to investigate the feasibility of percutaneous radiofrequency treatment for
      parietal endometriosis, with the secondary objective of evaluating the safety, efficacy and
      risk factors for failure of the technique.

      10 patients will be treated. For follow-up all patients will have an ultrasound and MRI
      before treatment, then an ultrasound at 1 month, 3 months and 6 months post-treatment and a
      second MRI at 6 months post-treatment. The investigators will also evaluate pain and quality
      of life with specific questionnaires at each visit.

    <intervention_name>Percutaneous radiofrequency ablation of parietal endometriosis</intervention_name>
    <description>Treatment is carried out under local anaesthesia after surgical asepsis, in interventional radiology room. Radiofrequency needles are inserted percutaneously under ultrasound guidance. Number of needles depends on the size of lesion (1 needle if &lt; 50mm, 2 to 3 needles if &gt; 50mm). In case of proximity between lesion and peritoneum, artificial ascites can be performed. Treatment is carried out in accordance with device's instructions for use (thyroid nodules treatment algorithm), with a gradual increase in power every 5 minutes, without exceeding the maximum authorised power (depending on number and length of needles). State of coagulation is monitored under visual ultrasound control of ablation area (diffusion of Co bubbles), until a decrease in effective power is obtained. Several ablation zones are performed on the same nodule with overlapping of the different impacts. An ice pack is applied to the treated area. An analgesic PO treatment of step 1 and/or 2 is prescribed for 5 days.</description>
