      The aim of this study is to investigate the chronic hemodynamic and autonomic repercussions
      of the insertion of VRBT in CR. To qualitatively analyze the perception of patients and
      physiotherapists regarding the use of VRBT, as well as their association with CR, and through
      a new questionnaire that takes into account patients 'adherence, identifying which are the
      main barriers that influence patients' absences.

      Introduction: Despite the benefits that cardiovascular rehabilitation programs (CR) can
      promote, there are problems regarding adherence, which can be related to several factors,
      among them, motivation. Alternative therapies can reflect on motivation and promote increased
      adherence to CR. In this context, virtual reality-based therapy (VRBT) appears as an option.
      Additionally, chronic hemodynamic and autonomic repercussions of VRBT in relation to CV still
      need to be investigated. Objective: To evaluate the chronic hemodynamic and autonomic
      repercussions of the insertion of VRBT in CR. To qualitatively analyze the perception of
      patients and physiotherapists regarding the use of TRV, as well as their association with CR,
      and through a new questionnaire that takes into account patients 'adherence, identifying
      which are the main barriers that influence patients' absences. Methods: cardiac patients or
      individuals with factors that regularly participate in CR will participate in this study.
      Patients will be randomly allocated to CR + VRBT intervention or keeping the normal routine.
      Interventions will be carried out three times a week for 12 weeks. The primary outcome will
      be to assess chronic hemodynamic repercussions (blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate,
      oxygen saturation and perceived exertion using the Borg scale) and autonomic (linear and
      non-linear data). The secondary outcome consists of a qualitative assessment through a focus
      group with patients and a focus group with therapists, in addition, the new questionnaire
      developed to identify the influence of barriers on patients' adherence to CR will be applied.

    <description>Participants in a cardiovascular rehabilitation program will be randomly allocated to CR + VRBT interventions. This group will hold 3 weekly sessions (one for VRBT and two for CR) for 12 weeks. In the first, sixth and last week, chronic hemodynamic data and autonomic data will be evaluated.Furthermore,at the end of 12 weeks, a focus group with therapists and a focus group with patients will be held to identify qualitative aspects in relation to the insertion of VRBT. And in all eligible patients of CR wiil be applied the Questionnaire of barriers identification in frequenters of Cardiovascular Rehabilitation.</description>

    <description>The warm-up was performed using the &quot;Just Dance 2015&quot; game, in a sequence previously defined in a pilot study, aiming to increase HR progressively. A multimedia projector (Epson Power Life, H309A, China) connected to a console (Xbox One KinectTM, Microsoft, Redmond, WA) was used to project the game onto a white wall.The conditioning phase was performed using the &quot;Shape Up&quot; exercise game, in which patients perform exercises following a virtual therapist.</description>
