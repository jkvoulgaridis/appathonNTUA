  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It has been established that the consumption of a diet that causes a low rise in blood
      insulin levels is beneficial in terms of risk for diabetes and heart disease. Furthermore, it
      is known that certain nutrients contained within a food play an important role in the insulin
      response of that food. For example, the type and quantity of protein has been shown to affect
      the insulin response to particular foods.

      Different types of infant formula exist, containing different levels and types of protein,
      yet the impact of these different infant formulas on blood insulin levels is not known.

      Using a randomized, double blind, cross-over study design, the insulin response to four test
      milks was compared in healthy adults. The four test milks were as follows: i) infant formula
      containing partially hydrolyzed protein; ii) infant formula with intact protein; (iii) infant
      formula with a higher energy and protein content compared to (i) and (ii); and (iv) human
      breast milk (in a small sub-group). The aim of the study was to show that the insulin
      response to the partially hydrolyzed formula is similar to that of an infant formula with
      intact protein.
