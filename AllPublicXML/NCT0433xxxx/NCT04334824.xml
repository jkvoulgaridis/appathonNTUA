  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the use of hydrochlorothiazide is
      associated with an increased risk of skin cancer compared with the use of
      angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. More specifically, the investigators will
      assess the risk of non-melanoma and melanoma skin cancer. The investigators hypothesize that
      the use of hydrochlorothiazide is associated with an increased risk of skin cancer compared
      with ACE inhibitors.

      The investigators will carry out separate population-based cohort studies using
      administrative health databases from seven Canadian provinces and the United States. The
      study cohort will be defined by the initiation of hydrochlorothiazide or an ACE inhibitor,
      with follow-up until an incident diagnosis of non-melanoma or melanoma skin cancer. The
      results from the separate sites will be combined to provide an overall assessment of the risk
      of non-melanoma and melanoma skin cancer in users of hydrochlorothiazide.

      The study objective is to determine whether the use of hydrochlorothiazide is associated with
      an increased risk of skin cancer compared with the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)
      inhibitors. More specifically, the investigators will assess whether hydrochlorothiazide is
      associated with the risk of non-melanoma and melanoma skin cancer.

      A common-protocol approach will be used to conduct retrospective cohort studies using
      administrative health data from seven Canadian provinces (Alberta, British Columbia,
      Manitoba, Nova Scotia, Ontario, Quebec, and Saskatchewan) and the United States (US)
      MarketScan database. Briefly, the Canadian databases include population-level data on
      physician billing, diagnoses and procedures from hospital discharge abstracts, and
      dispensations for prescription drugs. The data in Alberta, Nova Scotia, and Ontario will be
      restricted to patients aged 65 years old and older. The US MarketScan database includes
      individuals and their dependents covered by large US employer health insurance plans, and
      government and public organizations.

      In each jurisdiction, the investigators will assemble a study cohort that includes all
      patients aged 40 years or older newly-treated with hydrochlorothiazide or an ACE inhibitor
      between April 1, 1995 and March 31, 2018 (or the latest date of data availability at each
      site). The date of study cohort entry will be defined by the dispensation date of the newly
      prescribed hydrochlorothiazide or ACE inhibitor. Patients will be followed starting 366 days
      after study cohort entry until an incident diagnosis of non-melanoma or melanoma, or censored
      upon switching to a study drug, death, end of coverage or end of the study period (March 31,
      2018), whichever occurs first.

      Exposure will be defined as a prescription for hydrochlorothiazide or an ACE inhibitor on the
      date of cohort entry. The exposures will be lagged by one year in order to consider a minimum
      cancer latency period between treatment initiation and the diagnosis of skin cancer. Analyses
      will be conducted using a modified intention-to-treat approach. The outcomes of interest will
      be non-melanoma and melanoma skin cancer.

      Cox proportional hazards will be used to estimate site-specific adjusted hazard ratios (HR)
      and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) for each outcome of interest among
      hydrochlorothiazide users compared to ACE inhibitor users. Secondary analyses will be
      conducted for each outcome of interest. These will include the following: 1) cumulative
      duration of use, 2) dose-response relation, 3) effect modification by age (≤65, 66-74, and
      ≥75 years), sex and immunosuppressive status, and 4) time since initiation of treatment (&lt;3,
      3-5, and &gt;5 years). For non-melanoma, events will be further classified into basal cell
      carcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma sub-types in jurisdictions where data is available.
      Three sensitivity analyses will be performed to assess the robustness of study results and
      address some of the study limitations. Site-specific results will be combined by
      random-effects meta-analysis to provide an overall assessment of the risk of non-melanoma and
      melanoma skin cancer in hydrochlorothiazide users compared to ACE inhibitor users.
