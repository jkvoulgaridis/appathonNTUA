    <textblock>
      Phase I study of RO7119929 given orally to participants with unresectable advanced or
      metastatic primary liver cancers and other solid tumors with predominant liver involvement.
      The primary objective of the study is to explore the safety and to determine the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) and/or optimal biologic dose (OBD) of RO7119929 as single agent.
