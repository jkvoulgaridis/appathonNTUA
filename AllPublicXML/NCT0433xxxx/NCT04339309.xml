  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Periodontitis is treated by regularly clearance of the disease-causing biofilm through
      domestic care and dental measures (Petersilka et al., 2002, Herrera et al., 2008). Healthy
      gums have intact papillae occluding the interdental area. Successful brushing cleans these
      areas; the prophylaxis of gingivitis for such patients does therefore not require special
      aids. In contrast, initial attachment loss as a result of inflammation or restorative therapy
      leads to additional cleaning needs, since the normal brush is not able to clean interdental
      areas as successful as vestibular and oral surfaces (Dörfer and Staehle, 2010).

      It can be said that interdental brushes are the most effective tools for cleaning interdental
      spaces (Salzer et al., 2015). Compared with a toothbrush, they are the only tool showing
      better results of plaque removal and reduction of gingivitis (Slot et al., 2008). Therefore
      their use should not be restricted to older people with already reduced interdental papillae.
      A big advantage is that interdental brushes are generally easy to use. If brush sizes are
      chosen correctly, insertion and multiple forward and backward movement is sufficient to
      obtain com- plete cleaning of the interproximal surfaces. Additional cleaning by other means
      such as dental floss is not always necessary because interdental brushes clean approximal and
      subgingival surfaces sufficiently, providing the size was chosen correctly (Dörfer and
      Staehle, 2010).

      Due to the above mentioned coherences and associations, this study includes the hypothesis
      that patients with periodontitis would benefit from the instruction and motivation of
      interdental brushes within the active periodontitis therapy in comparison to a periodontitis
      therapy without the instructed domestic interdental hygiene by a stronger reduction of
      clinical inflammatory characteristics (Salzer et al., 2015). The corresponding
      Zero-Hypothesis says that no difference would be found between both groups.

    <description>Probing Pocket Depth (PPD) at every site will be assessed as the distance (mm) from the gingival margin to the apical end of the pocket using a PCP UNC-15 probe (Hu-Friedy, Chicago Ill, USA). The probe will be inserted parallel to the root surface and directed apically toward the perceived location of the apex of the root until slight resistance is felt. Probe recordings will be rounded off to the nearest millimeter mark. PPDs are measured at six areas of the tooth. These are the disto-vestibular, vestibular, mesio-vestibular, disto-lingual, lingual and the mesio-lingual. First the vestibular surface is probed and scored. Thereafter, the lingual surface is probed and scored.</description>

    <description>The CAL at every site will be measured as the distance between the cemento-enamel junction (CEJ) and the apical end of the pocket using a PCP UNC-15 probe (Hu-Friedy, Chicago Ill, USA). The probe will be placed parallel to the tooth surface and probe recordings will be rounded off to the nearest millimeter mark. A score is given to six areas of the tooth. These are the disto-vestibular, vestibular, mesio-vestibular, disto-lingual, lingual and the mesio-lingual. First the vestibular surface is probed and scored. Thereafter, the lingual surface is probed and scored.</description>
