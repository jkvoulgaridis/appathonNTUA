    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that duvelisib maintenance after autologous stem cell
      transplant with carmustine, etoposide, cytarabine, and melphalan (BEAM) conditioning in
      patients with T-cell lymphomas, or a history of indolent B-cell lymphomas, will be safe and
      well tolerated, and will improve progression free survival.

    <description>-Patients who received the standard BEAM regimen with autologous hematopoietic stem cells transplant will begin duvelisib maintenance at 25 mg PO BID after count recovery (approximately 30 days after transplant) for one year. If the patient is in a complete remission at day +100, with no evidence of disease on PET/CT, then the dosing schedule of duvelisib may be changed to 25 mg BID for 14 days, then 14 days off in 28 day cycles (at the treating physician's discretion). If the patient has residual disease, duvelisib will continue at 25 mg BID until they have a negative PET CT. PET CTs will be completed every 3 months for patients with residual disease. Duvelisib maintenance will be continued for one year post-transplant.</description>
