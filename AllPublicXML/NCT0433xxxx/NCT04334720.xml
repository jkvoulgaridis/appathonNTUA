    <textblock>
      False positives for Brown Fat &amp; Muscle（F&amp;M） always affect the evaluation of metabolic disease
      treatment. Recently, using PET/CT，international journals such as Journal of Nuclear Medicine
      reported that the amount of active brown fat was correlated with renal creatinine clearance
      and subject to regulation by atrial natriuretic peptide in addition to association of season
      and temperature. At present，studies based on PET/CT have shown that elimination of the above
      factors, brown fat(even muscle) will still appear false positive metabolism in tumor
      patients. In view of the basis of Positron emission computed tomography/Magnetic resonance
      (PET/MRI) brain function research，our team speculate that it may be related to psychological
      or cortex metabolism. And there is a lack of studies on the correlation between the
      psychosocial，cortex structure and metabolism. Therefore, it suggests that，combination of
      structure and metabolism，PET/MRI will play a role in studying the effects of psychological on
      F&amp;M false-positive metabolism in malignant patients. In this project, the investigators
      intend to observe the changes of F&amp;M metabolism with psychological and cortex metabolism
      after comprehensive treatment in malignant patient by combining PET/MRI. The relationship
      between F&amp;M metabolism and psychological will be deeply analyzed to provide scientific basis
      for the development of the differential diagnosis and assessment.
