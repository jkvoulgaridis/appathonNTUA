    <textblock>
      Depression is a severe mental disorder that affects 5-7% of Belgians each year.
      Unfortunately, many individuals with depression do not seek professional help, and if they do
      seek professional help, waiting lists for psychotherapy are typically very long.

      To help resolve this problem, this study aims to investigate whether blended therapies, i.e.
      therapies that consist of a mixture of face-to-face sessions and online sessions, are
      (cost-)effective as a treatment for depression, and whether they are as (cost-)effective as
      traditional treatments which consist of face-to-face sessions alone. Should this be the case,
      then blended therapy can be implemented on a large scale in mental health care, as it could
      provide a more cost-effective means of helping individuals with depression.

      This study also aims to investigate whether certain patient features, such as the severity of
      depression and personality traits, may influence the efficacy of (blended) psychotherapy for
      depression.

      Finally, we will also investigate patients' attitudes towards and experience of blended
      therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Depression is a highly prevalent disorder with a lifetime prevalence of 15-25%, and is
      associated with high psychosocial and economic costs (e.g, suicide, absenteeism, long-term
      disability). Epidemiological research shows that depression is underrecognized and
      underdiagnosed in Belgium, resulting in very high unmet needs, with more than 50% of patients
      not seeking professional help in the first year after onset and often taking patients up to
      10 years and more to effectively seek professional help (Bruffaerts et al., 2007, 2008). The
      current lack of capacity of mental health services in Belgium is a major obstacle in attempts
      to increase access to effective psychotherapy for depression. Centers for Mental Health Care
      ('Centra Geestelijke Gezondheidszorg', CGGs) in particular are faced with a growing number of
      patients (+3% per year). Despite their efforts (e.g., by offering more group-based
      psychotherapy and interventions), CGGs in Belgium are faced with increasingly longer waiting
      lists. There is therefore an urgent need for (cost-)effective, time-saving interventions in
      the mental health care system in Belgium.

      Both pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy alone or in combination have been shown to be
      effective in the treatment of depression, and meta-analyses have shown no substantial
      differences in the efficacy of two of the empirically most validated types of brief
      face-to-face (FTF) psychotherapy in major depression, i.e., Cognitive Behavioral Therapy
      (CBT) and Psychodynamic Therapy (PDT) (Cuijpers et al., 2013; Cuijpers, Van Straten, Van
      Oppen, &amp; Andersson, 2008; Driessen et al., 2015; Luyten &amp; Blatt, 2012; Munder et al., 2018).
      Moreover, meta-analyses and qualitative reviews converge to suggest that internet-based
      interventions, particularly offered as blended care (combining face-to-face sessions with
      internet-based modules), may be equally effective as FTF psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy in
      major depression both at treatment termination and at follow-up in the medium to long-term,
      suggesting non-inferiority (Andersson, Cuijpers, Carlbring, Riper, &amp; Hedman, 2014). Extant
      research in this domain also suggests that both CBT and PDT delivered through the internet
      may be effective in depression. Moreover, the available evidence suggests that internet-based
      psychotherapy if combined with therapist support may be more cost-effective as it typically
      reduces the number of face-to-face contacts, without compromising the effectiveness of
      psychotherapy (Andersson, Titov, Dear, Rozental, &amp; Carlbring, 2019). Hence, the
      implementation of blended care may lead to increased availability of psychotherapy for
      depression and a more effective use of resources in mental health care, at least for a
      subsample of depressed patients.

      The primary objective of this study is therefore to investigate the non-inferiority (defined
      as a small-sized difference in effect size (Cohen's d= .20) of blended PDT and CBT for
      depression compared to FTF PDT and CBT in adults diagnosed with major depressive disorder
      (n=504) in the context of a pragmatic, multicenter randomized controlled trial. Patients will
      be randomized to one of four conditions (i.e., blended PDT, blended CBT, FTF PDT, or FTF
      CBT). The primary outcome is changes in the severity of depression as measured by the Beck
      Depression Inventory (BDI-II; Beck, Steer, &amp; Brown, 1996) at 6 months follow-up
      (approximately 12 months after the start of treatment).

      In addition, this study will investigate the comparative efficacy of blended care versus FTF
      psychotherapy on the following secondary outcomes: severity of depression as measured with
      the BDI-II at treatment termination, and at 6-month, and one- and two-year follow-up;
      recovery from depression as assessed with the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM 5
      disorders - Clinical Trials Version (SCID-5-CT; American Psychiatric Association) and the
      Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) at treatment termination, and at 6-month, and one- and
      two-year follow-up; and quality of life as measured with the EuroQol-5D-5L (EQ-5D-5L; Herdman
      et al., 2011) at treatment termination, and at 6-month, and one- and two-year follow-up.

      Furthermore, this study will also examine possible predictors of treatment response in
      blended care versus FTF therapy, such as severity of depression (BDI-II, PHQ-9), psychiatric
      co-morbidity (SCID-5-CT), and patients' experience of both types of treatment as assessed
      with the Credibility and Expectancy Questionnaire (CEQ; Devilly &amp; Borkovec, 2000). In
      addition, the feasibility of implementing blended care in mental health care centers in
      Flanders, Belgium, will be investigated. To this end, we will record recruitment rate,
      retention in treatment, treatment adherence, and adherence to the research protocol.
      Acceptability will be indicated by the number of sessions attended, including the number of
      individuals who refuse treatment, and feasibility by the number of patients failing to comply
      with the full clinical and research protocol. Patients will also complete very brief measures
      of credibility of the treatments and satisfaction with the treatments. Treatment integrity of
      therapists will be assessed on the basis of independent ratings of audio or video recorded
      psychotherapy sessions, applying a treatment integrity instrument developed in the UK
      specifically for the treatments used in this study (Lemma, Target, &amp; Fonagy, 2011).

      Finally, provided blended care is non-inferior to FTF therapy, the cost-effectiveness of
      blended care versus FTF psychotherapy will be investigated from a societal perspective, i.e.,
      taking all relevant costs and effects into account (intervention costs, direct and indirect
      medical costs, as well as productivity losses and costs made elsewhere in the health care
      system). To this end, patients will complete the Trimbos and Institute for Medical Technology
      Assessment (iMTA) Questionnaire on Costs Associated with Psychiatric Illness (TIC-P; Bouwmans
      et al., 2013). Moreover, health care use data for all patients will be provided by the
      Rijksinstituut voor Ziekte- en Invaliditeitsverzekering (RIZIV).

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age 18-65

          -  Current diagnosis of major depressive disorder with or without dysthymic disorder
             according to DSM 5 criteria.

          -  PHQ score ≥ 10.

        Note: Use of pharmacotherapy for depression and other psychiatric disorders during the
        intervention is allowed (with the exception of antipsychotic medication for psychotic
        disorder), as this reflects routine clinical care. Of note, in routine clinical care, it is
        not uncommon that antipsychotic medication is prescribed for symptoms in the
        depressive-anxious cluster rather than for primary psychotic symptoms.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Current psychotic symptoms or bipolar disorder.

          -  Current use of antipsychotic medication specifically for the treatment of primary
             psychotic disorder.

          -  Severe Personality Disorder (e.g., borderline personality disorder).

          -  Historic or current self-injury/parasuicide of such extent and/or severity that may
             substantially interfere with the ability to engage in brief psychotherapy.

          -  Current excessive use of drugs/alcohol.

          -  Not fluent in Dutch.

          -  Clinical contra-indication to brief psychotherapy (e.g., attachment history - multiple
             separations, serious ongoing trauma in childhood, multiple caregivers - suggesting the
             need for longer-term psychotherapy).

          -  Evidence of pervasive use of help.

          -  Highly unstable or insecure life arrangements.

          -  No access to computer/internet or computer illiteracy.

          -  Participation in another depression clinical trial within the last year where the
             participant has received CBT or PDT.
