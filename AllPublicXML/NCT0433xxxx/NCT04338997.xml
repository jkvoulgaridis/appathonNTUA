      Single center, open-label, intra-individual dose-escalation study in subjects with
      mild/moderate Parkinson's Disease

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After assessing eligibility during a screening period of up to 4 weeks, up to 6 subjects will
      be included.

      Subjects will check into the clinic one day prior to dosing (Day -1). To evaluate and compare
      drug exposure levels in plasma and CSF, plasma and CSF will be serially sampled over a period
      of 36 hours. Subjects will be discharged from the clinic on Day 5 after all required study
      procedures are completed and if medically justified.

      Subjects will return to the clinic approximately 1 week after discharge from the clinic for a
      follow-up visit.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject is a man or woman aged between 45 and 75, inclusive.

          -  Documented clinically established diagnosis of Parkinson's Disease, Hoehn &amp; Yahr stage
             1 to 3 and Montreal Cognitive Assessment greater or equal than 26. Diagnosis of
             Parkinson's Disease consistent wit MDS Research Criteria for the Diagnosis of
             Parkinson's Disease must include bradykinesia with sequence effect, and motor
             asymmetry (especially if no rest tremor). Diagnosis has to be made less than 3 years
             prior to Screening.

          -  The subject understands the nature and purpose of the study, including possible risks
             and side effects, and i willing and able to comply with all compulsory stud procedures
             and provides signed and dated written informed consent (in accordance with local
             regulations) prior to any study procedures being performed.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject used any NSAIDs, steroids, colchicine or anti-IL-1 inhibitors within 7
             days prior to Day 1.

          -  The subject received any investigational drugs within 4 weeks or 5 half-lives
             (whichever is longer), prior to Day 1.

          -  The subject had an active systemic infection (other than common cold) within 2 weeks
             prior to Day 1.

          -  The subject has a history of severe hypersensitivity to previous drugs.

          -  The subject has any severe, progressive or uncontrolled medical condition at Screening
             or on Day -1 that in the judgment of the investigator prevents the subject from
             participating in the study.
