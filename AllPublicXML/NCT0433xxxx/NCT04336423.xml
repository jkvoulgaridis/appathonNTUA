  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to build a microbiome cohort by collecting sputum and fecal samples every few
      months for three years from healthy smokers and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
      patients. The aim of this study is to analyze the composition of microbiome of various
      samples (e.g. sputum, feces) and describe the difference between healthy smokers and COPD
      patients.

    <textblock>
      After the introduction of the gut-lung axis theory, extensive studies revealed the diversity
      of microbiomes among healthy smokers and COPD patients form the respiratory samples or lung
      tissues. In the previous study, distinct difference in composition of microbiome in lung
      tissue between healthy smokers and COPD patients was reported. This study is to build a
      microbiome cohort by collecting sputum and fecal samples every few months for three years
      from healthy smokers and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients who are being
      followed up by Asan Medical Center. The aim of this study is to analyze the composition of
      microbiome of various samples (e.g. sputum, feces) and describe the difference between
      healthy smokers and COPD patients. This study would help establishing gut-lung axis model in
      humans.

    <description>DNA is extracted from each sample from each patient by using a DNA Isolation Kit. The 16S universal primers are used for amplification of 16S ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA) genes with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) system. After amplication, sequencing is performed using the GREENGENES database, after which a metagenomic analysis was performed by the MD Healthcare corporation using MDx-Pro software (Ver.1, Seoul, South Korea). Taxonomic assignment of these sequences is carried out with an operational taxonomic unit (OTU) cutoff of 3%.</description>
