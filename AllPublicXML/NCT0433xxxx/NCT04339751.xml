      Background:

      Cushing s disease is caused by excess ACTH hormone release by a benign tumor of the pituitary
      gland. It can lead to decreased quality of life and early death. The current best treatment
      for Cushing s disease is surgery. If surgery does not work or if the tumor returns, there are
      no more good treatment options. Vorinostat, which is approved to treat a type of lymphoma,
      might be a treatment option.

      Objective:

      To test vorinostat to see if it can kill tumor cells and change the number of hormones
      released in people with Cushing s disease.

      Eligibility:

      People ages 18 and older who have Cushing s disease and are scheduled for surgery under
      protocol 03-N-0164 to remove a tumor in their pituitary gland

      Design:

      Participants will be screened under protocol 03-N-0164.

      Participants will stay in the hospital for 8 days before their surgery.

      On the first day, participants will have a physical exam and blood tests. They will have
      their urine collected for testing all day. They will have an ECG: For this, small metal disks
      or sticky electrode pads will be placed on their chest to record heart activity.

      For the next 7 days, participants will have blood tests and all-day urine collection. They
      will drink at least 2 liters of fluid per day. They will take the study drug by mouth each
      morning.

      On the eighth day, participants will have their surgery. Leftover tissue will be collected
      for research.

      On the day they are discharged from the hospital, participants will have a physical exam and
      blood tests.

      Objective

      Cushing s disease is caused by excess ACTH hormone release by a benign tumor of the pituitary
      gland. The resulting increase in cortisol levels caused by increased ACTH causes a severe
      condition that leads to decreased quality of life and early death. The current best first
      treatment for Cushing s disease is surgery. However, if surgery is unsuccessful or if the
      tumor returns, there are no good treatment options for patients. In laboratory studies, we
      discovered that a previously FDA approved oral medication Vorinostat was able to kill tumors
      cells and reduce ACTH secretion. We want to test whether this drug can be used in patients
      with Cushing s disease to reduce ACTH levels.

      Study Population

      Adult (&gt; 18 years old) patients with a diagnosis of Cushing s disease that qualify for
      surgery through a different NIH protocol (#03-N-0164).

      Design

      We will recruit patients with Cushing s disease who have surgery planned for removal of the
      pituitary tumor. If they consent, we will admit them as inpatients for 8 days before surgery.
      After a thorough laboratory investigation, we will administer Vorinostat by mouth daily for 7
      days. During this time, we will measure the levels of ACTH and glucocorticoid hormones in the
      blood and urine daily. On the 8th day, we will perform the surgery as planned. We also will
      test tissue obtained during surgery to evaluate the drug s effect on the tumors.

      Outcome Measures

      The main outcome measure is the midnight plasma ACTH level on the last day of drug
      administration. A secondary outcome measure is the serum cortisol change during drug
      administration.-
