    <textblock>
      Drug Hypersensitivity Syndrome or DRESS for &quot;Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic
      Symptoms&quot; is a serious drug allergy which can be life-threatening for patients with serious
      organ damage. The pathophysiology of DRESS is still not fully understood. In particular, no
      study has focused on the characterization of eosinophils, while paradoxically eosinophilia is
      one of the diagnostic criteria. Likewise, there is no data about the origin of eosinophils
      and few data are available concerning immune polarization of T-cells or the involvement of
      innate lymphoid cells type 2 in the recruitment of eosinophils. Our preliminary data on
      increase activation markers membrane expression of cutaneous eosinophils suggest that this
      approach could allow the identification of endotypes in which eosinophils are involved and
      contribute to organ damages. The correlation between tissue infiltration of eosinophils and
      their degree of activation would then justify the development of targeted therapeutic
      strategies in DRESS syndrome (anti-IL-5 therapy?). The aim of the project is: 1) Evaluate the
      activation status of circulating and cutaneous eosinophils in patients with DRESS compared
      with drug induced maculopapular exanthema without or with eosinophilia (but do not fulfill
      DRESS criteria) and healthy subjects; 2) Understand the pathophysiological mechanisms at the
      origin of this eosinophilia.
