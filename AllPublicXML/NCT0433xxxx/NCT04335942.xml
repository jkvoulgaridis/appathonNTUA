  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Spinal cord injuries and people with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy or Infant Spinal Muscular
      Atrophy (ISA) are prone to pain and pressure sores associated with prolonged sitting. For
      this reason, it is recommended that people with spinal cord injuries release pressure every
      15 to 30 minutes and motorized wheelchair users use the electric positioning functions at
      least 1 minute every hour.

      The aim is to prevent and/or reduce pain and pressure sores. These devices could help to
      observe daily the variability of users' pressure maps, their impact on occupational
      performance, the link with pain and redness and could propose customized adjustments.

      The main objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of an algorithm that characterizes
      the cruro-ischiatic fingerprints used in daily life and that issues an alert in case of
      detection of a pressure sore risk defined by the literature on the occupational performance
      of the subjects.

      The resulting assumption is based on the following points:

        -  The algorithms implemented in this device are able to calculate and isolate a number of
           cruro-ischiatic fingerprints used during the day during priority activities and active
           or passive position changes.

        -  They may, in the event of a risk position, issue alerts based on the recommendations.

      This will allow us to analyze the impact of these alerts on the changes in position and
      relief actually performed by the subject, analyze the consequences on the MCRO score
      (psychosocial impact on occupational performance) and verify the impact of visual biofeedback
      on chair positioning.
