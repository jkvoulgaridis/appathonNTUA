      IO-002 study is a multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation Phase I/IIa clinical study to
      evaluate the safety and tolerability, PK, PD, and antitumor activity of EOS884448 in
      participants with advanced cancers.

      Multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation Phase I/IIa clinical study to evaluate the safety
      and tolerability, PK, PD, and antitumor activity of EOS884448 in participants with advanced
      cancers. The study will be conducted in 2 parts. The first part is a dose-escalation to
      determine the MTD, the RP2D, and the safety of EOS884448 in participants with advanced
      cancers. The subsequent expansion part will further explore safety, PK, PD responses, and
      antitumor activity of EOS884448 at the RP2D as monotherapy in participants with selected
      cancer types.

          2. Be more than18 years of age on day of signing informed consent.

          3. Have histologically or cytologically confirmed advanced or metastatic cancer for whom
             no standard treatment is further available

          4. Have evaluable disease, per RECIST v1.1 for solid tumor escalation or other criteria
             if indicated

          5. Have an ECOG performance status of Grade 0 to 1.

          6. Have adequate organ function.

          2. Has undergone major surgery within 5 weeks before initiating treatment.

          3. Has received prior radiotherapy within 2 weeks of start of IP.

          4. Has toxicity (except for alopecia) related to prior anti-cancer therapy, unless the
