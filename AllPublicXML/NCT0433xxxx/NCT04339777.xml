    <textblock>
      Background:

      During a transplant, blood stem cells from one person are given to someone else. The cells
      grow into the different cells that make up the immune system. This can cure people with
      certain immunodeficiencies. But transplant has many risks and complications.

      Objective:

      To see if stem cell transplant can be successfully performed in people with primary
      immunodeficiency disease and cure them.

      Eligibility:

      People ages 4-69 for whom a primary immunodeficiency has caused significant health problems
      and either standard management has not worked or there are no standard management options,
      along with their donors

      Design:

      Donors will be screened under protocol 01-C-0129. They will donate blood or bone marrow.

      Participants will be screened with:

      Medical history

      Physical exam

      Blood, urine, and heart tests

      CT or PET scans

      Before transplant, participants will have dental and eye exams. They will have a bone marrow
      biopsy. For this, a needle will be inserted through the skin into the pelvis to remove
      marrow.

      Participants will be hospitalized before their transplant. They will have a central catheter
      put into a vein in their chest or neck. They will get medications through the catheter to
      prevent complications. Participants will get stem cells through the catheter. They will stay
      in the hospital for at least 4 weeks. They will give blood, urine, bone marrow, and stool
      samples. They may need blood transfusions. They may need more scans. They will take more
      medications.

      Participants will have visits on days 30, 60, 100, 180, and 360, and 24 months after the
      transplant. Then they will have visits once a year for about 5 years

      Background:

        -  With the availability of whole exome sequencing (WES) and whole genome sequencing (WGS)
           for patients with suspected immune deficiency, the number of recognized PID has
           increased in recent years to over 350 distinct immune defects.

        -  Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation represents a potentially curative
           therapy for many hematologic diseases.

        -  Hematopoietic stem cell transplant is now an accepted standard or an appropriate
           experimental approach for treatment of an increasing number of PID

        -  The use of conditioning regimens containing high doses of alkylating agents, often in
           combination with total body irradiation, are considered myeloablative and are essential
           and for suppression of the host-versus-graft response to the donor stem cells (i.e.
           rejection)

        -  We propose to evaluate the efficacy and safety of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell
           transplantation (HSCT) using selected conditioning regimens and selected donor sources
           in reconstituting normal hematopoiesis and immune function and reversing the disease
           phenotype in patients with primary immunodeficiency diseases.

      Objectives:

      -To determine whether allogeneic HSCT results in sustained donor engraftment defined as
      neutrophil recovery with ANC greater than or equalto 500/mm(3) for 3 consecutive days
      associated with &gt; 50% donor T-cell and myeloid cell donor chimerism before day 100 for
      diseases characterized by loss of function and &gt;75% donor T-cell and myeloid cell chimerism
      for diseases characterized by gain-of-function mutations.

      Eligibility:

        -  Recipients ages 4-69 years old with PID or clinical evidence of a PID with a history of
           at least one life-threatening infection or disfiguring infection due to opportunistic
           organisms.

        -  Have a 10/10 or a 9/10 HLA-matched related or unrelated donor (HLA -A, -B, -C, DRB1,
           DQB1 by high resolution typing identified through the National Marrow Donor Program), or
           a haploidentical related donor.

           dose will be based on pharmacokinetic levels from the test dose and will be targeted to
           an AUC of 3200-4000 microMol X min/L (52-65 mg X h/L) (3.2 mg/kg IV per day will be the
           default dose), and HSCT on day 0.

        -  Patients with PID receiving an intermediate intensity transplant conditioning regimen
           will receive a regimen consisting of of fludarabine 40 mg/m(2) IV once daily for 4 days

             appropriate informed consent

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because the study agents have the
             potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but
             potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the
             mother with the study agents, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is
             treated with the study agents.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, symptomatic
             congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric
             illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.
