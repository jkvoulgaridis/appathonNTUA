  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Iron deficiency and altered homeostasis due to inflammation and decreased iron utilization
      are main factors involved in anemia in liver disease. Lactoferrin is a first line defence
      protein for protection against microbial infections and subsequent development of systemic
      disease as seen with systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and sepsis. Lactoferrin
      with iron has been shown to be efficacious with anemia in chronic disease, in pregnancy and
      in cancer patients with fewer side effects than oral iron alone. High exposure to iron is
      associated with increased inflammation which is associated with worse cardiovascular
      outcomes. Lactoferrin can help reduce the total iron dose and hepatic inflammation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lactoferrin is a highly conserved, monomeric 80 kDa single polypeptide chain contained in
      most mammalian exocrine secretions, such as milk, saliva and tears, bronchial, and intestinal
      secretions. LTF is also found in the secondary granules of neutrophils a glycoprotein present
      in milk, has been demonstrated to possess a multitude of biological functions. Lactoferrin in
      Inflammation and Sepsis The antimicrobial activity of LTF is well documented and consists of
      two mechanisms: one is iron dependent and deals with high affinity of LTF to iron
      (bacteriostatic), and the other one is due to LTF affinity to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to
      function as a direct bactericidal agent for Gram-negative organisms. Small changes, such as
      single nucleotide polymorphisms, can affect outcomes against pathogenic agents . LTF
      interacts with cell surface receptors involved in &quot;danger signal&quot; recognition [e.g.,
      toll-like receptor (TLR)4, CD14, and CD22]. At the molecular level, LTF seems to reduce
      LPS-induced monocyte activation and subsequent production of pro-inflammatory mediators.
      Lactoferrin in Anemia in Liver Disease The hepatic expression of the hepcidin gene is
      regulated by signals which reflect body iron status and erythropoietic activity. The
      regulation of hepcidin by iron status includes a signal from the circulating transferrin via
      hepatocellular transferrin receptor (TfR2). Like transferrin, lactoferrin will deliver iron
      to hepatocytes but unlike transferrin, lactoferrin cannot deliver iron to erythroid cells.
      Lactoferrin does not interact with TfR1 or TfR2.
