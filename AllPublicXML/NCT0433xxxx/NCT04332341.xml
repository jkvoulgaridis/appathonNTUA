    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find a safe and tolerable way to improve engraftment after
      transplant. Research studies have shown that adding nicotinamide riboside to donor cells has
      the potential to increase blood stem cell numbers and potentially decrease the time to
      engraftment. Also, nicotinamide riboside, TRU NIAGEN (the study drug) is a type of vitamin B
      supplement that the general public can get without a prescription and is well tolerated.

      This is a single-center, pilot feasibility study of NR supplementation in allogeneic (donor)
      HCT in which the study team is seeking to obtain preliminary data on any beneficial effect of
      increasing NAD+ levels in-vivo to facilitate engraftment. Engraftment is defined as the
      process during which transplanted stem cells begin to grow in the bone marrow and produce new
      white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets. It takes about 14 to 24 days for donor
      cells to engraft after infusion, and the time between which blood counts fall to the time
      when they recover is a very critical period. Transfusions are frequently required to prevent
      bleeding and antibiotics are needed to prevent infections during this critical time period.
      Shortening the time of engraftment decreases these risks and can improve long-term health
      status.

      The primary objectives of this study is to evaluate safety and tolerability of NR
      supplementation

      The secondary objective of this study is to evaluate neutrophil and platelet recovery after
      HCT
