  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The standard of care for obese men starting Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is physician
      based dietary and exercise counseling. Interventions to lessen the harmful effects of ADT are
      needed yet have been limited. Exercise is one strategy that has been attempted however there
      is conflicting data as to whether or not exercise effectively improves body mass, results in
      sustained weight loss, improvements in metabolic risk profiles including glucose tolerance
      and lipid profiles in men starting ADT, or has any effect of progression of cancer. Dietary
      interventions have been attempted without clear improvement in weight, metabolic factors,
      quality of life or cancer progression. Bariatric arterial embolization (BAE), given it
      results in weight loss in obese men and women without cancer, may be able to stave off the
      harmful side effects of ADT by inducing weight loss. Therefore, the investigators hypothesize
      that Bariatric Arterial embolization (BAE), done prior to initiation of ADT, will mitigate
      the weight gain and metabolic side effects associated with ADT, by inducing weight loss of at
      least 5% in obese men with biochemical recurrent prostate cancer starting ADT.

      The primary objective is to determine if BAE, done prior to ADT initiation in obese men (with
      obesity related comorbid condition) with biochemically recurrent prostate cancer, can induce
      5% or greater weight loss at 6 months.
