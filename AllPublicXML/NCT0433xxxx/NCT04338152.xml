    <textblock>
      The present study is a confirmatory efficacy trial of Family Focused Therapy for youth at
      clinical high risk for psychosis (FFT-CHR). This trial is sponsored by seven mature CHR
      clinical research programs from the North American Prodrome Longitudinal Study (NAPLS). The
      young clinical high risk sample (N = 220 youth ages 13-25) is to be followed at 6-month
      intervals for 18 months.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This randomized, single blind trial will compare outcomes from a 6-month FFT-CHR intervention
      and a control condition (enhanced care, or EC) matched to the FFT-CHR in duration (6 months)
      and access to a clinician. Participants families in FFT-CHR are provided 18 family sessions
      augmented by a therapy app with content and surveys, while participants in the EC condition
      are provided three family sessions plus five monthly individual support and case management
      sessions. Duration of therapy sessions is one hour.

      Main Goals of FFT-CHR (Experimental Treatment)

        1. To assist young clients and their family in: developing a common understanding of CHR
           symptoms; recognizing early signs of escalating symptoms; practicing individual and
           family coping strategies; and pre-planning family responses to any escalation in
           symptoms. When families have poor understanding of CHR symptoms and strategies for their
           management, this can fuel stressful home dynamics and contribute to youth withdrawal and
           decompensation.

        2. For the youth and their family members to learn to express more constructive messages
           during their interactions, particularly regarding highly charged topics such as curbing
           risky behaviors and management of the offspring's symptoms.

        3. For youth and family members to practice skills for resolving family or extrafamilial
           conflicts (usually those related to the youth's functioning) through effective
           communication and problem solving

      The control condition, Enhanced Care (EC) shares the psychoeducation goal of FFT-CHR but is
      more oriented toward skill-training for the individual patient. Whereas it does not offer the
      same level of opportunity for families to build communication and problem-solving skills, the
      family is actively involved in helping the individual develop a relapse prevention plan.
      Monthly individual sessions focus on the development of individual coping skills such as
      symptom tracking and problem-solving. Both conditions require families to submit real-time
      mobile app surveys to assist with progress tracking.

      Study Aims

      The primary clinical outcomes are prodromal positive symptom scores examined immediately
      after treatment (6 months) and at 18 months. Secondary outcomes are time to remission of
      positive symptoms and psychosocial functioning over 18 months. Temporal relationships between
      early changes in treatment targets and later changes in symptoms or psychosocial functioning
      will also be examined.

      Primary Hypotheses

        1. FFT-CHR (vs. EC) will be associated with greater improvement in positive symptoms by end
           of therapy and follow-up (6 and 18 months), and greater high-risk syndrome remission and
           better psychosocial functioning at 18 months

        2. FFT-CHR (vs. EC) will be associated with greater improvement in family communication and
           problem solving at 6 months

        3. FFT-CHR (vs. EC) will be associated with greater improvement in youth-perceived parental
           criticism at 6 months. In turn, improvements in family communication, problem-solving
           and youths' perceptions of criticism will be associated with downstream improvements in
           the youths' primary outcomes (positive symptoms) and secondary outcomes (time to
           remission and psychosocial functioning) over 18 months. Thus, improvements in family
           functioning are hypothesized to mediate the relationship between treatment condition
           (FFT-CHR, EC) and changes in primary and secondary outcomes in the individual with CHR
           syndrome.

        4. CHR individuals with higher baseline risk of conversion are hypothesized to improve more
           on family communication over 6 months and primary and secondary outcomes over 18 months
           in FFT-CHR than in EC.

    <intervention_model_description>FFT-CHR assists families with (1) recognizing the youth's psychosis risk symptoms and warning signs of escalating risk, (2) understanding vulnerability to psychosis and interventions, and (3) operating effectively as a unit. The manual includes session instructions and handouts.
The Enhanced care (EC) condition has also been manualized and tested as a family educational treatment in CHR and bipolar youth. The 3 weekly sessions involve an abridged form of FFT-CHR psychoeducation. Then the youth has monthly individual sessions focused on applying the prevention plan and nondirective problem-solving of conflicts. The clinician serves as case manager.

    <description>Family-Focused Therapy (FFT) has been tested in randomized trials involving persons with bipolar disorder, depression, and clinical high-risk syndromes. FFT-CHR provides families with psychoeducation (sessions 1-6) about prodromal symptoms and the role of the family in helping maintain stability. Clients are supported in building coping skills and monitoring thoughts, perceptions, and mood. The family formulates a prevention action plan to prevent prodromal symptoms from escalating into full episodes. Communication training (sessions 7-13) teaches families to express positive and negative feelings, listen actively, make positive requests for change, and communicate clearly through role-playing and between-session practice. In problem solving (sessions 14-18) participants learn to break down problems into smaller ones, evaluate pros/cons, and choose solutions to implement.</description>

    <description>Enhanced care (EC) has been tested as a family educational treatment in CHR and bipolar youth. The first 3 sessions of EC involve the CHR person and family (parents, siblings) and cover the same content as the psychoeducational module of FFT in abridged form. The objective of these sessions is to develop a prevention action plan. Then, the CHR person is offered monthly individual sessions with the same clinician over the next 5 months, for a total of 8 sessions over 6 months. The individual sessions focus on applying the prevention action plan when symptoms emerge, and supportive, nondirective problem-solving regarding areas of conflict with family, with peers or in the educational or occupational arena. The clinician also serves as case manager.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria

          1. Participants must be able to understand and sign an informed consent (or assent for
             minors) document in English;

          2. Youth has at least one parent or legal guardian who participants sees often enough
             (minimum 4 hours/week) that family intervention is sensible, who is English-speaking,
             and who consents to study participation and treatment sessions; and

          3. Youth currently meets criteria for clinical high-risk (CHR) for psychosis, with
             attenuated positive symptoms that have begun or worsened in the past 12 months,
             genetic risk and deterioration, or brief intermittent psychotic symptoms. Eligible
             participants may meet DSM-5 criteria for any non-psychotic disorder (e.g. major
             depression, anxiety disorders, ADHD), as long as the disorder does not clearly account
             for the presence of psychosis risk symptoms.

        Exclusion Criteria

          1. Current or lifetime Axis 1 psychotic disorder by DSM-5 criteria

          2. Impaired intellectual functioning (IQ&lt;70)

          3. Unwilling or unable to taper individual therapy to monthly by start of treatment

          4. Past or current history of a clinically significant medical or central nervous system
             disorder that may contribute to CHR symptoms or confound assessment

          5. Severe substance or alcohol use disorder within the past 6 months, and/or substance
             use (including cannabis) is causally related to recent onset of CHR symptoms so as to
             confound prodromal diagnostic determination.

        If either an exclusionary medical condition or an incidental medical condition is
        suspected, the participant will be advised to consult with their physician or will be
        referred to a specialist. Eligibility for the trial will be reconsidered if the medical
        condition has been treated to remission and the subject still meets CHR criteria.
