  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study seeks to address two key questions related to sensory dysregulation in Tourette
      syndrome (TS) and obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD): 1) Is sensory dysregulation in OCD
      clinically distinct from that in TS? 2) To what extent does sensory dysregulation affect QOL
      in each of these disorders? Patients with TS, patients with OCD, and healthy controls will
      complete an online battery of validated questionnaires assessing sensory dysregulation,
      psychiatric symptoms, and quality of life.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tourette syndrome (TS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder affecting 1% of school-aged children,
      with one-third of patients suffering persistent tics into adulthood. Obsessive-compulsive
      disorder (OCD) is a common comorbidity with TS. Individuals with either TS or OCD frequently
      exhibit sensory dysregulation, manifesting as heightened awareness of internal and external
      stimuli. For patients with OCD, sensory dysregulation has been linked to obsessive-compulsive
      symptoms and is an important consideration in treatment strategies. Sensory dysregulation
      remains largely unexplored in TS, but preliminary data suggests it is dissociable from tics,
      linked with obsessive-compulsive symptoms, and associated with poorer quality of life (QOL).
      This study seeks to address two key questions related to sensory dysregulation in TS and OCD:
      1) Is sensory dysregulation in OCD clinically distinct from that in TS? 2) To what extent
      does sensory dysregulation affect QOL in each of these disorders? To do so, we will recruit
      patients with TS, patients with OCD, and healthy controls to complete an online battery of
      validated questionnaires assessing sensory dysregulation, psychiatric symptoms, and QOL.
      Addressing these knowledge gaps will enhance our understanding of bothersome sensory symptoms
      in TS and OCD, shed light on clinical overlap and/or distinctions between these commonly
      co-occurring psychiatric diagnoses, and clarify QOL impact and the potential need for more
      direct targeting of these symptoms.
