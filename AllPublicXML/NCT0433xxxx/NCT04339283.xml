  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hibiscus sabdariffa tea is commonly used all over the world by healthy individual but the tea
      is also employed by patients in the management of chronic diseases such as hypertension
      diabetes, high cholesterol, liver disease etc. Several studies in humans and animal have
      proved the efficacy of Hibiscus sabdariffa tea in lowering blood pressure, blood glucose
      level and serum total cholesterol. But no study exists on the effect of daily consumption of
      this tea on blood pressure, blood glucose, total cholesterol and other biochemical and
      hematological parameters in healthy humans. Hence this study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Several studies have been carried out on the effect of the water beverage of Hibiscus
      sabdariffa, most focus on hypertensive patients, diabetic patients and obese patient and some
      studies investigated the hypolipidemic a effect of the water beverage of Hibiscus sabdariffa
      as well as its effect on haematological parameters but mice were used for these studies.
      Little or no investigation has been done to assess the safety of daily consumption of this
      water beverage of hibiscus sabdariffa on humans.

      Hence, this study aims at investigating the safety in the daily consumption of Zobo in
      humans, monitoring lipid profile, blood pressure, blood glucose, body mass index and
      haematological parameters such as haematocrit, haemoglobin, total white blood cells and also
      hepatic indices.
