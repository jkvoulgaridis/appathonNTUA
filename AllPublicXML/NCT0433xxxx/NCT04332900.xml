  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a crossover study that will investigate the immediate effects of a proximal
      therapeutic approach and a distal one in pain intensity (and others secondary self-perception
      variable) and lower limb kinematics (hip adduction and internal hip rotation peak, rearfoor
      eversion peak) during functional taks (gait and step-down test) in people with patellofemoral
      ostheoartritis

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It will be enroled in this study 30 participants with patellofemoral ostheoartritis. These
      participants will be randomized under three conditions: 1) control condition (withou any
      therapeutic approach); 2) Intervention 1 and; 3) Intervention 2. In both conditions,
      Intervention 1 and Intervention 2, will be randomized the therapeutic approach that will be
      applied - proximal or distal. The proximal therapeutic approach will be an elastic hip strap
      that control the moviments of hip adduction and internal hip rotation. The distal therapeutic
      approach will be an insole that control the moviment of rearfoot eversion.In all these three
      randomized conditions the participants will performed the functional tasks gait and step-down
      test. The primary variable of this study is pain intensity and the secondy variables are
      related to self-perception and lower limb kinematics. For each functional task, three valid
      attempts will be collected.
