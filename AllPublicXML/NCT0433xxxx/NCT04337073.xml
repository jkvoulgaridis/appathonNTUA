  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      patients may appear serious perineal itching, after injection of dexamethasone sodium
      phosphate injection its incidence is about 25% ~ 100%, and the incidence of the discomfort in
      females was much higher than that of the maleTo investigate the effect of propofol
      pretreatment on perineal pruritus induced by dexamethasone sodium phosphate injection and
      explore the possible machanisms.

    <textblock>
      40 patients scheduled for selective surgery,aged 18-65years,ASA physical status I~II,BMI
      18~30kg/m2 were selected in this study.The patients were equally randomized into two groups:
      propofol (P) group and normal saline (N) group, 20 cases in each group. Before anesthesia
      induction, M group received intravenous injection of 0.3mg/kg propofol , while N group
      received corresponding intravenous normal saline of the same volume. After 1 min, both groups
      received intravenous injection of dexamethasone sodium phosphate injection of 10mg. The
      anesthesiologist assessed perineal irritation in both groups and recorded Ramsay scores,the
      number of cases, visual analogue scale(VAS) scores ,duration of itching and observed the
      occurrence of adverse reactions such as dizziness, hypotension and respiratory depression in
      the two groups.
