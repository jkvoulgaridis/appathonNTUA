  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Researchers are trying to find out more about the side effects of fremanezumab when treating
      patients with Cerebral Autosomal Dominant Arteriopathy with Subcortical Infarcts and
      Leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) for migraine headaches.

      Subjects will receive 4 to 20 weeks of placebo injections followed by 12 weeks of monthly
      administered fremanezumab by subcutaneous injection (225 mg split four weeks apart for 12
      weeks). Following completion of the 12 weeks of therapy, the participant will return to
      placebo for the washout period. Both the patient and the investigator will be blinded to the
      timing of transition to and from placebo and the transition to and from fremanezumab.
