  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of multiple doses of rifampin (a
      strong inducer of CYP3A4 and a moderate inducer of CYP2C9) on the pharmacokinetics of a
      single oral dose of erdafitinib in healthy adult participants.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy on the basis of physical examination, medical history, and vital signs (blood
             pressure, pulse, and body temperature) performed at screening

          -  Healthy on the basis of clinical laboratory tests performed at screening. If the
             results of the serum chemistry panel and hematology panel are outside the normal
             reference ranges, the participant may be included only if the investigator judges the
             abnormalities or deviations from normal to be not clinically significant. This
             determination must be recorded in the participant's source documents and initialed by
             the investigator. Participants must have phosphate within normal limits, and total
             bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate amino transferase (AST), and
             alkaline phosphatase (ALP) serum levels lower than or equal to the upper limit of
             normal at screening

          -  Willing and able to adhere to the prohibitions and restrictions specified in this
             protocol

          -  Must agree to have a pharmacogenomic blood sample (10 milliliter [mL]) collected at
             screening to allow for pharmacogenomic analysis

          -  Non-smoker for at least 6 months before first study drug administration

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History or current evidence of ophthalmic disorder, such as central serous retinopathy
             (CSR) or retinal vein occlusion, active wet age-related macular degeneration, diabetic
             retinopathy with macular edema, uncontrolled glaucoma, corneal pathology such as
             keratitis, keratoconjunctivitis, keratopathy, corneal abrasion, inflammation, or
             ulceration

          -  Use of soft contact lenses, unless disposable on daily basis

          -  Use of any prescription or nonprescription medication (including vitamins and herbal
             supplements), except for paracetamol (a maximum of 3 doses per day of 500 milligram
             [mg] paracetamol, and no more than 3 gram [g] per week), hormonal replacement therapy
             and cetirizine (in case of allergic reactions), within 14 days before the first dose
             of the study drug is scheduled until completion of the study

          -  Received an experimental drug or used an experimental medical device within 1 month or
             within a period less than 5 times the drug's half-life, whichever is longer, before
             the first dose of the study drug is scheduled

          -  Known allergies, hypersensitivity, or intolerance to erdafitinib or rifampin or any of
             the excipients of the formulations
