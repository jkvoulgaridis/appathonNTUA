  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Detrusor underactivity (DU) is a known disease of the muscles of the urinary bladder that
      defined as a weak contraction of the muscle resulting in a failure to achieve complete
      bladder emptying. Recently, DU as a cause of Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms in both men and
      women has been increasingly gaining attention. There is a major issue in differentiation of
      underactive bladder symptoms and other causes of lower urinary tract symptoms such as
      detrusor hyperactivity and impaired contractility (DHIC), hypersensitive bladder (HSB),
      detrusor overactivity (DO), bladder outlet obstruction (BOO) and Dysfunctional Voiding (DV).
      Urodynamics (UDS) is the standard diagnostic tool, it includes invasive recording of the
      pressure that is produced when the bladder muscle contracts via pressure sensors introduced
      in the urinary bladder through special types of urethral catheters. This study aims to
      determine the prevalence of DU along with its symptomatic and urodynamics (UDS)
      characteristics of DU in Jordanian population through a retrospective chart review.

    <description>Arabic version of the International Prostate Symptom Score was used to assess the prevalence and severity of the symptoms that are associated with detrusor underactivity. The questionnaire includes 8 questions, the 1st 7 questions are about the urinary symptoms (Incomplete emptying, urinary frequency, intermittency, urgency, weak urine stream, straining and nocturia) and the 8th is about Quality of Life due to Urinary Symptoms. Each question concerning urinary symptoms allows the patient to choose one out of six answers indicating increasing severity of the particular symptom. The answers are assigned points from 0 to 5. The total score can therefore range from 0 to 35 (asymptomatic to very symptomatic). The answers to the 8th question (quality of life) range from &quot;delighted&quot; to &quot;terrible&quot; or 0 to 6.</description>

    <measure>Urodynamics parameters</measure>
    <time_frame>Each test takes around 30-45 minutes, all urodymanics studies were performed during the study period</time_frame>
    <description>Urodynamics is a series of tests conducted in an outpatient setting that evaluates the function of the urinary bladder, including physiological parameters of how completely the bladder, sphincter and urethra are storing and releasing urine. These parameters are recorded by pressure sensors that are inserted into the bladder via special urinary catheters to measure the pressure that is generated during storing and releasing urine. The assessment of urodynamic variables is based on bladder capacity, presence of involuntary bladder muscle contractions, bladder volume at 1st sensation of bladder filling, bladder volumes at normal and strong desire for urination, detrusor pressure at maximum flow of urine during voiding, volume voided, and the post-void residual urine volume. All urodynamic testing was performed based on the International Continence Society standards.</description>

        The study has reviewed a retrospective chart for 334 patients underwent UDS at the
        Istishari Urology Center (IUC), Amman, Jordan from July 2016 to August 2019.

        The study has excluded 77 records of patients in the initial stage either due to missing
        data (4 cases) or exclusion criteria (73 cases), the final study population was considered
        to be 206 patients.
