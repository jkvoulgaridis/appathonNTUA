    <textblock>
      This is a prospective observational study using data from an existing, ongoing National
      Swedish registery (SWIBREG). This study is designed to assess the effectiveness of
      tofacitinib treatment on clinical disease activity parameters in patients with ulcerative
      colitis in Swedish clinical practice.

  <eligibility>
    <study_pop>
      <textblock>
        Patients with a confirmed diagnosis of ulcerative colitis, ≥18years of age, with confirmed
        active disease (biomarker or endoscopy) initiating tofacitinib as per the Swedish summary
        of product characteristics (SmPC)

    </study_pop>
    <sampling_method>Non-Probability Sample</sampling_method>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The assignment of the patient to tofacitinib is not decided in advance by the protocol
             but falls within clinical practice and the prescription of the medicine is done
             according to the SmPC and is clearly separated from the decision to include the
             patient in the study.

          -  The patient must sign the informed consent before enrollment in the study. The
             informed consent permits extraction of data from SWIBREG at baseline and during the
             duration of the study. For patients not registered in SWIBREG, they must complete all
             SWIBREG consents and registration at the time of treatment initiation. Evidence of a
             personally signed and dated informed consent document indicating that the patient (or
             a legally acceptable representative) has been informed of all pertinent aspects of the
             study.

          -  Patients, male or female, must be 18 years old or above.

          -  The patient must have active disease as confirmed by fecal calprotectin &gt;250 mg/kg or
             endoscopic assessment corresponding to a Mayo endoscopic subscore ≥2 not more than 2
             weeks prior onset to the initiation of tofacitinib treatment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The patient is enrolled in a clinical trial in which the treatment of ulcerative
             colitis is dictated by a study protocol. If the patient is participating in another
             ongoing observational study (non-interventional), the patient may be included in this
             observational study.

          -  Patients that fulfill any of the contraindications according to the latest version of
             the SmPC. Any SmPC label updates will be communicated to all study sites.

          -  For whatever reason the physician feels the patient unsuitable to participate in the
             study.
