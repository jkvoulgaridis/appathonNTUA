  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to find out whether treating children and young people living with HIV with
      two anti HIV medicines, dolutegravir and lamivudine, is safe and as effective as the
      three-medicine anti-HIV treatments currently used in routine practice.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will include 370 children and young people aged 2 to less than 15 years old who
      are living with HIV and are being treated with anti-HIV medicines for the first time.
      Participants will be split into two groups, by chance, by a process called &quot;randomisation&quot;.
      One group will continue to receive the anti-HIV medicines already taken according to
      country-specific routine practice. The second group will change to the new combination of
      medicine, dolutegravir and lamivudine (with the combination written usually as &quot;DTG/3TC&quot;).
      Depending on the weight, participants in the second group will be able take the new medicine
      either as one tablet a day or as a small number of dispersible tablets that are also taken
      once a day. All children and young people in the study will have regular clinic assessments
      that are at a similar frequency to the clinic visits that participants would have outside of
      the study. Blood tests will be performed to check that the medicine is safe and, at some
      visits, participants and their carers will also be asked to answer some questions on how they
      feel about taking their medicine. All children and young people will be followed until the
      last participant who joins the study has been in the study for 96 weeks.
