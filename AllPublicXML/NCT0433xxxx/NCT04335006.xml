  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized, open-label phase 3 study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of
      Carelizumab (an engineered anti-programmed death-ligand 1 [PD-1] antibody) in combination
      with Nab-paclitaxel and Apatinib, carelizumab plus nab-paclitaxel, and Nab-paclitaxel in
      Patients with Unresectable Locally Advanced or Metastatic Triple Negative Breast Cancer.
      Participants will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to Arm A (Carelizumab + Nab-paclitaxel +
      Apatinib), Arm B (Carelizumab + Nab-paclitaxel), or Arm C (Nab-paclitaxel).
