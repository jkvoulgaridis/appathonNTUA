  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to model longitudinal data at NICU of Assuit University Children
      Hospital to create predictive growth charts for weight in preterm infants from birth till
      discharge, that take into account the differing growth rates post-birth when compared to
      in-utero growth ,and to compare it with WHO chart for preterms.

      It is an observational retrospective study achieved by collecting retrospective, longitudinal
      measurements of weight from preterm infants born at &lt;34 weeks gestation, starting from birth,
      and model gender- and gestation specific predictive centile charts till discharge from the
      neonatal unit by a population-based cohort study.
