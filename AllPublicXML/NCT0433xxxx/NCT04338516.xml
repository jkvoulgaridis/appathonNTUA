  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized, parallel design, controlled study will assess the histologic healing of this
      Ossix™ Bone in humans and compare it to a Bio-Oss® Collagen that is well researched.

      Subjects will be enrolled into 2 groups. Each subject will provide a single non-molar tooth
      site for study treatment. The tooth will be extracted, the extraction socket will be filled
      with one of the study bone grafts. No wound dressing or membrane will be used to cover the
      bone graft material as both materials can be used alone. An core biopsy will be collected
      after 16 weeks of healing during the implant placement.

      The study will evaluate if there is a difference in histologic wound healing following tooth
      extraction and ridge preservation between groups treated with Bio-Oss® Collagen compared to
      Ossix™ Bone.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  One tooth, excluding molars, that has been identified by dental faculty as requiring a
             single tooth extraction

               -  A dental implant is indicated and treatment planned to replace the missing tooth

               -  Have adequate restorative space for a dental implant-retained restoration

               -  Have at least 10mm of alveolar bone height, without impinging on the maxillary
                  sinus or inferior alveolar canal.

               -  Have a dehiscence of the buccal or lingual bony plate of the tooth socket
                  extending no more than 50% of the total depth of the socket.

               -  Female patients who have undergone a hysterectomy, tubal ligation, or menopause,
                  and non-pregnant women of child-bearing potential.

               -  Are nonsmokers or former smokers. Current smokers may be included if they smoke
                  &lt;10 cigarettes per day

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Will not cooperate with the follow-up schedule. Patients will not be entered who are
             mentally incompetent, prisoners, or pregnant.

               -  Pregnant women or women intending to become pregnant during the study period (as
                  confirmed verbally; an over the counter pregnancy test will be provided if
                  pregnancy status is unknown or suspected).

               -  Patients who become pregnant during the study will be withdrawn and standard care
                  will be delivered.

               -  Smokers who smoke &gt;10 cigarettes per day

               -  Clinical and/or radiographic determinations which will preclude inclusion in this
                  study are: Active infection other than periodontitis; Inadequate bone dimensions
                  or restorative space for a dental implant; Presence of a disease entity,
                  condition or therapeutic regimen which decreases probability of soft tissue and
                  bony healing, e.g., poorly controlled diabetes, chemotherapeutic and
                  immunosuppressive agents, autoimmune diseases, history of bisphosphonate use or
                  long-term steroid therapy; Positive medical history of endocarditis following
                  oral or dental surgery.
