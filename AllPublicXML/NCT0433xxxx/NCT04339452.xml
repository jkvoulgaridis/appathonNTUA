  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study introduces a novel approach to coronary revascularization through the use
      of a short term minimally-invasive LVAD to minimize myocardial injury and eliminate low
      output state during the perioperative period

    <description>Subjects will undergo insertion of an axillary or ascending aortic Impella 5.0 Device, followed by Impella supported OPCABG using a sternotomy approach with shunting of the coronary arteries to achieve myocardial protection.</description>

        Patients fitting inclusion criteria will undergo Impella supported OPCABG using coronary
        shunts. Inclusion criteria will target patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy, similarly
        defined to the STICH trial which evaluated coronary revascularization in the setting of
        heart failure (defined by an EF≤35%). Patients would be considered for enrollment in the
        setting of symptomatic severe multi-vessel coronary artery disease with target vessels that
        are amenable to bypass (as determined by the operating surgeon).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age ≥ 18 years old

          -  Ejection fraction ≤ 35%

          -  Symptomatic three vessel Coronary Artery Disease with target vessels that are amenable
             to bypass (as determined by the operating surgeon)

          -  Adequate Distal target caliber (as determined by the PI)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Exclusion criteria will include the existing contraindications to either Impella
             therapy or OPCABG revascularization:

               -  Patients with structural heart disease requiring CPB

               -  Patients with cardiogenic shock who require a period of short-term MCS

               -  Patients with mechanical aortic valve

               -  Patients with previous median sternotomy

               -  Patients with evidence of non-viability on preoperative cardiac MRI or CT scan

               -  Insufficient conduit

               -  BMI over 50
