      Background:

      Age-related macular degeneration is a common eye disease in people over 50. The &quot;dry&quot; form of
      the disease can worsen into geographic atrophy, causing blind spots. Researchers want to
      learn if replacing older eye cells with younger ones can help treat this disease.

      Objective:

      To test the safety of putting cells inside the eye as a possible future treatment for dry
      age-related macular degeneration.

      Eligibility:

      People ages 55 and older who have geographic atrophy with loss of vision. People who have had
      &quot;wet&quot; macular degeneration in either eye are NOT eligible.

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with:

        -  Medical history

        -  Physical exam

        -  Blood and urine tests

        -  Eye exam

        -  Eye photos

        -  Fluorescein angiography. An intravenous (IV) line is placed in an arm vein. A dye is
           injected. A camera takes pictures of the dye as it flows through the eyes' blood
           vessels.

        -  Electroretinography. An electrode is taped to participants' forehead. They sit in the
           dark. After 30 minutes, numbing eye drops and contact lenses are placed in their eyes.
           They watch flashing lights.

        -  Tuberculosis test

        -  Chest X-ray

        -  Electrocardiography. Sticky pads are placed on participants' chest to record the heart's
           electrical activity.

      Participants will have at least 14 study visits over 5 and a half years. They will repeat
      screening tests.

      Participants will have retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) transplantation surgery in one eye.
      For this, cells from participants' blood are turned into RPE cells. These cells are placed in
      their eye through a cut in their retina. They will get dilating eye drops, an IV line, and
      anesthesia that may make them sleep. A gas bubble will be put in their eye to help it heal.

      Participants will be contacted yearly for up to 15 years.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a leading cause of vision loss among the elderly.
      There is no treatment for geographic atrophy (GA), the advanced stage of dry AMD, in which
      cells of the neurosensory retina and associated retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) gradually
      degenerate and die. Advances in stem cell biology allowing differentiation of pluripotent
      cells into RPE in vitro make feasible a cell-based strategy for potential treatment of AMD,
      and recent methods for induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) generation offer promise of
      individualized autologous] therapy. Such an approach involves generation of iPSC from somatic
      cells taken from a patient with GA, differentiation of iPSC into RPE grown as a monolayer on
      a thin scaffold in vitro, and transplantation of the RPE/scaffold construct into a small
      region in the subretinal space of the same patient, with a goal of rescuing the overlying
      neurosensory retina from further degeneration.

      Objective: To evaluate the safety and feasibility of subretinal transplantation of
      iPSC-derived RPE, grown as a monolayer on a biodegradable poly lactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA)
      scaffold, as a potential autologous cell-based therapy for GA associated with AMD.

      Study Population: Five participants will undergo RPE transplantation in one eye. Eligible
      eyes will have GA, best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) between 20/100 and 20/500, and a
      fellow eye that has same or better BCVA. If the National Eye Institute (NEI) Data and Safety
      Monitoring Committee (DSMC) gives clearance to proceed based on review of data from the first
      cohort, a second cohort of up to seven additional participants with GA, BCVA between 20/80
      and 20/500 in the eye being considered for RPE transplantation, and same or better visual
      acuity in the other eye may undergo the procedure to gather additional safety and potential
      efficacy data useful for planning future studies. Up to 20 participants may be enrolled to
      allow for screening failures or for participants withdrawing from the study prior to RPE
      transplantation.

      Design: In this phase I/IIa, prospective, single-arm, single-center clinical trial,
      participants will undergo subretinal transplantation of autologous iPSC-derived RPE in one
      eye and will be followed for five years after surgery.

      Outcome Measures: The primary outcome measure is the safety of RPE/PLGA transplantation, as
      determined by assessment of visual acuity change and summary of adverse events at 12 months
      after RPE/PLGA transplantation. Secondary outcome measures include visual acuity change and
      adverse event reporting at 24 and 60 months, and changes in the following at 12, 24 and 60
      months as compared with baseline, assessed in the transplanted region, and compared where
      applicable with other areas in the macula, and/or with corresponding regions in the fellow
      eye: retinal sensitivity and fixation parameters assessed by microperimetry; multifocal
      electroretinography (ERG) responses; macular structure on cross-sectional and en face imaging
      by optical coherence tomography (OCT); macular features on color, single-wavelength
      reflectance, and fundus autofluorescence (FAF) photography; and fluorescein angiography (FA).
      Some participants may undergo imaging of photoreceptor/RPE features using
      adaptive-optics-assisted macular imaging under a separate protocol (e.g., 15-EI-0020).

                  patch or vaginal ring),

               -  Intrauterine device,

               -  Barrier methods (diaphragm, condom) with spermicide, or

               -  Surgical sterilization (tubal ligation).

          -  Participant must be medically able to comply with the study treatment (including

        Study Eye Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The study eye must have one or more regions of geographic atrophy with total area of 1
             disc area or more. A region of geographic atrophy is defined as an area of uniform
             hypofluorescence on fundus autofluorescence (FAF) imaging, with greatest linear
             dimension at least 500 micrometer , with a border within 500 micrometer of the foveal
             center, not compatible with pigmentary changes, drusen, RPE detachment, drusenoid RPE
             detachment, hemorrhage, or other lesion. (Note: If macular geographic atrophy is
             contiguous with peripapillary atrophy, complicating calculation of total area, only
             atrophy temporal to a vertical line placed a half disc diameter temporal to the
             temporal border of the disc will be included in the total area of geographic atrophy
             calculated for eligibility purposes.)

          -  For participants in the first cohort, the study eye must have an ETDRS best-corrected
             visual acuity (BCVA) letter score of less than or equal to 53 and greater than or
             equal to 14 (i.e., Snellen equivalent between 20/100 and 20/500), and the fellow eye
             must have a letter score no more than five letters worse than the study eye using
             Electronic Visual Acuity (EVA) testing. (Note: Letter scores within five or fewer
             letters of each other are accordingly considered equal for eligibility determination,
             and other factors may be used to select the study eye if both are eligible by BCVA.)

             visual acuity (BCVA) letter score of less than or equal to 58 and greater than or
             equal to 14 (i.e., Snellen equivalent between 20/80 and 20/500), and the fellow eye
             must have a letter score no more than five letters worse than the study eye using
             Electronic Visual Acuity (EVA) testing. (Note: Letter scores within five or fewer
             letters of each other are accordingly considered equal for eligibility determination,
             and other factors may be used to select the study eye if both are eligible by BCVA.)

          -  The compromise in visual acuity for the study eye must be judged predominantly
             secondary to dry AMD, in the judgment of the investigator.

          -  The study eye must have clarity of ocular media and degree of pupil dilation
             sufficient to permit adequate fundus photography and safe vitrectomy surgery.

             autosomal dominant retinal degeneration in a parent or child.

          -  Participant is taking, or has taken within the previous year, medication with known
             potential toxicity to the retina, optic nerve, or lens (such as chloroquine,

             (PDT) or macular thermal laser photocoagulation, or history of intravitreal injection
             of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) agents or corticosteroids (excepting
             medications used peri-operatively at prior cataract surgery).

          -  The study eye must not have an axial length &gt; 25.0 mm.

          -  The study eye must not have had any surgery in the previous 12 weeks, or laser

             in a study or fellow eye, if not secondary to steroid response, and if now resolved
             and not expected to recur (e.g., history of elevated intraocular pressure from
             retained visco-elastic after cataract surgery), is not exclusionary. History of
             glaucoma or ocular hypertension in the fellow eye, if not felt to significantly impact
             risk of glaucoma in the study eye, is not exclusionary.)

          -  The study eye must not have a condition materially increasing the risks of surgery or
             potentially affecting visual function over the next two years in the judgment of the

             pathologic myopia, etc. A history of such conditions is not exclusionary, if judged to
             not materially increase risks of surgery or to potentially affect vision in the next
             two years in the opinion of the investigator.
