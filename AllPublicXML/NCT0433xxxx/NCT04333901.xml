  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background : Long-term home non-invasive ventilation (NIV) can be proposed as treatment for
      acute respiratory failure with severe alveolar hypoventilation. The aim of NIV is to correct
      both daytime and night-time hypoventilation and associated symptoms and to provide the
      patient with adequate night-time oxygen saturation. The benefits of long-term NIV in the
      management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients in a stable state remain
      controversial. This highlights the importance of identifying the predictive factors for good
      compliance to the NIV, defined as a use of more than 4 hours per day.

      Aim of the study: The main objective is this observational study is to monitor the home NIV
      compliance over a period of 1 year under real conditions of treatment in patients with COPD
      newly initiated onto NIV (with telemonitoring or not) in order to specify the predictive
      criteria for good compliance. The secondary objectives are to assess the evolution of
      functional respiratory data, NIV parameters and changes in prescription, occurrence of acute
      exacerbations of COPD, hospitalizations and death, patient outcomes (quality of life and
      acceptability of NIV).

      Study design: a cohort of 120 patients with COPD newly initiated onto home-NIV (with
      telemonitoring or not), either in a stable state or following an acute exacerbation will be
      enrolled in the study and follow-up over 1 year. Data will be collected by lung specialists
      and home health care provider teams at 1-month post-initiation of NIV, 6 months and 1 year.
      The study is conduct in France.
