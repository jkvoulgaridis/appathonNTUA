  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label expanded access program for boys, 3 to 12 years old, for the treatment
      of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) with confirmed mutation(s) in the dystrophin gene that
      is amenable to skipping of exon 53.

    <textblock>
      This expanded access program is designed to provide access to viltolarsen in patients with
      DMD with confirmed mutation(s) in the dystrophin gene amenable to skipping of exon 53, who in
      the opinion and clinical judgement of the treating physician, would benefit from treatment
      with viltolarsen.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male ≥ 3 and ≤ 12 years of age

          -  Clinical signs compatible with DMD

          -  Confirmed DMD mutation(s) in the dystrophin gene that is amenable to skipping of exon
             53 to restore the dystrophin messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) reading frame

          -  Able to walk independently without assistive device

          -  Not able to participate in a Phase 3 trial

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Chronic systemic fungal or viral infections

          -  An acute illness within 4 weeks prior to the first dose of viltolarsen

          -  Symptomatic cardiomyopathy

          -  Patient has a previous or ongoing medical condition, medical history, physical
             findings, or laboratory abnormality that could affect participant safety in the
             opinion of the treating physician

          -  Surgery within the 3 months prior to the first anticipated administration of
             viltolarsen and in the opinion of the treating physician would impact weekly treatment
             schedule

          -  Positive test results for hepatitis B antigen, hepatitis C antibody, or human
             immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody at screening

          -  Currently taking any other investigational drug or has taken any other investigational
             drug within 3 months prior to the first dose of viltolarsen

          -  Previously enrollment in any viltolarsen study.

          -  Currently taking any other exon skipping agent or has taken any other exon skipping
             agent within 2 weeks prior to the first dose of viltolarsen (would need to be
             discontinued in order to be eligible)

          -  Any gene therapy for DMD

          -  Inadequate renal function as defined by a serum cystatin C &gt; 1.5 x upper limit of
             normal (ULN). If the value is &gt; 1.5 x ULN then the measurement can be repeated once.
             If repeat measurement is still &gt; 1.5 x ULN then the patient should be excluded.
