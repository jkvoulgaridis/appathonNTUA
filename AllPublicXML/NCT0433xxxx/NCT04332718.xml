      Study outcomes

      Primary:

      Detection of one or more episodes of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter ≥30 seconds as
      assessed at the 30 day follow-up.

      Secondary:

        1. Proportion of patients prescribed oral anticoagulation, as assess at the 30-day follow
           up.

        2. Patient adherence with 30-day smartphone ECG monitoring, and percentage of patients
           using the monitor &gt;75% of the target in 30-day period

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  i. Age 55 years or older. ii. Diagnosis of the index event made by neurologist or
             general physician of an acute ischemic stroke or TIA (WHO definition) of undetermined
             etiology occurring within the previous 6 months (180 days). The event must be either:

               1. An ischemic stroke confirmed by neuroimaging; or

               2. A transient ischemic attack, defined as involving a focal unilateral motor
                  deficit, speech/language deficit or hemianopia, with symptom duration &lt;24 hours
                  (note: amaurosis fugax/ transient monocular blindness, pure sensory spells,
                  isolated vertigo spells, etc. do not qualify for enrolment given the potential
                  for misdiagnosis of such events).

        iii. Patient meets the following:

          1. At least one 12-lead ECG has already been obtained as part of the routine clinical
             post-stroke/TIA work up, and not ECGs have shown any episodes of AF or atrial flutter.

          2. A Holter monitor has already been obtained as part of the routine clinical
             post-stroke/TIA work-up, and does not show any episodes of AF or atrial flutter
             ≥30seconds.

        iv. The patient is being actively investigated for the etiology of the stroke/TIA event and
        additional cardiac monitor is desired to screen further for the possibility of AF or atrial
        flutter.

        v. The following diagnostic test have already been completed as part of clinical routine
        post-stroke/TIA:

          1. Brain imaging with CT or MRI

          2. Vascular imaging of the extracranial and intracranial circulation with either CT
             angiography or MRI angiography to exclude significant large vessel occlusion disease
             as the most likely mechanism for index ischemic event (carotid Doppler ultrasound is
             acceptable for those presenting with anterior circulation ischemic events).*

          3. Transthoracic (or transesophageal) echocardiography to exclude thrombus or other
             structural heart disease that in the opinion of the investigator is the most likely
             cause for the stroke/TIA events.* *(if a baseline investigation cannot be obtained
             clinically after the index event and prior to study enrolment, then it is acceptable
             for study purposes for investigations to be obtained after patient enrolment into the
             study but prior to the 90-day follow-up visit.) vi. Informed consent from the patient
             (or from a legally authorised representative if the patient is not competent, due to
             stroke-related cognitive impairment, aphasia, or anosognosia).

        vii. The patient is expected to survive at least 12 months.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  i. Any previously documented atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter (a remote history
             of transient AF during perioperative period is not exclusionary).

        ii. Exclusively retinal stroke or retinal TIA event. iii. A most responsible etiological
        diagnosis for the qualifying stroke/TIA event has already determined i.e. cervicocephalic
        artery dissection, venous sinus thrombosis, hypercoagulable states, or other known cause.

        iv. Planned carotid endarterectomy within 90 days. v. Any finding on echocardiography for
        which there is already an evidence-based indication for long-term anticoagulation (e.g.
        mechanical heart valve, thrombus, etc) vi. Inability to use the AliveCor smartphone ECG
        monitor upon enrolment into the study (if patient is randomised into interventional
        group).* vii. Participating in a clinical trial involving investigational medication. viii.
        Endocarditis. ix. Pregnancy.
