    <textblock>
      The purpose of this randomized controlled trial is to study the feasibility, adherence and
      effects of two exercise interventions on body weight, body composition, anthropometric and
      fasting blood measures, physical fitness, quality of life, and lifestyle habits in patients
      with severe mental illness.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Self-reported sedentary behavior</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>In hours per week. Using the Sedentary Behaviour Questionnaire. It asks about amount of time spent doing 11 sedentary behaviours of a usual weekday and weekend day. Time in hours of each behaviour were summed separately for weekdays and weekend days, and time for an average day was calculated as (weekday hours ×5 +weekend day hours × 2)/7. Higher values represent a higher level of sedentary behavior.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Self-reported physical activity</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>In metabolic equivalent minutes per week. Using the Simple Physical Activity Questionnaire. Higher values represent a higher level of physical activity.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Behavioral Regulation in Exercise</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Using the Behavioral Regulation in Exercise Questionnaire. It consists of 24 items1 with a five-point Likert scale, which varied between 1 (&quot;Strongly Disagree&quot;) and 4 (&quot;Strongly Agree&quot;). The items were grouped posteriorly into six factors (with four items each). Higher values represent a higher level of motivational continuum of self-determination theory.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Adherence</measure>

    <measure>Health status</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Using the Short Form 36-Item Health Survey questionnaire version 2. Examines eight domains of physical (physical functioning, physical role, body pain, and general health) and mental health status (vitality, social functioning, emotional role, and mental health). The four physical-domains are summarized into a physical component score, and the four mental-domains constitute a mental component score. Scores range from 0 to 100 points, with higher scores indicating better health status.</description>
