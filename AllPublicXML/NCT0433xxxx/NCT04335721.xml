      This study is a single center, prospective exploratory pilot study of Sickle Cell Anemia
      (SCA) participants. The study will enroll patients with early stages of sickle cell
      nephropathy (Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) stage 1 or 2) who are at the highest risk of CKD
      progression (presence of both hemoglobinuria and urine albumin concentration ≥ 30 mg/g
      creatinin

        Inclusion Criteria

          1. Documentation of SCA genotype (HbSS or HbSβ0-thalassemia) may be based on history of
             laboratory testing or must be confirmed by laboratory testing during screening

          2. Participants have had urine dipstick defined hemoglobinuria (positive for blood (+1 or
             higher) and ≤ 2 red blood cells per high power field) on 2 prior outpatient visits

          3. Participants with albuminuria (urine albumin ≥ 30 mg/g creatinine) and an eGFR ≥ 60
             mL/min/1.73m2 calculated using the CKD-EPI equation on 2 prior outpatient visits

          4. Age ≥18 years

          5. Hemoglobin (Hb) ≥ 5.5 and ≤ 10.0 g/dL during screening

          6. For participants taking hydroxyurea (HU), the dose of HU (mg/kg) must be stable for at
             least 90 days prior to signing the ICF and with no anticipated need for dose
             adjustments or initiation during the study, in the opinion of the Investigator

          7. Endari stable dose for one month.

          8. For participants taking an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitor or
             angiotensin receptor blocker, the dose must be stable for at least 90 days prior to
             signing the ICF and with no anticipated need for dose adjustments or initiation during
             the study, in the opinion of the Investigator

          9. Participants, who if female and of child bearing potential, are using highly effective
             methods of contraception from study start to 30 days after the last dose of study
             drug, and who if male are willing to use barrier methods of contraception, from study
             start to 30 days after the last dose of study drug

             screening period

          3. Hospitalized for sickle cell crisis or other vaso-occlusive event within 14 days prior

             infection which require therapy:

               -  Participants with acute bacterial infection requiring antibiotic use should delay
                  screening/enrollment until the course of antibiotic therapy has been completed

                  immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive

          6. Severe renal dysfunction (estimated glomerular filtration rate at the Screening visit;
             calculated by the central laboratory) &lt; 60mL/min/1.732, on chronic dialysis, or have
             received a kidney transplantation

          7. History of malignancy within the past 2 years prior to treatment Day 1 requiring
             chemotherapy and/or radiation (with the exception of local therapy for non-melanoma
             skin malignancy)

          8. History of unstable or deteriorating cardiac or pulmonary disease within 6 months
             prior to consent including but not limited to the following:

               -  Unstable angina pectoris or myocardial infarction or elective coronary
                  intervention

               -  Congestive heart failure requiring hospitalization

               -  Uncontrolled clinically significant arrhythmias

          9. Any condition affecting drug absorption, such as major surgery involving the stomach
             or small intestine (prior cholecystectomy is acceptable)

         10. Participated in another clinical trial of an investigational agent (or medical device)
             within 30 days or 5 half-lives of date of informed consent, whichever is longer, or is
             currently participating in another trial of an investigational agent (or medical
             device)

         11. Inadequate venous access as determined by the investigator/site staff

         12. Medical, psychological, or behavioral conditions, which, in the opinion of the
             Investigator, may preclude safe participation, confound study interpretation,
             interfere with compliance, or preclude informed consent

         13. Receipt of erythropoietin or other hematopoietic growth factors within 28 days of
             signing ICF or anticipated need for such agents during the study
