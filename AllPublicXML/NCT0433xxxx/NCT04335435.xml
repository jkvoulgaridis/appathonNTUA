      Avenanthramides and saponins are types of chemical compounds found naturally in oats.

      Avenanthramides have anti-oxidant properties, anti-atherosclerotic, anti-inflammation, and
      anti-proliferative effects on cancer cells in vitro. Oat saponins, or avenacosides, have the
      ability to bind cholesterol, and thus, the ability to lower blood cholesterol.

      Oat bran is a known source of these dietary compounds. This study aims to determine the
      bioavailability of these compounds to in the urine of participants after ingesting an oat
      bran cereal, both before, and after for multiple time points.

      Analytical chemistry will be used to determine the bioavailability of the oat compounds at
      each time point. This will help to establish a kinetic curve for the metabolism of these
      compounds.

      Initially, the diet of the participants will be asked to restricted to avoid eating any
      polyphenols that might interfere with the employed analytical chemistry techniques. This
      period of diet restriction is the washout period. The list of foods to avoid are: oats, whole
      grains, fruits, vegetables, herbal supplements, ginger, coffee, tea, and chocolate.

      After the washout period, a baseline urine and fecal sample will be collected from the
      participants, then a large portion of oat bran will be provided to the participants for
      consumption. The approximate portion size will be 100 g by dry weight. The participants will
      then provide urine samples during the designated time points. The time points for the urine
      collection are as follows:

        1. st sample, ~ 30 min to 1 hour prior to oat consumption

        2. nd sample: 0-2 hours after oat consumption

        3. rd sample: 2-4 hours after oat consumption

        4. th sample: 4-6 hours after oat consumption

        5. th sample: 6-9 hours after oat consumption

        6. th sample: 9-12 hours after oat consumption

        7. th sample: 12-24 hours after oat consumption

        8. th sample: 24-32 hours after oat consumption

        9. th sample: 48 hours after oat consumption These samples will be analyzed in using HPLC
           and LC/MS.
