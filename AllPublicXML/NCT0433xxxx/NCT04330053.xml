      Due to the aging of the earth's population in the coming years, strategies for preventing
      falls in the elderly are of increasing research interest. Injuries due to falls have a direct
      impact on the quality of life of the elderly and are associated with very high costs for the
      healthcare system. However, few organized fall prevention interventions have been implemented
      in Greece, unlike other EU countries. The systematic recording of falls, the information and
      education of older people about injury prevention and the participation of older people in
      organized fall coping strategies in Greece are almost non-existent. Group exercise programs
      have proven to be effective in reducing falls. The OTAGO exercise program has shown that it
      can effectively reduce the number of falls in the elderly by up to 54%. However, its
      widespread implementation by a government agency in Greece such as the Elderly Day Care
      Centers (EDCC) has not yet been possible.

      Background: Falls in the elderly are a global health problem as they are associated with
      serious injuries and chronic disability. About 30% of seniors over 65 experience one or more
      falls each year. Any fall can lead to injury, a long period of immobilization, a decline in
      the functional level of the elderly, a negative psychological impact and often the elderly
      can even end up in death. The causes of the falls are multifactorial and are related both to
      the effects of aging on the human body and to environmental factors. Due to the aging of the
      earth's population in the coming years, strategies for preventing falls in the elderly are of
      increasing research interest. Injuries due to falls have a direct impact on the quality of
      life of the elderly and are associated with very high costs for the healthcare system.
      However, few organized fall prevention interventions have been implemented in Greece in
      contrast to other EU countries. The systematic recording of falls, the information and
      education of older people about injury prevention and the participation of older people in
      organized fall coping strategies in Greece are almost non-existent. Group exercise programs
      have proven to be effective in reducing falls. The combination of balance exercises and
      strengthening of the core and lower limbs seems to have a positive effect on the elderly in
      avoiding falls. The OTAGO exercise program has shown that it can effectively reduce the
      number of falls in the elderly by up to 54%. However, its widespread implementation by a
      state body has not yet been possible.

      Aim: The purpose of this study is to record the incidence of falls in older people, to inform
      and educate them on prevention and to study the effect of specialized therapeutic exercise in
      relation to the usual physiotherapeutic care in reducing the number of falls. Senior people
      will be selected from the Elderly Day Care Centers for this purpose.

      Methods / Design: About 150 elderly people over 65 are expected to participate in this study.
      Participants will be recruited from 20 Day Care Centers, which will be divided into two
      groups (intervention and control). All participants will be informed and trained in fall
      prevention through lectures at the Day Care Center, as well as through the distribution of
      appropriate audiovisual material. Subsequently, the participants from the Day Care Center
      that belong to the intervention group will follow a 6-month OTAGO group exercise program,
      where seniors will perform exercises three times a week. The control group participants of
      the Day Care Center will follow the usual physiotherapeutic care. The history of falls, fear
      of falling, balance and functional ability of participants will be assessed before, during
      and after the intervention, and will be re-examined 12 months after the intervention.

      Expected results: The results of this research will give a first glimpse of the magnitude of
      the problem of falls in older people in Greece, as data will be collected on the number of
      episodes, the factors that cause them, the outcome of falls, etc. The effectiveness of
      targeted exercise programs and in particular of OTAGO in reducing the number of falls and
      improving the balance and functional capacity of older people in relation to the usual
      physiotherapeutic care provided by the Elderly Day Care Centers in Greece will also be
      explored.

    <intervention_model_description>An assessor-blind randomized control trial with a duration of six months and a 12-month follow up will be performed in 150 seniors with a history of a previous fall. The participants will be allocated into two groups of 75 persons each (one intervention group and one control group). The first group will receive consulting about home modification for home safety related to fall prevention and training on how to avoid a fall and how to act if a fall occurs. Additionally, the first group participants will follow a fall prevention exercise program based on the OTAGO exercise program. The second group (control group) will receive only the consulting and training part excluding the fall prevention exercise program.</intervention_model_description>

    <measure>Changes in CONFbal - GREEK score questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-treatment, Month 6, 18</time_frame>
    <description>The CONFbal questionnaire is a tool that assesses the self-esteem of an elderly person associated with the risk of falling. It consists of a 10-item scale, which are summed to give an index of balance confidence. The score ranges from 10 to 30. A higher score indicates lower balance confidence. Τhe questionnaire demonstrates excellent internal consistency and excellent test-retest reliability. The Greek version of the questionnaire CONFbal - GREEK (Billis, et al., 2011) will be used in this study.</description>

    <measure>Changes in Short Falls Efficacy Scale International (Short FES-I) score questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-treatment, Month 6, 18</time_frame>
    <description>Short FES-I is a measure of &quot;fear of falling&quot; or, more properly, &quot;concerns about falling&quot;, which are suitable for use in research and clinical practice. It is the short version of the Falls Efficacy Scale International (FES-I), comprised of seven questions and is more applicable in clinical practice. The score ranges from 7 to 28. A higher score indicates greater fear of falling. The Greek version of the questioner (Billis, et al., 2011) will be used in this study</description>

    <measure>Changes in 4-Stage Balance Scale test</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-treatment, Month 6, 18</time_frame>
    <description>The 4-Stage Balance Test is an assessment of static balance in four different and increasingly challenging positions - feet together, instep of foot advanced to toe of other foot, foot in front of other foot (tandem), and single leg stance (Lajoie &amp; Gallagher, 2004). The participant must stand in each position for ten seconds, while the examiner tracks time using a stopwatch. Time is calculated in seconds and the maximum duration is 40 seconds. A higher score indicates greater static balance ability of the participant. The test has good validity (Marques et al., 2017).</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in Timed Up and Go test</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-treatment, Month 6, 18</time_frame>
    <description>It is a simple test used to assess a person's mobility. It requires both static and dynamic balance and is a valid and reliable indicator of the functional ability of an individual (Podsiadlo &amp; Richardson). The participant starts in a seated position. They then stand up following the instructions of the therapist, walk three meters, turn around, walk back to the chair and sit down. The examiner tracks time using a stopwatch. Time is calculated in seconds. A higher score indicates lower functional ability of the participant.</description>

The exercise program will last for six months and will be based on the OTAGO exercise program, which includes five exercise groups: general warm-up, muscle strengthening exercises, balance exercises, range of motion and stretching exercises. The participants will be grouped into homogeneous groups of 8 to 12 people once a week at the EDCC, while seniors should repeat the exercises twice a week alone at home and also walk twice a week for at least half an hour.</description>
