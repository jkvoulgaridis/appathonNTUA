      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Basiliximab in
      combination with pegaspargase in the treatment of relapsed/refractory NK/T-cell lymphoma.

      The investigators previously found that CD25 was elevated in patients who were resistant to
      chemotherapy, and CD25 can mediate resistance, which can be reversed by targeting CD25
      therapy. Thus, the purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of
      Basiliximab in combination with pegaspargase in the treatment of relapsed/refractory
      NK/T-cell lymphoma.
