      Smartphone Impact Scale (SIS) was originally developed in English to determine the cognitive,
      affective, social, and behavioral impacts of smartphones in everyday life. The purpose of
      this study was to translate and cross-culturally adapt the SIS instrument into Turkish and
      investigate its psychometric properties.

      Smartphone Impact Scale (SIS) was originally developed in English to determine the cognitive,
      affective, social, and behavioral impacts of smartphones in everyday life. The purpose of
      this study was to translate and cross-culturally adapt the SIS instrument into Turkish and
      investigate its psychometric properties. Two hundred healthy young adults will include. For
      cross-cultural adaptation, two bi-lingual translators used the back-translation procedure.
      Within a 5-to-7-day period after the first assessment, the participants completed the Turkish
      version of SIS (SIS-T) to evaluate test-retest reliability. Cronbach's alpha (α) was used to
      assess internal consistency. The correlations with the Turkish version of the Smartphone
      Addiction Scale (SAS-T) and Turkish version of the Nottingham Health Profile (NHP-T) will
      determine to check the validity.

    <description>The Smartphone Impact Scale is a reliable and scale for evaluating cognitive, affective, social, and behavioral impacts of smartphones in everyday life. It assesses loss of control of smartphone use ,nomophobia, smartphone-mediated communication, emotion regulation through smartphone usage, smartphone support to romantic relationships, smartphone tasks support, and awareness of smartphone negative impact. A high score in the subscales shows a higher negative impact of smartphone on cognitive, affective, social, and behavioral aspects.</description>

    <measure>Smartphone Addiction Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (First assessment)</time_frame>
    <description>Smartphone Addiction Scale (SAS) is a self-reported scale developed by Kwon et al. based on internet addiction and the features of smartphones in 20135. The scale consisted of 33 items rated on a 6-point Likert-type scale from 1 to 6. A high total score in the scale, which has no cut-off score, shows a smartphone addiction risk. The Turkish version of SAS (SAS-T), which was previously reported as a reliable instrument, will use in the present study.</description>

    <measure>Nottingham Health Profile</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (First assessment)</time_frame>
    <description>Nottingham Health Profile is patient-completed questionnaire used to determine and quantify perceived health problems. Composed of 38 items divided into six domains: 1) sleep, 2) mobility, 3) energy, 4) pain, 5) emotional reactions, 6) social isolation. Total Score ranges from 0 (no perceived distress) to 100 (maximum perceived distress). The Turkish version of Nottingham Health Profile, which was previously reported as a reliable and valid instrument, will use in the present study.</description>
