  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      TQ05105 is a JAK2 inhibitors and can be used to treat JAK2 target-related diseases. The
      activation of the JAK/STAT pathway is related to abnormal proliferation, obstruction of
      apoptosis, and differentiation disorder of leukemia cells which is caused by genetic
      abnormalities and viral infection.
