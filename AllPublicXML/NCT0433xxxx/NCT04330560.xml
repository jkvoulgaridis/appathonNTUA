  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The intervention will involve a new system which comprises of a fitness tracker act as a
      medium to link to the healthcare system (i.e.: EATs) via a smartphone application. This is a
      new system comprising of a wrist-worn fitness tracker, smartphone application and
      internet/WiFi connectivity that link patients to healthcare professionals in a hospital
      setting.

      Primary Objective: To determine the exercise capacity among patients with coronary heart
      disease (CHD) that utilising an electronic activity tracker system (EATs) during the cardiac
      rehabilitation phase 2 (CRP2).

      Secondary Objectives: To assess the efficiency of EATs on patient's exercise adherence and
      identify the changes on the patient's cardiovascular risk factors, influence by the EATs
      utilisation.

      Primary Endpoint: The patient's exercise capacity.

      Secondary Endpoints: The patient's weekly exercise adherence; and cardiovascular risk factors
      include the serum lipid, blood pressure, body mass, body mass index (BMI), blood glucose
      level, and quality of life (QOL).

      Study Population: Patient with coronary heart disease

      Phase: 2

      Description of Sites/Facilities Enrolling Participants: Patient engagement with the cardiac
      rehabilitation phase 2 (CRP2) at the University Malaya Medical Centre (UMMC).

      Description of Study Intervention: This study is a quantitative study consisting of a pilot
      study (phase 1) and a randomised control trial (phase 2). The present study will be
      conducting a single-blinded, three-arm, parallel over 8-weeks study period during CRP2.
      Measurement will be collected at pre- and post-test (8 weeks).

      Study duration: 24 months

      Participant Duration: 8 weeks

    <description>Patient's weekly exercise adherence based on the UMfit applications' (apps) exercise history. The patient's exercise history is synchronised to our database and data can be assessed via UMFit portal. This is only applied for patient enrolling to the intervention group only. The exercise adherence in the control group will be assessed by using the weekly exercise log. The exercise adherence will be based on the individually prescription on their targeted frequency of the exercise, duration of the exercise and moderate exercise intensity (50-85% maximum heart rate) whether it is performed at the CR centre-based or home-based.</description>
