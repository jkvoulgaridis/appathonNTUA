    <textblock>
      High-risk type human papillomavirus (HPV) is the known etiological agent of cervical cancer.
      HPV testing and risk stratification by genotyping has been recognized as an effective
      cervical screening program. A chip for HPV DNA typing based on type-specific polymerase chain
      reaction (PCR), DR. HPV Genotyping IVD Kit (HPV-27) was developed for genotyping of 27 common
      HPV types including all high-risk types. We studied its agreement, sensitivity, and
      specificity compared to DNA sequencing as the gold standard.

      High-risk type human papillomavirus (HPV) is the known etiological agent of cervical cancer.
      HPV testing and risk stratification by genotyping has been recognized as an effective
      cervical screening program. HPV detection is also applied for triage of atypical squamous
      cells of undetermined significance and follow-up after treatment for cervical neoplasms. A
      chip for HPV DNA typing based on type-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR), DR. HPV
      Genotyping IVD Kit (HPV-27) was developed for genotyping of 27 common HPV types including all
      high-risk types. We studied its agreement, sensitivity, and specificity compared to DNA
      sequencing as the gold standard.

      One-thousand one-hundred and three (1103) subjects were enrolled between December 2012 and
      December 2013 from Linkou Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Mackay Memorial Hospital, Changhua
      Christian Hospital, and Cathay General Hospital.
