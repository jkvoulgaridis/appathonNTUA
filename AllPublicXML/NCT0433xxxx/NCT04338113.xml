  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this registry is to depict the myocardial tissue characteristics in patients
      with myocarditis by CMR and other cardiac imaging modalities and to assess the prognostic
      value of imaging-derived indices. Information will be collected prospectively in about 200
      patients with myocarditis in 5 sites. Subjects will be followed for up to 5 years.

      This is a prospective, multi-center, non-randomized, observational registry study of patients
      with myocarditis that undergo CMR examination. Information of other cardiac imagings and
      clinical outcomes are also prospectively collected in the database. This project will
      establish a prospective registry of 200 patients with myocarditis in 5 sites with follow-ups
      of up to 5 years.

      The aim of the project will be as following:

        1. To investigate myocardial tissue features and functional changes in patients with
           myocarditis.

        2. To identify CMR-derived indices that are associated with adverse clinical outcomes.

        3. To compare CMR with other alternative cardiac imaging modalities (i.e., echocardiography
           or SPECT) on prognostic prediction in patients with myocarditis.

        [Inclusion Criteria]:

          1. Definitive diagnosis of myocarditis — A definitive diagnosis of myocarditis is based
             upon identification of diagnostic findings on EMB, including histology (Dallas
             criteria) as well as immunohistochemical stains.

          2. Criteria for clinically suspected myocarditis - We adopted the 2013 European Society
             of Cardiology (ESC) position statement criteria for &quot;clinically suspected&quot;
             myocarditis, which require that a patient have at least one of the following clinical
             presentations of myocarditis and at least one diagnostic criteria; if the patient is
             asymptomatic at least two diagnostic criteria are required. A diagnosis of clinically
             suspected myocarditis also generally requires the absence of other clinical conditions
             that could explain the clinical findings such as cardiovascular disease (eg,
             angiographically significant CAD [coronary stenosis ≥50%], valve disease, or
             congenital heart disease), or an extra-cardiac condition (eg, hyperthyroidism). While
             it is possible to make a diagnosis of &quot;clinically suspected&quot; myocarditis in a patient
             with a concomitant condition such as CAD, clinical findings must be carefully reviewed
             to determine whether findings can be explained by a single disease process or whether
             the patient likely has at least two separate conditions. Clinical suspicion is higher
             with greater numbers of fulfilled criteria unrelated to other conditions .

               -  Clinical presentations:

                    -  Acute chest pain (pericarditis or pseudo-ischemic)

                    -  New-onset (days up to three months) or worsening of dyspnea at rest or
                       exercise, and/or fatigue, with or without left and/or right HF signs

                    -  Palpitation, and/or unexplained arrhythmia symptoms and/or syncope, and/or
                       aborted sudden cardiac death

                    -  Unexplained cardiogenic shock

               -  Diagnostic criteria:

                    -  ECG/Holter stress test features - New 12-lead ECG and/or Holter and/or
                       stress testing abnormalities with any of the following: first to third
                       degree atrioventricular (AV) block or bundle branch block, ST/T wave change
                       (ST elevation or T wave inversion), sinus arrest, ventricular tachycardia or
                       fibrillation, asystole, atrial fibrillation, significantly reduced R wave
                       height, intraventricular conduction delay (widened QRS complex), abnormal Q
                       waves, low voltage, frequent premature beats, or supraventricular
                       tachycardia.

                    -  Elevated troponin T or troponin I.

                    -  Functional and structural abnormalities on cardiac imaging (echocardiogram,
                       angiogram, or CMR) - New, otherwise unexplained abnormality of LV and/or RV
                       function (regional wall motion abnormality or global systolic or diastolic
                       dysfunction); such abnormality may occur with or without one or more of the
                       following: ventricular dilatation, increased ventricular wall thickness,
                       pericardial effusion or intracavitary thrombus.

                    -  Tissue characterization by CMR - Late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) and/or
                       findings consistent with edema in pattern suggestive of myocarditis. (See
                       'Cardiovascular magnetic resonance' below.)

               -  The following ancillary features support the clinical suspicion of myocarditis:

                    -  Fever ≥38.0 degrees C at presentation or during the preceding 30 days with
                       our without associated symptoms (eg, chills, headache, myalgias, malaise,
                       decreased appetite, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea).

                    -  Prior clinical suspected or definite myocarditis.

                    -  Exposure to toxic agents.

                    -  Extra-cardiac autoimmune disease.

        [Exclusion Criteria]:

          1. Patient who is unable to comply with the follow-up schedule.

          2. Patient who has any medical conditions that in the opinion of the investigators will
             not be appropriate to participate in the study.

          3. Patient has a life expectancy of less than 6 months due to any condition.
