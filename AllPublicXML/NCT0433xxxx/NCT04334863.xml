  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this Phase I clinical study, the investigators plan to offer investigational treatment
      with the novel JAK2/STAT3 inhibitor WP1066 (Moleculin Biotech, Inc.) to pediatric patients
      with any progressive or recurrent malignant brain tumor that is refractory to standard
      treatment and is without known cure.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to find the highest tolerable dose of WP1066 that
      can be given to pediatric patients with recurrent (has returned after treatment) cancerous
      brain tumors or melanoma that has gotten worse and spread to the brain. The safety of this
      drug will also be studied.

      WP1066 is designed to target the STAT3 pathway in cancer cells, which makes these cells
      divide, increases new blood vessels to the tumor, causes the cancer cells to move throughout
      the body and brain, and avoids them being detected by the immune system. Targeting this
      pathway may cause the immune system to kill the cancer cells. The investigators will
      administer five escalating doses of WP1066, starting at lowest dose currently found to be
      safe and tolerable in adults.

      WP1066 is not FDA approved or commercially available. It is currently being used for research
      purposes only.

      Up to 36 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at Children's
      Healthcare of Atlanta (CHOA).

    <time_frame>28 Days post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of WP1066 in pediatric patients with recurrent or refractory and progressive malignant brain tumors for which there is no known treatment with clinical benefit.
Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined as the dose level at which 0/6 or 1/6 patients experience a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) with at least 2 patients experiencing DLT at the next higher dose level. DLT is defined as an adverse event or an abnormal laboratory value assessed as being at least possibly related to the investigational agent that occurs during the first 28 days after administration of the first dose of WP1066.</description>

    <measure>Change in safety and tolerability of WP1066: Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and Dose limiting toxicities (DLT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 months after the last study drug dose</time_frame>
    <description>The trial will investigate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and record the dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) at least possibly related to the investigational drug, as well as all toxicities related or unrelated that occur. MTD is defined as the dose level at which 0/6 or 1/6 subjects experience a DLT with at least 2 subjects experiencing DLT at the next higher dose level. A minimum of 6 subjects must be treated at the MTD. DLT is defined as a graded adverse event or abnormal lab value at least possibly related to the investigational drug that occurred within 28 days after the first dose of the drug was administered. All toxicities will be recorded and graded throughout the study.</description>

          -  The enzymatic metabolism profile of WP1066 is unknown. Patients who are receiving
             drugs that significantly interact with the CYP450 enzyme(s) are ineligible. However,
             if they are switched to other medications with a 2-week washout window, they will be
             eligible. Patients are also excluded if they have been exposed within 7 days of
             planned first study treatment day to medications that are predominantly CYP2D6, 2C9 or
             2C19 substrates, strong inhibitors or inducers, and sensitive substrates of CYP3A4
             with narrow therapeutic range.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.

          -  No single lesion can be larger than 5 cm in maximal diameter. There may not be
             clinically significant midline shift or hydrocephalus.

          -  The effects of WP1066 on the developing human fetus are unknown. Pregnant women are
             excluded from this study because WP1066 could potentially be teratogenic or have
             abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse
             events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with WP1066,
             breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with WP1066. Female
             subjects of childbearing potential should be willing to use 2 methods of birth control
             prior to study entry, during the study, and for 2 months after the last dose of the
             study drug or be surgically sterile. Subjects of childbearing potential are those who
             have not been surgically sterilized or have not been free from menses for &gt; 1 year.
             Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is
             participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately. Men
             treated or enrolled on this protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception
             prior to the study, for the duration of study participation, and 4 months after
             completion of WP1066 administration.

          -  HIV-positive patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible
             because of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with WP1066.

          -  The potential for further hemorrhaging with the use of WP1066 is unknown. It will be
             at the PIs discretion to enroll a patient who has a small, asymptomatic brain
             hemorrhage, but patients who have had symptomatic hemorrhages will be excluded.

          -  Patients requiring escalation of the corticosteroid dose will be excluded, but
             patients receiving a stable or decreasing dose for at least one week prior to
             registration will be eligible.

          -  The cardiac toxicities of WP1066 are unknown. Thus, patients who have a mean QTc
             interval &gt;450 ms at baseline will be excluded. Concomitant use of agents that prolong
             the QT interval will be avoided.

          -  Patients with uncontrolled seizures or seizure requiring escalation or addition of
             anti-epileptic drugs will be excluded.

          -  The use of medical cannabis and CBD oil is prohibited during the first 2 cycles of
             this protocol. Patients must be off cannabis oil for 3 days prior to enrollment.
