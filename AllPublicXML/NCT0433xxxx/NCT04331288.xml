  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical study is to assess pharmacokinetic interactions between ethanol
      (EtOH) and PT150 (900 mg qd) in non-treatment-seeking alcohol-experienced volunteers who are
      veterans.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study can be classified as a phase 1, single center, and drug-drug interaction (DDI)
      study. The within-subjects' experimental procedures will assess pharmacokinetic interactions
      between ethanol (EtOH) and PT150 (900 mg qd) in non-treatment-seeking alcohol-experienced
      volunteers who are veterans. The specific aim of this study is to evaluate the safety and
      tolerability of PT150 (a novel, selective Glucocorticoid receptor (GR) antagonist) in
      combination with alcohol and to determine the amount of PT150 and alcohol in blood (i.e., the
      pharmacokinetic (PK) interactions between alcohol and PT150) in 10 non-treatment seeking
      participants. The purpose of this study is to assess the possibility of any adverse
      interactions between alcohol and PT150. While PT150 might be effective in the treatment of
      AUD, because alcohol can affect the way that PT150 is metabolized in the body, we first need
      to determine 1) that it is safe to take PT150 in combination with alcohol, and 2) the amount
      of PT150 and alcohol in blood after PT150 has reached steady state. This study population
      will be drawn from adults of any race or ethnicity, males, and females who are
      post-menopausal, undergoing hormone replacement treatment at a stable dosage for at least 3
      months, infertile and not hormone cycling, or using approved non-hormonal contraception for
      at least two weeks after the last dose. Potential enrollees will be drawn of those NOT
      seeking treatment for alcohol use disorder (AUD). Statistical goals for the study are to
      evaluate the pharmacokinetics of PT150 given in combination with exposure to alcohol. The
      primary objective includes assessing if measures of concentration and timing of PT150 levels
      in the blood differ between the PT150 challenge (challenge on Day 8 and continually observed
      through Day 9) in combination with alcohol (ethanol beverage) compared to the steady-state
      PT150 challenge, absent alcohol challenge, on Day 7. Secondary objectives are to determine if
      measures of concentration and timing of BAL in the blood differ between the active alcohol
      challenges only (Day 1/baseline) and PT150 challenges in combination with alcohol challenges
      (Day 8). Other secondary outcomes include evaluating health and safety outcomes as well as
      withdrawal from alcohol. After completion of the screening period, the remaining study
      duration will proceed as follows for each participant: Admission for an initial 1-day
      in-patient stay; Discharge followed by 4 days of outpatient visits; Readmission for a 4-day
      inpatient stay; and for females, a follow-up visit will be scheduled to occur at least 14
      days after the final dose of PT150 is administered to ensure pregnancy has not occurred. This
      results in a total participant duration of 10 days.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        1) Be a veteran; 2) Provide signed and dated informed consent form; 3) Male or female, aged
        21-64; 4) Must score &lt; 10 on the revised clinical institute withdrawal assessment for

        acceptable limits noted in the protocol (Tests may be repeated if initial results are out
        of range); 6) Have normal vitals (heart rate 50-100 bpm, systolic blood pressure 90-140
        mmHg and diastolic blood pressure 60-90 mmHg) and a baseline ECG that demonstrates
        clinically normal sinus rhythm, clinically normal conduction, normal QTc, and no clinically
        significant arrhythmias; 7) Have a self-reported medical history and brief physical
        examination demonstrating no clinically significant contraindications for study
        participation, in the judgment of the admitting physician; 8) Must be willing to comply
        with all study procedures and be available for the duration of the study; 9) Women must
        either be unable to conceive (i.e., surgically sterilized, sterile, or post-menopausal) or
        using non-hormonal, medically acceptable contraception during the study and for at least 2
        weeks after study completion, with or without additional hormonal contraception. Women can
        be receiving hormone replacement treatment (HRT) as long as the HRT dose has been stable
        for a period of at least 3 months; 10) Women must provide a negative urine pregnancy test
        within 30 days of alcohol administration on Day 1/baseline (i.e. during the screening
        period) and a negative serum pregnancy test on day 1 prior to alcohol administration and on
        day 5. Note that because participants are supervised 24-hours a day when they reside as
        inpatients, a urine pregnancy test is planned on day 7; 11) Able to provide proof of age
        and identity (includes providing full name and date of birth). Listed below are acceptable
        documents, provided they include full name.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        positive for prescription or illegal substances. With regard to marijuana/THC, an
        individual must test negative at intake (Day 1/baseline). If an individual tests positive,
        they will be given a grace period where they will have the opportunity to return and test
        negative prior to being enrolled; 2) Be pregnant or nursing; 3) Be receiving HRT where
        their dose has not been stable for a minimum of 3 months; 4) To reduce variability in the
        magnitude of drug-drug interactions (DDIs), use of concomitant medications (except birth
        control pills) or OTC medications should be excluded for a sufficient time before subject
        enrollment (at least 14 days or 5 half-lives [whichever is longer]) and for the entire
        duration of the study. These items should be excluded for a longer time period if the DDI
        mechanism is induction or time-dependent inhibition. Concomitant medication use includes
        any prescription, over-the-counter medications or dietary/herbal/nutritional supplements;
        5) Be receiving any non-pharmacotherapy treatments or procedures for which there are
        precautions for taking concomitantly with PT150 and/or those that might interfere with the
        study; 6) Have neurological or psychiatric disorders other than AUD; 7) History of suicide
        attempts and/or current suicidal ideation/plan; 8) Have evidence of untreated or unstable
        medical illness including: cardiovascular, neuroendocrine, autoimmune, renal, hepatic, or
        active HIV+, AIDS infection; 9) Have a history of medically adverse reactions to alcohol
        (e.g., loss of consciousness (LOC), chest pain, or epileptic seizure) or major
        alcohol-related medical complications requiring hospitalization (i.e. hepatitis or
        pancreatitis); 10) Have contraindication(s) to take the study medications such as renal or
        hepatic impairment, congenital metabolic disorders, or hypersensitivity to study medication
        class (i.e., glucocorticoid antagonists); 11) Have past brain injury/head trauma with
        current symptoms (e.g. not photophobic, dizziness, etc.) or past report of LOC for &gt;30
        minutes and/or have been blast-exposed or had LOC of &gt;1 minute and current post-concussive
        symptoms; 12) Self-report more than thirty days' abstinence from alcohol during the three
        months prior to enrollment/consent; 13) Current signs of violence or aggression assessed as
        part of the consent process; 14) Participation in a pharmaceutical trial or exposure to
        investigational drugs within 1 month of the screening visit; 15) Be currently seeking
        treatment for AUD; 16) Have any other illness, condition, or use medications (psychotropic
        or antiretroviral), which in the opinion of the PI and/or the admitting physician would
        preclude safe and/or successful completion of the study; 17) A history of adrenal
        insufficiency or a baseline plasma cortisol level of ≤ 5mcg/dL; 18) A baseline cortisol of
        &gt; 5 mcg/dL BUT a post-ACTH stimulation cortisol of &lt;18 mcg/dL; 19) Have been treated with
        any form of corticosteroid in the past 30 days; 20) Have a history of endometrial
        hyperplasia, endometrial cancer, uterine polyps, or unexplained vaginal bleeding; 21) Have
        potassium levels below the normal reference range; 22) Men taking testosterone replacement
        therapy; 23) Men or women currently interested in fertility; 24) Have underlying
