      This is a Phase 2 randomized, double-blind, parallel group, vehicle-controlled study to
      evaluate the safety and efficacy of topical ATx201 OINTMENT in adolescents and adults with
      mild to moderate Atopic Dermatitis.

      Approximately 210 subjects will be randomly assigned to receive ATx201 OINTMENT 4%, ATx201
      OINTMENT 7%, or OINTMENT vehicle for 6 weeks. Treatments will be balanced into consecutive
      blocks in 1:1:1 ratio for the active groups and vehicle.

      Sixteen additional subjects (adults and adolescents) will be enrolled in a 2-week open label
      substudy of twice-daily ATx201 OINTMENT 7% to evaluate the PK profile of ATx201.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria (main ones):

          1. Diagnosis of AD using the Hanifin and Rajka criteria and minimum 1-year history with a
             current IGA score of 2 or 3 and treatable BSA ≥5% but ≤36% (treatable BSA includes all
             lesions present at screening except scalp)

          2. Age ≥12 and &lt;60 years

          3. Male or nonpregnant and nonlactating female who is abstinent or agrees to use
             effective contraceptive methods throughout the course of the study. Females must have
             a negative urine beta-human chorionic gonadotropin hormone (hCG) pregnancy test at Day
             1.

          4. Subject or LAR able to understand and provide signed informed consent. Assent is also
             required of adolescents.

          5. Normally active and otherwise in good health by medical history and physical
             examination

        Exclusion Criteria (main ones):

          1. Actively infected AD (ie, requiring antimicrobial therapy as determined by the
             investigator)

          2. Acute exacerbation or flare in the 4 weeks prior to the Day 1 visit that necessitates
             treatment with a high potency corticosteroid (such as clobetasol propionate or
             betamethasone dipropionate), or antibiotics, or prednisolone

          3. Enrollment in an ATx201 study in the previous 6 months

          4. Allergy or history of significant adverse reaction to ATx201 or related compounds, or
             to any of the excipients used

          5. Underlying skin condition that may interfere with the placement of study treatment or
             impede clinical evaluations (including active Herpes simplex)

          6. Current acute or chronic condition unless considered clinically irrelevant and stable
             by the investigator

          7. The presence of a condition the investigator believes would interfere with the ability
             to provide informed consent or assent, or comply with study instructions, or that
             might confound the interpretation of the study results or put the subject at undue
             risk

          8. Unable or unwilling to comply with study procedures

          9. Exposure to any IP within 30 days prior to randomization

        There are also some specific criteria related to prior or concomitant therapy
