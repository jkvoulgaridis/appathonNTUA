  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary Open Angle Glaucoma (POAG) is an eye disease that causes optic nerve damage, visual
      field defect, and blindness caused by increased intraocular pressure. In recent years, many
      studies have shown that ginkgo biloba extract has a protective effect on the visual function
      of glaucoma patients. Studies have shown that Ginkgo biloba capsules can improve the visual
      field damage of glaucoma controlled by intraocular pressure;Ginkgo biloba capsule can promote
      the recovery of visual evoked potential of glaucoma controlled by intraocular pressure; the
      improvement of visual field has a certain correlation with visual electrophysiological
      recovery. The mechanism may be achieved by suppressing the influx of calcium ions and thereby
      inhibiting the apoptosis of cells. Therefore, in this clinical study, effect of Ginkgo biloba
      capsule on visual function of primary open-angle glaucoma with blood stasis syndrome was
      evaluated by placebo as control.

      In this clinical study, the visual field, including MD, MS, LV, and vision score, are the
      main efficacy indicators. HRT and visual electrophysiological examination are the secondary
      efficacy indicators. Safety indicators based on laboratory tests and total frequency and
      incidence of adverse events. To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of Ginkgo biloba
      capsules for glaucoma patients with intraocular pressure control.
