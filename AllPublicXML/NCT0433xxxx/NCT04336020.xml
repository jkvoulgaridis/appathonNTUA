  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Develop an app-based nationwide study of individuals who routinely use a smartwatch or other
      wearable activity tracker to determine if individualized tracking of changes in heart rate,
      activity and sleep can provide an early indication of influenza-like illnesses (ILI) and
      possibly other viral infections.

      This study will be configured in CareEvolution's myDataHelps platform. This app-based
      platform will allow people to:

        -  Provide informed consent electronically

        -  Donate robust smartwatch and activity tracker data, as well as self-reported data.

        -  Sensor-collected data, which will vary between devices, but what is shared will always
           be entirely up to the participant. Investigators anticipate a minimum to include heart
           rate and activity, plus sleep duration when available.

             -  This can include historical data collected by a sensor prior to the participants
                date of joining the study.

        -  Occasional survey-based participant-reported outcomes (PROs).

        -  Participant-entered physiologic data such as oral temperature

        -  Passively share environmental data such as air quality and weather that will be captured
           from external sources based on participants' &quot;home&quot; zip code. Optionally, if the
           participant consents to enable location/GPS services on their smartphone, higher grain
           environmental data will be enabled.

        -  Optionally connect to and share their electronic health record (EHR) data in the event
           they have an event that requires interaction with a health care provider

    <measure>The primary objective of the study is to study the individual heart rate, activity and sleep data in identifying influenza-like illnesses (ILI) in that individual using the CareEvolution's myDataHelps app-based platform.</measure>
    <time_frame>Anticipated 2+-year duration of involvement in the study.</time_frame>
    <description>The study will enable tens- to hundreds-of-thousands of interested smartwatch and active tracker wearers (e.g., Fitbit, Apple Watch, Garmin, Amazefit, OURA, Beddit, etc.) to donate their routinely collected data for research through a user-friendly app-based research platform to determine if individualized tracking of changes in heart rate, activity and sleep can provide an early indication of influenza-like illnesses (ILI) and possibly other viral infections.
The study will capture timing, symptoms, and treatments of influenza-like illnesses (ILI) through on-app participant-reported outcome (PROs).
When possible, use electronic health records (EHR) , available through in-app linkage, to supplement PRO-collected information about ILI or similar episodes.
Data from optional devices (pulse ox, weight scales, BP cuffs, glucometers) may be integrated if the devices are connected and participant consents to share their data.</description>
