  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to compare the correlation between FGFR mutations found in bladder cancer
      tissues and urine to develop a companion diagnostic method for predicting the effect of FGFR
      inhibitors using urine samples of the patients with urothelial cancer.

    <textblock>
      This study targets 92 patients with urothelial cancer, whose tissue (from scheduled surgery)
      and urine samples can be obtained, regardless of the treatment stage.

      â–  Examination Methods

        -  FGFR mutations in bladder cancer tissues will be analyzed using next-generation
           sequencing and current companion diagnostic methods.

        -  FGFR mutations in urine samples obtained from patients with bladder cancer will be
           analyzed using nanowires.

        -  Bladder cancer subtyping will be performed by RNA sequencing of tumor tissues or other
           methods.

        -  Analysis of paired tissues before and after chemotherapy will be performed on
           transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TUR-BT) and cystectomy tissues before and
           after neoadjuvant chemotherapy.
