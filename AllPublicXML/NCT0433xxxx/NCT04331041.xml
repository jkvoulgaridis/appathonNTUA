  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with advanced pancreas adenocarcinoma will be treated with standard of care
      chemotherapy followed by stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) concurrent with the FAK
      inhibitor defactinib. Patients will be assessed for clinical outcomes such as progression
      free survival (PFS), local control, distant control, and toxicity. A safety lead-in of 6
      patients will be treated and assessed for DLT; if no DLTs are observed, 30 additional
      patients will be enrolled to phase II of the study.

      Hypothesis: defactinib given concurrently with SBRT will increase the PFS of advanced
      pancreas tumor primaries compared to historical rates of SBRT alone
