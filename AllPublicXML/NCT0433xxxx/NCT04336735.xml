  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vaccine preventable infections are a serious complication following pediatric solid organ
      transplant. Immunizations are a minimally invasive and cost-effective was to reduce these
      infections. Despite the importance of pre-transplant vaccination, the majority of pediatric
      solid organ transplant recipients are not up-to-date on age-appropriate immunizations at the
      time of transplant. The goal of this study is to pilot a novel health information technology
      immunization tool to improve immunization rates in pediatric solid organ transplant
      candidates.

      Triads of parents, primary care physicians, and transplant sub-specialists will be enrolled
      to use a pre-transplant immunization tool while their child awaits transplant. The tool will
      provide information about vaccines, information about vaccine-preventable infections in the
      transplant population, a central easily accessible vaccine record, and a communication
      portal. The tool will also send vaccine reminders when vaccinations are due. We will assess
      1) the effectiveness of the tool in improving pre-transplant immunization rates, 2) the
      acceptability of the tool to users and 3) the feasibility of the tool.
