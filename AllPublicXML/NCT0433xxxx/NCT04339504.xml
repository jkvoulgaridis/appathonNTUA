  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a follow-up study to investigate the long-term safety and explore efficacy of
      SMUP-IA-01, for the treatment of Knee Osteoarthritis. Subjects who participated in and
      completed the initial stage of the Phase I trial (NCT04037345 ) will be followed-up until 60
      months.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The subjects will be followed up at 6-month, 12-month, 24-month, 36-month, 48-month and
      60-month after the initial administration of SMUP-IA-01.

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in K&amp;L(Kellgren-Lawrence) grade</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 12 and 24 after treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The K &amp; L grade is 0 to 4 Grade, which means that the higher the grade, the greater the joint damage and the stenosis of the joint</description>

    <measure>Change in mechanical axis, anatomical axis</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 12 and 24 after treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The degree of deformation of the lower half of the body is measured by measuring the angles of the mechanical axis and the anatomical axis with respect to the vertical axis. Mechanical axis: A line connecting the femoral head center point and the ankle joint center point. Anatomical axis: The middiaphyseal line of the femur and tibia</description>
