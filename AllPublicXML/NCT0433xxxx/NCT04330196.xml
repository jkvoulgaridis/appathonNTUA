  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to assess the effect of the natural course of
      postprandial hypoglycemia vs. a postprandial euglycaemic condition on driving performance in
      individuals with confirmed postprandial hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia after gastric-bypass
      surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite the increasing prevalence of postprandial hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia (PHH),
      clinical implications are still unclear. Anecdotal evidence from patients with PHH suggest a
      high burden for these patients due to the recurrent hypoglycaemias with possibly debilitating
      consequences. It is well established, that even mild hypoglycaemia (plasma glucose of
      3.4mmol/l) in diabetic and non-diabetic significantly impairs cognitive-motor functioning. Of
      note, some of the cognitive aspects remain impaired for up to 75min, even when the
      hypoglycaemia is corrected. In addition to the hypoglycaemic blood glucose levels per se, the
      dynamics of the hypoglycaemia occurrence appears to play a role. It was shown in individuals
      with type 1 diabetes, that cognitive functions are affected more during a fast-fall than slow
      fall hypoglycaemia in the postprandial state.

      Driving is a frequent daily activity which integrates various mental function including
      visual and auditory processing, motor skills, reasoning and problem solving. Due to the
      potentially dangerous consequences, avoidance of hypoglycaemia-induced driving mishaps is of
      uttermost importance. Several studies have evaluated the impact of induced, controlled
      hypoglycaemia in individuals with type 1 diabetes on driving performance using driving
      simulators but data in PHH patients are currently lacking. Assessing the potential impact of
      the natural course of postprandial hypoglycaemia on driving performance in PHH patients will
      contribute to a better understanding of the consequences and relevance of this problem. The
      investigator hypothesize that driving performance is impaired during the fast fall in blood
      glucose and during hypoglycaemia in PHH patients.

    <description>To compute this score a subject's performance on each variable (e.g. standard deviation of speed) will be converted into a z score based on all subjects' performances on that variable during the three driving periods. The z scores for all variables will be then summed for each subject from each test drive, generating the IDS (33). The following variables will be primarily measured:
Steering: swerving, spinning, driving off road, driving across midline
Inappropriate braking, smoothness of braking, percentage of missed stops, percentage of collisions
Percentage below speed limits, percentage above speed limits</description>
