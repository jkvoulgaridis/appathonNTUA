  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) is the current standard procedure for men with
      prostate volume 30-80 gm. In case with large prostate adenoma (&gt;80 g), the resection time
      required by TURP is associated with increased risk of TUR syndrome, blood loss and other
      complications.

      Many types of minimally invasive surgery exist along with new equipment and techniques. Many
      types of laser devices such as greenlight laser, thulium laser and holmium laser, are used to
      enucleate the prostate. Increasing evidence has proven their safety and efficacy However, the
      use of laser devices is difficult and associated with steep learning curve and high medical
      expenses.

      PKEP is a safe and effective procedure for the treatment of bladder obstruction secondary to
      BPH. This procedure not only improves maximum flow rate at 3 and 12 months after surgery, but
      it also improves all other recorded parameters (IPSS, QOL, IEFF-5, PVR, PSA).

      A button electrode can be effectively used to enucleate the prostate because of its powerful
      vaporisation and strong coagulation (B-TUEP technique) ,such as that with a holmium laser,
      thulium laser and greenlight laser. However its associated with short term complication as
      early irritative symptoms, Bulai reported that 16.7% of the patients suffering from early
      irritative symptoms while Geavlete reported that 11.4% of patient suffering from early
      irritative symptoms.

      Aim: compare safety and efficacy and adverse events of endoscopic enucleation of large
      prostate using hot knife electrode (needloscopic enucleation) versus the standard
      vaporization electrode ( vapoenucleation) patients &amp; methods: Patients will randomly be
      divided into two equal groups: Group A: Patient will be subjected to bipolar endoscopic
      enucleation of the prostate by vaporization electrode (vapoenucleation).

      Group B: Patient will be subjected to endoscopic enucleation of the prostate by bipolar hot
      kife electrode (needloscopic enucleation) Inclusion criteria: patients with Qmax of less than
      15 mL/second due to BPH, severe LUTS/BPH requiring surgical treatment, and International
      Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS)&gt;7 due to BPH.

      exclusion criteria: prostate and/or bladder cancer, bladder diverticula, urethral stricture,
      active urinary tract infection (UTI), unless treated, and men with neurogenic voiding
      dysfunction.

      Operative Technique: Endoscopic enucleation of the prostate in saline utilizing either
      bipolar vaporization electrode or bipolar hot knife (collin's) electrode.

      follow up: operative time, resected tissue weight, cath time, hospital stay and change of;
      IPSS,QOL, Qmax, PVR, PSA, IIEF-5 &amp; MSHQ‐EjD besides; perioperative adverse events are
      recorded &amp; followed-up.
