  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pain is one of the most misunderstood, underdiagnosed, and untreated medical problems,
      particularly in children. New Joint Commission on Accreditation of Health Care Organization
      regards pain as fifth vital sign and requires caregivers to regularly assess pain. Inadequate
      pain relief during childhood may have long-term negative effects including harmful
      neuroendocrine responses disrupted eating and sleep cycles and increased pain perception
      during subsequent painful experiences. Also, postoperative pain can result in an
      uncooperative and restless child. Hence, it is preferable to prevent the onset of pain rather
      than to relieve its existence.

      Various multimodal techniques have been designed for pediatric pain relief. These include
      both systemic and regional analgesia. The most commonly used regional technique is caudal
      epidural block. Advantages of the caudal block are smoother recovery with less distress
      behavior, early ambulation, decreased the risk of chest infections, decreased postoperative
      analgesic requirements, and early discharge.

      In our culture; considerable number of parents still refuses caudal anesthesia fearing from
      the rare neurological sequelae may occur. This the motive for searching for parenteral
      surrogate gives clear headed recovery resembles regional analgesia.

      Dexmedetomidine is an alpha 2 agonist which has sedative, analgesic, and opioid-sparing
      effect. It prolongs the duration of analgesia by its local vasoconstrictive effect and by
      increasing the potassium conductance in A-delta and C-fibers.

      It also exerts its analgesic action centrally via systemic absorption or by diffusion into
      the cerebrospinal fluid and reaches alpha 2 receptors in the superficial laminae of the
      spinal cord and brainstem or indirectly activating spinal cholinergic neurons. The sedative
      effects of dexmedetomidine are mostly due to stimulation of the alpha 2 adrenoceptor in the
      locus coeruleus

    <description>On arrival to operating room, Noninvasive monitors, such as electrocardiography, noninvasive blood pressure (NIBP), oxygen saturation (SpO2), will be attached and baseline parameters such as heart rate, mean arterial pressure, and peripheral oxygen saturation will be recorded .
General anesthesia will be induced with O2/sevo (FiO2 = 1 /sevoflurane 8% MAC), cis-atracurium 0.1 mg/kg iv, +/- fentanyl 1 mcg/kg iv. Trachea will be intubated with an appropriate sized, endotracheal tube and maintenance of anesthesia by O2/Air (FiO2 = 0.4), sevoflurane 2% MAC.
Dexamethasone 0.15 mg/kg iv will be given as PONV prophylaxis. Increments of fentanyl 0.5 mcg/kg iv and cis-atracurium 0.03 mg/kg iv will be given according to hemodynamics and capnography.</description>
