  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) has shown good results in bones and soft tissues
      of the lower and upper extremities such as: pseudoarthrosis, promoting bone formation of
      delayed or nonunion fractures, tendinopathies, fascitis and even in vascular pathologies.

      The investigators main hypothesis is that the application of extracorporeal shock wave
      therapy (ESWT) in the residual alveolar bone after an extraction of an anterior upper
      maxillary tooth should prevent further residual alveolar bone resorption and will enhance
      vital bone formation.

      The investigators null hypothesis is that applying extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT)
      in the residual alveolar bone after an extraction of an anterior upper maxillary tooth has no
      influence in the alveolar bone remodeling process.

      Therefore, the investigators main objective is to evaluate the efficacy of the ESWT in the
      prevention of alveolar bone resorption after an extraction with a volumetric exam through
      computer tomographies (CT) analysis. The investigators secondary objective is to determine
      the effect of ESWT in the internal bone healing process of these postextraction alveolar
      sockets, measuring the bone density in the CT (Hounsfield units) and the histomorphometric
      exam.

      Methodology: randomized and open clinical trial with 20 patients (10 per group: with or
      without ESWT treatment) that comply the inclusion and exclusion criteria. In the first
      appointment the tooth extraction will be performed, while in the second visit (two weeks
      later), CT scan will be made to all patients and ESWT will be applied in the experimental
      group. Finally, in the third visit (ten weeks later), a new CT scan will be done and an
      implant will be placed in the zone taking previously a bone sample with a trephine bur.

      The expected results are an improvement in the quantity and quality of the alveolar bone
      before the implant placement.
