  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of stereotactic
      ablative radiotherapy (SAbR), also known as stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT), for
      treatment of ventricular tachycardia (VT) requiring implantable cardioverter defibrillator
      (ICD) treatments in patients with VT refractory to standard invasive ablation techniques. We
      hypothesized that SAbR is effective in suppressing sustained VT and reducing ICD treatments
      in this group of patients and is associated with acceptably low risk of serious
      complications.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age â‰¥ 18 years

          -  Have an ICD implanted &gt; 6 months and all VT episodes in the past 6 months are
             available in device memory.

          -  Within the past 3 months, the patient has at least one episode of symptomatic
             monomorphic VT that requires ICD treatment (anti-tachycardia pacing and/or ICD shock)
             or was sustained/incessant but falls under ICD treatment zone. These VT episodes must
             occur after at least one standard invasive VT ablation or occur in a patient that is
             clinically deemed not eligible to the standard VT ablation procedure.

          -  Two independent cardiac electrophysiologists reviewed the case and agreed that the
             patient would benefit from suppression of these VT episodes but there is no optimal
             invasive VT ablation or antiarrhythmic drug options.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Has contraindication to receive SAbR or VT clinically deemed not suitable for SAbR.

          -  Is pregnant

          -  Has severe co-morbid medical condition or terminal illness and is unlikely to survive
             more than 6 months regardless of VT status based on clinical judgement by treating or
             enrolling physicians.

          -  On potent immunosuppressive therapy (e.g., post organ transplant)

          -  Has severe collagen vascular disorder with organ involvement

          -  Not willing or not able to consent to participate in the study
