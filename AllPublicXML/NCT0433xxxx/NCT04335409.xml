      Major goals of radiotherapy include local disease control and improvement of the patients'
      prognoses. One possible side effect of radiotherapy of breast or lung cancer is radiation
      pneumonitis. Severe (grade ≥3) radiation pneumonitis can even be fatal in approximately 2% of
      the patients. Therefore, it would be very important to identify and treat pneumonitis at an
      earlier stage (grade 2).

      In the present study, the patients are asked to complete a questionnaire (paper version) once
      a week during the period of radiotherapy and up to 24 weeks following radiotherapy. In this
      questionnaire, the patients are asked to state and rate their symptoms potentially associated
      with pneumonitis. Scoring points are assigned to the severity of the symptoms (symptom
      scores), and the resulting sum score (patient score) will be used for identification of
      radiation pneumonitis.

      The main goal of this trial is to evaluate the usefulness of a new symptom-based scoring
      system with respect to the identification of patients developing pneumonitis after
      radiotherapy of breast or lung cancer. The discriminative power of the symptom-based scoring
      system will be assessed by calculating the area under the ROC curve (AUC). Taking into
      account that 5% of patients will not qualify for Full Analysis Set, a total of 78 patients
      should be recruited.

      If statistical significance of the AUC is reached, the most-informative (optimal) scoring
      point to identify radiation pneumonitis will be derived. Sensitivity analyses will be
      conducted to further investigate the performance of the symptom-based scoring system.

      In 10 patients (5 breast cancer and 5 lung cancer patients), the paper version of the
      symptom-based scoring system (questionnaire) will be supplemented by a mobile application
      (app) asking the same questions regarding symptoms potentially associated with radiation
      pneumonitis.

      Background Breast cancer and lung cancer belong to the most common types of solid cancer in
      Europe and Northern America. The majority of breast cancer patients receive adjuvant
      radiotherapy, either following breast-conserving surgery or mastectomy. And most patients
      with small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) receive radiotherapy in combination with chemotherapy as
      definitive treatment. Also, a considerable number of patients with advanced non-small-cell
      lung cancer (NSCLC) are treated with radiotherapy with or without concurrent chemotherapy,
      particularly if they are not candidates for surgery.

      Major goals of radiotherapy include local disease control and improvement of the patients'
      prognoses. One possible side effect of radiotherapy of breast or lung cancer is radiation
      pneumonitis. Severe (grade ≥3) radiation pneumonitis can even be fatal in approximately 2% of
      the patients. Therefore, it would be very important to identify and treat pneumonitis at an
      earlier stage (grade 2).

      According to a systematic review, the prevalence of symptomatic (grade ≥2) pneumonitis after
      radiotherapy of breast cancer ranges between 0.8% and 2.9%. In our own center, the prevalence
      of grade ≥2 pneumonitis in patients receiving radiotherapy for breast cancer between 2016 and
      2019 was 1.8%, i.e. in this range. Moreover, the prevalence of symptomatic (grade ≥2)
      pneumonitis in patients irradiated for lung cancer in our center between 2016 and 2019 was
      7.6%.

      Pneumonitis can occur up to 23 weeks following radiotherapy. Therefore, patients and their
      general practitioners may not associate symptoms of pneumonitis such as cough, shortness of
      breath and fever with the radiation treatment that took place several weeks ago. Thus,
      radiation pneumonitis can be missed at an early stage, and the patients are often treated
      with antibiotics for bronchitis or pneumonia. Treatment with antibiotics alone is not
      effective for radiation pneumonitis, which often becomes more severe before eventually
      diagnosed.

      In the present study, the patients are asked to complete a questionnaire (paper version) once
      a week during the period of radiotherapy and up to 24 weeks following radiotherapy. In this
      questionnaire, the patients are asked to state and rate their symptoms potentially associated
      with pneumonitis. Scoring points are assigned to the severity of the symptoms (symptom
      scores), and the resulting sum score (patient score) will be used for identification of
      radiation pneumonitis.

      Primary endpoint To assess the performance characteristics of the symptom-based scoring
      system for detection of radiation pneumonitis the receiver operating characteristic (ROC)
      curve is used to show the connection between sensitivity and specificity for every possible
      cut-off for the scoring system and to select the optimal scoring point for detection of
      radiation pneumonitis- The area under the ROC curve (AUC) is calculated to prove the
      diagnostic ability of the scoring system.

      General trial design and duration This is a single-center prospective study, which aims to
      assess the performance of a new symptom-based score and to identify its optimal scoring point
      with respect to the detection of patients developing pneumonitis following radiotherapy of
      breast cancer or lung cancer. The recruitment of all 78 patients (74 patients plus drop-outs)
      should be completed within 24 months. The treatment period will be 6-7 weeks, and the follow
      up period 24 weeks. This equals a total running time for the trial of approximately 31
      months.

      Symptom-Based Scoring System (Paper Version) The patients are asked to complete a paper-based
      questionnaire (symptom-based scoring system, paper version) once a week during the period of
      radiotherapy and up to 24 weeks following radiotherapy. The patients are asked to state and
      score their symptoms that are potentially associated with pneumonitis, namely cough,
      shortness of breath and fever. Scoring points are assigned to the severity of the symptoms (=
      symptom scores), and the resulting sum score (patient score) will be used to identify
      radiation pneumonitis.

      During the time of radiotherapy, the patients will complete the paper-based questionnaire
      directly prior to their appointment with a physician who will perform a physical examination
      once a week. Following radiotherapy, the patients will be contacted by phone once a week and
      asked to answer the questions of the questionnaire. In case of a score of 0-1 points, no
      further action is required. In case of a score of ≥2 points, patients will either receive a
      follow-up telephone call (visit) after 3 days, will be asked to come to the hospital as an
      outpatient within 24 hours or will be admitted to hospital on the same day. In case of
      suspected pneumonitis, the patient will undergo a lung function test and measurement of the
      transfer factor of the lung for carbon monoxide (TLCO). If the suspicions of pneumonitis are
      substantiated, the patient receives a chest x-ray in accordance with the current standard
      procedures at the University Medical Center Schleswig-Holstein in Lübeck.

      If the diagnosis of pneumonitis is confirmed, the patients receive standard treatment with
      prednisolone until the symptoms disappear or show considerable improvement, generally over a
      period of 12 weeks. The symptom-based sum score will be correlated to the diagnosis of
      pneumonitis (yes vs. no).

      Subgroup Analysis: Symptom-Based Scoring System (Mobile Application) In 10 patients (5 breast
      cancer and 5 lung cancer patients), the paper version of the symptom-based scoring system
      (questionnaire) will be supplemented by a mobile application (app) asking the same questions
      regarding cough, shortness of breath and fever. The symptoms collected by the app will not be
      evaluated or analyzed. With regard to the app, only its functionality will be tested in this
      study. The patients will be asked to complete the questionnaire of the app directly after
      completing the questionnaire of the paper version.

      Statistics / Sample size calculation The main goal of this trial is to evaluate the
      usefulness of a new symptom-based scoring system with respect to the identification of
      patients developing pneumonitis after radiotherapy of breast or lung cancer. The
      discriminative power of the symptom-based scoring system will be assessed by calculating the
      area under the ROC curve (AUC). Assuming a ratio between patients without and with radiation
      pneumonitis of 2.33, a sample size of 74 patients is required in the full analysis set to
      yield statistical significance at the significance level of 5% with a power of 90% if the AUC
      under the alternative hypothesis is in fact at least 0.9. Taking into account that 5% of
      patients will not qualify for Full Analysis Set, a total of 78 patients should be recruited.

      If statistical significance of the AUC is reached, the most-informative (optimal) scoring
      point to identify radiation pneumonitis will be derived. Sensitivity analyses will be
      conducted to further investigate the performance of the symptom-based scoring system.
