  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of TAK-071 when compared to placebo on
      gait in patients with Parkinson Disease (PD) who also have cognitive impairment. Safety and
      tolerability of TAK-071 will also be established in participants with Parkinson Disease.

    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is TAK-071. TAK-071 is being tested to treat people with
      Parkinson Disease who have cognitive impairment and are at risk for falls.

      The study will look at the efficacy and safety of TAK-071 in participants with Parkinson
      Disease who take TAK-071 versus placebo.

      The study will enroll approximately 64 patients. Participants who meet the entrance criteria
      will be randomly assigned to one of two sequences in crossover design. — 1 sequence starting
      placebo then crossing over to TAK-071 after washout. The other sequence will do the opposite.
      Treatments will remain undisclosed to the patient and study doctor during the study.

        -  TAK-071 7.5 mg

        -  Placebo - this is a tablet that looks like the study drug but has no active ingredient

      All participants will be asked to take one tablet at the same time each day throughout the
      study. The study will be conducted in the United States. The overall time to participate in
      this study is 17 weeks. Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic and will be
      contacted by telephone at Week 3, Week 12, and 14 days after completion of the last period
      for a follow-up assessment.
