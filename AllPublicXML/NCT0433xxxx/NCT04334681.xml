  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In our hospital, between January 2013 and January 2017, those operated with the Limberg flap
      method after the Rhomboid excision due to pilonidal disease, and those operated with the
      un-roofing curettage method will be screened retrospectively. Patients will be divided into
      two groups as Un-roofing curettage group (UC group) and the Limberg Flap group (LF group).
      Operation time, hospital stay time, return to work time, recovery time, Time to walk without
      pain, days, Time to sit on the toilet without pain, days, Postoperative VAS and recurrence
      will be compared between both groups

      In our hospital, between January 2013 and January 2017, those operated with the Limberg flap
      method after the Rhomboid excision due to pilonidal disease, and those operated with the
      un-roofing curettage method will be screened retrospectively. Patients who are well followed
      up will be included in the study. Demographic features will be recorded. Patients will be
      divided into two groups, the un-roofing curettage group (UC group) and the Limberg Flap group
      (LF group). Surgery time, hospital stay, return to work time, recovery time, painless walking
      time, days, painless sitting time in the toilet, days, postoperative VAS, and recurrence will
      be compared between both groups. In addition, mobilization time, days, recovery time, days,
      exclusion time, days, wound infection, wound distribution will be compared between groups.
      The results will be analyzed with the SPSS statistics program. Factors affecting recurrence
      wound infection, recovery time, hospital stay, operation time, early mobilization will be
      evaluated by univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis.
