  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Physical exercises are known to reduce chronic pain in elderly individuals by activating the
      motor system. However, it seems that exercises are not effective for everyone. The
      investigators believe that elderly individuals with altered corticospinal tract will be those
      in whom the exercise alone are not sufficient to relieve pain. For those patients, adding an
      exogenous stimulation of the motor system such as transcranial direct current stimulation
      (tDCS) would facilitate the corticospinal tract, and consequently, would help exercises to
      relieve chronic pain. The investigators hypothesize that combining tDCS with the exercises
      will be more effective than exercises alone, but only in individuals who initially show low
      corticospinal projections.

      Prevalence and intensity of chronic pain increases substantially with age. According to
      several studies, physical exercises are effective to reduce chronic pain in elderly. However,
      it seems that exercises are not effective for everyone. One of the hypotheses raised is that
      the people in whom the exercises have no effect would be those with an alteration of the
      corticospinal tract. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive
      neurostimulation technique known to facilitate the corticospinal tract when applied over the
      motor cortex.

      Elderly suffering from chronic pain will be recruited in this double-blind, parallel-group,
      randomised control trial. Participants will be randomized to receive exercises combined to
      real tDCS (5 daily sessions, 2 mA, 20 minutes) or to sham tDCS. Intervention will last 8
      weeks at a rate of 3 workouts per week.
