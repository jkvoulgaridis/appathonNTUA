    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well paclitaxel with and without nivolumab works in treating
      patients with soft tissue sarcoma that have not received taxane drugs, and how well nivolumab
      and cabozantinib work in treating taxane pretreated patients with soft tissue sarcoma.
      Nivolumab works through the body's immune system to help the immune system act against tumor
      cells. Chemotherapy drugs, such as paclitaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of
      tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them
      from spreading. Cabozantinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the
      enzymes needed for cell growth. This trial is being done to see if the combination of
      nivolumab and paclitaxel or cabozantinib can shrink soft tissue sarcoma and possibly prevent
      it from coming back.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the progression free survival (PFS) for paclitaxel with and without nivolumab
      in subjects with taxane naive angiosarcoma.

      II. To determine the overall response rate (ORR) of nivolumab in combination with
      cabozantinib S-malate (cabozantinib) in patients with taxane pre-treated angiosarcoma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the ORR of paclitaxel in combination with nivolumab. II. To determine
      clinical activity of the addition of nivolumab to paclitaxel or cabozantinib in subjects with
      angiosarcoma by determination of overall survival (OS) for each combination.

      III. To determine clinical activity of the addition of nivolumab to cabozantinib in subjects
      with taxane pre-treated angiosarcoma by determination of progression free survival (PFS) at 6
      months by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version (v)1.1.

      IV. To assess toxicity of the concurrent nivolumab-paclitaxel and nivolumab-cabozantinib
      combinations in subjects with angiosarcoma based on National Cancer Institute (NCI)-Common
      Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version (v).5.0.

      V. To measure symptomatic adverse events (AE) for patients via Patient Reported Outcome
      (PRO)-CTCAE.

      OUTLINE: Patients who have not previously received a taxane are randomized to Arm I or Arm
      II. Patients who have previously received a taxane are assigned to Arm III.

      ARM I: Patients receive nivolumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1 and paclitaxel
      IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15. Cycles repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15. Cycles repeat every
      4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with disease
      progression may crossover to Arm III.

      ARM III: Patients receive nivolumab IV over 30 minutes on day 1 and cabozantinib orally (PO)
      daily. Cycles repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 3 years.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically confirmed cutaneous or visceral angiosarcoma, where curative treatment
             is either not possible or curative modality therapy is declined by the subject

               -  Note: Radiation induced angiosarcomas are permitted

                    -  All local diagnostic slides AND 5 x 4-6 micron unstained slides from
                       diagnostic tumor tissue should be available for retrospective central
                       pathology review

          -  Must have measurable disease per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)
             version (v)1.1. Per RECIST v1.1, clinical lesions will only be considered measurable
             when they are superficial and P10 mm diameter as assessed using calipers or ruler
             (e.g. skin nodules). For the case of skin lesions, documentation by color photography
             including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion is required. When lesions can be
             evaluated by both clinical exam and imagining, imaging evaluation should be undertaken
             since it is more objective and may also be reviewed at the end of the study. The same
             method of measurement should be used throughout the study, preferably performed by the
             same investigator. Areas previously radiated must have demonstrated disease
             progression at some point over the past 6 months and growth must be subsequent to the
             last line of anti-cancer directed therapy (e.g. chemotherapy, radiation therapy,
             surgery)

                    -  Exception: Targeted small molecule chemotherapy or radiation must be
                       completed &gt;= 14 days of day 1 of study treatment. For targeted
                       chemotherapies, prior therapies must be completed prior to registration and
