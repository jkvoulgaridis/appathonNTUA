  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The music therapy intervention it is dedicated to premature baby and their family at the
      Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU)of the Woman-Child department &quot;Hospital Del Ponte&quot;. In
      NICU an integrated psychological and music therapeutic protocol has been structured. The
      protocol aims to limit or overcome long-term developmental morbidities, promote parenting and
      attachment bond in preterm infants. Protocol is named &quot;Premature family music therapy
      intervention (PFMI): an Italian protocol to support parenting, attachment bond and preterm
      development&quot;. The methodologies will provide early intervention from the first days of
      hospitalization in NICU and use music therapy sessions &quot;active&quot; (chant parental, live music
      and lullaby) and &quot;receptive&quot; (listening to recorded tracks). Such therapy becomes a support
      for the born prematurely and her parents during hospitalization and after discharge. The
      music therapy accompanies the newborn and his parents during the hospitalization and focuses
      its attention on the emotional-relational care, according to the different needs of babies
      and parents.

      This protocol it is a Family Centered Care Music Therapy Intervention.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All infants will be enrolled when in stable clinical condition within two weeks after birth.
      Therapy sessions will take place minimum three times per week on three different days of the
      week directly at the unit during the entire hospitalization until discharge. After discharge
      music therapy treatment will be performed once a week until twelve months of corrected age.

      The infant's wellbeing and relaxation during each session of music therapy will be measured
      using the following parameters:

      HRV (Heart Rate Variability) analysis Oxygen's saturation Stress level of the child

      Infants will be followed till 12 months of corrected age. Investigators will assess:

      Neuro-behavioral and neurological development of the child Stress level of the parents

    <masking_description>A prospective randomized controlled trial will be conducted. Infants will be divided in two subgroups: an intervention group (that will undergo music therapy treatment) and a control group. To evaluate the effectiveness of the protocol, the effects of treatment in the short- and long-term period will be evaluated, with particular reference to the clinical course, the neuro-behavioral development of the premature baby and the relationship with his parents.</masking_description>

    <description>The heart rate variability is related to the interaction of the sympathetic nervous system (alarm system) and parasympathetic (vagal). HRV derives from the balance of Low Frequency (LF) and High Frequency (HF). LF parameter represents the Sympathetic System and is correlated to a state of stress, while HF parameter represents the Parasympathetic System and is correlated to a state of relaxation. The balance of the two parameters (represented by value 1), means that their relationship is a state of well-being.</description>
