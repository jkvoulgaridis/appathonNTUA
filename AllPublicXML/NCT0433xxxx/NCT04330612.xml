  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was a randomized control trial conducted to determine if frequent, standardized
      updates affect anxiety and satisfaction of family members. Additionally, the investigators
      aimed to determine if the length of the surgical procedure effects the satisfaction with
      updates.
