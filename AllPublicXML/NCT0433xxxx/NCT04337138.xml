  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this observational study is to describe treatment patterns and effectiveness
      outcomes in a sample of oncology patients treated for AML with Mylotarg through up to two
      additional relapsed/refractory (R/R)-based lines of therapy (through third-line therapy). The
      study will use United States oncology electronic medical record (EMR) data. All study data
      are secondary data and will have been collected retrospectively from existing clinical data
      originally collected as part of routine care.
