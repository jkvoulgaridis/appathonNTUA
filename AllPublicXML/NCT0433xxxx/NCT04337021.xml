      Unpaid informal caregivers (CGs), such as family and friends, who are also employed may be at
      significant risk of experiencing burden and stress. This may be especially true for CGs who
      provide care to care recipients coping with behavioral health issues associated with
      conditions like depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain
      injury. Stress not only increases the CG's risk of workplace difficulties, illness, and poor
      quality of life, but also impacts the CG's ability to provide care for the care recipient.
      The primary aim of this randomized study is to examine the impact of a novel intervention,
      Caregiver SOS (Self-Management of Stress), on CG distress and work performance and
      productivity. Caregiver SOS is delivered by phone and offers evidence-based, work and CG role
      performance-focused self-management counseling to employed CGs. Study findings will
      ultimately shed light on whether a program that specifically addresses caregiving-work
      balance is effective in improving CGs' wellbeing and work functioning and the quality of
      Veterans' care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Research has shown that unpaid, informal caregivers (CGs), such as family and
      friends, who are also employed may be at significant risk of experiencing burden and stress.
      A recent national survey found that approximately 60% of employed CGs had significant
      problems balancing work and caregiving. Stress not only increases the CG's risk of illness
      and diminishes their quality of life; it also impacts the CG's ability to provide care for
      the care recipient (CR) and overall relationship quality. Moreover, while work frequently
      adds to the CG's stress, relinquishing work can create new stress for both the CG and CR,
      particularly when it involves losses in resources such as income, benefits, social contacts
      and/or respite from caregiving duties.

      Specific Aims: The aims of this study are to, 1) determine the extent to which, relative to
      usual care, a novel intervention providing evidence-based, telephonic CG/work stress
      self-management counseling is related to changes in CG psychological distress and ability to
      function effectively in work and CG roles, and 2) evaluate whether participation in the
      intervention is related to CGs' overall wellbeing and CRs' health care utilization.

      Methodology: The investigators will conduct a randomized controlled trial and compare
      pre/post changes among 300 CGs allocated to the Caregiver SOS (for Self-Management of Stress)
      program or usual care. CGs who, 1) care for Veterans diagnosed with depression, anxiety,
      PTSD, and/or traumatic brain injury (TBI) and, 2) screen positive for clinically significant
      distress and CG/work role difficulty will be recruited to participate from two VA Medical
      Centers and their affiliated outpatient clinics. A novel intervention, Caregiver SOS includes
      6, 1-hour telephonic sessions with a care manager. Usual care will consist of 1 telephonic
      session with a care manager. Primary and secondary outcomes will be pre-post change in CG
      distress and work functioning, respectively. Additional CG and CR outcomes (i.e., physical
      mental and interpersonal functioning) also will be measured and analyzed. CRs' VA health
      utilization data will be extracted from clinical patient records and non-VA health
      utilization data will be collected via CG self-report. Intent to treat analysis using mixed
      effects models will be used to test the study hypotheses. The investigators anticipate that
      CGs in the intervention arm will show significantly greater improvements in outcomes compared
      to those in usual care.

    <description>SOS care is brief, telephonic care (6 one-hour sessions over 3-4 months) tailored to the CG's needs, preferences, and priorities. SOS care addresses both work and caregiving-related stress. The five pillars of behavior change in SOS care are: 1) knowledge of work and CG stress; 2) stress management skills and abilities; 3) supports and resources; 4) confidence and motivation to modify stress; and 5) work and CG-focused problem-solving skills. The pillars are addressed through seven modules. In six sessions, the CM will cover each module at least once. SOS care involves an ongoing process of formulating self-management goals and action plans and preparing CGs to succeed in implementing them. Addressing both work and caregiving contexts, CMs will educate CGs about stress. CMs introduce strategies for self-managing stress and collaboratively design experiments to test these strategies. The CG's progress is monitored to identify strategies that effectively achieve self management goals.</description>

    <description>CGs in this arm will be contacted telephonically once by a CM. After a brief needs assessment, the CM will provide contact information for appropriate VA (e.g., local CSP clinicians) and non-VA community resources/services. CGs will be sent brochures for the national VA CSP. Information on both the program's website (which includes links to training, education, resources, and outreach programs for CGs) and the national CG hotline number will be included in the mailed packet. After this initial contact, CGs in this group will only be contacted again 4 and 9 months after baseline for administration of follow-up research assessments. CGs will be encouraged to seek medical, psychological, social support, and social services that are available to them through VAMCs or any other non-VA/community source. CGs in the SOS group will be offered similar information.</description>
