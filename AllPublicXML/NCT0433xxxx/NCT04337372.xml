  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Shared book reading has been found to have broad developmental benefits for language,
      socio-emotional and cognitive development. However, the effects of shared book reading on
      infant development are not well understood. Although healthcare professionals and educators
      ask parents to read books to their infants early and often, the book reading experience
      itself has never been systematically investigated in infancy. This work is guided by two
      specific aims and is expected to result in a better understanding of the effectiveness of
      shared book reading as a tool for supporting parent-infant interactions and infant learning
      across the first year of life. The first aim of the proposed research is to determine the
      extent to which infant and parent visual attentional coupling during shared book reading
      predicts later: a) infant selective attention and b) infant and parent neural coupling. The
      second aim of the proposed work is to determine the extent to which books with
      individually-named characters (e.g., &quot;Boris&quot;, &quot;Fiona&quot;) increases parent-infant joint
      attention and infant selective attention relative to books with generic labels (e.g., &quot;Bear&quot;,
      &quot;Bear&quot;) or no labels and whether attention differs by age. To address the aims of this
      project, a cross-sectional sample of 6-, 9-, and 12-month old infants and their parents will
      come to the laboratory and read a book that includes three distinct character labeling
      conditions (individual names, generic category labels, no label). During infant-parent shared
      book reading joint attention will be measured using dual eye-tracking. Infants and parents
      will then return to the lab the next day and infant selective attention and infant-parent
      neural synchrony will be measured using EEG frequency tagging while infants and their parent
      view familiar characters across labeling conditions as well as unfamiliar characters. If the
      aims of the proposed research are achieved, we will have determined the extent to which
      parent-infant joint attention prompts subsequent selective processing of book content in 6-,
      9-, and 12-month old infants.

    <description>Infant visual fixations will be recorded during shared book reading and duration of attention and joint attention calculated. Three age groups will be examined (6-, 9-, and 12-month olds).</description>

    <measure>Parent Visual Fixations</measure>
    <time_frame>On Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>In the lab, parent visual attention will be measured across conditions using a head mounted eye-tracker. Duration of joint attention within a spatial window will be calculated in conjunction with infant visual fixations.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Infant EEG steady-state evoked potential frequency tagging power</measure>
    <time_frame>On Day 2</time_frame>
    <description>Infant EEG power will be measured and compared across conditions and ages during a ssVEP frequency tagging task. We will examine the ssVEP power evoked by two overlapping visual objects to quantify the degree of visual attention devoted to learned characters relative to novel characters across labeling conditions.</description>

    <measure>Infant and parent EEG synchrony with steady-state evoked potential power</measure>
    <time_frame>On Day 2</time_frame>
    <description>Infant and parent EEG synchrony will be quantified and compared across conditions.We will use magnitude squared coherence and phase-locking index to quantify EEG dyadic synchrony under viewing conditions in which the phase of brain oscillations is constrained by external stimulation (i.e., Steady-State Evoked Potential power (ssVEP) Frequency Tagging Task) and we will compare within-subject conditions.</description>
