      300 women admitted to the labor and delivery unit in kasr Elainy teaching hospital, Following
      the decision to perform a cesarean section because of obstetric indications. The study
      involved only elective cesarean sections.

      The 300 patients participated in this work and will be randomly and equally divided into
      three groups:

        1. Group A :

           It consists of 100 patients that will be allocated for early post-operative oral feeding
           receiving water and clear fluid approximately 2 hours after surgery, followed by soft
           food and regular diet 4 hours later irrespective to intestinal sounds, flatus or stool.

        2. Group B :

           It consists of 100 patients that will be allocated for early Postoperative oral feeding
           receiving water and clear fluid approximately 2 hours after surgery till the return of
           intestinal sounds, then soft food and regular diet later on.

        3. Group C :

      It consists of 100 patients that will receive no oral feeding till passage of flatus instead
      2 to 3 Litres of intravenous fluid will be used for feeding. Water and fluid will be then
      offered, followed by soft foods and then a regular diet.
