  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Usage of LMA has gained much importance especially as a rescue device for failed intubation.
      We hypothesised optimal operating table height could improve successful attempt of
      ProSeal-LMA™ (P-LMA™) insertion.

      The main objective of this study is to evaluate the optimal operating table height for
      successful placement of P-LMA™ by comparing operating table height to operators' body
      landmark.

      The secondary objectives of this study are to evaluate duration required for a successful
      P-LMA™ insertion and its associated complications during the attempt.

      Written informed consent will be obtained by primary investigator from patients recruited
      into this study. The study will be conducted by anesthesiology medical officers with more
      than 3 years of anesthetic experience.

      All recruited patients will be reviewed by the primary investigator prior to their operation.
      Patients' demographic characteristics and airway assessment will be recorded preoperatively.
      Airway assessment consists of Mallampati score, mouth opening and thyromental distance (TMD).
      Mallampati score is assessed based on modified Samsoon and Young test. Mouth opening is taken
      as distance between upper and lower incisor teeth when mouth is maximally opened. TMD is
      measured as distance between symphysis menti and thyroid notch with the head in full
      extension. Patients are required to be fasted for at least 6 hours before the scheduled
      operation. They will then be randomly allocated by computer generated randomisation into one
      of three groups based on height of operating table with reference to the performers'
      anatomical landmark. The height of the operating table will be adjusted at levels
      corresponding to the performers' umbilicus (Group U), lowest rib margin (Group R) or xiphoid
      process (Group X).

      In the operation theatre, standard monitoring will be applied. Operating table will be
      adjusted according to the respective group randomization. Patient will be preoxygenated with
      100% oxygen until end-tidal oxygen (etO2) of 85% is achieved. Following which, intravenous
      (IV) anesthetic induction drugs will be given: fentanyl 1.5 mcg/kg, propofol 2.0 mg/kg. After
      loss of consciousness, the attending anesthesiology medical officer will proceed with mask
      ventilation with a mixture of oxygen and sevoflurane to achieve Minimum Alveolar
      Concentration (MAC) of 1.0 to 1.2. If there is no difficult ventilation, IV rocuronium 0.6
      mg/kg will be given and the patient will be subsequently ventilated for 3 minutes. If
      unexpected difficult ventilation occurs, patient will be drop out from this study and
      management of the patient will be at the discretion of attending anesthesiologist.

      P-LAM™ will then be inserted by the attending anesthesiology medical officer. The size of
      P-LMA™ used will be according to the manufacturer's recommendation. The P-LMA™ will be
      thoroughly checked and tested as per manufacturer recommendations i.e.: visual inspection
      and; inflation and deflation test. All P-LMA™ are reuse within the manufacturers'
      recommendation, i.e. ≤40 usages and manufactured by The Laryngeal Mask Airway Co Ltd, Mahe,
      Seychelles.

      The P-LMA™ will be inserted with cuff fully deflated using introducer technique on all
      attempts. Patient's head will be positioned with flexion of the neck and extension of the
      head using operator's non-dominant hand. The P-LMA™ is held and inserted while pressing up
      against palate and posterior pharyngeal wall until resistance is felt. P-LMA™ cuff is
      inflated with a volume of air recommended by the manufacturer. The P-LMA™ cuff pressure is
      then measured by a cuff pressure manometer to ensure cuff pressure achieves 60 cmH2O.

      A successful insertion is determined when it fulfills both positional and performance tests.
      Positional tests includes gastric tube 'bubble' test, suprasternal notch tap test and
      insertion of gastric tube through its drain tube which verifies the ideal position of P-LMA™
      placement. Another set of test known as performance test consists of oropharyngeal leak
      pressure test and it determines how well P-LMA™ is able to perform once it is inserted. All
      these tests will be done after insertion and are recorded by a second anesthesiology medical
      officer who was not involved in the insertion process. General anesthesia is maintained with
      a mixture of oxygen/air (50%/50%) and sevoflurane to achieve Minimum Alveolar Concentration
      (MAC) of 1.0 to 1.2 intraoperatively.

      Gastric tube 'bubble' test is done by sealing the drainage tube of P-LMA™ with a drop of gel
      2-3 mm height followed by Intermittent Positive Pressure Ventilation (IPPV) with a tidal
      volume of 8 ml/kg. If no air leak out and gel remains in the drainage tube, it suggests good
      P-LMA™ placement. Suprasternal notch test is done by placing a drop of gel 2-3 mm height and
      a firm pressure is applied to suprasternal notch with a finger. P-LMA™ placement is
      considered good if gel column moves synchronously with the applied pressure. Successful
      insertion of a 14 Fr or 16 Fr orogastric tube via drainage tube without encountering any
      resistance and confirmation of its position in gastric suggests a good P-LMA™ placement.
      Position of orogastric tube is verified by presence of gastric fluid aspiration and audible
      gastric insufflation at the epigastrium during auscultation via stethoscope after 20 ml
      injection of air.

      Subsequently, to test for oropharyngeal leak pressure test, airway seal pressure is
      determined by setting Adjustable Pressure Limiting (APL) valve to 30 cmH2O and fresh gas flow
      at ≥3 L/min. A good oropharyngeal leak pressure is determined by its capability to record a
      stable airway pressure of ≥25 cmH2O in supine position and such recording suggests a good
      P-LMA™placement.

      The same assistant who records the data will also record duration taken for P-LMA™ insertion
      by using a standard stopwatch and it starts from the time when operator places the P-LMA™ at
      the aperture of oral orifice till appearance of first end-tidal CO2 (etCO2) waveform on
      capnography. Time measurement is only done during the first P-LMA™insertion.

      If there is a failure of insertion or failure of placement of P-LMA™ during the first
      attempt, defines as any failure of individual positional and performance tests, the patient
      will be considered as failed P-LMA™ attempt and subsequently airway management will be up to
      the discretion of the attending anesthesiologist. Ease of placement of P-LMA™ is evaluated by
      the operator via subjective ease of insertion whereby score 1=very easy, 2=easy, 3=difficult,
      4=very difficult. Presence of airway morbidity during the first attempt of P-LMA™ insertion
      will be recorded. Examples of complications monitored includes oxygen desaturation of &lt;90%,
      airway obstruction, laryngospasm, bronchospasm and oropharyngeal trauma (defined as presence
      of blood upon removal of P-LMA™). After the procedure is done, operating table height will be
      adjusted according to surgical operation requirements.
