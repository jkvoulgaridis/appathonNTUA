  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This prospective, randomized controlled trial will evaluate the effect of two pre-test
      education methods on the level of participation in genetic testing for hereditary cancer
      risk. A prospective study examines outcomes before the development of a disease.

        -  The research study procedures include screening for eligibility, randomization and a
           series of questionnaires.

        -  Participants will be randomized, or assigned by chance, to one of two methods of
           pre-genetic test education and after completing either pre-test education participants
           will be offered the opportunity to have genetic testing performed

      Two methods of pre-genetic test education:

        -  video education

        -  in-person counseling

        -  Genetic testing will be performed by blood draw.

        -  It is expected that 500 people will participate in this study

        -  Participants will be in the research study for up to 5 yrs after enrollment

    <description>MICRA is a widely used validated 25-item measure that assesses psychosocial consequences associated with genetic testing for cancer. Section 1 contains 3 sub-scales: the Positive sub-scale (4 items), the Distress sub-scale (6 items), and the Uncertainty sub-scale (9 items) and two other items that do not fit into either sub-scale. Section 2 contains two items for participants who have children. Section 3 contains 2 items for participants who have/have had cancer. Responses are indicated on a 4 point scale for experiences in the past week. A higher score in the sub-scales or total scale indicated greater distress. The positive sub-scale is reverse scored to reflect this.</description>
