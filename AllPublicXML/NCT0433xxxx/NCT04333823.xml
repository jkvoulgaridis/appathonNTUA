    <textblock>
      The ATTEMPT (Adolescent Type 1 diabetes Treatment with SGLT2i for hyperglycEMia &amp;
      hyPerfilTration Trial) is a multi-center, double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled
      trial to evaluate the effect of treatment with Dapagliflozin when compared to placebo, in
      combination with adjustable insulin, on measured GFR in adolescents with T1D 12 to &lt;19 years
      of age over a 16-week treatment period.

      The ATTEMPT (Adolescent Type 1 diabetes Treatment with SGLT2i for hyperglycEMia &amp;
      hyPerfilTration Trial) is designed to evaluate the impact of Dapagliflozin versus placebo in
      combination with insulin therapy. This trial will assess detailed renal mechanistic
      evaluations, with direct measurement of GFR, to understand the important physiologic impacts
      of SGLT2 inhibition on the early onset manifestations and progression of diabetes
      complications within this age group.

      Fundamentally, the ATTEMPT trial will provide essential information in establishing a
      framework for this young cohort to evaluate key physiologic, mechanistic and metabolic
      outcomes.

             a suboptimal understanding of diabetes management that would include regular and
             consistent blood glucose monitoring, appropriate ketone testing and DKA symptom
             recognition, appropriate adjustment of insulin doses for meals and activity as well as

         15. Participants are not allowed to change their insulin administration method (injection
             to pump or vice versa) throughout the study period, nor change to hybrid or closed
