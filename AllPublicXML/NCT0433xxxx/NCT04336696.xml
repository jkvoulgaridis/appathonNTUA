      study assigned into three groups, Group I was the control group operated by total
      thyroidectomy and retrospectively followed, where the other two groups Operated by Total
      thyroidectomy and central neck dissection. Recurrence Free Survival (RFS) was the main issue
      of the study and calculated as the time from date of surgery to date of relapse or the most
      recent follow-up contact that patient was known as relapse-free, Study exclusively studied
      the outcome and advantage of central neck dissection

      informed consent taken, study was a prospective cohort study, with controlled group a
      retrospectively. patients ablated by total thyroidectomy only who failed to achieve ablation
      with the first dose of iodine 131I may be dynamically risk stratified as high-risk category
      and managed aggressively. N0 patients will benefit and ablated by total thyroidectomy and
      prophylactic central neck dissection, PCND decreases the residual, increase the RFS and
      patients without residual do not need adjuvant RAI therapy except in high risk group.
      Histological grading, size of the primary tumour, the extension of PTC, the extent of surgery
      were found to be a strong predicting factor for recurrence-free survival

      Locoregional recurrence cases always found more in male patients aged more than 45 years old.
      Size of the primary tumour and the extent of surgery was a significant factor for RFS,
