  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) that cannot be surgically removed will
      receive first-line treatment with standard chemotherapy of pemetrexed and cisplatin.
      Two-thirds of the participants in the study will be randomly assigned to also receive a new
      treatment called durvalumab.

      Durvalumab is an antibody (a type of human protein) that works by blocking a body substance
      called Programmed Death-Ligand 1 (PD-L1). Blocking PD-L1 helps the body's immune system
      attack cancer cells. Research has shown that durvalumab can slow tumor growth and shrink
      tumors in some people with cancer. Previous studies of combining durvalumab and chemotherapy
      showed that this combination is active in advanced mesothelioma.

      The purpose of this study is to see whether adding durvalumab to standard chemotherapy will
      improve overall survival (OS) in patients with MPM.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mesothelioma is a malignant tumor of the mesothelial surfaces primarily arising in the
      thoracic pleura. In the United Kingdom and USA the expected number of cases in the next few
      decades are 65,000 and 85,000, respectively. Once diagnosed, this disease is rarely cured
      with a median survival of less than a year.

      This is an International, Open-Label, Multi-center, Phase III study. Patients will be
      randomized 2:1 to receive durvalumab with standard chemotherapy or to receive standard
      chemotherapy alone.

      Arm A: Durvalumab every 3 weeks + standard chemotherapy (Cisplatin every 3 weeks + Pemetrexed
      every 3 weeks) for 4 to 6 cycles, followed by Durvalumab every 4 weeks.

      Arm B: Standard chemotherapy (Cisplatin every 3 weeks + Pemetrexed every 3 weeks) for 4 to 6
      cycles followed by observation.

      Treatment with durvalumab in Arm A will continued until disease progression, unacceptable
      toxicity or patient withdrawal.

      Tumor assessments and Quality of Life forms will be performed at baseline, then at weeks 6,
      12, 18, 26, 34, 42, 50 and then every 12 weeks until disease progression.

      Mandatory pre-treatment tumor tissue sample (i.e., obtained during a previous procedure or
      biopsy) for research will also be required. Blood samples for research at baseline, day 1 of
      cycle 2, and day 1 of cycle 3 will be done.

      The study is being led jointly by PrECOG as the US sponsor and University of Sydney as the
      international sponsor

             first dose of durvalumab. Note: Local surgery of isolated lesions for palliative
             intent is acceptable.

          -  No other malignancy that requires active treatment. Participants with a past history
             of adequately treated carcinoma in situ, non-melanoma skin cancer or lentigo maligna
             without evidence of disease or superficial transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder
             are eligible.

             diarrhoea, active bleeding diatheses.

          -  Hepatitis B, hepatitis C or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Exceptions include
             past or resolved Hepatitis B (defined as the presence of hepatitis B core antibody
             [anti-HBc] and absence of HBsAg) and patients positive for hepatitis C (HCV) antibody
             if polymerase chain reaction is negative for HCV RNA. HIV testing is not required in
             absence of clinical suspicion of HIV.

          -  Known history of primary immunodeficiency, allogeneic organ transplant, pneumonitis or
             active tuberculosis.

          -  Receipt of live attenuated vaccination within 30 days prior to enrolment or within 30
             days of receiving durvalumab.

          -  Specific comorbidities or conditions or concomitant medications which may interact
             with the investigational product(s).

          -  Any condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would interfere with
             evaluation of study treatment or interpretation of patient safety or study results.

          -  Serious medical or psychiatric conditions or social situation that might limit
             compliance with study requirements, substantially increase risk of incurring adverse
             events or compromise the ability of the patient to give written informed consent.
