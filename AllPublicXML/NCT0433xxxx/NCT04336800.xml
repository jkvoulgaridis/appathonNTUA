      To build a registry of diabetic volunteers by inviting them to get a LiverMultiScan and
      collecting their contact information to seek interest in participating in future research
      studies.

    <textblock>
      Perspectum's LiverMultiScan is a quantitative multiparametric MRI method, FDA-cleared and
      CE-marked, that is used to detect and stage early liver disease.It is already widely used
      internally in both research and within the clinical setting. LiverMultiScan has been adopted
      as the only liver scan in whole-population long term studies. The LiverMultiScan is more cost
      efficient, short in duration(&lt;15mins), non-invasive and safe(no IV or oral contrast required,
      no ionizing radiation and no venipuncture).

      This is a registry where there will be no intervention to the standard of care. Registry
      volunteers will be required to attend a single visit that will involve having a
      multi-parametric MRI at no cost to them. In addition, the investigators will collect contact
      information of the volunteers including their email address, phone number and home address so
      that they can be contacted to discuss possible participation in future studies which may be
      sponsored by Perspectum or third parties, such as pharmaceutical companies.The volunteer's
      personal information shall never be shared with these third parties. Additionally, the
      contact information of the volunteers' medical providers shall also be collected so that the
      LiverMultiScan reports can be delivered to them.
