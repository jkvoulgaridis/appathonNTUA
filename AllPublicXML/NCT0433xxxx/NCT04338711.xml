  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetic (PK) and safety of an
      age-appropriate tofacitinib Modified Release (MR) formulation with varying level of enteric
      coating. The effect of food on the PK of age-appropriate tofacitinib MR formulation with the
      lowest and higher levels of enteric coating will also be assessed.
