    <textblock>
      This phase IIa trial studies the side effects of itacitinib when given together with standard
      treatment (tacrolimus and sirolimus), and to see how well it works in preventing
      graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD) in patients with acute leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome or
      myelofibrosis who are undergoing reduced intensity conditioning donor stem cell
      transplantation. GVHD is a common complication after donor stem cell transplantation,
      resulting from donor immune cells recognizing recipients' cells and attacking them. Adding
      itacitinib to tacrolimus and sirolimus may reduce the risk GVHD and ultimately improve
      overall outcome and survival after donor stem cell transplantation.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Following a patient safety lead-in, estimate graft-versus-host disease free relapse free
      (GRFS) survival at 1- year post allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloHCT).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Estimate the cumulative incidence of acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) and
      non-relapse mortality (NRM) at 100-days post-transplant.

      II. Estimate the cumulative incidence of chronic GVHD at 1- and 2-years post-transplant.

      III. Estimate the probabilities of overall and progression-free survival (OS/PFS) at 1- and
      2-years post-transplant.

      IV. Estimate rate of infection and development of second malignancies including
      lymphoproliferative disorders at 1- and 2-years post-transplant.

      V. Assess patients' quality of life (QOL) at day 100 and 1 year post alloHCT.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Characterize and evaluate hematologic recovery, donor cell engraftment and immune
      reconstitution by cell count and flow cytometry of lymphocyte subsets.

      II. Characterize changes in aGVHD biomarkers (Reg-3alpha, TNF-RI, and ST2) and a composite
      biomarker panel (IL2Ralpha, TNF-R1, IL-8, and hepatocyte growth factor), JAK-regulated
      pro-inflammatory cytokines (i.e., IL-6, TNFalpha, CRP, Beta2 Microglobulin, and IFNgamma) and
      STAT3 phosphorylation (downstream of JAK signaling) over time and by aGVHD status/grade.

      OUTLINE:

      REDUCED INTENSITY CONDITIONING (RIC): Patients receive fludarabine via infusion on days -9 to
      -5 and melphalan on day -4 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ALLOGENEIC HEMATOPOIETIC STEM CELL TRANSPLANT (HSCT): Patients undergo HSCT on day 0.

      GVHD PROPHYLAXIS: Patients receive itacitinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) beginning on day -3
      and continuing until day 100 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
      Patients also receive tacrolimus intravenously (IV) or PO and sirolimus PO beginning day -3
      and continuing until day 100 with a taper in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, then periodically
      for up to 2 years post- transplantation.
