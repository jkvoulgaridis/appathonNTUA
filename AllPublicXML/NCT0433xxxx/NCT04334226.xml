      This is an observational study utilizing a qualitative descriptive methodology with a
      thematic analysis approach to explore the impact of a preoperative educational intervention

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will utilize a qualitative descriptive methodology with a thematic analysis
      approach. Individual interviews will be held with bladder cancer and caregiver dyads who
      participated in the Stoma Bootcamp study. Interviews will explore the patient's and
      caregiver's experiences and perceptions of ostomy surgery prior to the Bootcamp and after the
      Bootcamp from a physical, psychological, social, and spiritual perspective. Semi-structured
      interview guides will be developed using Engel Biopsychosocial Model (BPS),5 one guide geared
      towards patients and the second toward caregivers.

    <description>The research team will open code a subset of interviews, develop a codebook, and continue rounds of coding and discussion until consensus on code and definitions is reached. Once consensus is reached, all transcripts will be coded using the codebook, categories will be developed, and emergent themes will be assessed. Once themes are identified, they will be placed into a thematic map. Data will be analyzed until thematic saturation is reached</description>
