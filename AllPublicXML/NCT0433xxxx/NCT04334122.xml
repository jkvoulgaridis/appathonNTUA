  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was carried out to investigate the effect of instrument-assisted soft tissue
      mobilization in patients with lomber region disc herniation. 60 patients with lumbar disc
      herniation between the ages of 30-65 were included in the study. Following the evaluation,
      the patients were divided into two groups by closed envelope method; control group (n=30) and
      experimental group (n=30). In both groups, 4 weeks (20 sessions) hot pack (hotpack),
      conventional transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), therapeutic physical therapy
      program with therapeutic ultrasound applications were performed. In addition to this program,
      Instrumental Assisted Soft Tissue Mobilization (IASTM) was applied to the experimental group
      in 12 sessions of 3 times a week. This technique was performed by using stainless steel tools
      of different sizes and shapes. IASTM treatment was performed (including SWEEP-FAN-BRUSH-SWEEP
      technique, 45° angle with the skin, by 8-10 repetitions) for the ilicostalis lumborum,
      priformis, gluteus medius, erector spines, quadratus lumborum muscles, superficial and deep
      fascia. Depression levels of the patients were evaluated with Beck Depression Scale, before
      the treatment and after 4 weeks pain severity, VAS pain scale, functional status with
      Oswestry Scale, quality of life with Short Form-36 (SF-

      36) and normal range of motion with goniometer. The results were analyzed by using SPSS v.20
      program. In all analyzes, the significance ratio was accepted as p &lt;0.05. At the end of the
      four-week treatment program, significant improvements were observed in VAS levels, normal
      joint movements (flexion, extension, right-left lateral flexion, rotation) in both groups (p
      &lt;0.05). Oswestry and Beck Depression Scale scores showed significant improvement merely in
      the experimental group compared to the control group (p &lt;0.05). There was no significant
      difference in VAS values, normal joint motion and Oswestry scale while there was no notable
      difference in SF-36 and Beck Depression Scale. As a result of the study, it was concluded
      that IASTM is a more effective method on normal range of motion and functionality in
      comparison with traditional physiotherapy program in patients with lumbar disc herniation and
      it can be used as an alternative method in patients during the physiotherapy and
      rehabilitation program if needed.

    <description>Personal information (name, surname, address, telephone, marital status, educational status, occupational and health security), demographic and clinical information (age (year), gender, height (cm), weight (kg), BMI of all patients participating in the study (calculated by the formula of the ratio of body weight to neck squared (kg / m²)), information about the disease, drugs used for lumbar disc hernia, other drugs used, presence of chronic disease, surgical history, smoking and alcohol use] by questioning '' Demographic Information Forms '' recorded.</description>

    <measure>Assessment of pain (VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>4 week</time_frame>
    <description>The pain intensities of the patients at rest, during the activity and at night were determined using the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). VAS is an easy-to-apply scale, as values that cannot be measured numerically can be digitized and quickly understood.
The patients were asked to mark their severity (rest, activity, night) on a 10 cm line. The starting point of the truth was '' 0 '' '' I have no pain '', the end point was '' 10 '' '' I have pain of unbearable severity ''. The point that the patient marked on the right was measured with a ruler and recorded in &quot;cm&quot;. Localization of the pain, its frequency and the causes that increase and decrease pain were questioned and recorded. The Turkish validity and reliability study of the scale was performed.</description>

    <time_frame>4 week</time_frame>
    <description>The limitation of flexion, extension, lateral flexion and rotation movements of the lumbosacral joint was measured using a universal goniometer. All normal joint movements were repeated 3 times and the average of the obtained values was recorded in degrees.</description>

    <measure>Evaluation of the quality of life</measure>
    <time_frame>4 week</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of life was assessed with the survey &quot;SF-36 (Short form-36) quality of life&quot;. SF-36 is a generic scale that evaluates the overall health status. It consists of 36 questions that evaluate 2 main (physical and mental component) and 8 sub parameters (physical function, emotional function, physical role, social function, mental health, pain, general health and vitality). The score of each subgroup is evaluated between 0-100. A high score indicates that the quality of life is good. The Turkish validity and reliability study of the SF-36 questionnaire was conducted.</description>

    <measure>Evaluation of depression</measure>
    <time_frame>4 week</time_frame>
    <description>Depression level of the patients was evaluated by Beck Depression questionnaire. The scale developed by Beck consists of 21 questions. 4-point Likert scoring is used in the scale. Each item gets points between 0-3. The total score ranges from 0-63.
Points obtained from the survey;
0-10 points → no depression
11-17 points → mild depression
18-23 points → moderate depression
24 points above → interpreted as severe depression.
The Turkish validity and reliability study of the scale was conducted.</description>

    <measure>Functional evaluation for low back pain</measure>
    <time_frame>4 week</time_frame>
    <description>Oswestry Disability Index was used to evaluate the disability caused by low back pain. The scale evaluates how much back pain affects daily life activities. Pain severity consists of 10 questions evaluating personal care, weight lifting, walking, sitting, standing, sleep quality, social life, ability to travel and the degree of pain. Six-point likert scoring is used. A high total score indicates an increase in disability. The Turkish validity and reliability study of this scale was conducted.
Points obtained from the survey;
0% - 20% → minimal disability
20% to 40% → mild disability
40% to 60% → severe disability
60% - 80% → complete limitation
80% - 100% → bed-dependent (or symptoms are exaggerated)</description>

    <description>All patients in the control group were given a traditional physiotherapy program applied in lumbar disc herniation for 4 weeks (20 sessions) and 5 days a week.
As a traditional treatment, patients received hot packs, conventional transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), therapeutic ultrasound and exercise.
Hot packs used as superficial heat were wrapped in a towel and applied to the waist area for 20 minutes.
Conventional TENS used as analgesic current were applied to the waist region for 20 minutes with 4 electrodes with 2 outputs, with a current time of 180 ms at a frequency of 80 Hz.
It was applied with a dose of 1Mhz for 5 minutes with ultrasan (Chattanooga Intelect Mobile Combo model device) used to heat deep tissues.
Waist exercises were asked to be done during the treatment, with 10 repetitions, each exercise twice a day (morning and evening).</description>

    <description>In addition to the traditional physiotherapy program, tool-assisted soft tissue mobilization was performed 3 times a week (12 sessions with 1 day interval) in the experimental group.
Instrument Assisted Soft Tissue Mobilization (IASTM) treatment was applied to ilicostalis lumborum, priformism, gluteus medius, erector spinas, quadratus lumborum muscles, superficial and deep fascia. Before applying the application, petroleum jelly was applied to the area and the tool was slipped.
IASTM treatment was applied to the treated muscle fibers for 6 minutes, each technique (SWEEP-FAN-BRUSH-SWEEP techniques) with 8-10 repetitions.
Sweep: Applied in all directions at 30 or 60 degree angle. Fan: It was applied by moving one side fixed arm at 30 degree angle. Brush: It was applied in straight steps at 30 degrees angle. Each stage of IASTM treatment was done by the physiotherapist.</description>
