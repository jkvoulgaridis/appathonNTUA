    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate safety, tolerability, physical and motor development, and
      pharmacokinetics (PK) in children aged ≥6 months to &lt;2 years treated daily for 52 weeks with
      orally administered ataluren 10, 10, and 20 milligrams/kilogram (mg/kg) (morning, mid-day,
      and evening dose, respectively).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Body weight ≥7.5 kilograms (kg)

          -  No clinically significant abnormality based upon laboratory assessments during the
             screening period, in the opinion of the Investigator; good general health, as
             determined during the screening period by medical history and physical examination
             (including vital sign measurements).

          -  Diagnosis of duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) based on an elevated serum creatine
             kinase and genotypic evidence of dystrophinopathy.

          -  Documentation of the presence of a nonsense mutation of the dystrophin gene.

          -  Verification that a blood sample was drawn for sequencing of the dystrophin gene.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participation in any drug investigation or received an investigational drug within
             three months prior to the Screening Visit or who anticipate participating in any other
             drug or device clinical investigation or receiving any other investigational drug
             within the duration of this study.

          -  Expectation of a major surgical procedure during the study period.

          -  Known hypersensitivity to any of the ingredients or excipients of the study drug
             (polydextrose, polyethylene glycol 3350, poloxamer 407, mannitol 25C, crospovidone
             XL10, hydroxyethyl cellulose, vanilla, colloidal silica, or magnesium stearate).

          -  Prior and concomitant use of corticosteroids.

          -  Ongoing use of the following drugs:

               1. Systemic aminoglycoside therapy and/or intravenous (IV) vancomycin.

               2. Coumarin-based anticoagulants (for example, warfarin), phenytoin, tolbutamide, or
                  paclitaxel.

               3. Inducers of UGT1A9 (for example, rifampicin), or substrates of OAT1 or OAT3 (for
                  example, ciprofloxacin, adefovir, oseltamivir, aciclovir, captopril, furosemide,
                  bumetanide, valsartan, pravastatin, rosuvastatin, atorvastatin, pitavastatin).
