  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Attention deficit/ hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common neurodevelopmental disorder. The
      common diagnostic of ADHD is based on psychiatric examination and interview. So far, there is
      not any other diagnostic tool for ADHD nowadays. Therefore, virtual reality (VR) technology
      can be used as a stimulus, replacing real stimuli, recreating experiences, which are in the
      real world would be impossible. Consequently, ADHD-VR diagnostic tool development should be
      started to justify the ADHD diagnosis in psychiatric out-patient clinical services.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diagnostic test is a very essential in modern medical practices, especially in child and
      adolescent psychiatry field because the main diagnostic tool is only based on psychiatry
      interview and observation. Using Diagnostic tool can help a confirmation towards specific
      clinical diagnosis, provide more evidence for eliminating one diagnosis versus another,
      provide more evidence for parents, or to rule out the differential diagnosis. Even though
      psychiatric examination is the main approach on ADHD diagnostic procedure, however the
      laboratory testing or imaging examination is also used especially to rule out the general
      medical condition or to find out any medical conditions that mimic ADHD but not to facilitate
      the ADHD diagnosis per se. Nowadays, the expand study in biological psychiatry has found a
      lot of biological markers in ADHD as well; but none is really sensitive and specific for ADHD
      diagnostic test. Therefore, there should be another approach for developing diagnostic tool
      in ADHD. VR is one of the best approach bacasue these days, because VR as an ADHD diagnostic
      tool could create and replace real stimuli, recreating experiences, which could not be
      observed by the clinician at the out-patient clinic.

    <description>Since that time and in accordance with the application area, several definitions have been formulated: for example, Fuchs and Bishop (1992) defined VR as &quot;real-time interactive graphics with 3D models, combined with a display technology that gives the user the immersion in the model world and direct manipulation&quot;; Gigante (1993) described VR as &quot;The illusion of participation in a synthetic environment rather than external observation of such an environment. VR relies on a 3D, stereoscopic head-tracker displays, hand/body tracking and binaural sound. VR is an immersive, multi-sensory experience&quot;; and &quot;Virtual reality refers to immersive, interactive, multi-sensory, viewer-centered, 3D computer generated environments and the combination of technologies required building environments&quot;.</description>
