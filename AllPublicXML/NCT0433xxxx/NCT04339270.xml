  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this trial is to compare the exacerbation rates over 12 months of
      follow-up between a group of patients with COPD treated according to standardized management
      (standardized comparator arm: azithromycin prescribed in case of severe sputum according to
      the CASA-Q score) and a similar group in which azithromycin is prescribed according to mucus
      rheology (experimental arm).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The secondary objectives are to compare between the 2 arms:

        -  exacerbation rates according to their severity (observed throughout the duration of the
           study);

        -  the evolution of the symptoms, the rheology of the sputum, and the pulmonary function
           (measurements repeated every three months);

        -  medication consumption and adverse events (monitored throughout the duration of the
           study);

        -  patient trajectories during follow-up;

        -  the overall clinical improvement at the end of the study and the evolution of the
           quality of life (measurements repeated every 3 months);

        -  the change in biomarkers of interest (baseline versus end of study).

    <masking>Triple (Participant, Investigator, Outcomes Assessor)</masking>
    <masking_description>CASA-Q scoring is performed by the patient and then sealed away from investigator-view. Similarly, mucus rheology results are blinded. The patient does not know what arm he/she is in, as so does not know exactly why the prescription was made or not.
Similarly, investigators/outcome assessors are blinded to both CASA-Q scores and sputum rheology. The prescription strategy is determined according to an algorithm, and investigators/outcome assessors do not know what arm the patient is in nor exactly why a prescription was made or not.</masking_description>

    <description>An exacerbation is defined according to French recommendations as an &quot;acute event characterized by worsening of respiratory symptoms (notably cough, sputum and dyspnea) beyond [normal] daily variation and leading to a modification of treatment: either a simple increase in bronchodilators (in this case, a duration greater than 24 hours is required to define an exacerbation) or the addition of another treatment (antibiotic therapy and / or oral corticosteroid therapy).&quot;</description>

1 point: gain &gt; 100mL in pre-bronchodilator FEV1 at the 52nd week compared to the baseline state;
1 point: variation of the CAT score during the 52 weeks of observation &gt; 2.</description>

    <description>The SF-36 taps eight health concepts: physical functioning, bodily pain, role limitations due to physical health problems, role limitations due to personal or emotional problems, emotional well-being, social functioning, energy/fatigue, and general health perceptions. It also includes a single item that provides an indication of perceived change in health. A score of zero is equivalent to maximum disability and a score of 100 is equivalent to no disability.</description>

CASA-Q will be listed every 3 months.
If the patient has a sputum symptoms score &lt;70, a prescription for 3 months of azithromycin treatment will be initiated. This prescription can be renewed every 3 months during the 12 months of follow-up planned in this study, if the patient continues to obtain a sputum symptoms score &lt;70.

The rheology of mucus will be quantified every 3 months.
If the patient has spontaneous or induced sputum, and this sputum has a critical constraint (tau-C) &gt; 39, a prescription for 3 months of azithromycin treatment will be initiated.
This prescription may be renewed every 3 months during the 12 months of follow-up planned in this study.
In the absence of sputum, azithromycin will not be prescribed.</description>
