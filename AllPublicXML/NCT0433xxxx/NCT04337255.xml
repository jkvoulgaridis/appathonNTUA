    <textblock>
      To test the effects of a 2- to 3-year intervention of the MIND diet versus usual post-stroke
      care on cognitive decline, the characteristic feature of dementia, and on brain biomarkers of
      Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and vascular disease in a Phase Ill randomized controlled trial of
      500 patients hospitalized for acute ischemic stroke, aged 60-80 years and without dementia
      who are discharged home following hospitalization.

      The Mediterranean-DASH diet intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND in Stroke patients
      is designed to test the effects of a 2-3 year intervention of a hybrid of the Mediterranean
      and DASH diets, called MIND on 500 older patients, without dementia who are hospitalized for
      acute stroke who are discharged home following hospitalization. The MIND diet has the same
      basic components of the DASH and Mediterranean diets, such as emphasis on natural plant based
      foods and limited animal and high saturated fat foods, but uniquely specifies green leafy
      vegetable and berries as well as food component servings that reflect the nutrition dementia
      evidence. In this study we will test the effects of a 2- to 3-year intervention of the MIND
      diet (3 months of delivered meals followed by dietary and general stroke health counseling)
      versus usual post-stroke care (3 months delivered self-selected meals followed by general
      stroke health counseling) on change on cognitive outcomes over 24 to 36 months. Biological
      effects of the MIND diet will be assessed by measurement of brain macro and microstructural
      integrity in 300 trial participants randomly selected participants. Other biochemical markers
      will be assessed in the entire group of 500 participants including: plasma Abeta42/beta40,
      brain derived neurotropic factor (BDNF) and plasma markers of oxidative stress and
      inflammation. The trial will examine potential effect mediators and modifiers by a number of
      cardiovascular risk factors, AD biomarkers and biological mechanisms. The proposed study has
      3 clinical sites, Rush University Medical Center, University of Chicago, and Advocate Christ
      Hospital all located in Chicago.
