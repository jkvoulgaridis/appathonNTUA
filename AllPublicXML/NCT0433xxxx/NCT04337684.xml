      This study will collect long term follow-up data regarding overall survival and neurological
      parameters from patients previously identified and/or enrolled in Protocols 09-CH-0059 and
      90-CH0149 and Historical Control data on Menkes disease patients.

      Primary Objective:

        1. To provide additional clinical and safety data on long term following administration of
           Copper Histidinate treatment in patients treated with Copper Histidinate under Protocols
           09-CH-0059 and 90-CH0149 and untreated patients previously identified and/or enrolled in
           Protocol 09-CH-0059.

        2. To provide additional Historical Control data on Menkes disease patients.

    <description>Menkes disease is a form of inherited copper deficiency associated with neurodevelopmental delays and neurological problems. Copper Histidinate is being evaluated for efficacy and safety in patients with Menkes disease. The purpose of this protocol is to collect long term follow-up data.
During the study, patients and/or parent/legal guardian will be contacted by the investigator by either telephone or an in-person visit to assess long term follow-up.</description>
