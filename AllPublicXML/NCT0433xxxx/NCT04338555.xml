  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients undergoing elective orthopedics, urology, and general surgery for non-tumor surgery
      will be included and randomly allocated to TEAS group or control group . After routine
      anesthesia induction and tracheal intubation, patients in TEAS group will receive electrical
      stimulation of acupoints at Baihui, Neiguan and Shenmen points. For patients in the control
      group, the electrodes will be only attached to the corresponding sites, with no TEAS
      electrical stimulation given during the operation. The primary outcome is the incidence of
      POCD at Day 7 after surgery. The secondary outcomes include the incidence of POD during
      post-operative days 1-7, the incidence of POCD at Day 30 after surgery, and the serum levels
      of cytokines, including IL-1β、IL-6、TNF-α、MMP9 on Day 1 after surgery.

      This study will enroll 110 patients who are older than 60 years old and will have elective
      orthopedics, urology, or general surgeries due to non-tumor reasons under general anesthesia.
      Patients will be randomly assigned to TEAS group and control group. After routine anesthesia
      induction and tracheal intubation, patients in TEAS group will receive electrical stimulation
      of acupoints at Baihui, Neiguan and Shenmen points for 30min every hour. In other words, the
      patients will receive TEAS stimulation for 30min, then no stimulation for 30min, then
      stimulation for another 30min, etc, until the end of the surgery. For patients in the control
      group, the electrodes will be only attached to the corresponding sites, with no TEAS
      electrical stimulation given during the operation. The primary outcome is the incidence of
      POCD at Day 7 after surgery. The secondary outcomes include the incidence of POD during
      post-operative days 1-7, the incidence of POCD at Day 30 after surgery, and the serum levels
      of cytokines, including IL-1β、IL-6、TNF-α、MMP9 on Day 1 after surgery.
