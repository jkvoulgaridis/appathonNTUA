  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Only 59% (29-73%) of Alaska Native people have been adequately screened for colorectal cancer
      (CRC), which could save lives, despite having the highest reported incidence of CRC in the
      world. A new at-home multi-target stool DNA screening test (MT-sDNA; CologuardÂ®) with high
      sensitivity for pre-cancerous polyps and CRC is now available. MT-sDNA has not been tested
      for feasibility or acceptability within the Alaska tribal health care delivery system, and it
      is unknown whether use of this new test will increase Alaska Native CRC screening rates. Our
      long-term goal is to improve screening and reduce CRC-attributable mortality. The objective
      of this application is to test the effectiveness of MT-sDNA for increasing CRC screening in
      Alaska Native communities using a mixed methods, community-based participatory research
      (CBPR) approach. The study will be conducted in collaboration with regional Tribal health
      organizations who are responsible for providing health care to geographically remote Alaska
      Native communities. Although the proposed implementation strategy is evidence-informed and
      promising, it is novel in that MT-sDNA has not been evaluated in the tribal health setting or
      among rural/remote populations. Using the Social Ecological Model, our research will be
      multi-level, examining influence on patients, providers, and tribal health organizations
      (THOs). This research study will pursue two specific aims: (1) Identify patient-, provider-,
      and system-level factors associated with CRC screening preferences, uptake, and follow-up;
      and (2) test the effectiveness of graded intensity MT-sDNA intervention in the Alaska Native
      community setting. For the first aim, focus groups with Alaska Native people who are non- or
      inadequately adherent to CRC screening guidelines, and surveys and interviews with healthcare
      providers will be used to identify individual, interpersonal (provider), and health system
      factors for future intervention. For the second aim, a three-arm cluster randomized
      controlled trial (high intensity with patient navigation, medium intensity with mailed
      reminders, usual care) will provide evidence on the usefulness of MT-sDNA in remote tribal
      communities as well as the first data on MT-sDNA diagnostic follow up adherence rates in the
      Alaska Native population. This aim will also provide evidence on the usability of MT-sDNA in
      the Alaska setting by evaluating MT-sDNA sample quality and neoplastic yield, which will
      inform plans to scale-up the intervention model. This research has the potential to
      sustainably improve public health by increasing CRC screening rates among a rural/remote
      tribal population as well as provide a model for other integrated health systems that provide
      care to high-risk or underserved populations in the U.S. and worldwide.

      The study will employ a cluster-randomized design, in which twelve communities within 1-2
      Tribal health regions will be randomized to one of the two study intervention conditions (6
      communities per intervention), matched by community size. All Alaska Native adults aged 45-75
      due for colorectal cancer (CRC) screening within each community will be offered the same
      intervention. A total of 770 participants will be recruited in at least six communities per
      study arm.

        1. High Intensity Intervention: Participants will receive navigated tribal health worker
           outreach, a mailed MT-sDNA kit, mailed culturally appropriate educational material
           describing CRC screening options available and follow-up reminders

        2. Medium Intensity Intervention: Participants will receive mailed culturally appropriate
           educational material describing CRC screening options available, including MT-sDNA, and
           navigated follow-up outreach reminders

        3. Usual Care (Control arm): All other communities in the participating Tribal health
           region will serve as the reference group receiving usual care (i.e., screening
           recommendation at a clinic visit) Participants receiving the high intensity intervention
           are expected to have a 20% increase in screening uptake while those receiving medium
           intensity intervention will have a 10% increase in screening uptake over those receiving
           usual care.We will also measure MT-sDNA sample quality and neoplastic yield in these
           remote Alaska Native communities. We anticipate that the proportion of MT-sDNA tests
           meeting quality control standards will be the same as in the general US population (96%)
           and that pre-cancerous polyp detection rates at diagnostic post-MT-sDNA colonoscopy will
           exceed routine clinical practice rates in the general US population (52%-67%).

      During and following the graded intensity intervention, we will survey samples of patients to
      evaluate their awareness and response to the CRC screening intervention. We will assess their
      perceived severity, perceived susceptibility, perceived benefits, perceived barriers, and
      self-efficacy relevant to CRC screening as well as measure the time-to-respond and screening
      method used. We will use focus groups and key informant interviews to learn about factors
      associated with screening response. For the focus groups, we will invite AN people ages 45-75
      who are unscreened or non-adherent to screening guidelines (colonoscopy within 10 years,
      sigmoidoscopy within five years, or fecal occult blood testing within preceding 12 months) to
      provide their views on barriers to and facilitators of screening, including barriers
      described in the literature and identified in our previous work. Non-adherence will be
      identified through tribal medical records. Each focus group will last up to two hours, and
      will include 6-8 participants. All focus groups will be stratified by gender, and focus
      groups will be balanced so that approximately equal numbers of men and women are included in
      the analysis.

      We will also conduct a brief survey and key informant interviews (6-8 clinician interviews at
      each location) among community health aides, providers, and tribal health system
      administrators using validated measures of intervention feasibility, acceptability, and
      appropriateness to characterize provider- and system-level barriers and promotors to MT-sDNA
      implementation.
