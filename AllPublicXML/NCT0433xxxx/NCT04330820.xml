  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label Phase I dose-escalation study of oral venetoclax in combination with
      increasing cytarabine doses plus mitoxantrone to define the safety profile and MTD of
      cytarabine in subjects with a histologically or cytologically confirmed acute myeloid
      leukemia who are refractory or suffered a relapse. This study will be conducted at multiple
      centers in Germany.

           of venetoclax in combination with increasing cytarabine doses plus fixed dose
           mitoxantrone in subjects with a relapsed or refractory AML considered fit for intensive

                       the investigator and Coordinating investigator.

               -  Adequate renal function assessed by serum creatinine ≤ 1.5x ULN OR creatinine

             trial inclusion:

               -  Post-menopausal (12 months of natural amenorrhea or 6 months of amenorrhea with

             clearance of infection (Occult or prior hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection (defined as

             be included if HBV DNA is undetectable, provided that they are willing to undergo
             monthly DNA testing. Patients who have protective titers of hepatitis B surface
             antibody after vaccination or prior but cured hepatitis B are eligible. Patients
             positive for hepatitis C virus antibody are eligible provided PCR is negative for HCV
