  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this protocol is to test the effects on weight of an evidence-based behavioral
      weight loss program enhanced with culturally targeted stress management strategies compared
      to the evidence-based weight loss program alone among adult black females with obesity and
      elevated stress levels. Participants will be randomized to receive either a behavioral weight
      loss intervention with a focus on stress management or the weight loss intervention alone for
      26 sessions.
