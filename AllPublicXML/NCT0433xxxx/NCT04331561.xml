  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a preliminary study of how human beings control balance and how symptoms of
      visually-induced dizziness may result in falls. The researchers created new tests of
      orientation and balance, as well as a new treatment for visually-induced dizziness. The
      researchers will use the new tests and treatments with adults who are affected by
      visually-induced dizziness. Testing is done twice before and twice after treatment, which is
      provided twice during a one-week period. The total time participants are involved in the
      study is approximately three weeks.

    <textblock>
      This is a preliminary study of how human beings control balance and how symptoms of
      visually-induced dizziness may result in falls. The researchers created new tests of
      orientation and balance, as well as a new treatment for visually-induced dizziness. It is not
      known whether the new tests of orientation and balance are better, worse, or the same as
      existing tests in the ability to detect problems, nor is it known if the new treatment
      technique is any better, worse, or the same as existing treatments for dizziness and
      imbalance. However, the researchers hypothesize that the new tests will improve the ability
      to detect problems. They hypothesize that the treatment will result in less dizziness, better
      balance, and reduced risk of falling for those who receive it and that it is a better
      alternative to treatments that are already available to patients.

      In order to see if this is true, the researchers will use the new tests and treatments with
      adults who are affected by dizziness. All participants in this study will undergo the same
      tests and will receive the same treatment. Testing is done twice before and twice after the
      treatment period. The treatment is provided twice during a one-week period. The tests and
      treatments are done while standing on a computerized platform that measures balance and can
      tilt people from side to side. During these study procedures, participants wear virtual
      reality goggles that show them simple images in an otherwise dark environment.

      The goal of the tests and the treatment is for participants to use what they feel to help
      them decide if the images shown inside the goggles are aligned with the person's sense of
      gravity. Participation in this study is voluntary and people who decide to participate may
      stop at any time without penalty.

    <measure>Post-Intervention Virtual Reality Sickness Questionnaire (VRSQ) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Visit 2 (Week 2) and Visit 3 (Week 2)</time_frame>
    <description>This questionnaire will be administered on paper immediately following each instance of testing and each round of training. Additional rest time will be required if participants symptoms are scored as &gt; 33% on the VRSQ (see below for more information regarding VRSQ scoring). Symptoms must return to baseline before participants are permitted to begin a round of testing or training. The VRSQ is comprised of nine items from two domains (oculomotor: general discomfort, fatigue, eye strain, and difficulty focusing; disorientation: headache, fullness of head, blurred vision, dizzy (eyes closed), and vertigo). The intensity of each item is rated on a 4-point Likert scale: 0 = not at all, 1 = slightly, 2 = moderately, and 3 = very. Scores for each sub-scale and the total score range from 0 to 100. Higher scores indicate greater symptom intensity. The VRSQ is an adaptation of the Simulator Sickness Questionnaire (SSQ) for use in virtual environments.</description>

    <measure>Change in Motion Sensitivity Assessment Questionnaire (MSAQ) Overall Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Visit 1 (Week 1) and Visit 4 (Week 3)</time_frame>
    <description>The MSAQ was designed to evaluate symptoms of visually-induced motion sickness in response to an optokinetic stimulus. Respondents use a 9-point scale to indicate how accurately 16 statements describe their experience viewing the stimulus. Statements include, &quot;I felt sick to my stomach&quot; and &quot;I felt dizzy.&quot; The overall score is obtained by calculating the percentage of total points scored: (sum of points from all items/144) Ã— 100. Higher scores indicate greater severity of symptoms. The MSAQ will be administered on paper following exposure to an optokinetic stimulus while standing and wearing the virtual reality headset. Participants will rate their symptoms on the MSAQ after 1 minute of exposure to an annulus rotating clockwise and counterclockwise at 30 degrees per second. Participants will be permitted to rest with the headset off between the clockwise and counterclockwise trials until symptoms have completely resolved. The reliability and validity of the MSAQ have been established.</description>

    <measure>Change in Visual Vertical Analogue Scale (VVAS) Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Visit 1 (Week 1), Visit 2 (Week 2), Visit 3 (Week 3), and Visit 4 (Week 3)</time_frame>
    <description>The VVAS consists of nine scales, each relating to a specific symptom-provoking situation. A revision of the VVAS by researchers at the University of Pittsburgh is in press. The revised version consists of 15 scales. The revised version will be administered in this study. In the revised version of the VVAS, each scale has two anchors, 0 representing no dizziness and 10 representing extreme dizziness or activity avoidance. The distance from the zero anchor to the respondent's marking is measured electronically. Items that are not applicable to the individual's life may be completed as imagined. Internal consistency and validity of the VVAS have been established. A total score is calculated to determine the severity of visual vertigo by summing all items, dividing by the number of answered items, and then multiplying by 10. The maximum score is 100 with higher scores indicating greater symptom severity.</description>

    <measure>Change in Vision-related Dizziness Questionnaire (VRDQ) Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Visit 1 (Week 1), Visit 2 (Week 2), Visit 3 (Week 3), and Visit 4 (Week 3)</time_frame>
    <description>The VRDQ is used to quantify vision-related dizziness. This outcome measure consists of 25 questions comprising two subscales [frequency and severity of symptoms]. The maximum score for each sub-scale is 100 points. The total score is the average of both sub-scales. Higher scores represent greater frequency and severity of symptoms. Test-retest reliability for the VRDQ is well above the good performance level and convergent validity for the VRDQ was demonstrated with the Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI). Spearman correlation coefficients are 0.75 between the DHI and VRDQ frequency scale and 0.76 between the DHI and VRDQ severity scale.</description>

    <measure>Change in Rod and Disk Test (RDT) Mean Performance</measure>
    <time_frame>Visit 1 (Week 1), Visit 2 (Week 2), Visit 3 (Week 3), and Visit 4 (Week 3)</time_frame>
    <description>The image of an annulus comprised of a pseudorandomized pattern of dots will be presented in the virtual reality headset. The image of a rod is also presented within the central region of the annulus that is black. This image will be rotated at 30Â° per second in either a clockwise or counterclockwise direction around the participant's line of sight. A batch of rod angles will be predetermined. This assessment will be completed using an Oculus Rift and without reference to external visual cues. Only binocular testing will be completed. The average value for performance in each position will be used in data analysis. The mean of absolute value of the error in rod alignment measured in degrees for each body position tested will be used as the measurement variable for this outcome. Mean performance in this population is 15.1 (sd 8.4). Higher values indicate greater deviation of perceived vertical from earth vertical.</description>

    <measure>Change in Subjective Visual Vertical (SVV) Mean Performance</measure>
    <time_frame>Visit 1 (Week 1), Visit 2 (Week 2), Visit 3 (Week 3), and Visit 4 (Week 3)</time_frame>
    <description>An image of a rod will be shown in the central portion of the visual field. The surrounding virtual environment will be void. A batch of rod angles will be predetermined. This assessment will be completed using an Oculus Rift and without any reference to external visual cues. Only binocular testing will be completed. The average value for performance in each position will be used in data analysis. The mean of absolute value of the error in rod alignment measured in degrees for each body position tested will be used as the measurement variable for this outcome. Mean performance in this population is 0.39 (sd 0.8). Higher scores indicate subjective visual vertical alignment that is farther away from earth vertical.</description>

    <measure>Change in Rod and Frame Test (RFT) Mean Performance</measure>
    <time_frame>Visit 1 (Week 1), Visit 2 (Week 2), Visit 3 (Week 3), and Visit 4 (Week 3)</time_frame>
    <description>An image of a rod will be projected inside a tilted frame within the central portion of the visual field. The surrounding virtual environment will be void. The frame will be tilted by +/- 20Â° in the frontal plane. A batch of rod angles will be predetermined. This assessment will be completed using an Oculus Rift and without reference to external visual cues. Only binocular testing will be completed. The average value for performance in each position will be used in data analysis. The mean of absolute value of the error in rod alignment measured in degrees for each body position tested will be used as the measurement variable for this outcome. Mean performance in this population is 6.51 (sd 7.8). Higher values indicate greater deviations of perceived vertical from earth vertical.</description>

    <measure>Change in Multisensory Balance Evaluation (MBE) as measured by the Intersection Point Height</measure>
    <time_frame>Visit 1 (Week 1), Visit 2 (Week 2), Visit 3 (Week 3), and Visit 4 (Week 3)</time_frame>
    <description>This test is designed to assess balance during quiet standing in different sensory conditions. Participants perform one trial (lasting 50 seconds) of each condition. All trials are performed while standing on a force plate with the feet in a self-selected, comfortable position. The force plate samples center of pressure and direction of ground reaction force. The visual environment is controlled using an Oculus Rift. The surface conditions are either non-compliant or compliant. The frequency-dependent height of the Intersection Point (IP) of the ground reaction force is the main outcome. The behavior and shape of the IP curvature will be studied in each test trial. The IP curvature for certain conditions will be compared versus others in order to assess the impact of manipulating specific sensory inputs on the behavior of the IP. The height of the IP at a specific frequency represents how stable a person is during a given test trial. Lower IP height suggests greater stability.</description>

    <measure>Change in Semmes-Weinstein Monofilament Examination (SWME) Discrimination Threshold</measure>
    <time_frame>Visit 2 (Week 2) and Visit 3 (Week 2)</time_frame>
    <description>A SWME will be conducted at the pre-test 2 and post-test 1 assessments in order to determine if the sensory re-weighting training results in changes in sensitivity to light touch/deep pressure sensation on the soles of the feet. Lower SWME threshold indicate increased sensitivity to light touch. The sensitivity between 0.008 grams and 2.0 grams will be assessed.</description>

    <description>Adults with self-reported visually-induced dizziness will be recruited to help establish the feasibility and tolerability of the testing and training methods, as well as observe for any effects of the sensory re-weighting intervention. Tests involve assessing motion sickness, vision, somatosensation, balance, and perception of verticality. The treatment provided is designed to facilitate re-weighting of sensory feedback for orientation and balance. Participants will serve as their own controls.</description>

    <intervention_name>sensory re-weighting</intervention_name>
    <description>Participants will be supported in quiet standing by a safety harness and crisscrossing strap system. A cervical collar will be used to maintain consistent alignment between the head and trunk. A virtual reality headset is used to create a virtual environment in which visual stimuli will be presented. Three different body positions will be used during training: earth-vertical and clockwise and counterclockwise tilted 16Âº in the frontal plane. Sensory re-weighting will be driven by priming upregulation of somatosensory cues. In each training trial, participants must determine the direction of gravity and then indicate if the rod being displayed is aligned with gravity or if it needs to rotate clockwise or counterclockwise for that to be so. Participants will be instructed to pay attention to what they feel from their feet, legs, and gut during training and to use that pressure, stretch, movement, and muscle tension feedback to help them sense gravity.</description>
