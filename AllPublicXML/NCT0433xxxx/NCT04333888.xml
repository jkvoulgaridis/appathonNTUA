  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a proof-of-concept study that aims to test the additional value of adjuvant
      neurofeedback treatment for psychotherapy. Three sessions of real-time fMRI neurofeedback
      will be administered to N=22 patients with BPD while they receive residential Dialectical
      Behavior Therapy treatment. In addition, outcomes are assessed from a control group with same
      sample size who do not receive the treatment.

    <description>Mean successive squared differences (MSSD) of six-item negative affect scale measured via behavioural sampling using ecological momentary assessment (EMA) over four days. MSSD will be compared between baseline and post-treatment timepoints.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in emotion regulation</measure>
    <time_frame>Before treatment, immediately after treatment + follow-up measure (3 months)</time_frame>
    <description>Negative and neutral pictures are either presented with instruction to regulate or to respond naturally (view) for 12 s. BOLD response in the amygdala (and the rest of the brain) is measured and subjective ratings of regulation success are collected. Changes (between the time points) in differences of the two conditions (regulate vs. view) are measured for both: amygdala BOLD response and subjective ratings of regulation success.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in borderline symptomatology</measure>
    <time_frame>Before treatment, immediately after treatment + 2 follow-up measures (3 months, 6 months)</time_frame>
    <description>Facets of BPD are assessed with questionnaires, including impulsivity. Borderline Symptom List (BSL-23) score will be used for assesment of BPD symptoms. This scale has 23 items, each scored 0-4, and total score is mean item endorsement (sum of all items divided by 23). Higher scores indicate more symptom endorsement.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in resting state brain connectivity</measure>
    <time_frame>Before treatment, immediately after treatment + follow-up measure (3 months)</time_frame>
    <description>Patients get a 10 min brain scan (fMRI) without active task. Data are analysed to compare changes in intrinsic functional brain connectivity (BOLD activation of amygdala with other brain regions) during resting state before and after neurofeedback training.</description>
