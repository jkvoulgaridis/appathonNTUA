  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke patients have limited hand mobility post-stroke, thus inhibiting them from performing
      daily functional tasks independently, resulting in reduced quality of life. Current hand
      rehabilitation robotic devices are typically driven by rigid linkages/joints, which subject
      the fingers into a single plane of motion that is unnatural and uncomfortable. These devices
      belong to the class of continuous passive motion (CPM) devices that only promote hand
      range-of-motion, but do not require the patient to play an active role in performing the hand
      exercises. There is a strong need for a device that can resolve the lack of compliant
      robot-assisted hand motion and lack of intuitive user control in assistive and rehabilitation
      processes.

      This proposed research aims to fill the above-mentioned gaps for current hand rehabilitation
      devices by developing a soft robotic glove that provides compliant assistance to
      bidirectional hand motion, coupled with intuitive user control.

      In the short term, the robotic glove will likely enhance the patients' hand flexion-extension
      range of motion and improve the neuro-motor control of the hand.

      In the long term, the robotic glove will act as an adjunct to therapists, thereby raising
      productivity in the presence of growing manpower constraints and optimizing therapy time for
      the patients; this can potentially enhance recovery time and quality of life, as a result of
      improved hand mobility for common daily tasks.

      The investigators aim to develop a new bidirectional composite soft actuator that is capable
      of assisting in both hand flexion and extension. This new class of actuator will comprise of
      a flexion actuator component with its external bending patterns and dedicated pneumatic
      channel, and an embedded extension actuator component with its dedicated air-flow inlet. When
      pressurized air is introduced through the extension inlet, the extension actuator will
      inflate and stiffen, thereby assisting in hand extension. Moreover, when pressurized air is
      introduced through the flexion inlet, the flexion actuator will inflate and bend, thereby
      assisting in hand flexion.

      These bidirectional actuators will be embedded onto each finger segment of a fabric glove,
      and air inflow into each of the bidirectional actuators can be controlled via a pump-valve
      control system. The pump-valve control system comprises a microcontroller, onboard power
      source, transceiver, motor pump, and flexion and extension control valves. Once the
      microcontroller receives a command signal to adopt a specific hand posture, it will send the
      postural command to the motor pump and the necessary flexion/extension control valves,
      thereby actuating the corresponding bidirectional soft actuators to assist the user's hand
      into the desired hand posture.

      Aims:

      Aim 1: The bidirectional myoelectric soft robotic glove may provide intuitive user-controlled
      robot-assisted hand grasping postures to the human user for achieving functional tasks. With
      the help of the glove system, participants may be more capable of achieving active daily
      living tasks.

      Aim 2: The bidirectional myoelectric soft robotic glove may provide intuitive user-controlled
      robot-assisted hand grasping postures to the human user for rehabilitation purposes.

      Hypothesis:

      The central hypothesis is that a bidirectional myoelectric soft robotic glove will provide
      intuitive user-controlled robot-assisted hand grasping postures to the human user for
      achieving functional tasks more than no robot assistance.
