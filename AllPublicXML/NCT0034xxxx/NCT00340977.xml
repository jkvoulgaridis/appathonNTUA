  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This proposal describes a population-based case-control study of all Norwegian infants born
      with cleft lip or palate over a five-year period. The study will be jointly supported by the
      U.S. National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS), and the Norwegian National
      Institute of Public Health (SIFF) and Medical Birth Registry of Norway (MBR). Cases will be
      identified through the two surgery clinics that treat all clefts in Norway. Controls will be
      randomly selected from all live births through the MBR. Mothers will complete two
      selfadministered questionnaires; one regarding exposures before and during pregnancy, the
      other their diet during their early months of pregnancy. Biological specimens for DNA testing
      (blood samples, buccal swabs) will be collected from cases, controls and mothers in order to
      describe possible gene-environment interactions. With 750 cases and 1100 controls, this will
      be one of the largest and most complete field studies of facial clefting yet conducted.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        We expect to enroll about 150 infants with cleft lip or palate annually for five years (550
        with cleft lip with or without cleft palate, and 200 with cleft palate alone)

        Controls will be chosen randomly from all Norwegian live-births through the Medical Birth
        Registry.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        There will be no exclusion by race, sex or ethnic group.
