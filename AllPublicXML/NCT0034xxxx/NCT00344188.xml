    <textblock>
      This study will examine the natural history of Leishmanial infections and their treatments.
      It will provide an opportunity for NIAID staff to learn more about leishmaniasis and perhaps
      to improve diagnostic tests for these infections. Patients between 2 and 80 years of age with
      known or suspected leishmaniasis are eligible for this study.

      Participants will have routine blood tests and a biopsy to confirm leishmanial infection. The
      biopsy procedure will be determined by the type of infection local cutaneous leishmaniasis
      (LCL), mucocutaneous leishmaniasis (MCL) or visceral leishmaniasis (VL). CL will be confirmed
      with a punch biopsy, in which a cookie-cutter type razor is used to remove a small circular
      piece of skin tissue. MCL will be confirmed using a thin flexible tube inserted into the
      nose. This tube is used to examine the nose and upper airway and to remove a tissue sample,
      if an affected area is seen. VL will be confirmed with either a bone marrow or liver biopsy
      or a splenic aspirate. For these procedures, a small tissue sample is withdrawn through a
      needle placed in the hipbone, liver or spleen, respectively. Some patients may also have a
      skin test for leishmaniasis similar to tuberculin skin testing.

      Treatment and length of hospital stay are determined by the type of infection. CL may be
      treated with Pentostam, amphotericin, amphotericin B, itraconazole or ketoconazole; ML with
      amphotericin B, or encapsulated amphotericin; and VL with Pentostam or encapsulated
      amphotericin. Pentostam is infused daily for 18 to 28 doses, most as an outpatient. Blood is
      drawn 3 times a week for safety tests and an electrocardiogram is done 2 to 3 times a week to
      monitor heart rhythm. Amphotericin B is infused every day or every other day for about 30
      doses, all on an inpatient basis. Patients undergo hydration (infusion of a large amount of
      fluid) just before and immediately after each infusion to protect the kidneys. Blood is drawn
      every other day and urine samples are collected occasionally for routine urinalysis.
      Encapsulated amphotericin is infused every other day, on an outpatient basis. Blood is
      generally drawn every other day to every 2 days and urinalyses are done periodically.
      Itraconazole and ketoconazole are taken orally for at least 1 to 3 months, with blood drawn
      every 2 to 3 weeks.

      Patients may be asked to have photographs taken before, during and after treatment to
      document progress. They may also be asked to provide extra blood samples for research
      purposes, either through a vein in the arm or through apheresis, a method for collecting
      large numbers of cells. For apheresis, whole blood is collected through a needle in an arm
      vein and circulated through a machine that separates it into its components. The desired
      cells are then removed, and the rest of the blood is returned to the body, either through the
      same needle used to draw the blood or through a second needle in the other arm.

      Patients with cutaneous leishmaniasis will have a follow-up clinic visit 2 weeks to 3 months
      after treatment is completed. If there are no complications, their participation will end at
      that time. Patients with mucocutaneous leishmaniasis and visceral leishmaniasis will be
      followed every 3 to 6 months indefinitely for routine evaluations and re-treatment if the
      infection recurs.

      Patients admitted on this protocol will have, or be suspected of having, a Leishmania
      infection. The major objectives of the protocol are to diagnose and classify the Leishmania
      infection and to provide species-based therapy to study the natural history of the treated
      infection. As part of the standard evaluation of these patients, infecting parasite isolates
      will be obtained when possible and the host response before and after therapy will be
      assessed to address broader questions related to diagnosis, disease pathogenesis and response
      to therapy. Careful observations of the patients' clinical and immunologic responses to
      therapy will be made, as well as long-term follow-up of these changes. It is anticipated that
      the patients will receive optimal clinical care for their infections and that the specimens
      collected from them will prove to be valuable reagents for the laboratory studies of the host
      responses unique to leishmanial infections.
