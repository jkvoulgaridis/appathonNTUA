        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject has typical or atypical chest pain suspected of CAD and is referred for an
             elective coronary angiography.

          -  The subject must be scheduled to undergo a CATH procedure between 48 hours and 3 weeks
             post CCTA procedure.

          -  The subject must not undergo any cardiac interventional treatment between the 2
             procedures.

          -  The subject must have sinus rhythm with stable heart rate of ≤65 beats per minute
             (bpm) or if heart rate was &gt;65 bpm, the subject must agree to the use of
             beta-blocker(s) prior to the CT scan procedure to achieve stable heart rate of ≤65
             bpm.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject had an established diagnosis of CAD by a) previous CATH, b) prior
             myocardial infarction confirmed by ECG, or c) prior revascularization (balloon
             angioplasty, stent placement, or CABG).

          -  The subject had a known allergy to iodinated contrast agent, including but not limited
             to hives, anaphylactoid or cardiovascular reactions, laryngeal edema and bronchospasm.

          -  The subject had impaired renal function with a serum creatinine level of 1.7 mg/dL
             (150 μmol/L) or above.

          -  The subject had atrial fibrillation/flutter or any irregular heart rhythm considered
             by the investigator to interfere with temporal acquisition of cardiac CT images.

          -  The subject had a resting heart rate of &gt;100 bpm and/or a resting systolic blood
             pressure of &lt;100mm Hg.

          -  The subject had an artificial heart valve(s).

          -  The subject has had prior pacemaker or internal defibrillator lead implantation.

          -  The subject's resting heart rate was &gt;65 bpm and beta-blocker therapy was
             contraindicated.

          -  The subject had a contraindication to verapamil when beta-blocker therapy could not be
             administered. The subject had a contraindication to nitroglycerin.

          -  The subject had evidence of ongoing or active clinical instability.
