      This study will define the major genetic risk and protective factors for idiopathic
      inflammatory myopathies (IIM), a group of immune disorders affecting connective tissues such
      as muscles. It will also identify new environmental risk factors for IIM and identify immune
      responses in myositis and related diseases. There are many forms of IIMs, and the causes of
      these diseases are unknown. However, scientists suspect that they result when people with
      some genetic factors that predispose them-that is, put them at greater risk-are exposed to
      certain environmental triggers. Some of those triggers include food, drugs, biologics (such
      as a vaccine to prevent disease), medical devices and occupational exposures.

      Patients, including children under 18, who had a diagnosis of myositis, a related autoimmune
      disease, or a rheumatic disease, as well as their blood relatives, and control subjects who
      were in good health have already been recruited for this study.

      The evaluation consisted of one outpatient visit to the patient's doctor, who will obtain a
      medical history and conduct a physician examination. Patients spent 20 to 30 minutes to
      answer written questions. There was a blood collection of about 6 tablespoons. If there was a
      major change in patients' medical conditions, they were asked to return for a second
      outpatient evaluation to determine whether any of the blood tests or antibodies, which show
      an immune response, had changed. Blood samples collected will be used only for laboratory
      research studies. The samples have been identified by a code, and all other identifying
      information have been removed.

      During the study, researchers will explore possible environmental risk factors, including
      studies of infectious and non-infectious agents. They will analyze the blood for genetic
      markers and test for certain antibodies. Laboratory results will be evaluated as they relate
      to the signs, symptoms, and severity of patients' illnesses. That would help researchers to
      better understand patterns of the diseases and the outcomes for patients.

      This study will not have a direct benefit for patients. However, results from the study can
      be made available to patients' doctors for use in appropriate care. Also, it is hoped that
      information gained can help other people in the future.

    <textblock>
      Individuals who develop chronic harmful inflammation in association with self-reactive
      autoantibodies or T cells are said to have autoimmune diseases. The causes of these diseases
      are unknown but they are thought to occur in genetically susceptible individuals after
      exposure to selected environmental agents. There are many forms of these diseases, but we
      have been focusing on one of the rarest and most poorly-studied group of autoimmune
      disorders, known as the Idiopathic Inflammatory Myopathies (IIM). This heterogeneous group of
      diseases includes polymyositis, dermatomyositis and related disorders. This is a natural
      history protocol designed to continue our study of these diseases and begin the evaluation of
      related connective tissue disorders associated with environmental exposures. We plan to
      further delineate important groups of patients and familial cases, and obtain useful material
      for further investigations of the clinical presentations, etiology, pathogenesis, and
      immunologic abnormalities of autoimmune/connective tissue diseases. Clinical data and patient
      blood, urine and tissue specimens have been collected by referring physicians and sent to us.
      The blood samples have been separated into cells and plasma, frozen and then placed into cell
      and plasma banks. Often the diagnosis of an IIM can be confused with other illness (such as
      adult-onset dystrophies), and therefore, we have also included patients with other illnesses
      (who are referred with a preliminary diagnosis of an IIM or an unknown myopathy), including
      patients with other autoimmune diseases. In order to understand more fully the genetic risk
      factors for these diseases, family members of selected patients who have several blood
      relatives with autoimmune or connective tissue diseases will also be studied. In summary,
      this natural history protocol will attempt, through a series of hypothesis-testing and
      hypothesis-generating studies, to obtain new information regarding the clinical presentation,
      risk and protective factors, pathogeneses and prognostic features for myositis and related
      conditions.
