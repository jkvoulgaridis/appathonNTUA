      Little is known about the factors that cause biliary atresia nor the factors that influence
      disease progression. The purpose of this study is to collect the pertinent clinical
      information, genetic material and body fluid samples to enable investigators to address the
      following aims: To identify the gene or genes implicated in the etiology of BA; To identify
      polymorphisms that may be important in disease progression such as HLA polymorphisms; To
      characterize the natural history of the older, non-transplanted child with BA.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Little is known about the factors that cause biliary atresia nor the factors that influence
      disease progression. A variety of genetic, autoimmune and environmental influences have been
      hypothesized to be important. Most studies to date have focused on the neonate and young
      child with BA, yet the older surviving child with BA can provide important information about
      genetics, as well as, natural history.

      The purpose of this study is to collect the pertinent clinical information, genetic material
      and body fluid samples to enable investigators to address the following hypotheses:

      Hypothesis 1: A genetic defect is a likely causative factor for BA among children with BA and
      multiple congenital anomalies.

      Hypothesis 2: Autoimmune factors are likely to contribute to disease progression or
      acquisition and can be identified by correlating HLA among children with BA to healthy
      controls and by comparison of those who develop early complications including, variceal
      bleed, ascites, and growth failure compared to those who do not.

      Hypothesis 3a: Sentinel events such as variceal bleeding, ascites and growth failure are
      earlier predictors of death or need for liver transplantation than the pediatric end-stage
      liver disease score (PELD).

      Hypothesis 3b: Health related quality of life will be impaired compared to healthy age
      matched children and relate to severity of illness.

      Hypothesis 3c: Growth failure as measured by anthropometrics and nutritional supplementation
      will be predictive of onset of sentinel events (ascites, variceal bleed, death, and
      transplant) in the following 24 months.

      This study will be performed by the Childhood Liver Disease Research Network (ChiLDReN), a
      National Institute of Diabetes &amp; Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) funded network.

        Recruitment will be open to any eligible subject. The method of contacting the study
        subjects will conform to local IRB guidelines, but in general: the parents or guardians of
        all eligible subjects at each ChiLDReN center, or the subjects themselves if 18 years of
        age or older, will be approached to participate. New patients who are not participating in
        ChiLDReN study PROBE may be approached for study participation, but will not be eligible
        for enrollment until 6 months of age.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Participants need to have a confirmed diagnosis of BA determined by chart review
             including review of pertinent diagnostic biopsy reports, radiologic reports and
             surgical reports (if surgery was performed).

          2. Participants need to be &gt;6 months of age up to and equal to the age of 20
             (participants enrolled at 20 years of age will have one visit).

          3. Participants either have their native liver or have a confirmed liver transplantation.

          4. Parent, guardian or participant (if 18 years of age or older) is willing to provide
             informed consent and, when appropriate, the participant is willing to assent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Currently participating in the ChiLDReN study PROBE

          2. Inability to confirm original diagnostic evaluation of biliary atresia

          3. Inability or unwillingness of family or participant to participate in all scheduled
             visits.
