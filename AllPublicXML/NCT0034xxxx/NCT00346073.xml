  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      GSK Biologicals' dTpa vaccine has recently been approved by the US Food and Drug
      Administration (FDA) for booster vaccination of adolescents aged 10 to 18 years. The ACIP has
      recently issued provisional recommendations for universal adult Tdap vaccination. The current
      study will provide pivotal data in support of extending the age range for Boostrix vaccine to
      include adults 19-64 years of age.
