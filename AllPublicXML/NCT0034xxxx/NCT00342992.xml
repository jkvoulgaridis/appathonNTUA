  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The project is a passive follow-up of the Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene Cancer Prevention
      (ATBC) Study cohort. Originally, this was a large, randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled, 2x2 factorial primary prevention trial testing the effects of
      alpha-tocopherol and beta-carotene supplementation on cancer incidence and mortality. The
      study was conducted in Finland as a collaboration between the U.S. National Cancer Institute
      (NCI) and the National Public Health Institute of Finland. NCI has maintained passive
      surveillance of the cohort through Finnish national registries, including the cancer
      registry.

      The primary purpose of the ATBC cohort follow-up is to use the existing risk factor data and
      biological specimens (i.e., serum, whole blood, DNA, red blood cells, and toenails) to test
      hypotheses relevant to cancer etiology, survival, early detection, and prevention. These data
      and biospecimens continue to provide an invaluable resource for the study of biochemical,
      nutritional, genetic, and molecular hypotheses. These analyses are made all the more
      informative and powerful by the addition of cases identified annually during the follow-up
      period, and the research benefits from a longer pre-diagnosis period (now over 30 years).

  <detailed_description>

      The ATBC study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, primary prevention trial
      to determine whether daily supplementation with a-tocopherol, beta-carotene, or both would
      reduce the incidence of lung or other cancers among male smokers. Between 1985 and 1988,
      29,133 men ages 50 to 69 years, who smoked at least five cigarettes per day, were recruited
      from southwestern Finland. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either a-tocopherol
      as dl-a-tocopheryl acetate (50 mg/day), beta-carotene as all-trans-beta-carotene (20 mg/day),
      both supplements, or placebo capsules for 5-8 years (median 6.1 years) through April 30,
      1993. Post-intervention follow-up has continued through the Finnish Cancer Registry and other
      national registries, and epidemiological analyses continue to be conducted.
