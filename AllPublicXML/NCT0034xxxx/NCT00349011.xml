  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of a personalized menopausal therapy
      risk assessment and genetic counseling intervention on knowledge, risk perception, and
      decision-making in healthy women at increased risk for breast cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Women with a family history of breast cancer have several menopausal therapy options,
      including tamoxifen, hormone therapy, alternative medications, or no treatment. This complex
      decision should be based on each womanâ€™s risk to develop breast cancer, menopausal symptoms,
      preferences, and risks for other conditions. Current models in use for menopausal therapy
      counseling do not include pedigree analysis, personalized risk assessment or genetic testing
      in this process. The purpose of this multi-center study is to determine the effects of a
      personalized risk assessment and genetic counseling intervention on knowledge, risk
      perception, and decision-making in a group of healthy women who had a first-degree relative
      with breast cancer. Intervention participants will be given a personalized risk assessment
      for breast cancer, heart disease, osteoporosis, and uterine cancer based on family history
      and personal health data.
