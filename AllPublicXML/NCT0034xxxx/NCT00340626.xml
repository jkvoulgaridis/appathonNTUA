  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In a collaborative effort with the IBN AL-NAFEES Hospital (Damascus, Syrian Arab Republic),
      individuals from multiplex families determined to have hereditary oral clefts will be
      studied. The purpose of this study is to identify the gene(s) involved in heritable oral
      clefts by linkage analysis and gene mapping strategies. Characterization of genes involved in
      inherited oral clefts could provide important insight into the inheritance and pathogenesis
      of this disease.

      In a collaborative effort with the IBN AL-NAFEES Hospital (Damascus, Syrian Arab Republic),
      individuals from multiplex families determined to have hereditary oral clefts will be
      studied. Healthy Syrian individuals with no family history of oral clefts will also be
      enrolled as a comparison group. The purpose of this study is to identify the gene(s) involved
      in heritable oral clefts by linkage analysis and gene mapping strategies. Characterization of
      genes involved in inherited oral clefts could provide important insight into the inheritance
      and pathogenesis of this disease. All families are enrolled into the study by our Syrian
      collaborators (under Ethics Board approval from the IBN AL-NAFEES Hospital) and only coded
      phenotype data and coded biospecimens are ever received at the NIH.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Enrollment in this study will be limited to individuals with non-syndromic unilateral or
        bilateral cleft lip with or without cleft palate and their unaffected relatives, from
        families which meet the following criteria:

          1. A cluster of 2 or more affected first degree relatives, such as a parent and two
             offspring or 2 siblings, or

          2. The occurrence of oral clefts in each of 2 generations in either the proband's
             paternal or maternal lineages.

          3. The occurrence of oral clefts in 2 or more cousins (up to second cousins)

        The subject population is comprised of probands and their families previously examined at
        the IBN-AL NAFEES Hospital or at other hospitals and clinics in the Syrian Arab Republic as
        well

        as healthy controls from the same population. Consent documents are in Arabic language for
        non-English-speaking subjects

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Individuals unable to provide consent, except for cases who are children and mentally
        impaired persons with consenting parents or guardians.
