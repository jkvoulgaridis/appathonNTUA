  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to better understand the immune response to the
      Adjuvanted Subunit flu vaccine (MF59) and the High Dose flu vaccine (HDFlu) in people 65
      years of age and older. The research team will be studying why immune response diminishes as
      people get older in both men and women. The ultimate goal is to understand how flu immunity
      develops after vaccination. This information may lead to the development of more effective
      flu vaccines in the future.

      The overall goal of this proposal is to determine how vaccine type, sex, and gene expression
      influence both innate and T helper cell immune responses using systems biology and
      bioinformatics as tools to comprehensively assess the human transcriptome. We will evaluate
      sex-dependent immune responses to two unique influenza vaccines in a population of older
      adults; the recently FDA-licensed MF59-adjuvanted influenza subunit vaccine and the high-dose
      split virion influenza virus vaccine. The influence of sex on immune response to vaccination
      has been observed across multiple vaccines (including standard dose influenza vaccines, but
      the mechanisms are unknown, it affects all age groups regardless of hormonal status, and
      existing studies focus almost exclusively on humoral immune responses. Relatively little is
      known about the effect of sex on innate and T helper responses following vaccination and we
      are unaware of any studies evaluating the effect of sex on immune responses to adjuvanted
      influenza vaccine. The presence of adjuvant (MF59Flu) or higher antigen (Ag) dose leads to
      greater immunogenicity through mechanisms that have not been fully deciphered and are likely
      to be different. Further, a direct com-arison of innate and T helper immune responses between
      adjuvanted and high dose influenza vaccines has not been reported.

      The study design will include 200 generally healthy individuals (ages ≥65) who meet all
      inclusion criteria. 100 subjects will receive each vaccine with equal sex representation in
      each subgroup (a factorial design for sex by vaccine type). Subjects will undergo
      venipuncture for blood samples (~100 mL each, sufficient for the proposed assays) before
      vaccination and at three timepoints after vaccination (Day 1, Day 8, Day 28).

      The clinical characterization of our study subjects will include demographic information,
      height, weight, BMI, waist circumference, medications, and medical conditions that do not
      meet exclusion criteria (see Protection of Human Subjects). We will also quantify blood
      leukocyte populations (CBC, WBC differential).

      Immunosenescence and cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection can affect influenza vaccine-induced
      immune responses. We will evaluate whether CMV seropositivity or other measures of
      immunosenescence are associated with immune response and whether they interact with vaccine
      type/sex.

      We will monitor/characterize transcriptional changes (mRNA and miRNA) as well as measures of
      immune function (cytokine secretion, leukocyte surface phenotype, hemagglutination inhibiting
      antibody titer, and memory B cell ELISPOT) at each time point.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female adults ages 18-40 or of 65 and or older at the time of enrollment

          -  Eligible to receive Fluad® (MF59Flu) or Fluzone® (HDFlu) if age 65 or older

          -  No history of anaphylactic reaction to gelatin, neomycin, or other vaccine component

          -  Not pregnant

          -  No immunosuppression or immunodeficiency

          -  No acute illness at time of vaccination

          -  Determined by medical history and clinical judgment to be eligible for the study, by
             being generally healthy, with no autoimmune or immunosuppressive conditions and having
             stable current medical conditions (subjects with preexisting stable disease, defined
             as disease not requiring significant change in therapy or hospitalization for
             worsening disease 12 weeks before receipt of study vaccine, will be eligible. A change
             in dose or therapy within a category (e.g., change from one nonsteroidal
             anti-inflammatory drug to another) is allowed. A change to a new therapy category
             (e.g., surgery or addition of a new pharmacological class) is only allowed if it is
             not caused by worsening disease. A change to a new therapy category caused by
             worsening disease is considered significant and therefore ineligible for enrollment.

          -  Patients with diabetes mellitus are eligible for inclusion if they have had a
             hemoglobin A1c measurement of &lt;8.0 within the past 6 months prior to enrollment. These
             hemoglobin A1c measurements are recommended at least twice yearly by the American
             Diabetes Association (ADA), and the target levels here are representative of the goals
             of the ADA. These hemoglobin A1c levels will ensure that these participants have good
             glycemic control. (American Diabetes Association. American Diabetes Association

             for treatment of an acute illness, subjects will be included if corticosteroid therapy
             (inhaled, intranasal, and intra-articular corticosteroid therapy is permitted) has
             been discontinued for at least 30 days.

             with or without dialysis, clinically unstable cardiac disease, or any other disorder
             that, in the investigator's opinion, precludes the subject from participating in the
             study. Diabetic patients will be excluded if they do not have a hemoglobin A1c
             measurement within the past 6 months or if they had a hemoglobin A1c measurement of an
             A1c &gt;8.0
