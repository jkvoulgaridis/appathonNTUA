  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be a dual-arm prospective longitudinal cohort study for patients with brain
      metastases, at least one of which is appropriate for radiotherapy, to explore brain and
      cognitive changes following SRS or WBRT and evaluate the feasibility of a novel MRI protocol
      to identify potential radiological biomarkers of NCF decline.

      Patients diagnosed with brain mets will be assigned to either Arm A or Arm B, depending on
      their treatment plan. Patients in Arm A will be treated with SRS. Patients in Arm B will be
      treated with WBRT.

      Patients' neurocognitive function will be assessed before their radiation treatment and
      followed up for 2 years post treatment.

    <measure>Symptomatic Radiation Toxicity</measure>
    <time_frame>3-24 months</time_frame>

  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Local Failure</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Local failure will be defined as one of the following (follow-up MRI or CT brain scans will be compared to the prior MRI or CT brain scan): Increase of &gt; 25% in the size of any lesion or a new, non- contiguous lesion developed outside the radiosurgical bed (in the brain or meninges). Radionecrosis will not be considered tumor progression.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Distant Failure</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Distant disease is considered to be new metastatic lesions in the brain or outside the brain following WBRT and SRS.</description>

    <measure>Survival</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 24 months</time_frame>

    <description>Patients in Arm A will be treated with stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) which is a modern method of treating brain lesions that delivers a high amount of radiation to a small volume of the brain affected by a tumour; and is the standard of care for patients with a limited number of brain metastases.</description>

    <description>Patients in Arm B will be treated with whole brain radiotherapy, due to the number of lesions in their brain.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with brain metastases will be included in this study. Patients with known
             malignancies but without brain metastases, or patients with primary brain tumors are
             not eligible for enrollment.

          -  MRI confirmed 1-10 lesions. Each lesion must not be intended for resection.

          -  No prior radiation therapy for brain tumours.

          -  For patients enrolled to arm B, ability to tolerate RespirAct. Based on studies in
             patients with severe cerebrovascular disease, an 8 - 16% drop-out rate at the time of
             the first exposure to RespirAct CVR testing is expected [9]. The fourth generation of
             this device has been associated with increased tolerability secondary to elimination
             of a physical rebreathing circuit replaced by a digital re-breath analog. This
             improvement is expected to achieve a drop-out rate significantly below 10%.

          -  Patients must have a GPA greater than or equal to 1.0.

          -  Patients must be able to provide informed consent. Patient consent must be
             appropriately obtained in accordance with applicable local and regulatory
             requirements. Each patient must sign a consent form prior to enrollment in the trial
             to document their willingness to participate.

          -  Patients must have sufficient fluency in English and sufficient motor and visual
             functioning (corrected or assisted as required) to complete the NCF-A battery.

          -  Patients must be accessible for treatment, AE assessment and follow- up.

          -  Limit to KPS ≥ 70 for patients in arm B; no limit for arm A

          -  Women/men of childbearing potential must have agreed to use a highly effective
             contraceptive. Women of childbearing potential will have a pregnancy test to determine
             eligibility.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Treatment plan respecting normal tissue tolerances using dose fractionation specified
             within the protocol cannot be achieved.

          -  Pregnant patients will be excluded from this study.

          -  Prior cranial radiotherapy

          -  Inability to complete MRI with contrast of the head, or a known allergy to gadolinium

          -  Metastatic germ cell tumor, small cell carcinoma, or lymphoma or any primary brain
             tumor.

          -  Patients with known malignancies but without brain metastases.

          -  Image Findings

               -  Widespread definitive leptomeningeal metastasis

               -  A brain metastasis that is located ≤ 2 mm of the optic chiasm

               -  Evidence of midline shift

               -  Fourth ventricular narrowing, concerning for hydrocephalus

          -  Patients who have undergone surgical resection of brain tumor are not eligible for
             enrollment.
