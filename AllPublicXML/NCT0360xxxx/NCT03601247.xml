      To determine whether silicone gel is effective at preventing or minimizing scar formation
      after eyelid surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Upper eyelid blepharoplasty or ptosis repair is performed when the upper eyelid becomes
      droopy, which often occurs as a natural part of the aging process. The droopiness of the
      upper eyelids decreases the ability to see objects in their peripheral vision, causing
      functional deficits. Additionally, the droopiness can be a cosmetic concern for many. The
      most effective treatment option is blepharoplasty or ptosis repair.

      During routine pre-operative counseling, many patients note a fear of prominent facial
      scarring. Different techniques have been described in the literature to minimize scarring,
      from steroid creams to injections to laser therapy; however, there is currently no consensus
      for long-term management of post-surgical eyelid scars. Specifically, there is no study
      examining the efficacy of topical silicone gel on eyelid scars, although a few studies have
      examined its efficacy on other facial scars. Silicone is proposed to aid in healing by
      regulating fibroblast production, reducing collagen production, and modifying expression of
      growth factors.

      The investigator's study is designed to determine whether topical silicone may prevent
      significant post-operative eyelid scar formation. It may help clarify whether there is a safe
      and effective topical treatment for patients undergoing eyelid surgery for whom scarring or
      cosmesis is a concern. It is the first study of silicone gel on the eyelid and is also
      prospective, randomized, and double blinded.

    <description>Patients who have consented to the study will receive two tubes labeled only &quot;left&quot; and &quot;right&quot;, corresponding to the side of the face to which the tube contents will be applied. One tube will contain silicone gel and the other tube will contain aquaphor. Neither the patient nor the surgeon will know what side will receive which treatment. These tubes will be given to patients at post-operative week 1 visit. Patients will be instructed to rub the solution into their eyelid incisions gently with their fingers for 2-3 minutes twice a day</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients will be included if they have met the criteria for undergoing upper eyelid
             ptosis repair or blepharoplasty. This means they have droopiness of the upper eyelids
             that is visually significant and limiting the patient's visual field.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients will be excluded if they require additional upper eyelid surgery.
