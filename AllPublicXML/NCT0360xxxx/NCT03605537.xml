  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to find out how well drug-eluting stents work as part of treatment for choanal
      atresia repair. Participants will be receiving surgical choanal atresia repair; half will get
      a drug-eluting stent placed, the other half will not.

      Objective: To determine the utility of mometasone eluting stents in the treatment of choanal
      atresia.

      Setting: Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC), Division of Pediatric
      Otolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery

      Study Design: Randomized, single blind control trial

      Methods: This study will be a randomized, prospective single-blinded control trial. Inclusion
      criteria will include all subjects less than 11 years of age who are diagnosed with either
      unilateral or bilateral choanal atresia. Following enrollment, the patients will be
      randomized to either a control arm (no stent) versus an intervention arm (placement of drug
      eluting stent). Subjects will then undergo surgical repair of the choanal atresia with either
      no stent or a drug eluting stent placed. Multiple postoperative nasal endoscopies will be
      performed to assess size which will be reviewed and graded by two independent reviewers.

      Analysis: Descriptive statistical analysis and multivariate analysis will be performed.

    <description>Once photodocumentation from followup visits is collected, the images will be collected by a member of the team and given to two independent expert blinded reviewers for assessment of the size of the posterior nasal cavity. The picture will be obtained from the same anatomical position for each scope (the posterior portion of the inferior turbinate) and compared to the picture immediately after surgery of the posterior nasal cavity to assess any changes in size. Reviewers will assess the size of the posterior nasal cavity in each subsequent scope and categorize subjects based on the following sizes (0-50%, 51-75%, 76-100%).</description>

    <description>Subjects will undergo repair of the choanal atresia in the operating room with a drug eluting stent placed at the end of the surgical procedure. They will return to the operating room in 3-5 weeks for repeat nasal endoscopy with possible balloon dilation, which is standard of care within our institution. At this time in the operating room the intervention arm will have the stent removed. Following removal of the stent, photodocumentation of the posterior nasal cavity and nasopharynx will take place to assess the size (standard of care).
Subjects will then follow up and undergo a bedside or outpatient nasal endoscopy and nasopharyngoscopy (standard of care) at the following approximate intervals 1 month, 6 months, 12 months (these are not exact time periods as clinic scheduling can sometimes be 2-3 months on either side of these time stamps).</description>
