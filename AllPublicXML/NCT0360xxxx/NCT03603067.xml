  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate the change of psychological status before and after
      surgery in monophthalmic patients who receive the ocular surgery in eye with better vision.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Monophthalmos means the best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of the worse eye is less than
      0.05 or the central visual field (CFOV) is less than 5°. The ocular surgery of the better eye
      in monophthalmic patients is of high risk. On the one hand the surgical failure will result
      in the patient falling into permanent darkness. On the other hand the monophthalmic patient
      may have the same disease in both two eyes such as high axial myopia, uveitis and glaucoma,
      which will increase the surgical risk. There is still no consensus on whether it is necessary
      to take risks to perform this kind of operation. In this study we will evaluate the change of
      psychological status before and after surgery in monophthalmic patients who receive the
      ocular surgery in eye with better vision. The necessity of the ocular surgery in
      monophthalmic patients will be evaluated from the point of social psychology.

    <description>Hamilton anxiety scale（HAMA）will be filled in by each patient and the final score will be recorded. The total score ranges from 0-56. A score less than 7 means no symptom of anxiety. A score between 7 to 14 means possible anxiety. A score between 14-21 means mild anxiety. A score between 21-29 means moderate anxiety. A score more than 29 means severe symptom of anxiety.</description>

A score less than 8 means no symptom of depression. A score between 8 to 35 means mild or moderate depression. A score more than 35 means severe symptom of depression.</description>
