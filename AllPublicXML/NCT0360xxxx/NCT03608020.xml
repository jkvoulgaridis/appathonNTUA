  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This protocol is for a lead-in safety study of 5 patients followed by a randomized Phase 2
      clinical trial of BMX-001, a new class of pharmaceutical, in 64 patients with multiple brain
      metastases (MBM) undergoing whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT). Preliminary studies have
      demonstrated that BMX-001 provides protection of normal tissues from radiation-induced injury
      and augments tumor growth inhibition.

      This protocol is for a Phase 1 safety lead-in clinical trial of BMX-001 in combination with
      WBRT in 5 patients with MBM. Demonstrating safety of the selected MTD of BMX-001 in patients
      with MBM undergoing standard protocol WBRT will be the &quot;go/no-go&quot; criteria for proceeding to
      Phase 2.

      Phase 2 is a randomized open-label Phase 2 clinical trial of 64 patients with MBM, half
      receiving BMX-001 in combination with WBRT and half receiving WBRT alone.

      Subjects are treated with BMX-001 for a total of 19 days, during which time they receive
      radiation therapy. Following completion of radiation therapy, subjects will be followed for
      an additional one year.

    <measure>Assess safety and tolerability of WBRT + BMX-001 through proportion of patients who experience grade 4 or 5 study drug related adverse events.</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>AEs will be assessed according to the CTCAE version 5.0. If CTCAE grading does not exist for an AE, the severity of the AE will be graded as mild (1), moderate (2), severe (3), life-threatening (4), or fatal (5). Initially 5 patients will be accrued and treated with WBRT + BMX-001 as a lead-in safety phase. Enrollment to the randomized phase of the study will not proceed if patients in the safety lead-in phase experience the following:
Two or more patients are unable to complete radiation therapy (RT) due to toxicity related to BMX-001 (alone or in combination with RT.
Two or more patients experience delay in starting RT due to toxicity related to BMX-001 (alone or in combination with RT).
If any patient experiences a grade 4 or 5 BMX-001-related adverse event within Arm A (WBRT + BMX-001), accrual will be suspended and the experience of the patient will be carefully reviewed by the clinical team and the study's DSMB.</description>

    <description>Subjects will complete three standardized tests (Hopkins Verbal Learning Test - Revised, Trail Making Test A&amp;B, and Controlled Oral Word Association test) at baseline, 1 month after completion of WBRT and every 3 months after completion of WBRT.
