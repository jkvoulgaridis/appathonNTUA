      Open-label, Phase I-II, first-in-human (FIH) study for A166 monotherapy in HER2-expressing or
      amplified patients who progressed on or did not respond to available standard therapies.
      Patients must have documented HER2 expression or amplification. The patient must have
      exhausted available standard therapies. Patients will receive study drug as a single IV
      infusion. Cycles will continue until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, Phase I-II, first-in-human (FIH) study for A166 as monotherapy in
      HER2-expressing patients who progressed on or did not respond to available standard
      therapies. Patients enrolled in this Phase III study must have documented HER2 positivity
      defined as positive on in situ hybridization (ISH) or next-generation sequencing (NGS) or
      HER2 expression, defined as at least 1+ by validated immunohistochemistry (IHC) test. The
      patient must be, in the judgment of the investigator, an appropriate candidate for
      experimental therapy after available standard therapies have ceased to provide clinical
      benefit for their disease. Patients will receive study drug as a single IV infusion at the
      prescribed dose level in each treatment cycle. Cycles will continue until disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity. The study is divided into 2 parts (Phase I and Phase II).
