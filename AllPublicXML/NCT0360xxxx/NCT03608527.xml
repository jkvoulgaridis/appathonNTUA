  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Motor learning can induce significant changes in the human brain through neural plasticity
      processes, which play a crucial role in the brain functional reorganization in response to
      external stimuli and/or to pathological conditions. For example, people with multiple
      sclerosis present motor deficits often associated with cerebral activity alteration. However,
      whether these brain activation changes contribute to or protect against motor performance
      deficits still needs to be determined.

      Moreover, rehabilitation protocols could be designed to obtain efficient brain adaptation to
      preserve patients' outcome, but consistent data on the real efficacy of rehabilitative
      procedures are lacking, in particular concerning the rehabilitation effect on brain networks.

      Therefore, this project focuses on the degree to which imaging measures of functional brain
      activity can give new hints on the effects of motor rehabilitative protocols in multiple
      sclerosis patients' performance. Particularly, the investigator's aim is to investigate the
      effects of upper limb rehabilitation, focused on hand motor function, and the correlation
      between motor performance and functional magnetic resonance data.

    <measure>Score obtained at the Action Research Arm Test (ARAT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Action Research Arm Test is an observational measure used to assess upper extremity performance (coordination, dexterity and functioning). The scale ranges from 0 to 57, with higher scores indicating better outcomes. Items are categorized into four subscales: grasp (score 0-18) , grip (0-12), pinch (0-18) and gross movement (0-9) which are arranged in order of decreasing difficulty, with the most difficult task examined first, followed by the least difficult task.</description>

    <description>Exercises for neuromuscular control to improve proprioceptive sensibility, muscle strength, stability and coordination of the upper limbs, mainly including task-oriented movements with the goal to improve activities of daily living. Both proximal and distal muscles are involved, in actions such as grasping wooden cubes of different sizes, pinching, reaching targets displayed in front of the patient, and doing patchwork or paper mandala.</description>
