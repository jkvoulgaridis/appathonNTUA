  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The SurePathTM has been approved by the FDA since 1997. Currently, the SurePathTM is used for
      endometrial cells, body fluids, bronchoscopy aspirates, and thyroid fine needle aspirates.
      There is an advantage that the denaturation is small, the density of the cells is uniform,
      and the read area is small so that the read time can be shortened. Therefore, investigators
      plan to apply the SurePathTM test for pancreatic EUS-FNA specimens. Morphological comparative
      analysis is needed before completely replacing the existing classical smear test method. The
      aim of this study is to confirm that the SurePathTM is not inferior and is more accurate than
      the classical smear test.

    <description>If surgical treatment is performed after the examination, pathologic results of the surgical specimen and record will be checked whether it is malignancy or benign. If benign diagnosis is made by combining the results of SurePathTM and conventional smear test, the follow-up period is 6 months and the results of the 6-month follow-up imaging and additional biopsy are checked. Additional tests performed at this time are subject to the clinician's decision according to the clinical situation of each patient. The combined results make a final diagnosis and are compared between two groups.</description>
