    <textblock>
      This is an epidemiological study to investigate the etiology of radiographically-confirmed
      community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in adults aged ≥18 years. The main objective is to
      determine the proportion of which cases that is due to Streptococcus pneumoniae and the
      corresponding incidence and serotype distribution. The study will utilize a serotype-specific
      urinary antigen detection (UAD) assay.

        The Pneumonia Group: Adults ≥ 18 years of age who present to the emergency room with signs
        and symptoms of CAP and have radiographic evidence of pneumonia, as read by the clinical
        radiologist on duty will be identified and enrolled. As this is an active, prospective
        surveillance study, all eligible subjects should be screened for enrolment, including whose
        who are admitted during nights.

        The Control Group: Subjects will be sceened by the nurse at the orthopedic section of the
        emergency unit, since these patients are unlikely to have respiratory tract infections.
        Subjects will be chosen randomly and evenly over the whole duration of the study to get a
        representative control group.

             evidence of or documented concomitant infectious disease.

          -  Subjects residing in any long-term care facilities.

          -  Subjects with known bronchial obstruction or history of post-obstructive pneumonia.
             Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is permissible, provided there has no
             been an exacerbation with 3 months prior to enrollment.

          -  Subjects with primary lung cancer or another malignancy metastatic to the lungs.

             polysaccharide vaccine (PPV) administration within the past 30 days.
