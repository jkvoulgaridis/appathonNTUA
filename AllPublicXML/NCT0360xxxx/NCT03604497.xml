  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Over 4,800 American pedestrians die annually, a figure that is current increasing. One
      hypothesized reason for the increasing trend in pedestrian injuries and deaths is the role of
      mobile technology in distracting both pedestrians and drivers. The investigators propose to
      develop and then evaluate Bluetooth beacon technology as a means to alert and warn
      pedestrians when they are approaching dangerous intersections, reminding them to attend to
      the traffic environment and cross the street safely rather than engaging with mobile
      technology. One aspect of the research will involve a crossover research trial to evaluate
      efficacy of the program.

      Bluetooth beacons are very small (about the size of a dime) and inexpensive (~$20 range)
      devices that broadcast information unidirectionally (beacon to smartphone) within a closed
      proximal network. The investigators propose placing beacons at intersection corners (e.g., on
      signposts) frequently trafficked by urban college students. The beacons will transmit to an
      app installed on users' smartphones, signaling users to attend to their environment and cross
      the street safely. The app will be developed to be flexible based on user preferences; for
      research purposes, the app also will download data concerning the users' behavior while
      crossing the street. The crossover trial will evaluate the app with a sample of about 411
      young adults whose behavior is monitored for: (a) 3 weeks without the app being activated,
      (b) 3 weeks with the app activated, and then (c) 6 weeks without the app activated to assess
      retention of behavior. Throughout the 12 week period, the investigators will monitor user
      behavior at multiple intersections around campus, along with gathering self-report
      questionnaire perceptions and behavior at baseline and 12-week post-intervention assessments.
