  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The receptor tyrosine kinase AXL is a pathway that plays a crucial role in metastasis and
      chemoresistance. Overexpression of AXL has been associated with metastasis, recurrence, and
      chemoresistance in various cancer including ovarian cancer[16, 17]}. Targeting AXL is an
      attractive approach because it is overexpressed among patients with epithelial ovarian cancer
      and strongly associated with advanced stages, high grade cancer and shorter median survival
      time. AVB-S6-500 is a potent AXL inhibitor by binding to the ligand Gas6. Pre-clinical
      studies found that AVB-S6-500 was efficacious in ovarian cancer xenograft tumor models.
      Interventions which would increase the proportion of patients achieving pCR in this patient
      population could impact survival favorably and are of interest for study.

             radiation for localized cancer of the breast, head and neck, or skin is permitted,

             HIV infection or AIDS-related illness.

             study.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, or cardiac
