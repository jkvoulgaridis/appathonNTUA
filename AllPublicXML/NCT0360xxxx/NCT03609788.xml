    <textblock>
      The Pain Sensitivity Questionnaire(PSQ) is a self-rating measure for the assessment of pain
      sensitivity and has been developed by Dr. R. Ruscheweyh in Germany. It consists of 17 items
      rated from 0, not at all painful to 10, most severe pain imaginable. The validation of the
      Turkish version of PSQ is needed, in order to measure pain sensitivity among Turkish people.
