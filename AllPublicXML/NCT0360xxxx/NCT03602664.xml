      A questionaire specifically developed using in depth interviews with patients that has
      undergone surgery has been developed. This questionaire will be used for longterm follow in
      patients undergoing thoracic surgery. 200 patients will be asked to fill in this questionaire
      preoperatively as well as 3 and 12 months after surgery to assess symptomburden after surgery
      with specific aim to study postoperative pain as well as other physical, mental and cognitive
      problems that may affect the patient and their daily activities, health, return to work,
      family life and economy.
