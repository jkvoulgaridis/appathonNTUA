  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients who meet the inclusion criteria will be divided into two groups randomly: 'Kinect
      and exercise training' and 'exercise training'. The assessments will be made by a blind
      investigator four times, before and after the implementation of both protocols. The
      evaluations will take approximately 1 hour. The demographic information of the cases will be
      recorded. Designed as cross over study, two treatment protocols will be used in this study.
      The first protocol will be Xbox Kinect application plus exercise program, the second protocol
      will be only exercise program. At the beginning of the study, 2 groups will be allocated
      (Group A and Group B) randomly. For group A, the Xbox Kinect application plus exercise
      program will be applied for the first 8 weeks. For group B, only exercise program will be
      applied therapy first 8 weeks. All assessments will be repeated before and after each therapy
      period. Exercise program will consist of selected balance, coordination and walking exercises
      according to the individual needs of patients. . After 1 week washout period, patients will
      be included in the other group. All patients will take the treatment 1-hour, 3 days in a week
      for 8 weeks.

    <time_frame>change from baseline in dynamic balance component of postural control at 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Limits of stability test (LOS) assesses dynamic balance during the performance of specific tasks with visual feedback. It quantifies objectively the maximum distance a person can lean in a given direction without losing balance, stepping or reaching for assistance</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>International Cooperative Ataxia Rating Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>change from baseline in severity of ataxic symptoms at 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The International Cooperative Ataxia Rating Scale was developed to quantify the level of impairment as a result of ataxia as related to hereditary ataxias. The scale is scored out of 100 with 19 items and 4 subscales of postural and gait disturbances, limb ataxia, dysarthria, and oculomotor disorders. the maximum score is 100, the minimum score is 0 in this scale. Higher scores indicate higher levels of impairment. Postural and gait disturbances subscale has 7 items (0-34 points), limb ataxia subscale has 7 items (0-52 points), Dysarthria subscale has 2 items (0-4 points) and oculomotor disorders subscale has 3 items (0-6 points). The total score is obtained by summing the scores of the sub-scales.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Functional Reach Test (FRT)</measure>
    <time_frame>change from baseline in dynamic balance at 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>FRT is a quick and simple, single-task dynamic test that defines functional reach as &quot;the maximal distance one can reach forward beyond arm's length, while maintaining a fixed base of support in the standing position&quot;. It is a dynamic rather than a static test and measures a person's &quot;margin of stability&quot; as well as ability to maintain balance during a functional task.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>10 meter Walk Test (10mWT)</measure>
    <time_frame>change from baseline in gait speed at 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The 10mWTis a performance measure used to assess walking speed in metres per second over a short distance. It can be employed to determine functional mobility and gait.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Trunk Impairment Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>change from baseline in impairment of trunk at 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>It was developed to measure the motor impairment of the trunk through the evaluation of static and dynamic sitting balance as well as co-ordination of trunk movement. Three subscales: static sitting balance, dynamic sitting balance and coordination. There are 17 items in this scale and for each item, a 2-, 3- or 4-point ordinal scale is used. On the static and dynamic sitting balance and coordination subscales the maximal scores that can be attained are 7, 10 and 6 points. The total score for this scale ranges between 0 for a minimal performance to 23 for a perfect performance. The total score is obtained by summing the scores of the subscales.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Dynamic Gait Index (DGI)</measure>
    <time_frame>change from baseline in balance, fall risk and gait at 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The DGI was developed as a clinical tool to assess gait, balance and fall risk. It evaluates not only usual steady-state walking, but also walking during more challenging tasks. The DGI was developed as a clinical tool to assess gait, balance and fall risk. It evaluates not only usual steady-state walking, but also walking during more challenging tasks. 8 functional walking tests are performed by the subject and marked out of three according to the lowest category which applies. 24 is the total individual score possible. Scores of 19 or less have been related to increase incidence of falls.</description>
