  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Developmental Dysplasia of the Hip (DDH) is a common diagnosis in children that if untreated
      may lead to degeneration and arthritis of the hip joint at a young age. Ultrasound imaging is
      used to monitor progress of the developing hip joint during treatment. Initial data from our
      practice suggests that interim ultrasounds do not alter the course or outcome of treatment.
      Additionally, these ultrasounds add significant time to clinic visits and carry a substantial
      cost to the health care system. The goal of this study is to determine if limiting the number
      of ultrasounds during treatment results in the same outcomes while also evaluating the amount
      of time and money saved by omitting the ultrasounds.

    <description>The International Hip Dysplasia Institute (IHDI) grade will be measured from a radiograph of the pelvis. The score classifies hips into one of four groups based on the position of the proximal femoral metaphysis in relation to the acetabulum. The scores grade severity from Grade 1 as the mildest type to Grade 4 as the most severe type of hip dislocation.</description>

    <description>Children in the comprehensive ultrasound protocol group will follow the current standardized treatment protocol used at the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto, Canada. For children presenting with stable hip dysplasia, Pavlik harness (PH) treatment is initiated at the initial visit (week 0) and runs for a total of 12 weeks. Children return to clinic at weeks 2, 5, 8 and 12 for clinical and ultrasound examinations to ensure that the harness is fitting correctly, to screen for PH complications and to monitor acetabular development.</description>

    <description>Children in the limited ultrasound protocol group will receive the same treatment as described for the comprehensive ultrasound group above, except the ultrasound imaging conducted at weeks 2, 5 and 8 will be omitted. Children will still return to clinic at 2, 5, and 8 weeks for clinical examination, which includes the assessment of the Pavlik harness fit and screening for complications.</description>
