    <textblock>
      Levodopa-carbidopa intestinal gel (LCIG) infusion has demonstrated to improve motor
      fluctuations. The aim of this study is to assess the long-term safety and effectiveness of
      LCIG infusion in advanced Parkinson's disease (PD) patients with motor fluctuations and its
      effect in non-motor symptoms.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The following parameters were analyzed prior to LCIG treatment (at baseline), at months one,
      three, six and twelve, and every year afterwards over a 10-year period:

        -  Safety:

           - Adverse Events (AEs) related to percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) procedures
           and gastrostomy, infusion device, and treatment. Actions taken to solve them, and
           reasons for treatment discontinuation and withdrawal.

        -  Effectiveness:

             -  Motor fluctuations: Off time in hours recorded in Parkinson's Disease Diary©.

             -  Dyskinesia and other motor clinical aspects: evaluated with the Unified Parkinson's
                Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) part IV, UPDRS part II in On and Off, UPDRS part III
                in On and Off, Hoehn and Yahr (H&amp;Y) stage in On and Off and Schwab and England
                (S&amp;E) scale.

             -  Non-motor clinical aspects: cognitive function through Mini Mental State
                Examination (MMSE), and UPDRS part I, and relevant neuropsychiatric disorders.

      The parameters analyzed in the three prospective substudies carried out in three subsets of
      this population, are described below:

      Substudy 1 - Cognition and behavior assessment: Subgroup evaluated with a specific
      neuropsychological battery for assessment of cognition and behavior disorders prior to
      treatment (at baseline) and after 6 months of LCIG, by the same neuropsychologist at the same
      environmental conditions and in patients in phase On. The cognitive examination included:
      tests that assessed cognitive areas affected in PD according to the literature, psychometric
      tests with well-known parameters, tests that can be used in different types of populations
      (neurologic and psychiatric disorders, screening, etc.), tests suitable for a population with
      low educational and cultural level.

        -  Attentional function: Forward Digit Span test of Weschler Adult Intelligence Scale-Third
           Edition (WAIS III); Audio-verbal attentional capacity; and Stroop Color-Word test.

        -  Executive functions: Backward Digit Span of WAIS III; Audio-verbal working memory;
           Stroop-word and Stroop-color subtests; Response inhibition capacity; Controlled Oral
           Word-Association Test (FAS) of phonemic verbal fluency; Category Naming Test (Animals)
           of semantic verbal fluency.

        -  Visual-constructional visuospatial and visuoperceptual functions: Clock Drawing Test -
           (order and copy) -visual-constructional; Reading clocks - simple visuospatial ability;
           Luria test of overlapping figures - visual perceptive skills function.

        -  Memory and learning: Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT) - Short and long term
           audio-verbal memory and recognition.

        -  Language: Boston Naming Test (BNT) - Title by visual comparison.

        -  Motor functions: Luria motor sequences - Voluntary motor control, Motor coordination.

        -  Mood: Beck depression inventory (BDI)

        -  Behavior: Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) - Exploration of psychological and behavioral
           symptoms.

      Substudy 2 - Quality of sleep: Subgroup evaluated with Epworth scale, fatigue scale,
      Pittsburg quality of sleep questionnaire, Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and Hamilton
      anxiety scale, administered prior to treatment (at baseline) and 6 months after treatment. In
      addition, an overnight polysomnography (PSG) study was carried out at these timings.

      Substudy 3 - Health status, QoL and caregiver burden: Subgroup evaluated for up to 12 months,
      with the Spanish version of the 39-items quality of life questionnaire in PD (PDQ-39, 0-156),
      health status questionnaires (EQ-5D, range 5-15; and EQ-VAS range 0-100), global clinical
      impression scale (CGI, range 1-7), and caregiver burden questionnaire or Zarit Burden index
      (ZBI, range 0-100). Assessments were done prior to treatment (at baseline), 1 week, 3 months,
      6 months and 12 months after treatment.

        patients with advanced PD, responders to levodopa and with disabling motor fluctuations.
        that fulfilled the UK Brain Bank criteria (Hughes et al., 1992) for the diagnosis of
        idiopathic PD and were experiencing severe motor fluctuations, which were debilitating in
        daily life, despite receiving optimized conventional oral medications. Patients had been
        previously treated with oral levodopa combined with entacapone, rasagiline, dopamine
        agonists and/or apomorphine injections. Patients with atypical parkinsonian features were
        not included.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with Parkinson's Desease (PD), diagnosed according to diagnostic criteria of
             the Brain Bank of London - United Kingdom Parkinson's disease Society Brain Bank (Gibb
             and Lees 1988; Hughes, Daniel et al. 1992; Calne, Snow et al 1992 ; Daniel i Lees
             1993; Gelb, Oliver et al., 1999)

          2. Patients with PD who respond to levodopa, according to the doctor's opinion. When the
             values of clinical scales with levodopa treatment achieve a 20-30% improvement in the
             scores of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS). (UPDRS Off - UPDRS On)
             / UPDRS Off (Merello, Nouzeilles et al., 2002).

          3. Patients with PD with a recognized Off and On status (motor fluctuations), confirmed
             by Parkinson's Disease Diary © (Hauser, Friedlander et al., 2000) at the start of the
             study (newspapers corresponding to 3 days preceding the initial visit).

          4. Patients with PD in the advanced stage with severe motor fluctuations and dyskinesia
             induced by levodopa, poorly controlled with conventional optimized treatment.

          5. Patients with PD in the advanced stage with severe motor fluctuations and dyskinesia
             induced by levodopa, poorly controlled with other complex treatments (such as
             apomorphine infusion pumps or ECP).

          6. Patients with PD in the advanced state with serious motor fluctuations that present
             other non-motor complications such as depressive disorder, mild cognitive disorder,
             pulmonary control disorder, hallucinations and psychotic disorders and episodes of
             sleep, of moderate severity but , which excludes them from other alternatives to
             complex treatments, assisted with devices, second-line antiparkinsonians.

          7. Patients who are capable, they or their responsible carers and assistants, to learn
             the treatment with levodopa intestinal infusion and the use of their devices and to
             guarantee their proper functioning and correct handling.

          8. Patients with PD who have been indicated and who have agreed to begin treatment with
             levodopa intestinal infusion.

          9. Patients who have included and granted their consent to participate in the prospective
             study of habitual clinical practice and have signed an informed consent form to
             participate in the study.

         10. Women who have stopped menstruation naturally 24 months before, or are surgically
             sterile.

         11. Women of childbearing age may participate in the study provided they use a
             contraceptive method acceptable from a medical point of view (a stable dose of
             contraceptive drug for at least 3 months or barrier methods: intrauterine device,
             diaphragm, or combination of condoms and spermicide).

             Women who are not nursing or are pregnant. Although no human teratogenicity has been
             described with levodopa treatment, and carbidopa does not cross the placental barrier
             and does not prevent these patients from interrupting oral levodopa during pregnancy
             (Merchant, Cohen et al., 1994; Ball i Sagar 1995; von Graevenitz, Shulman et al. 1996;
             Nomoto, Kaseda et al., 1997); In the event that it is considered GILC will start after
             pregnancy.

         12. Patients attending the external consultation of the Neurology Service (Unit of
             Movement Disorders) at the Vall d'Hebron University Hospital.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients who do not suffer from an idiopathic PD. That is, in which the diagnosis of
             PD is unclear or there is suspicion that there are other Parkinson's syndromes, such
             as secondary parkinsonism (caused by drugs, toxins, infectious agents, vascular
             disease, trauma or brain neoplasms), Parkinson plus syndromes (e.g., multi systemic
             atrophy, progressive supranuclear paralysis, corticosteroidal degeneration) or other
             neurodegenerative diseases.

          2. Contraindications for the use of levodopa, such as narrow angle glaucoma,
             pheochromocytoma, Cushing syndrome or malignant melanoma history.

          3. Treatment with non-selective MAO inhibitors and selective MAO type A inhibitors. These
             treatments should not be administered simultaneously with levodopa intestinal
             infusion. They must be taken down at least two weeks before the start of the
             treatment.

          4. Psychiatric disorders, neurological or behavioral disorders that may interfere with
             the capacity of the subjects to give their informed consent to participate, or
             interfere with the performance or interpretation of the study; This category also
             includes serious hallucinations.

          5. Cognitive deficiencies or dementias, defined as a score &lt;24 in the Mini Mental State
             Exam (MMSE) (Folstein MF, Folstein et al., 1975) or that reach the criteria for the
             dementia of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Fourth Mental Disorders (DSM-IV)
             (American Psychiatric Association 2000). Except for a compelling indication that the
             fluctuations are seriously impaired and correct and successful treatment and
             supervision can be guaranteed.

          6. Abnormal laboratory data of clinical importance or any abnormal laboratory value that
             may interfere with the evaluation of safety according to the doctor.

          7. Current indications of haematological, autoimmune, endocrine, cardiovascular, renal or
             gastrointestinal disorders of clinical importance that could interfere with the
             participation of the subject in the study.

          8. Background or current suffering of gastrointestinal, liver, kidney or other pathology
             that may interfere with the absorption, distribution, metabolism or excretion of the
             study's drug or its evaluation, or interfere with the introduction of the probe
             system.

          9. Medical, laboratory or surgical problems that the doctor considers to be of clinical
             importance.

         10. Subjects in which the placement of a GEP-J probe is contraindicated for treatment with
             levodopa intestinal infusion or subjects considered to be of high risk for the GEP-J
             procedure, according to the evaluation performed by the gastroenterologist or the
             surgeon.

             The contraindications for the placement of the GEP-J probe include, among others, the
             following processes:

               1. Pathological changes in the gastric wall.

               2. Impossibility of joining the gastric wall and the abdominal wall.

               3. Blood clotting disorders: prothrombin activity less than 60% or INR of 1.4 and
                  platelet count less than 80,000; Anticoagulant or antiaggregant treatment is not
                  a contraindication but should be corrected and suspended before the procedure,
                  due to the risk of bleeding.

               4. Pneumonia or severe respiratory failure. It has been suggested that a forced
                  vital capacity of less than 1 liter and a pCO2 greater than 45 mmHg would be
                  associated with an unacceptable mortality with the GEP procedure.

               5. Ascites

               6. Peritonitis

               7. Acute pancreatitis.

               9. State of immunodeficiency, neutropenia, HIV, hypogammaglobulinemia, chronic
                  steroid therapy.

             Except in cases where the indication of treatment with levodopa intestinal infusion is
             manifestly necessary and will be resorted to the implantation of a surgical
             gastrostomy.

         11. Uncooperative attitude or reasonable probability that the subject does not comply with
             the treatment and the procedures of the study.

         12. Subjects that do not provide their informed consent in writing to participate in the
             study.
