    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, open-label study of SH-1028 with dose escalation and dose expansion
      cohorts in locally advanced or metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients who
      have progressed following prior therapy with an epidermal growth factor receptor(EGFR)
      tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) agent.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed to evaluate safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and anti-tumor
      activity of once-daily and orally (PO) administered SH-1028 tablets. The overall study design
      is shown in the flow chart below, which consists of 2 phases: dose escalation and dose
      expansion cohort.
