  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Major depression and anxiety disorders are leading causes of disability worldwide. These
      mental disorders deeply impact social functioning and physical health in more than
      300,000-600,000 Canadians over the age of 60. Depressed and anxious older adults have a 2-3
      times increased risk of developing dementia and cognitive decline.

      Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) is a group meditation intervention that has been
      beneficial in treating depression and anxiety in younger adults. Our research group has
      experience conducting clinical trials of MBCT in older adults with depression and anxiety.
      Meditation therapies may prevent cognitive decline, but no previous study has examined this
      with MBCT.

      In this 8-week clinical trial, Investigators are examining whether MBCT can strengthen the
      structural and functional integrity of brain networks and improve cognitive resilience in
      vulnerable depressed and anxious older adults. Investigators will also examine whether MBCT
      can improve depression, anxiety symptoms, disability, and quality of life in patients.

      Investigators will conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT), comparing
      Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT; n=15) versus a Health Enhancement Program (HEP;
      n=15) active control in 30 older patients (&gt;60) with depression or anxiety. Participants will
      be blinded to the treatment hypothesis while investigators and raters will be additionally
      blinded to group assignment. Both MBCT and HEP will be taught in weekly sessions over 8 weeks
      in similar sized groups (4-10 participants).

      Investigators will measure the effect of these interventions on brain network function and
      structure using magnetic resonance imaging at baseline and 8-week timepoints. Investigators
      will also assess cognitive functioning and a range of clinical symptoms/quality of life
      measures at baseline, 8-week and 6-month follow-up.

      Investigators anticipate that this project will improve quality of life in depressed and
      anxious older adults by enhancing brain resilience, cognitive function, and general mental
      health. This project will provides essential pilot data for a longer-term definitive
      neuroimaging trial of MBCT to assess the potential of this intervention to prevent cognitive
      decline and dementia in older adults.

      Context — Review of Literature

      Depression and anxiety are common in older adults affecting 300,000-600,000 Canadian seniors
      annually1. About 30% of patients aged ≥60 suffering from these conditions have cognitive
      dysfunction across several domains 2,3, and an episode of depression or anxiety in this
      population increases the odds of developing dementia by two-fold4-6. Cognitive impairment and
      dementia are major causes of disability and dependency among older people worldwide. These
      conditions confer poor quality of life and place people in an extremely vulnerable
      condition7.

      Adequate treatment of a depressive/anxiety episode can improve short- and longer-term
      cognition in executive, language, memory, and processing speed domains8. Because depression
      and anxiety in late-life are reversible to a certain extent and they are important risk
      factors for subsequent cognitive decline; improving these conditions can ultimately improve
      quality of life, lengthen the independent living of vulnerable people, reduces stress and
      caregiver burden. Unfortunately, existing pharmacotherapy treatments for late-life depression
      and anxiety have limited effectiveness (50-60% of patients are treatment-resistant), are
      poorly tolerated, and access is difficult due to the absence of trained personnel.
      Additionally, there are long waiting lists (up to 12 months) in most Canadian provinces and
      interventions are administered one-on-one, which is costly for the health system9. Thus,
      there is an urgent need for novel treatments for late-life depression and anxiety that can
      also improve cognition and even potentially prevent dementia in the longer-term.

      Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) is a group intervention that teaches mindfulness
      meditation (non-judgemental awareness of the present moment)10. MBCT is scalable, accessible,
      cost efficient, and has been shown to decrease symptoms of depression, anxiety and other
      psychiatric disorders11. Additionally, MBCT is associated with improved quality of life 12,
      disability, caregiver burden and stress13. Studies conducted by our own group have found that
      mindfulness meditation is feasible and well-tolerated in older patients suffering from
      depression and anxiety14. While the neural mechanisms of MBCT are not fully understood,
      previous work in younger adults has shown that this intervention increases grey matter
      density in the brain's hippocampus, known to be involved in learning, memory and stress15.
      Moreover, long-term meditation practitioners displayed decreased age-related degeneration of
      the hippocampus16 These findings are relevant because decreased hippocampal volume17,18 and
      brain functional connectivity (default mode network)19 are commonly found in depressed
      patients. Additionally, these findings are also observed early in Alzheimer's disease and are
      associated with cognitive decline20.

      Study Purpose and Rationale

      Despite all this evidence, it remains unknown whether MBCT can strengthen brain networks,
      increase brain volume, and bolster cognition in depressed and anxious older adults. To our
      knowledge, previous mindfulness studies assessing cognition in older adults have not used
      MBCT nor have used neuroimaging techniques in depressed and anxious participants. Cognitive
      assessments in previous studies were not sensitive enough and did not use an appropriate
      active control group.

      Thus, to address these issues, Investigators will conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT)
      in late-life depression and anxiety using a standardized MBCT intervention, an appropriate
      active control group, a more sensitive neurocognitive test battery and the use of
      neuroimaging methods. In this pilot neuroimaging study, Investigators wish to assess the
      effects of a standard Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) compared to an active
      control, Health Enhancement Program (HEP), on a number of clinical and biologically relevant
      outcomes, with a focus on structural and functional integrity of the default-mode network.

The Athens Insomnia scale( AIS ) was developed to assess the severity of insomnia based on the ICD-10 diagnostic criteria. It is a self-reported questionnaire consisting of 8 items; the first 5 items assess difficulty with sleep induction, awakening during the night,early morning awakening, total sleep time, and overall quality of sleep, while the last 3 items pertain to the sense of well-being,overall functioning and sleepiness during the day The usual time frame for responding is the last month. Each item of AIS can be rated 0-3, with 0 corresponding to no problem at all and 3 to very serious problem</description>
