  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Most adolescents who receive human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine are vaccinated in pediatric
      practices, yet missed opportunities (MOs) for HPV vaccination occur often and lead to low HPV
      vaccination rates. This single-arm study (embedded within arm 2 of a 2-arm cluster randomized
      clinical trial (RCT)) will test the effectiveness (and cost-effectiveness) of a bundled
      intervention (HPV vaccine communication, performance feedback reports and provider prompts),
      in practices that previously received standard of care, to reduce MOs and increase HPV
      vaccination rates.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      HPV vaccine rates remain lower than rates for other adolescent vaccines. Missed opportunities
      (MOs) are healthcare visits during which a patient is eligible, but does not receive a
      vaccine. MOs for vaccination contribute strongly to low HPV vaccination rates. This
      single-arm study (embedded within arm 2 of a 2-arm cluster RCT) will implement a 3-component
      bundle intervention together in practices that previously received standard of care. This
      study will test the effectiveness (and cost-effectiveness) of the bundled intervention, which
      trains providers in HPV vaccine communication (done through online educational modules and
      live office practice sessions), provides performance feedback reports (that pull from
      electronic health record (EHR) data, and compare participants' performance to their own
      previous performance and performance of others) and provider prompts (via EHR and also office
      staff prompts, e.g., placing Vaccine Information Statements (VISs) on desk) to reduce MOs and
      increase HPV vaccination rates. Throughout the intervention participants will also receive
      weekly text message mini-lessons that will remind participants of the project.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Practice Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The practice provides HPV vaccination services to adolescents.

          -  The practice is part of Physician's Computer Company (PCC), Office Practicum (OP) or
             (a) yet-to-be selected health system(s).

          -  The practice has had the same EHR system in place for a year or more (with special
             consideration on a case by case basis if they are close to but not do not reach a
             year).

          -  The practice agrees to not participate in other HPV-related QI projects or research
             interventions during the study period (with special consideration on a case by case
             basis).

        Practice Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The practice plans to change EHR systems in the next three years.

          -  The practice participated in the last year, is currently engaged in, or plans to
             participate in an office-based HPV-related quality improvement (QI) project or
             research intervention during the study period (with special consideration on a case by
             case basis).

          -  Estimated 20% or more of adolescents at the practice receive HPV vaccinations at
             schools or health department clinics (given standard practice and published data, the
             investigators expect that few to no practices will need to be excluded based on this
             restriction).

        Patient inclusion criteria:

        -All patients of participating practices (intervention and comparison) aged 11-17 years who
        have at least 1 visit to the practice within the past two years.

        Patient exclusion criteria:

        -None apart from age of patients (above).
