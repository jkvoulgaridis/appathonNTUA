  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Two scenarios may result in significant bone defect in the orbit: surgical oncology
      (meningioma, cancers of the upper aerodigestive tract) or severe trauma. This defect in the
      bone substance may affect the orbital floor, medial wall or lateral wall. These injuries can
      result in functional complications such as enophthalmos and diplopia, and an esthetic impact
      affecting the quality of life. The most frequent complication in orbital traumas is
      enophthalmos (10-20% according to publications).

      The aim of bone substance reconstruction is to restore the volume and the internal shape of
      the orbit. The gold standard is autologous bone grafts. The surgery which usually lasts 2 to
      3 hours depending on the number of walls involved, can lead to ophthalmological or esthetic
      complications. Its results are unsatisfactory, and the use of titanium implants would allow a
      reconstruction of the orbital volume more optimal than the autograft.

      The development of computer-assisted techniques permitted implants evolution: initially
      peri-operatively preformed, today patient specific implant can be obtained from data of
      CT-scan. In cranioplasties, a randomized study showed better results at 12 months of these
      implants compared to the autograft. Their success rate is close to 100% with less than 5% of
      postoperative complication, while the rate used for cortical graft reconstructions is 20-25%.

      Today, 3D printing of patient-specific porous titanium implants is possible. A study has
      shown that they allow a more accurate reconstruction compared to preformed implants. This
      innovation is available in France but it has a high cost (2,000 euros on average) and is
      currently not refunded. However, the use of this technology would reduce the operating time
      and the morbidity per- and post-operative, with functional and esthetic results superior to
      those obtained with bone autograft.

    <description>From data of a patient's CT-scan, it is possible to perform a &quot;mirroring&quot;. The unaffected orbit is mirrored onto the affected orbit, via a virtual treatment planning, in order to rely on facial symmetry to virtually restore healthy anatomy. From this simulation, the implant is 3D-printed by Selective Laser Melted (SLM) technique using titanium powder. This technique enabling the creation of custom-made implants is called computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing (CAD-CAM).
After sterilization, the implant is ready to be placed during a surgical procedure.</description>
