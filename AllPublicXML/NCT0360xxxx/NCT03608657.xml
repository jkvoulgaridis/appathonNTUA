  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a Canadian observational study utilizing a prospective cohort design. Patients
      with active psoriatic arthritis (PsA) for whom the treating physician has decided, prior to
      and independently of enrollment in the study, to initiate treatment with Otezla® will be
      considered for participation in the study.

      Patients will be enrolled from the practices of predominantly community rheumatologists and
      will be followed for 12 months from the time of initiation of treatment with Otezla® In line
      with the observational nature of the study, there will be no protocol imposed tests or
      assessments. However, recommended follow up visits will be at 4, 8 and 12 months. In
      addition, patients may be asked to voluntarily complete self-administered questionnaires.

      The 24-month assessment will be aimed to determine whether or not treatment with Otezla® has
      been maintained, and if not, to ascertain the reason for discontinuation and what new
      treatment was initiated following discontinuation of Otezla®
