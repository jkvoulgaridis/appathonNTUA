  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The umbilical cord plays an essential role in intrauterine life. It is the pathway between
      mother, placenta and fetus during pregnancy and delivery. Complete cord occlusion often leads
      to fetal demise, while intermittent occlusion has been associated with intrauterine brain
      damage. Compression and vasospasm in utero are important factors in fetal distress. Nuchal
      Umbilical Cord can be diagnosed antepartum using ultrasound, but the complications are
      unpredictable and unpreventable

    <description>Ultrasound evaluation will be done with transducer abdominal probe. The amount of amniotic fluid and umbilical cord sections will be determined by evaluating the images obtained from the sagittal plane in the ultrasound evaluations in the 4 abdominal quadrants.
When the anatomical structure of the umbilical cord is considered, it is folded in amniotic fluid. The folds appear as umbilical cord rings, side-by-side at the sagittal sections.
Scoring of &quot;umbilical cord length index&quot;
1 point will be given for each quadrant where the umbilical cord was observed.
0.5 point will be given for each umbilical cord ring in one quadrant. Every quadrant will be evaluated in this manner, and the total score will be calculated.</description>

        Patients who are in labor will be followed up through regular fetal heart rate monitoring
        and clinically using partograph to monitor the progress of labor. Fetal heart rate changes
        and cases with abnormal progress of labor will be recorded. Mode of delivery either vaginal
        or cesarean will be noted. Those who are scheduled for elective CS will be evaluated during
        and after cesarean section.
