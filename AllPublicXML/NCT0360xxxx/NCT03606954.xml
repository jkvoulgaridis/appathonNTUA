  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Several combination topical drugs are available on the market. The potency of corticosteroids
      depends on a particular molecular structure and the skin penetration properties. Besides
      molecular structure, a penetration of a corticosteroid molecule correlates with physical
      properties of the vehicle which depend on physical properties of the vehicle constituents.

      Vasoconstriction assay is considered as the gold standard for testing potency of topical
      corticosteroids.

      Primary outcome: Change in Vasoconstriction index following application of topical

    <description>The combination topical corticosteroid will be applied to specific and marked sites on the forearms (on the flexor side of the forearm- 5*5 cm with a distance of 3 cm) - two sites on both forearms of every subject (4 sites in total). The nature of this application method will enable the measurement of the level of potency of each drug, in a manner that is comparative, neutralizing thus the influence of inter-subject variability.
The drugs will be topically applied (50 microliter on each site) for 16 hours, utilizing an occlusive dressing bandage such as Tegaderm. The vasoconstriction test will be preformed both before and after drug application. The vasoconstriction in each subject will be graded on the Olsen scale</description>
