  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Three arms of experimental design were used: Pedometer walking training (PWT), positive
      education and pedometer walking training (PEPWT), and pedometer walking (PW). Trained walking
      exercise was provided by a physical education expert three times per week, 45 minutes per
      session. Positive education was designed and led by a licensed psychologist. Six sessions of
      activities targeted participants' self-strength, competence and self-efficacy in walking
      exercise; positive relations with others; and positive emotions about life and healthy
      lifestyle. Of 150 participants, 60, 60 and 30 were randomly assigned to PWT, PEPWT, and PW,
      respectively. Demographic information, Chinese Happiness Inventory (CHI), regular walking
      exercise and six-minute walking distance were assessed before and after the intervention.

      Randomization (allocation ratio 2:2:1) was stratified to three arms: pedometer walking (PW),
      pedometer walking with training (PWT), and positive education and pedometer walking with
      training (PEPWT). Randomization was conducted using opaque envelops and a randomly generated
      number sequence by an independent research assistant who had no prior knowledge of the
      recruited elders. Researchers allocated participants to their treatment condition based on
      the randomization code in the sealed envelope (opened in order of sequence). Researchers were
      not blind to the patients' treatment allocation.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Chinese Happiness Inventory</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Chinese Happiness Inventory (CHI). The CHI 20-item version has been widely used to measure individual well-being in Chinese culture (Lu &amp; Shih, 1997; Chiang, Lin, &amp; Lee, 2016). Each statement represents a different level of happiness, ranging from 0 (very dissatisfied) to 3 (very satisfied). CHI score is the sum of 20 items. The higher the score is, the higher the psychological well-being is. CHI has high validity and reliability (Lu &amp; Shih, 1997; Chiang, Lin, &amp; Lee, 2016).</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Cardiovascular fitness</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Cardiovascular fitness was calculated by using the six-minute walk test (6MWT) which measures the distance an individual is able to walk over a total of six minutes on a hard, flat surface and has been suggested as a useful outcome tool (Du, Newton, Salamonson, Carrieri-Kohlman, &amp; Davidson, 2009). The goal is for the individual to walk as far as possible in six minutes. The individual is allowed to self-pace and rest as needed as they traverse back and forth along a marked walkway. The 6MWT has been used to detect changes following interventions to improve exercise tolerance for healthy older adults (Troosters, Gosselink, &amp; Decramer, 1999).</description>
