      A cohort study of the cost for patients operated for adhesive small bowel obstruction (SBO)
      during a five-year period
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is a population-based cohort study of the costs for patients operated for adhesive small
      bowel obstruction during a five-year period (2007-2012) in two Swedish neighboring regions.
      Patients were identified by a broad search of operation and International Classification of
      Diseases (ICD) codes. Data regarding surgery and complications has been analyzed in a
      previous study (Clinical trials no NCT0353459)

      The costs for hospital stay, radiology, Intensive Care Unit (ICU)-care, operation for the
      index SBO care event were calculated. The cost for revisit, sick leave and recurrent SBO
      during follow-up were calculated. Patients were followed to 31st January 2017, last medical
      note or death.
