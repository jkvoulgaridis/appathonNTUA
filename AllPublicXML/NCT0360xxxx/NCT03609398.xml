      This study is being conducted to collect safety and immunogenicity data for the RVF vaccine,
      TSI-GSD 200, Lot 7, Run 2. Enrollment in this protocol is offered for personnel who enter
      areas where this virus is used in research or is endemic (an area where this disease process
      is found to occur frequently). Subjects who respond with a titer of &gt;1:40 may participate for
      study duration. Rift Valley Fever Vaccine, Inactivated, Dried (TSI GSD 200) will be
      administered in 1.0-mL doses SQ in the upper outer aspect of the arm.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Be 18 to 65 years old at time of consent.

          -  Have RVF plaque reduction neutralization 80% titers (PRNT80) &lt;1:10 for primary series.

          -  Have RVF PRNT80 (plaque reduction neutralization 80% titer) &lt;1:40 for booster series.

          -  If female of childbearing potential, must agree to have a urine pregnancy test on the
             same day before each vaccine administration. (Exception: documented hysterectomy or ≥3
             years of menopause.) The results must be negative. Females must agree not to become
             pregnant for 3 months after receipt of the last study treatment (vaccination).

          -  Be considered at risk for exposure to RVF virus and who have submitted a Request for
             IND Vaccines for the RVF vaccine.

          -  Sign and date the approved informed consent document and HIPAA Authorization.

          -  Have in their charts:

          -  medical history (including concomitant medications) within 60 days of planned first
             administration of vaccine

          -  Agree to report any adverse events (AEs) that may or may not be associated with
             administration of the vaccine for at least 28 days after administration and agree to
             report all serious adverse events (for example, resulting in hospitalization) for the
             duration of the subject's participation in the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Have completed previous RVF vaccine study as a nonresponder (PRNT80 &lt;1:40).

          -  Have clinically significant abnormal laboratory results (including evidence of
             hepatitis C, hepatitis B carrier state) or elevated liver function tests (two times
             the normal range or at the discretion of the PI).

          -  Have a personal history of an immunodeficiency or received treatment with an
             immunosuppressive medication, such as systemically administered glucocorticoids (eg
             prednisone) within 1 month before planned administration of the vaccine or with other
             immunosuppressive therapies within 6 months of planned administration of the vaccine.
             Other immunosuppressive therapies include all cancer chemotherapeutic agents, drugs to
             prevent transplant rejection, interferons, monoclonal antibodies, protein kinase
             inhibitors, methotrexate, TNF (tumor necrosis factor) inhibitors, and any other drug
             determined to be immunosuppressive by the PI. Current administration of topical,
             inhalational, or intranasal glucocorticoids is not excluded.

          -  Have confirmed HIV infection.

          -  Have positive pregnancy test or be breastfeeding female.

          -  Have any known allergies to components of the vaccine:

          -  Fetal rhesus monkey lung cells

          -  Formaldehyde

          -  Neomycin sulfate

          -  Streptomycin

          -  Sodium bisulfite

          -  Human serum albumin (HAS)

          -  RVF virus (Entebbe strain)

          -  Have administration of another vaccine or investigational product within 28 days of
             RVF vaccination.

          -  Have any unresolved AE resulting from a previous immunization.

          -  Have a medical condition that, in the judgment of the PI, would impact subject safety.
