  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Esophageal diverticulum is a rare disease. Majority comes form the pharyngo-esophageal
      junction (70 % Zenker's Diverticulum), 10% are mediothoracic and 20% epiphrenic. Zenker's
      diverticulum is well treated with endoscopy (efficacy around 80%, complications around 5%)
      (1). For medio or epihrenic diverticulum, the classic treatment is surgery (diverticulectomy
      with or without anti-reflux surgery) but is associated with 33% morbidity and 9% mortality
      (2). Recently another technique involving magnet was described (3). Five patients were
      treated with success.

      Considering the surgical risk, other techniques need to be evaluated. Using the Endomina
      device, sutures can be apposed between the foot of the diverticulum and the esophageal lumen.
      If necessary the bridge between the diverticulum and the esophagus can be cut with needle
      knife as described in Zenker's diverticulum treatment.
