      This phase II/III trial studies the usefulness of treatment with nivolumab and ipilimumab in
      addition to standard of care chemotherapy and radiation therapy in patients with esophageal
      and gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma who are undergoing surgery. Immunotherapy with
      antibodies, such as nivolumab and ipilimumab, may remove the brake on the body's immune
      system and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Chemotherapy and
      radiation therapy may reduce the tumor size and the amount of normal tissue that needs to be
      removed during surgery. A combined treatment with nivolumab and ipilimumab, chemotherapy, and
      radiation therapy might be more effective in patients with esophageal and gastroesophageal
      junction adenocarcinoma who are undergoing surgery.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the pathologic complete response rate (pathCR) rate following administration of
      neoadjuvant carboplatin, paclitaxel and radiation therapy versus neoadjuvant carboplatin,
      paclitaxel, radiation therapy and nivolumab in patients with a resected locoregionally
      advanced esophageal or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma.

      II. To assess the disease-free survival (DFS) following administration of adjuvant nivolumab
      and ipilimumab versus adjuvant nivolumab in patients with a resected locoregionally advanced
      esophageal or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma who received neoadjuvant treatment
      with carboplatin, paclitaxel and radiation therapy with or without nivolumab.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the overall survival (OS) following administration of adjuvant nivolumab and
      ipilimumab versus nivolumab in patients with a resected locoregional esophageal or
      gastroesophageal junctional adenocarcinoma who received neoadjuvant treatment with
      carboplatin, paclitaxel and radiation therapy with or without nivolumab.

      II. To assess the disease free survival (DFS) following administration of neoadjuvant
      carboplatin, paclitaxel, and radiation therapy with or without nivolumab in patients with a
      locoregional esophageal or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma III. To assess the
      toxicity associated with the administration of neoadjuvant nivolumab in combination with
      carboplatin, paclitaxel and radiation therapy in patients with a locoregional esophageal or
      gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma.

      IV. To assess the toxicity associated with the administration of adjuvant nivolumab and
      ipilimumab versus adjuvant nivolumab in patients with a resected locoregional esophageal or
      gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma who received neoadjuvant treatment with carboplatin,
      paclitaxel and radiation therapy with or without nivolumab.

      IMAGING OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine if the percent change in mean volumetric apparent diffusion coefficient
      (ADC), measured from pre-treatment to mid-treatment, is predictive of pathCR in patients with
      a locoregional esophageal or gastroesophageal junctional adenocarcinoma undergoing chemo and
      chemoradiotherapy plus (+)/minus (-) nivolumab.

      II. To identify an optimal delta ADC cutoff in predicting pathCR.

      OUTLINE:

      STEP I: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM A: Patients receive carboplatin intravenously (IV) and paclitaxel IV once weekly and
      undergo radiation therapy once daily (Monday-Friday) beginning on day 1. Cycles repeat every
      week for up to 5 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM B: Patients receive carboplatin, paclitaxel, and radiation therapy as in Arm A. Patients
      also receive nivolumab IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 15. Cycles repeat every week for up
      to 5 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      STEP II: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms following standard of care surgery.

      ARM C: Patients receive nivolumab IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 2
      weeks for up to 12 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM D: Patients receive nivolumab as in Arm C and receive ipilimumab IV over 90 minutes on
      day 1 of cycles 1, 4, 7, and 10. Treatment repeats every 2 weeks for up to 12 cycles in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years, and
      then every 6 months for up to 5 years.

             orientation or whether they have undergone tubal ligation, who meets the following
             criteria: 1) has not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy; or 2) has not
             been naturally postmenopausal for at least 24 consecutive months (i.e., has had menses
             at any time in the preceding 24 consecutive months)

          -  STEP 1: Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) and sexually active males must either
             abstain from sexual intercourse for the duration of their participation in the study
             or agree to use both double barrier contraception and birth control pills or implants
             for at least one month (female patients) or one week (male patients) prior to the
             start of the study drug and continuing for 5 months after the last dose of study drug
             (for female patients) and for 7 months after the last dose of study drug (for male
             patients who are sexually active with WOCBP). Investigators shall counsel WOCBP and
             male subjects who are sexually active with WOCBP on the importance of pregnancy
             prevention and the implications of an unexpected pregnancy

          -  STEP 1: If patient says 'Yes' to &quot;I choose to take part in the imaging study and will
             have the diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans&quot;: patients must be
             able to tolerate MRI scans:

               -  No history of untreatable claustrophobia

               -  No magnetic resonance (MR) incompatible implants/devices or metallic foreign
                  bodies

               -  Weight compatible with limits imposed by the MRI scanner table

          -  STEP 2: Patient registration must not exceed 12 weeks from time of esophagectomy

          -  STEP 2: Patients must have a post-operative ECOG performance status of 0-2

          -  STEP 2: Absolute neutrophil count &gt;= 1,500/mcL (within less than or equal to 14 days
             prior to randomization)

          -  STEP 2: Platelets &gt;= 100,000/mcL (within less than or equal to 14 days prior to
             randomization)

          -  STEP 2: Total bilirubin =&lt; institutional upper limit of normal (ULN) (within less than
             or equal to 14 days prior to randomization)

          -  STEP 2: AST (SGOT)/ ALT (SGPT) =&lt; 2.5 x institutional ULN (within less than or equal
             to 14 days prior to randomization)

          -  STEP 2: Serum creatinine =&lt; 1.5 x institutional ULN (within less than or equal to 14
             days prior to randomization)

          -  STEP 2: Patients must be disease free following esophagectomy as is demonstrated by
             having no evidence of disease on a post-surgical computed tomography (CT) scan.
             Patients must also have a negative surgical margin (R0 resection)

          -  STEP 2: Patients must not have an active, known or suspected autoimmune disease or a
             condition requiring treatment with steroids or immunosuppressive agents. Patients are
             permitted to enroll if they have vitiligo, type I diabetes mellitus, residual
             hypothyroidism due to autoimmune condition only requiring hormone replacement,
             psoriasis not requiring systemic treatment, or conditions not expected to recur in the
             absence of an external trigger

          -  STEP 2: Patients must not have a condition requiring systemic treatment with either
             corticosteroids (&gt; 10 mg/day prednisone equivalents) or other immunosuppressive
             medications with 14 days of study drug administration. Inhaled or topical steroids and
             adrenal replacement doses &gt; 10 mg/day prednisone equivalents are permitted in the
             absence of active autoimmune disease

          -  STEP 2: Patients must not be receiving any other investigational agents

          -  STEP 2: Patients with an uncontrolled intercurrent illness such as ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements will be excluded

          -  STEP 2: Women must not be pregnant or breast-feeding due to potential harm to the
             fetus from nivolumab or ipilimumab. All females of childbearing potential must have a
             blood test or urine study done (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of
             HCG) within 2 weeks prior to registration to rule out pregnancy. All patients must
             also agree to have a pregnancy test (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units
             of HCG) within 24 hours of starting nivolumab to rule out pregnancy. Those enrolled on
             Arm D with ipilimumab must agree to have pregnancy tests within 72 hours of each
             ipilimumab administration to rule out pregnancy

          -  STEP 2: Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) and sexually active males must either
             abstain from sexual intercourse for the duration of their participation in the study
             or agree to use both double barrier contraception and birth control pills or implants
             for at least one month (female patients) or one week (male patients) prior to the
             start of the study drug and continuing for 5 months after the last dose of study drug
             (for female patients) and for 7 months after the last dose of study drug (for male
             patients who are sexually active with WOCBP). Investigators shall counsel WOCBP and
             male subjects who are sexually active with WOCBP on the importance of pregnancy
             prevention and the implications of an unexpected pregnancy
