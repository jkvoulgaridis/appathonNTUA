    <textblock>
      Anti-EGFR-immunoliposomes loaded with doxorubicin (C225-ILs-dox) are given intravenously in
      patients with relapsed or refractory high-grade gliomas.

      The pharmacokinetics of C225-ILs-dox in peripheral blood (PB), cerebro-spinal fluid (CSF) and
      resected tumour tissue will be assessed.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Written informed consent according to International Conference on Harmonization
             (ICH)/Good Clinical Practice (GCP) regulations before registration and prior to any
             trial specific procedures

          2. Patients with relapsed histologically proven glioblastoma ≥ 18 years of age.

          3. Patients need to have at least one line of treatment with combined radio-chemotherapy

          4. EGFR amplification. EGFR amplification will be tested by comparative genomic
             hybridization (CGH) method. EGFR will be considered amplified if the value is 0.15
             above the average signal of chromosome 7.

          5. Evaluable disease on MRI brain scan

          6. Adequate bone marrow function: neutrophils ≥ 1.5 x 109/L, platelets ≥ 100 x 109/L

          7. Adequate hepatic function: bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN), aspartate
             aminotransferase (AST), Alanin-Aminotransferase (ALT) and alkaline phosphatase (AP) ≤
             2.5 x ULN

          8. Adequate renal function: serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN and calculated creatinine
             clearance &gt; 30 mL/min, according to the formula of Cockcroft-Gault

          9. Adequate cardiac function: Left ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) ≥ 50% as
             determined by either echocardiography (ECHO) or radionuclide angiocardiography (MUGA)
             in addition to pre- (brain-type natriuretic Peptide) BNP from peripheral blood

         10. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0-2 (0=Fully active,
             able to carry on all pre-disease performance without restriction, 1=Restricted in
             physically strenuous activity but ambulatory and able to carry out work of a light or
             sedentary nature, e.g., light house work, office work, 2=Ambulatory and capable of all
             self-care but unable to carry out any work activities. Up and about more than 50% of
             waking hours).

         11. No contraindications for lumbar puncture

         12. Women with child-bearing potential have to use effective contraception, are not
             allowed to be pregnant and have to agree not to become pregnant during trial treatment
             and during the 6 months thereafter. A negative pregnancy test before inclusion into
             the trial is required for all women with child-bearing potential.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. History of hematologic or primary solid tumor malignancy, unless in remission for at
             least 3 years from registration except for adequately treated cervical carcinoma in
             situ and localized non-melanoma skin cancer.

          2. Lack to provide written informed consent

          3. Previous therapy with more than 240 mg/m2 of doxorubicin or more than 450 mg/m2 of
             epirubicin

          4. Any serious underlying medical condition (at the judgement of the investigator) which
             could impair the ability of the patient to participate in the trial (e.g. active
             autoimmune disease, uncontrolled diabetes, etc.)

          5. Breastfeeding and pregnancy

          6. Participation in any investigational drug trial within 4 weeks preceding treatment
             start

          7. Any concomitant drugs contraindicated when administering Erbitux™ or Caelyx™ according
             to the Swissmedic-approved product information

          8. Known hypersensitivity to trial drug(s) or to any component of the trial drug(s)

          9. Any other serious underlying medical, psychiatric, psychological, familial or
             geographical condition, which in the judgment of the investigator may interfere with
             the planned staging, treatment and follow-up, affect patient compliance or place the
             patient at high risk from treatment-related complications.
