      Red yeast rice is a source of active compounds in reducing LDL levels with practically no
      side effects. Molval Fort is a natural product available in the Lebanese market with a
      combination of red yeast rice extracts, EPA/DHA and coenzyme Q10.

      The investigators are conducting this study to explore the effect of red yest rice extracts
      based product on LDL and its side effects in a sample of primary care Lebanese patients.

      Red yeast rice is a source of active compounds in reducing LDL levels with practically no
      side effects. Studies performed on American and Chinese populations have shown positive
      results. These studies need confirmation in different populations. Molval Fort is a natural
      product available in the Lebanese market with a combination of red yeast rice extracts,
      EPA/DHA and coenzyme Q10. The investigators are conducting this study to explore the effect
      of red yest rice extracts based product on LDL and its side effects in a sample of primary
      care Lebanese patients.
