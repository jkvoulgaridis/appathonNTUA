  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label study to investigate the functional features of prolonged monitoring by
      14-day EZYPRO® to improve the medical care and/or diagnosis for the patient with arrhythmia.
      Patients will be enrolled by outpatient basis from two clinical study sites. Enrolled
      patients will wear a traditional 24-hour Holter monitor and an 14-day EZYPRO® which can
      provide monitoring data for up to 14 days. This study will allow a direct comparison between
      two devices.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Compare the detection difference of any type of arrhythmia between 14-day continuous ECG patch and 24-hour Holter monitor device among patients with suspected cardiac arrhythmia events over total wearing time</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to14 days</time_frame>
    <description>The arrhythmia events of 14-day continuous ECG patch monitor (investigational device) and 24-hour Holter monitor will be analyzed by the qualified ECG technicians and determined by physician investigators at the study sites. Arrhythmia events are defined as detection of any 1 of 6 arrhythmias, including:
Supraventricular tachycardia (&gt;4 beats, not including atrial fibrillation or flutter)
Atrial fibrillation/flutter (&gt;4 beats)
Pause &gt;3 seconds
Atrioventricular block (Second-degree, 2:1 or third-degree atrioventricular block, need an advanced determination by the investigators)
Ventricular tachycardia (&gt;4 beats)
Polymorphic ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation In the end, all the detection will be confirmed by the investigators.
McNemar's tests will be used to compare the matched pairs of proportion data.</description>

    <measure>The wearing time of 14-day continuous ECG patch (Study Compliance)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to14 days</time_frame>
    <description>The wearing time will be recorded as the day of 14-day continuous ECG patch removal after stating monitoring. Kaplan-Meier method will be reported for total wearing time. The mean value along with two-sided 95% confidence intervals will be report as well.</description>
