    <textblock>
      This protocol is a pilot study of a personalized and supervised 10-week strength training
      program to improve self-efficacy and resolve biomarkers of inflammaging in a cohort of
      allogeneic hematopoietic transplant (HCT) long-term survivors versus healthy controls.
