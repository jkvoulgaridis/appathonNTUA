  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, single-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled dose escalation trial of
      three dose cohorts (A: 0.033 mg/kg, B: 0.165 mg/kg, and C: 0.33 mg/kg). The purpose of this
      study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of NTM-1633 in healthy adults. This is a
      first-in-human study consisting of three cohorts of eight subjects each. Dosing for each
      cohort is as follows: Two sentinel subjects will be administered a single 1-hour infusion
      (one NTM-1633, one placebo). No more than two subjects per day thereafter (at least 24 hrs
      will elapse between the dosing of each two subjects) will be dosed in the same manner until
      all subjects are dosed. Dose escalation will not occur until safety data through Day 8 is
      reviewed by the Safety Review Committee (SRC). Objective dose-escalation criteria and safety
      evaluations will be utilized. The study duration will be for approximately 8 months. Subjects
      in Cohort A will participate for approximately 17 weeks and Subjects in Cohorts B and C will
      participate approximately 21 weeks. Primary Objective: To assess the safety and tolerability
      of escalating doses of NTM-1633 administered intravenously in healthy adults.

      Objectives: 1) To assess the pharmacokinetic characteristics of NTM-1633 following a single
      intravenous administration; 2) To assess the immunogenicity of NTM-1633 following a single
      intravenous administration.

          7. If the subject is female and of childbearing potential, she agrees to practice
             abstinence from sexual intercourse with men or use acceptable contraception up to
             visit 12 of the study.

               -  Acceptable contraception methods are restricted to effective devices
                  (Intrauterine Contraceptive Devices, NuvaRing(R)) or licensed hormonal products

                  with spermicidal agents, monogamous relationship with a vasectomized partner

          8. The hemoglobin, platelet count, white blood cell count and absolute neutrophil count
             are within normal limits at the screening visit.

          9. The urine dipstick results on protein, glucose and blood are negative or trace.

               -  Menstruating females failing inclusion criteria due to a positive blood on urine
                  dipstick may be retested following cessation of menses.

         10. Chemistry screening laboratory tests are in the normal reference range.

               -  The following exceptions to laboratory normal reference ranges are allowed:
                  Creatinine, Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN), total bilirubin, AST, ALT, lipase,
                  amylase, Prothrombin Time (PT), Partial Thromboplastin Time (PTT) below the lower

                  and alkaline phosphatase with a toxicity grade of 1 is allowable; albumin above
                  the upper limit of normal (ULN).

                    -  Laboratory values that are outside the range of eligibility but are thought
                       to be due to an acute condition or due to laboratory error may be repeated
                       once.

                    -  Abnormalities in mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin

         11. Has adequate venous access for the infusion.

         12. The urine drug screen is negative.

         13. Breathalyzer test is negative.

         14. Available for follow-up for the duration of the study.

         15. Agrees not to participate in vigorous activity 72 hours prior to dosing through day 15
             post dosing.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. History of a chronic medical condition that would either interfere with the accurate
             assessment of the objectives of the study or increase the risk profile of the subject.

               -  Chronic medical conditions include diabetes; Asthma requiring use of medication
                  in the year before screening; Autoimmune disorder such as lupus, Wegener's,

             reason

         18. Any specific condition that in the judgment of the investigator precludes

         19. Plans to enroll or is already enrolled in another clinical trial that could interfere
