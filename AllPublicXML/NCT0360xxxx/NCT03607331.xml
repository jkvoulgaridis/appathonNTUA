  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study was to compare the therapeutic effects of Auricular Concha
      Electro-acupuncture and Citalopram on patients with major depressive disorder (MDD).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, 106 patients with MDD were randomly divided into the auricular concha
      electro-acupuncture group and the citalopram group by the evaluation blind method and
      randomized control design, and were treated for 8 weeks and 4 weeks follow-up. In No. 0, 2,
      4, 6, 8, 10, 12 Weekend, Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression-17 Item (HAM-D17) and Hamilton
      Anxiety Rating Scale (Ham-A) were performed for all patients. During the No. 0/8 weekend,
      patients were tested and analyzed for peripheral blood NE, 5-HT, DA, Cortisol, ACTH, GABA,
      glutamic acid, BDNF and BFGF, and the brain is also examined and analyzed by fMRI.

    <description>The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale has proven useful for determining the level of depression before, during, and after treatment. It is based on the clinician's interview with the patient and probes symptoms such as depressed mood, guilty feelings, suicide, sleep disturbances, anxiety levels and weight loss. The interview and scoring takes about 15 minutes. The rater enters a number for each symptom construct that ranges from 0 (not present) to 4 (extreme symptoms). The higher the total score is, the worse it is.The total score of 17HAMD more than 24 is defined as major depression, more than 17 but less than 24 is mild or moderate depression, and less than 7 is no depression.</description>

    <description>This widely-used interview scale measures the severity of a patient's anxiety, based on 14 parameters, including anxious mood, tension, fears, insomnia, somatic complaints and behavior at the interview. The higher the total score is, the worse it is. The total score of HAMA-14 more than 29 is defined as severe anxiety, more than 21 but less than 29 is obvious anxiety, more than 14 but less than 21 is certain anxiety, more than 7 but less than 14 is likely to be anxiety, and less than 6 is no anxiety.</description>
