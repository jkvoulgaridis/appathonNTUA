      The goal of this prospective, non-randomized, single-arm, feasibility study is to develop
      data to evaluate the safety and initial efficacy of this treatment (temporary disruption of
      the BBB) using this ExAblate Model 4000 Type 2 System in patients with mild to moderate
      Parkinson´s Disease Dementia

      This study is a prospective, single-arm, non-randomized, safety and feasibility trial of
      focal BBB disruption using the ExAblate® Model 4000 Type 2 (220 kHz) system with Luminity®
      ultrasound contrast in 10 patients with mild to moderate Parkinson's Disease Dementia.
      Patients, together with their caregivers, will be approached after their identification by a
      team of neurosurgeons and neurologists who specialize in the management of cognitive
      disorders and functional neurosurgery. The study will be discussed with them, and all
      patients, or their legal representatives will provide informed consent to participate in the
      study.

      This first in human trial will be divided into two stages. In the first stage, patients will
      undergo small volume BBB disruption, establishing the minimum required sonication parameters
      to open the BBB, as evidenced by gadolinium enhancement on T1-weighted MRI. Stage I is
      defined as a discrete region of approximately 9 mm x 9 mm area in the right
      parietooccipitotemporal cortex. Multiple sonications will be performed starting at low energy
      and ramping up until the BBB is observed to open.

      The subjects will then be removed from the ExAblate® Neuro device and followed for safety for
      2 weeks. If the subject experienced BBB disruption without any serious adverse effects (such
      as brain edema), then the subject may proceed to Stage II where a larger volume (2.5-3.0 cm)
      will be targeted. Subjects will be followed for an additional 2 weeks for safety and
      preliminary effectiveness.

      The staged approach will allow determination of:

        1. Safety of BBB disruption

        2. Feasibility of disruption the BBB

        3. Reversibility of BBB disruption

        4. Reproducibility of BBB disruption
