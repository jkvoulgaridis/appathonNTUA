  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute graft versus host-disease remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality after
      allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. The incidence of grade II to IV acute
      GVHD ranges from 30 to 50% of the patients transplanted. Steroids remain the standard first
      line treatment for acute GVHD.

      Prolonged exposure to steroids is associated to increased risk of infections and of
      osteoporosis, osteonecrosis and alteration of growth in children. Thus, reducing steroid
      exposure in order to reduce treatment-related morbidity is another important goal in the
      management of standard risk aGVHD.

      Extracoporeal photopheresis (ECP) is active in controlling steroid refractory or dependent
      acute GVHD.

      Hypothesis:

      In this study, the team hypothesizes that addition of ECP to first line treatment with 2
      mg/kg steroids of standard risk grade II aGVHD can reduce steroid exposure by increasing the
      probability of 6 month FFTF including absence of systemic steroids for chronic GVHD.
