      Background: Computer aided auscultation in the differentiation of pathologic (AHA class I)
      from no- or innocent murmurs (AHA class III) via artificial intelligence algorithms could be
      a useful tool to assist healthcare providers in identifying pathological heart murmurs and
      may avoid unnecessary referrals to medical specialists.

      Objective: Assess the quality of the artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm that autonomously
      detects and classifies heart murmurs as either pathologic (AHA class I) or as no- or innocent
      (AHA class III).

      Hypothesis: The algorithm used in this study is able to analyze and identify pathologic heart
      murmurs (AHA class I) in an adult population with valve defects with a similar sensitivity
      compared to medical specialist.

      Methods: Each patient is auscultated and diagnosed independently by a medical specialist by
      means of standard auscultation. Auscultation findings are verified via gold-standard
      echocardiogram diagnosis. For each patient, a phonocardiogram (PCG) - a digital recording of
      the heart sounds - is acquired. The recordings are later analyzed using the AI algorithm. The
      algorithm results are compared to the findings of the medical professionals as well as to the
      echocardiogram findings.

    <description>Automated AI algorithm-based analysis of digital heart sound recordings to detect pathological heart murmurs. Heart sound recordings were fully blinded before undergoing one-time automated analysis. Algorithm results for each recording included: AHA classification (I &quot;pathologic&quot; versus III &quot;innocent/no murmur&quot;), murmur timing, murmur grade, heart rate and S1/S2 identification.</description>

        Elderly in-patient subjects admitted to the Division of Cardiology, University Hospital
        Graz, Austria. All patients had known pathological murmurs caused by multiple valve
        defects, confirmed by gold standard echocardiography. Defects were interpreted by the
        cardiologist as &quot;low, medium or high&quot; severity. Altogether, 155 valve defects were
        observed, including insufficiencies of the aortic, mitral, tricuspid, and pulmonary valves;
        and stenosis of the aortic and mitral valves.
