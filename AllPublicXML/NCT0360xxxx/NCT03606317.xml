  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective is to perform a retrospective chart review of patients with cachexia related to
      cancer in patients treated in the palliative care clinic at Parkland Memorial Hospital to
      evaluate the prognosis and practice patterns in management of cachexia and associated
      symptoms.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The definition of cachexia has not been fully elucidated, but there are many similar
      parameters and guidelines associated with identifying patients with cachexia. Cachexia is a
      clinical diagnosis associated with weight loss, decreased muscle mass (sarcopenia), decreased
      strength, fatigue, and an increased inflammatory state. Patients with cachexia have a poorer
      prognosis than patients who have maintained their weight. Also, patients who have lost weight
      prior to initiating definitive therapy have worse side effects from subsequent therapy.

      This study involves no treatment or invasive procedures. The chart review will attempt to
      characterize lung and pancreatic cancer related cachexia in the setting of a palliative care
      clinic including both primary treatment and treatment at the time of recurrence.
      Interventions in cachectic patients for weight control including nutritional support and
      supplements, pain control, anti-inflammatory medications, and appetite stimulants will be
      tracked along with clinical markers including weight and laboratory values.

    <description>The quality of life questionnaire will be used as a standardized instrument to measure the health outcome.Its provides a simple descriptive profile and a single index value for health status. The US version of the EQ-5D will be used, to enable mapping of general HR-QOL scores from EQ-5D scores into health state utility scores (ranging from 0 to 100) for the US population.Analyses will be performed for all subjects having received at least one fraction of radiation.The analysis for the quality of life gained from this study could lead to improved medical care for palliative care patients with cachexia by focusing on keeping up strength and energy, minimizing distress in palliative care patients with cachexia.</description>

        Subjects medical charts will be identified by the palliative care clinic database with
        diagnosis during the above time frame. Data from charts will be entered into a password
        protected excel spreadsheet. The charts will be identified by name, medical record number,
        date of birth, and social security number. These are all patients treated by all hospitals
        and clinics affiliated with the Parkland palliative care clinic. At the time of study, many
        of the patients will have expired but some will be alive and in the regional North Texas
        area. Thus, given the fact the majority of patients will have expired at the time of this
        study and the minimal risk nature of this retrospective chart review, we could not
        reasonably conduct this research with a full waiver of consent.
