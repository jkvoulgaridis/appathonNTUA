  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pain in adolescents undergoing treatment for cancer is a common problem, often related to
      treatment or to the cancer itself. Due to increasing outpatient-based cancer treatment, the
      burden of care and pain management has shifted to the home environment. Yet, there are
      limited interventions that target the management of pain at home. Adolescence is marked by
      increased need for independence and social integration, both of which can be impaired by pain
      or fear of pain. To address unique needs during this developmental period, this study will
      test a telemedicine program to enhance pain knowledge and pain control strategies in
      adolescents ages 12-21 years who are undergoing treatment for cancer.

      Fifty-six teens will be randomized to an intervention or wait-list control condition.
      Patients randomized to the waitlist control condition will receive the intervention following
      completion of the waitlist condition. The intervention will consist of four weekly 30-45
      minute telemedicine (online via videoconferencing platform) sessions with a trained social
      work or psychology provider. Sessions will focus on pain psychoeducation, coping tools,
      communication, and stress management. Participants will complete online questionnaires
      assessing pain coping, pain management, and pain-related impairment at pre-intervention,
      post-intervention, and 1- and 2-month follow-up.

    <description>Intervention will be deemed acceptable if at least 80% of participants rate each question an average of at least &quot;4&quot; (&quot;Agree&quot;) on a 5-point scale anchored by &quot;Strongly Disagree&quot; and &quot;Strongly Agree.&quot;</description>

    <measure>Change in pain coping behaviors as assessed by the Pain Coping Questionnaire (PCQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>At study enrollment (pre-intervention) and between 4 and 6 weeks later (post-intervention for immediate group, post-waitlist period for waitlist group)</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed by the change in the total score on the 'Coping with Pain' section of the Pain Coping Questionnaire (PCQ) from pre-intervention to post-intervention (immediate group) or post-waitlist period (waitlist group). Calculated by subtracting the pre-intervention score from the post-intervention score. The 'Coping with Pain' section of the PCQ consists of 39 items. The total score is calculated as a mean rating and can range from 1-5 and higher scores indicate greater use of coping strategies.</description>

    <measure>Change in pain-related impairment as assessed by the PROMIS Pain Interference - Pediatric Short Form v2.0</measure>
    <time_frame>At study enrollment (pre-intervention) and between 4 and 6 weeks later (post-intervention for immediate group, post-waitlist period for waitlist group)</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed by the change in the total score on the PROMIS Pain Interference - Pediatric Short Form v2.0 from pre-intervention to post-intervention (immediate group) or post-waitlist period (waitlist group). Calculated by subtracting the pre-intervention score from the post-intervention score. The PROMIS Pain Interference - Pediatric Short Form v2.0 is an 8-item measure whose total score can range from 8-40. Higher scores indicate higher interference caused by pain.</description>
