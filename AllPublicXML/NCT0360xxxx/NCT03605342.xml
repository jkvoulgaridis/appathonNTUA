      The objective of this study is to test a standard psychotherapy for PTSD in Veterans who also
      suffer from Opiate Use Disorder (OUD). Specifically, this study will test whether Cognitive
      Processing Therapy (CPT)-C is more effective in treating PTSD, compared to a control group
      (Individual Drug Counseling (IDC); which approximates treatment as usual), among Veterans
      with PTSD and comorbid OUD who are maintained on buprenorphine.

      The study has three phases. In Phase I: induction to buprenorphine/naloxone (BUP/NLX)
      maintenance. Phase II: treatment. During this phase participants will be randomly assigned to
      CPT-C or IDC for 12 weeks. They will be seen weekly for psychotherapy and also regularly
      (weekly, then biweekly, then monthly) for buprenorphine management, symptom evaluation, and
      medication refill. After completing treatment participants will be referred to a
      buprenorphine clinic for ongoing care. Phase III: follow-up.

      Approximately 160 male and female Veterans (18-65 years old) with PTSD and comorbid opiate
      use disorder (OUD) will be enrolled in this study. Recruitment will be through VA clinics,
      word-of-mouth, referrals from area programs and by advertisement. Veterans who are interested
      will complete a brief pre-screening and detailed in-person screening. After completing the
      screening process, all eligible participants will be started on buprenorphine maintenance and
      once withdrawal symptoms are stabilized, participants will be randomly assigned to 1 of 2
      conditions (CPT-C or IDC) for 12 weeks. Veterans who are already on BUP/NLX will be allowed
      to participate and will start at Phase II of the study, after completing the screening.

    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test whether Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT-C) is more
      effective than Individual Drug Counseling (IDC), which is standard counseling, for the
      treatment of PTSD among Veterans with PTSD and comorbid opioid use disorder who are also
      maintained on buprenorphine. The investigators propose to conduct a randomized, controlled
      trial and Veterans (n=160) diagnosed with PTSD and comorbid OUD will be randomized to one of
      2 groups: (a) buprenorphine and CPT-C or (b) buprenorphine and IDC (treatment as usual).

      Primary Aim 1:.To test whether CPT-C is more effective than IDC in treating symptoms of PTSD
      among Veterans with OUD maintained on buprenorphine. PTSD symptoms will be measured using the
      PTSD Checklist - Military version (PCL-5), and confirmed by the Clinician Administered PTSD
      Scale using the DSM-5 criteria (CAPS-5).

      Secondary Aim 1: To test whether CPT-C is more effective than IDC in reducing opioid use
      among Veterans with PTSD and comorbid OUD maintained on buprenorphine. Opioid use will be
      measured using the Timeline Follow-back (TLFB) and confirmed by urine toxicology results.

      Exploratory Aims: To examine if treatment groups differ in 1) retention, measured by days in
      treatment, 2) psychosocial functioning, measured by the Veterans RAND 12-Item Short Form
      Health Survey (VR-12), 3) sleep as measured by the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), since sleep
      disturbance is a hallmark of PTSD and during early abstinence from opioids, and 4) Because of
      the high comorbidity between PTSD and chronic pain the investigators will explore this
      relationship and will measure pain intensity (measured by the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS), and
      functional impairment using the PROMIS-29 (Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information
      System) longitudinally over the course of treatment. Follow up will be conducted 1 and 3
      months after completion of the study to evaluate durability of effect on PTSD symptoms
      (measured as changes in PTSD symptoms), opioid use and treatment utilization.

      This study will be a randomized, open-label clinical trial. The study has three phases. In
      Phase I: induction to buprenorphine/naloxone (BUP/NLX) maintenance. Phase II: treatment.
      During this phase participants will be randomly assigned to CPT-C or IDC for 12 weeks. They
      will be seen weekly for psychotherapy and also regularly (weekly, then biweekly, then
      monthly) for buprenorphine management, symptom evaluation, and medication refill. After
      completing treatment participants will be referred to a buprenorphine clinic for ongoing
      care. Phase III: follow-up.

      Approximately 160 male and female Veterans (18-65 years old) with PTSD and comorbid opiate
      use disorder (OUD) will be enrolled in this study. Recruitment will be through VA clinics,
      word-of-mouth, referrals from area programs and by advertisement. Veterans who are interested
      will complete a brief pre-screening and detailed in-person screening (including: consent, lab
      work, interview with clinician including the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5 (SCID-5)
      and Clinician Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 (CAPS-5), medical and psychiatric history).
      After completing the screening process, all eligible participants will be started on
      buprenorphine maintenance and once withdrawal symptoms are stabilized, participants will be
      randomly assigned to 1 of 2 conditions (CPT-C or IDC) for 12 weeks. Veterans who are already
      on BUP/NLX will be allowed to participate and will start at Phase II of the study, after
      completing the screening. The investigators will use mixed effects models to assess changes
      in PTSD symptoms and opiate use over time. Treatments will be used as between-subject factors
      and time (in weeks) will be used as a within-subject factor. The primary outcome variables
      will be PTSD symptoms as measured by the PCL-5 and CAPS scales. The secondary outcome
      variables will be frequency of opiate use generated from the TLFB and confirmed with urine
      toxicology results at each medication visit (weeks 1-4, 6,8, 12) and follow-up.

      Potential benefits of participation in this study may include a reduction in PTSD symptoms.
      However, there is no guarantee or promise that participants will receive any benefit from
      participation in this study.

      Since 11 September 2001, more than 1.5 million Service Members have deployed more than 2
      million times in support of combat operations in Afghanistan and Iraq. One of the signature
      injuries from these operations is PTSD. Various reports of the post-deployment health-related
      needs estimated that 20% of Veterans returning from deployment will have symptoms of PTSD or
      related behavioral health conditions. In addition, the prescription opioid epidemic has
      seriously affected Veterans, and Veterans with PTSD are more likely to abuse opioids and to
      have high-risk behaviors. Nevertheless, treating comorbid PTSD and OUD has not been
      systematically tested. This study proposes to test an evidence based psychotherapy for PTSD
      vs. individual drug counseling in Veterans given opioid maintenance treatment who have both
      PTSD and OUD.

    <intervention_model_description>This study is a 14-week, open-label randomization: 1) buprenorphine (BUP) + CPT-C vs (2) BUP + IDC. Phase I: buprenorphine induction and stabilization for all participants. Participants starting dose 2mg/0.5 mg BUP/NLX this will increased as needed up to 24 mg per day. Phase II: randomization to CPT vs. IDC (x12 weeks). CPT-C will be provided by one of the investigators' licensed therapists trained. IDC will be provided by research staff. Phase III: Subjects will be referred to one of the buprenorphine clinics (West Haven or Newington) and will be referred for ongoing treatment for PTSD if they choose, including the option for CPT-C for those who did not receive this during the study. Participants will be seen on a daily basis (excluding weekends) for the initial 5-7 day induction. Once subjects are on maintenance dose of BUP/NLX, they will be seen weekly by study RN for the first 4 weeks, biweekly for a month then monthly for symptom evaluation, and medication refill.</intervention_model_description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 6, week 12</time_frame>
    <description>CAPS-5 will be used to diagnose PTSD and to obtain data to assess the change in frequency and severity of PTSD symptoms. The CAPS-5 is a structured diagnostic interview for DSM-5 diagnosis and the gold standard for assessing PTSD. It has excellent psychometric properties and diagnostic efficiency. The CAPS for DSM-5 uses only a single 5-point ordinal rating scale to measure symptom severity.
CAPS-5 scores range from 0 to 80 with higher scores indicating greater PTSD symptom severity. The CAPS-5 was revised with an eye towards maintaining backwards compatibility with the DSM-IV version of the instrument.</description>

    <measure>PTSD Checklist - Military version (PCL-5) Change</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, weekly weeks 1-12</time_frame>
    <description>PCL-5 will be used to collect information on PTSD symptoms. PCL-5 will be given at baseline and weekly for 12 weeks to assess any change in PTSD symptoms.
The PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 is similar in form to the PTSD Checklist (PCL) based on the DSM-IV. The PCL-IV has excellent psychometric characteristics. The PCL-5 is a 20-item self-report measure, selected for its dimensional sensitivity, with higher scores reflecting greater PTSD severity. Scoring is based on how much the patient has been bothered by the symptoms on a scale from &quot;0 = not at all&quot; to &quot;4 = extremely.&quot; PCL scores will be collected based upon symptoms experienced in the past month at baseline, but since the last visit, during the weekly assessments.</description>

    <description>IDC will serve as the control group. The current standard of treatment for Veterans entering buprenorphine maintenance is to do drug counseling. Standard counseling is the primary means to achieve goals. IDC uses a semi-structured, time-limited addictions-counseling model in a 1:1 setting. The IDC manual provides an organized, concise version of what is currently practiced by most addiction counselors.</description>
