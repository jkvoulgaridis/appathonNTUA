    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1 multicenter, single-arm, open-label, dose escalation and dose expansion
      study of enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2 ) inhibitor SHR2554. This study is to assess the
      tolerability, safety, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary anti-tumor activity of SHR2554 in
      participants with relapsed or refractory mature lymphoid neoplasms.
