  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if a procedure called Endoscopic Retrograde
      CholangioPancreatography (ERCP) with sphincterotomy reduces the risk of pancreatitis or the
      number of recurrent pancreatitis episodes in patients with pancreas divisum. ERCP with
      sphincterotomy is a procedure where doctors used a combination of x-rays and an endoscope (a
      long flexible lighted tube) to find the opening of the duct where fluid drains out of the
      pancreas. People who have been diagnosed with pancreas divisum, have had at least two
      episodes of pancreatitis, and are candidates for the ERCP with sphincterotomy procedure may
      be eligible to participate. Participants will be will be randomly assigned to either have the
      ERCP with sphincterotomy procedure, or to have a &quot;sham&quot; procedure. Participants will have
      follow up visits 30 days after the procedure, 6 months after the procedure, and continuing
      every 6 months until a maximum follow-up period of 48 months.

      This is a sham-controlled, single blinded with a blinded outcome assessment, multi-center,
      randomized clinical trial of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) with minor
      papilla endoscopic sphincterotomy (miES) for the treatment of recurrent acute pancreatitis
      (RAP) with pancreas divisum. ERCP with miES is often offered in clinical practice to patients
      with RAP, pancreas divisum, and no other clear risk factors for their acute pancreatitis
      episodes. The hypothesis is that obstruction at the level of the minor papilla is one cause
      of RAP in pancreas divisum; miES will relieve the obstruction, thereby reducing the risk of a
      recurrent attack(s) of acute pancreatitis. The trial requires a total sample size of
      approximately 234 subjects, and a planned enrollment period of approximately 3.5 years with
      total planned study duration of 5 years (minimum follow-up of 6 months, maximum follow-up of
      48 months).

    <measure>To compare the incidence rate ratio of acute pancreatitis between treatment groups</measure>
    <time_frame>Incidence rate will be assessed starting 30 days after treatment through a maximum follow-up of 48 months.</time_frame>
    <description>All randomized subjects will be followed longitudinally until study completion (minimum follow-up of six months, maximum follow-up of 48 months), even if acute pancreatitis occurs during follow-up. A secondary benefit of miES may be a reduction in acute pancreatitis frequency, defined as the incidence rate (episodes/time pre- and post-randomization). Since baseline incidence rate is a probable predictor of post-randomization incidence rate, the investigators will compare the incidence rate ratios between the two arms, keeping person-time equal between the pre/post periods.</description>

    <description>Subjects randomized to EUS + sham will undergo a diagnostic endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) under sedation. The physician investigator will not make any attempts to achieve minor papilla cannulation, but photo document the minor papilla using a duodenoscope. Diluted dye will be injected into the duodenum. A small caliber prophylactic pancreatic duct stent will be deposited into the duodenal lumen. These maneuvers are performed to minimize the risk of unmasking.</description>

    <description>Subjects randomized to EUS + ERCP with miES will undergo the procedure at the same time as endoscopic ultrasound (EUS), under sedation. Indomethacin (100 mg) will be administered rectally at the onset of the ERCP procedure in patients with no known allergy to indomethacin. The techniques used to perform the endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP)with miES (minor papilla endoscopic sphincterotomy) will be left to the discretion of the study endoscopist. The extent of sphincterotomy will be per the discretion of the treating endoscopist. Unless methylene blue (or similar chromoendoscopy agent such as indigo carmine) has already been used to facilitate minor papilla cannulation, diluted dye will be injected into the duodenum.</description>
