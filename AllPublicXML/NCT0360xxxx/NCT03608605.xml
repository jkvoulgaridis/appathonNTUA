  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We aim to evaluate the role of conventional and advanced MRI sequences in:

        1. Establishing the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis and differentiate it from its mimics.

        2. Predict the prognosis and evaluate the treatment response in the first year of patients
           with multiple sclerosis.

      All patients in the study will be referred among those attend to Assuit university hospital
      with clinical symptoms suspicious of MS according to McDonald criteria 2017 with age range
      from (18-50 years old).

      MRI study will be done for each patient. MRI study will be repeated for those already
      diagnosed as MS after starting the suitable treatment as decided by attending physician after
      one year to assess the efficacy of treatment and the patient prognosis.

      MR imaging will be performed on a 1.5-T MR imaging unit (Siemens, Sembra medical
      system,German).

      Prospectively completed data forms will be analyzed and compared. Statistical tests
      appropriate to the nature of the data will be used.

      All patients will not be subjected to risk of any kind during this study. All patients' data
      will be confidentially kept. Approval of the ethical committee of Faculty of Medicine, Assiut
      University.

      An informed consent will be taken from all patients included in this study.

        -  The research will be conducted only by scientifically qualified and trained personnel.

        -  The procedures included in this study have been already used in hospital and centers in
           and outside Egypt.
