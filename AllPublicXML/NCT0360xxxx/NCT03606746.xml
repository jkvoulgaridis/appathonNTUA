  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of cellular
      immunotherapy with MDR-103 for induction of functional immune tolerance in past recipients of
      human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched, living donor kidney transplants.

    <textblock>
      Currently, patients receiving a transplanted kidney are required to take life-long
      immunosuppressive medications to prevent rejection of the transplanted kidney. These
      medications carry substantial side effects. In addition, these medicines often do not
      completely control damage to the kidney from the recipients' immune system, ultimately
      causing the kidney to fail.

      Medeor Therapeutics is developing a novel cell-based therapy to reprogram the past
      recipients' immune system to accept the transplanted kidney without the concurrent need for
      long term use of immunosuppressive drugs.

      The purpose of the current Phase 2 study is to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of MDR-103
      for the induction of transplant immune tolerance in a prospective, multicenter clinical
      trial. MDR-103 is intended to induce mixed lymphohematopoietic chimerism and donor specific
      immune tolerance in order to preserve transplant kidney function, avert transplant kidney
      rejection, and eliminate the cumulative and serious side effects associated with
      immunosuppressive drugs.

    <description>The primary efficacy endpoint is the proportion of subjects achieving persistent mixed chimerism in MDR-103 treated recipients of past HLA zero-mismatch living donor kidney transplants.
Persistent Mixed Chimerism - is defined as at least 6 months of persistent WBC mixed chimerism consisting of at least 5% donor cells in whole blood or in at least one WBC lineage (CD3+ T cells, CD33+ myeloid cells, CD19+ B cells, and/or CD56+ NK cells).</description>
