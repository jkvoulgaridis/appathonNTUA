  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical study is designed to assesses the benefit of adding pulsed shortwave therapy to
      the postoperative pain and recovery protocol following Cesarean section. Pulsed shortwave
      therapy is a safe adjunct pain therapy for acute and chronic pain.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pain is ranked highest among undesirable clinical outcomes associated with caesarean section
      therefore postoperative pain relief following a cesarean section is extremely important to
      optimize maternal and neonate well being. Multimodial analgesics are effective in reducing
      postoperative pain but analgesia is still not optimized. Opiate based analgesics are
      effective but having troubling side effects. Addition of non-drug pain therapies hold promise
      in improving postoperative recovery while potentially allowing for reduced use of drug based
      analgesics.

    <measure>Change in Visual Analogue Pain</measure>
    <time_frame>Data collected for 7 Days</time_frame>
    <description>The visual analog scale (VAS) has been used extensively for rating pain intensity in previous studies. Postoperative pain will be measured daily over a 7 day recovery period</description>

    <description>The benefits of mobility outlined in current nursing textbooks indicate that &quot;Early ambulation is the most significant general nursing measure to prevent postoperative complications&quot;. There the time in hours after the c-section operation when the patient becomes mobile(walking) will be used recorded.</description>
