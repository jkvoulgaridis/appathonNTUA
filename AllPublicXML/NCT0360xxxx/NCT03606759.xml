  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The management of the craving is a key element in addiction treatment as the craving is
      linked to the probability of relapse. Several cues could induce the craving, some generic
      substance-induced cues or addictive behavior-related cues (e.g. gambling-related cues), and
      also some more subject-specific cues. The awareness of the craving intensity and its
      individual cues for each patient will allow the clinician to tailor a better treatment. The
      aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of a program based on an Individually Adjusted
      Therapy scale added to a treatment as usual for the treatment of addiction.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Addiction is one of the most prevalent psychiatric disorders in general population. In the
      DSM-5, substance abuse and substance dependence have been combined into a single substance
      use disorder and gambling disorder is now reclassified in the new substance-related and
      addictive disorders category. Moreover, a criterion assessing the craving has been added. The
      management of craving is an important focus of addiction treatment as craving is often linked
      to relapse. Several cues could precipitate the craving. Some of them are substance-related or
      gambling-related, some other are more person-specific. Recent studies have revealed that
      those &quot;individual cues&quot; are highly predictive of craving and relapse, and suggest that they
      are involved in addiction chronicity. The awareness of these cues and the intensity of the
      craving are important to tailor a better treatment adapted to the patient's need in order to
      prevent relapse. The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of a program that includes
      an Individually Adjusted Therapy scale (ATI) to help the clinician to modulate the level of
      care regarding of the patient's risk of relapse (based on cues, intensity and frequency of
      the craving). The study will consist in a randomized controlled trial comparing 2 groups of
      participants that are seeking treatment for substance use disorder (alcohol, opiates,
      tobacco, cannabis, cocaine) or gambling disorder in an outpatient addiction clinics in France
      (four inclusion sites).

      All the participants will be assessed with several questionnaires that evaluate the history
      and the severity of addiction.
