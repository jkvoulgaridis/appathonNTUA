      • The aim of the VIP study is to investigate the impact of vulnerability markers
      (inflammatory serum biomarkers for systemic vulnerability, coronary shear stress and
      vulnerability mapping for pancoronary vulnerability, and imaging-based plaque features for
      systemic vulnerability) on the rate of major adverse cardiovascular events caused by
      progression of the non-culprit lesion in patients with acute ST or non-ST segment elevation
      myocardial infarction who undergo revascularization of the culprit lesion during the acute
      event. Furthermore, the study will evaluate the rate of progression of non-culprit lesions
      towards a higher degree of vulnerability, based on coronary computed tomography angiographic
      assessment at 1 year after enrollment.

      The project is a prospective, cohort, mono-centric study which will be carried out in the
      Center of Advanced Research in Multimodal Cardiac Imaging Cardiomed.

      The project will include 100 subjects who present ST and non-ST segment elevation myocardial
      infarction at 30 days prior to study enrollment, who underwent emergency revascularization of
      the culprit lesion. Samples for systemic serum biomarkers for myocardial injury, myocardial
      strain and enhanced systemic inflammation will be collected at the moment of the acute event.
      All patients will undergo coronary CT angiography, cardiac perfusion CT and intracoronary
      imaging procedures (Intravascular ultrasound - IVUS; Optical Coherence Tomography - OCT) at
      the moment of enrollment in the study, for complex assessment of non-culprit coronary
      lesions. The endothelial coronary shear stress will be calculated with imaging
      post-processing techniques on the CT data acquired at baseline, by using computational fluid
      dynamics.

      The study will be conducted over a period of 3 years, in which patients will be examined at
      baseline, and during several follow-up visits. At the one-year follow-up, the study subjects
      will undergo CT coronary angiography for re-evaluation of the non-culprit lesions, in the
      prospects of analyzing the rate of plaque progression towards a higher degree of
      vulnerability. At the end of the 3-year period, patients will be assessed about the
      occurrence of major adverse cardiovascular events and the rate or revascularization for
      non-culprit lesions.

      Study objectives:

      Primary: to investigate the association between systemic, pancoronary and local vulnerability
      features of coronary plaques and the risk for major adverse cardiac events - MACE (all-cause
      mortality, cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, repeated revascularization, repeated
      hospitalizations for cardiovascular related incidents, cerebrovascular events) during a
      3-year follow-up.

      Secondary: to assess the rate of progression for the non-culprit lesions towards a higher
      degree of vulnerability, as evaluated via coronary CT angiography at 1 year after enrollment,
      in relation to systemic, pancoronary and local vulnerability features at baseline.

      To identify the type of vulnerability (systemic, pancoronary or local) with the highest
      impact on plaque progression and future MACE
