  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute left heart failure (ALHF) is a sudden attack or deterioration of abnormal left heart
      function, which may impair myocardial contractility and increase cardiac loading, further
      result in decreased cardiac output, abrupt elevation of pulmonary and systemic circulation
      pressure, consequently trigger in acute pulmonary congestion, acute pulmonary edema and
      cardiac shock .

      Hypoxia and severe dyspnea may pose fatal threats for the patients suffered from ALHF should
      be alleviated as soon as possible, and thus oxygen therapy and ventilation support are
      regarded as important therapeutic measures for these patients. According to 2017 Chinese
      College of Emergency Physicians(CCEP) acute heart failure clinical guideline, invasive
      ventilation should be recommended to those patients whose symptoms still get worsening
      despite timely treatments.

      Intubation may increase the risks of infection and multiple organ failure, so timely
      extubation contributes to reduce the duration of mechanical ventilation and the rate of
      complications. But if extubation failure occurs, the patient often requires re-intubation
      that may induce the outset of complications, extend the length of stay and increase
      mortality.

      Heart failure proves to be high risk factor for extubation failure on the basis of previous
      studies. It is recommended to apply sequential non-invasive ventilation (NIV) if the patient
      receiving invasive ventilation for more than 24 hours and having high risk for extubation
      failure on the basis of 2017 American Thoracic Society(ATS) clinical guideline. It is worthy
      to note that NIV has many shortcomings, for example, it may induce dry oropharyngeal cavity,
      skin injury caused by mask oppression, gaseous distention, vomiting, respiratory aspiration,
      air leak, drying sputum, difficulty in coughing up phlegm and claustrophobia.

      As an emerging technology, high flow nasal oxygen (HFNO) has many advantages in airway
      humidification, tolerance and compliance which also can effectively improve pulmonary
      oxygenation function of patients with respiratory failure. Which therapeutic measure should
      be recommended for the patients with ALHF after extubation, NIV or HFNO? It is still unclear
      according to the latest management guidelines. So one perspective study will be launch to
      compare the difference between HFNO-group patients with NIV-group patients in re-intubation
      rate within 48 hours, oxygenation index, length of ICU stay, total hospital stay, mortality
      and compliance for evidence-based medicine.

      1. The anticipated number of patient subjects will reach 120 in the study. The patient's
           condition should be informed to his/her next of kin and then agree to signs the informed
           consent.

        2. When passing spontaneous breathing trials and removing tracheal tube, the patients
           should be divided into two groups by random digital table.

        3. Group A/HFNO group: the patients should receive the treatment of high flow nasal oxygen
           immediately after extubation. The initial flow speed was set at 30L/min and increased at
           5L/min in titrated type until the patient feels uncomfortable. The temperature was set
           at 37℃. The fraction of inspiration O2 was set in accordance with specific condition of
           patient to insure oxygen saturation more than 95%.

           Group B/NIV group: the patients should receive the treatment of non-invasive ventilation
           immediately after extubation. The initial pressure are set at a lower level (inspiratory
           pressure: 6-8cmH2O, expiratory pressure: 4cmH2O) and adjusted to a suitable level in
           10-20min. The fraction of inspiration O2 was set in accordance with specific condition
           of patient to insure oxygen saturation more than 95%.

        4. The criteria of successful extubation: the patient doesn't require re-intubation within
           48 hours after extubation.

           The criteria of extubation failure: the patient needs re-intubation and ventilation
           support within 48 hours after extubation.

        5. (1) Investigators should keep a record of these patient's general condition, for
           instance, age, sex, diagnosis, Apache II score, treatment, etc.(2) Investigators should
           routinely detect clinical manifestation, ventilation parameters and physiological
           indices of the recruited patients. Elementary monitoring indicators consist of vital
           signs, oxygen saturation, ECG, tidal volume, breathing rate, inspiratory pressure,
           expiratory pressure and blood gas analysis. Blood gas analysis should be evaluated on an
           average of 12 hours, within the range of 48 hours after extubation.(3) Clinical
           prognosis of these patients should be recorded, including the rate of weaning failure,
           re-intubation rate, time for re-intubation, causes of re-intubation, duration of
           HFNO/HIV, length of ICU stay, hospitalization time and number of death.（4） The data of
           adverse effect derived from devices applied in the study should be recorded. HFNO group:
           dry nasal cavity, dry oropharyngeal cavity, dysphagia.HIV group: dry oropharyngeal
           cavity, skin injury caused by mask oppression, gaseous distention, vomiting, respiratory
           aspiration, air leak, drying sputum, difficulty in coughing up phlegm and
           claustrophobia.
