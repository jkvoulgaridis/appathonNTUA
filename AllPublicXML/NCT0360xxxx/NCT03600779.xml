  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The development of in vivo biomarkers sensitive to myelin disruption represents a major
      clinical need to be able to monitor the demyelination processes as well as the effect of
      remyelinating therapies in multiple sclerosis. The investigators recently proposed a
      technique, derived from the conventional magnetisation transfer (MT): inhomogeneous
      Magnetisation Transfer (ihMT). In preliminary studies, this simple-to-implement and robust
      technique has shown great sensitivity for evaluating the demyelination processes. The goal of
      the project is to evaluate the ability of ihMT to measure and describe the spontaneous
      demyelination and remyelination processes involved in active lesions in a population of
      patients with MS at the the disease onset.
