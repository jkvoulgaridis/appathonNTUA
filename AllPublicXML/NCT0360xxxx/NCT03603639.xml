  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of the study is to assess the pharmacodynamic (PD) activity of E2730 as
      measured by suppression of epileptic photoparoxysmal response (PPR) in the participant's most
      sensitive eye condition in participants with photosensitive epilepsy.

    <textblock>
      Adult participants with epilepsy will be enrolled in this study. This study will consist of 2
      phases: Prerandomization and Randomization Phase.

      The Prerandomization Phase will consist of a Screening Period (up to 3 weeks), during which
      each participant's study eligibility will be determined and baseline assessments will be
      conducted. The Randomization Phase will consist of 3 Treatment Periods with a single dose in
      each period (placebo, E2730 40 mg, or E2730 120 mg), each separated by a 3-week washout
      interval for a total of approximately 6 weeks, and a Follow-up Period (3 weeks after the last
      dose of study drug).
