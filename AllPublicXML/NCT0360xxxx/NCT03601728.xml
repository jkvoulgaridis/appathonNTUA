  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The mission is to develop novel interventions to improve cognitive function, and thereby
      reducing delirium in hospitalized patients to improve perioperative outcomes. Delirium
      affects up to 42% of hospitalized patients and disproportionately increases morbidity and
      mortality in older adults, especially after surgical procedures. Current approaches prevent
      only 30-40% of delirium cases. The goal is to use prehabilitation (an individualized exercise
      regimen performed in the 2-4 weeks prior to admission) to improve peri-operative cognitive
      status, mobility and recovery. Based on preliminary data, the investigators propose to deeply
      phenotype patients, meaning to study the patient, the disease and surgery in a very detailed
      fashion, with elective knee or hip replacement surgery and use a personalized prehabilitation
      intervention compared to standard pre-operative care. To facilitate data collection over the
      course of the study, the investigators use wearable devices and mobile phone applications.

      The fiscal burden estimated at $164 billion annually in the US alone, with delirium often
      leading to significant increases in hospital length of stay. The pathophysiology of delirium
      is multifactorial and incompletely understood. Disruption of circadian rhythms, with
      subsequent impairment of alertness, and increased inflammation including neuroinflammation,
      is common in hospital environments, and is associated with poorer outcome, particularly in
      the elderly.

      An intriguing new therapeutic concept currently emerging in the area of elective surgery is
      prehabilitation, a form of exercise training, which when pre-emptively administered in the
      weeks prior to admission, has the potential to improve postoperative cognitive status,
      mobility and recovery, thereby minimizing complications such as delirium. Our team has
      recently developed a novel personalized medicine intervention that uses wearable devices
      (smartwatches) to create an individualized exercise regimen for older adults that can
      facilitate prehabilitation and monitor adherence to the prehabilitation regimen while the
      patient is at home. In one sense, prehabilitation can be conceptualized as bouts of physical
      exercise performed at home prior to admission, which, when adequately timed using guidance by
      a wrist-worn biometric mobile device (smartwatch), augment the robustness of circadian
      rhythms, particularly in the elderly. This intervention has the potential to have a high
      impact because of its low cost, personalized nature, and ability to monitor adherence to
      confirm maximization of functional status prior to admission.

    <description>Four weeks prior to the scheduled (elective) surgery, participants will receive a 60-minute in person education session how to increase the level of physical activity. This will be followed by 4 weeks of keeping this level of physical activity, which will be monitored and supported by personalized interactive prompts delivered by a smartwatch. This approach is called personalized prehabilitation.</description>

    <description>The 60-minute education session includes a 30-minute general education on exercise in older adults and a 30-minute instruction on participating in the study intervention (how to work with the personalized circadian-based activity guideline). The education session will be developed and presented by the PI and the certified exercise trainer. The general education session will be designed using materials from Go4Life program from the National Institute on Aging (https://go4life.nia.nig.gov). The personalized circadian-based activity guideline (exercise goal and plan) will be developed by the investigators and the exercise trainer based on the individual's typical daily circadian profile, functional status, preference for exercise.</description>
