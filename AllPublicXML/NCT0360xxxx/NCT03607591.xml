  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study evaluates the efficacy of 3 weeks of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation
      (rTMS), 5 sessions/weekly, in reducing cocaine consumption immediately after and within the 8
      weeks following the treatment in addicted patients with cocaine use disorders (CUD) versus
      placebo.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      40 patients are expected and randomized in two groups: 20 patients with active rTMS and 20
      with placebo rTMS.

      Visit 1: 15 days (3 weeks of 5 consecutive daily sessions and 2 days of rest) 15Hz rTMS is
      performed during the following days in addition to a biweekly urine drug test and VAS
      evaluation.

      Visit 2: Changes from baseline to week 8 in cocaine intake. Evaluation of craving and of
      other assessments like mood and quality of life.
