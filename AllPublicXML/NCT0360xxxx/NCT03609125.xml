      A non-randomized, monocentric clinical study with a four month follow-up period , using a
      cord blood serum (CBS) eye drops in glaucoma patients. The purpose of the study analyzes
      whether the addition of CBS to hypotonic therapy is able to slow down the progression of
      anatomical and functional damage induced by glaucoma. The study evaluates the differences
      after two months of treatment as compared to baseline and after two-month from the end of the
      treatment.

      The treatment of neuroprotection of degenerative ophthalmological diseases is currently
      proposed by administering products belonging to the category of food supplements
      (nutraceuticals containing amino acids and vitamins) or compounds of vegetable origin
      (Curcumin, flavonoids taken with food consumption of apples and oranges, LBP Polysaccharides
      from goji berries etc) or specific synthesis molecules (Memantine, Citicoline, Brimonidine,
      Omotaurina, Polyphenols).

      The rationale for the use of eye drops prepared from the blood, and in particular Cord Blood
      Serum (CBS), as a source is mainly based on its content in growth factors (Growth factors,
      GF). with particular reference in neurotrophic GFs .

      Enrollment of 10 patients with glaucoma and documented progressive retinal ganglion cells
      (RGC) dysfunction and degeneration was performed. The product to be administered was analyzed
      with respect to the levels of BDNF (Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor), beta-NGF (Neural
      Growth Factor) , GDNF (Glial Derived Neuronal Factor), and EGF (Epidermal Growth Factor).

      Functional, electro-physiological, and structural parameters were evaluated at baseline,
      after two months of treatment, and after two months from the end of the treatment.
