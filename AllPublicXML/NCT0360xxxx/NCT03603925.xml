  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Standardized Uptake Values (SUVs), normalized activity concentration, measured using PET/MR
      have inaccuracies â‰¥ 20% which exceeds National Cancer Institute / American College of
      Radiology Imaging Network (NCI/ACRIN), Radiological Society of North America / Quantitative
      Imaging Biomarkers Alliance (RSNA/QIBA) specifications and disqualifies PET/MR from
      multicenter or cooperative group clinical trials. High inaccuracy is primarily due to poor
      attenuation correction (AC) owing to lack of computed tomography (CT) data. This study will
      develop acquisition and analyses methods to synthesize CT images from MR data that can be
      used to achieve SUVs that are within 5% of those obtained using PET/CT (reference standard),
      thus meeting accuracy requirements needed to qualify for multicenter trials.

      The overall goal of this research project is to validate clinically practical methods for
      producing MR-based attenuation correction information which is needed to produce
      quantitatively accurate PET images from a PET/MR scanner. Existing commercial PET/MR systems
      use methods that are inaccurate.

      Objective The primary objective is to demonstrate that, using the new acquisition and
      analysis methods for MR-AC, PET SUVs in lesions and normal tissues can be measured using
      PET/MR and be within 5% agreement of those measured using PET/CT.

      The secondary objective is to demonstrate visual and quantitative agreement between
      synthesized CT images generated from MR data and the reference, measured CT images.

      Study Design This study would like to enroll patients receiving a clinically indicated PET/CT
      scan. The patients will be asked to agree to a receive research PET/MR scan within the study
      which requires additional time and potential MR risks for the patient. It does not entail
      extra injections or radiation exposure. Research acquisition and processing will be performed
      on the PET/MR data to create PET images that are expected to have quantitatively accurate
      SUVs. These will be compared to SUVs from the clinical PET/CT which will serve as the
      reference standard.

      Outcome By bringing together cutting-edge advances in both MR acquisition and image analyses,
      the successful completion of these aims will achieve SUVs that are within 5% of those
      obtained with PET/CT (reference standard) with clinically appropriate acquisition time, image
      quality, and diagnostic accuracy, so that PET/MR systems meet SUV accuracy requirements
      needed to qualify for cooperative group clinical trials.

    <description>The Philips Ingenuity PET/MR is used for research scanning. Patients receiving a clinically indicated PET/CT, will be approached to be included in this study. There is no special preparation other than that needed for the prerequisite PET/CT scanning. At the completion of the PET/CT scanning, the subject will be taken to the PET/MR scanner, which is in close in proximity, for research scanning. The research scanning would take up to one hour or as tolerated.</description>
