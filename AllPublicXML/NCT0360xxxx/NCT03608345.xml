    <textblock>
      Space maintainers are appliances that applied when primary teeth were lost prematurely
      because of many reasons such as tooth decay, trauma, lack of germ of permanent tooth.4 Space
      problems play an important role in practice of dentistry and also understanding of the dental
      development in the primary and mixed dentitions could help to intercept the malocclusion.The
      aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of applied space maintainers on periodontal
      health and dental status after teeth missing in pediatric dentistry clinic.

      The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Istanbul University Faculty of
      Dentistry (No:2014/8) and was carried out in agreement with the Declaration of Helsinki
      principles. This study conducted 104 patient whose age between the range of 4-15 years were
      chosen to applied fixed (band and loop, palatal arch, lingual arch) or removable space
      maintainers in Istanbul University Faculty of Dentistry Department of Pediatric Dentistry
      were followed between years of 2013-2014. Totally, four of the patients excluded due to
      systemically and genetically disorder.

      In primary and mixed dentition, dft index was used and in permanent dentition DMFT index was
      used. Longevity time in the mouth, the number of developing new caries were evaluated and
      DMFT/dft and plaque index were compared.
