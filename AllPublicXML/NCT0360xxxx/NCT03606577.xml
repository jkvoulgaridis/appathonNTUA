  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      According to international guidelines, upfront therapy for transplant eligible myeloma
      patients should include triplet induction containing proteasome inhibitor and
      immunomodulatory agent, autologous stem cell transplant, PI+Imid based triplet consolidation
      and lenalidomide maintenance. Despite this approach, virtually all MM patients experience
      disease relapse, especially those with High Risk disease defined by adverse cytogenetic
      abnormalities (i.e. del(17p), or t(14;16) or t(4;14)) detected by FISH and/or SNP arrays.
      Indeed, HR myeloma is associated with poorer progression free survival and overall survival
      and frontline therapy should therefore be improved for this subset of HR patients. The
      primary objective of this prospective multicenter, open label, interventional phase 2 trial
      is to evaluate the feasibility of an intensive program including quadruplet induction and
      consolidation, tandem autologous stem cell transplantation and maintenance in newly diagnosed
      multiple myeloma patients presenting with HR cytogenetic. Quadruplet induction and
      consolidation include carfilzomib, lenalidomide, dexamethasone and daratumumab. Maintenance
      will include lenalidomide and daratumumab. Secondary objectives will include efficacy
      parameters (i.e. response rate, minimal residual disease, safety, progression free survival,
      overall survival).
