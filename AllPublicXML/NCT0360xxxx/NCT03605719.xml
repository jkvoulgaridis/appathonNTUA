      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of wild-type reovirus (pelareorep)
      when given together with dexamethasone, carfilzomib, and nivolumab in treating patients with
      multiple myeloma that has come back (relapsed). Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as
      dexamethasone, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing
      the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Carfilzomib
      may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.
      Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab, may help the body's immune
      system attack the cancer and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and
      spread. A virus, called pelareorep, which has been changed in a certain way, may be able to
      kill tumor cells without damaging normal cells. Giving dexamethasone, carfilzomib, and
      nivolumab with pelareorep may work better in treating patients with multiple myeloma.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Identify maximum tolerated dose of pelareorep in combination with other antineoplastic
      agents.

      II. Identify whether the combination of carfilzomib and nivolumab lead to a safety profile
      different than what has been reported with either agent independently.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess the relative roles of immune-mediated and direct cytotoxic myeloma cell killing.

      II. Understand the clinical benefit of nivolumab in programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1)
      positive multiple myeloma (MM) cells.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of pelareorep. Patients are assigned to 1 of 3 arms.

      ARM 1: Patients receive dexamethasone intravenously (IV) on days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, and 16,
      carfilzomib IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, and 16, and nivolumab IV over 30
      minutes on days 1 and 15. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM 2: Patients receive dexamethasone IV on days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, and 16, pelareorep IV on
      days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, and 16, carfilzomib IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, and 16,
      and nivolumab IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 15. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM 3 (expansion cohort): Patients receive dexamethasone IV on days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, and 16,
      pelareorep IV on days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, and 16, carfilzomib IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 2, 8,
      9, 15, and 16, and nivolumab IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 15. Cycles repeat every 28 days
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for a minimum of 4 weeks once
      off treatment or at least 100 days after the last nivolumab dose, then every 6 months after.

          -  Females of childbearing potential (FCBP) must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy
             test prior to starting therapy. The effects of pelareorep and nivolumab on the
             developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason, women of child-bearing potential
             and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth
             control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation.
             Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is
             participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.
             Female of childbearing potential (FCBP) is a sexually mature woman who: 1) has not
             undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy; or 2) has not been naturally
             postmenopausal for at least 24 consecutive months (i.e., has had menses at any time in
             the preceding 24 consecutive months)

          -  The patient must be willing to comply with fertility requirements as below:

               -  Male patients must agree to use an adequate method of contraception for the
                  duration of the study and for 7 months afterwards

               -  Female patients must be either postmenopausal, free from menses ≥ 2 years,
                  surgically sterilized, willing to use two adequate barrier methods of
                  contraception to prevent pregnancy, or agree to abstain from heterosexual
                  activity starting with screening and for 5 months after last treatment in all
                  patients

               -  Patients must agree not to donate blood, sperm/ova while taking protocol therapy
                  and for at least 7 months after stopping treatment (for males) and 5 months after
                  stopping treatment (for females)

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document

          -  Patients with a prior or concurrent malignancy whose natural history or treatment does
             not have the potential to interfere with the safety or efficacy assessment of the
             investigational regimen are eligible for this trial

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection or active hepatitis B or C due to
             risk of viral infectivity of pelareorep

          -  Known pulmonary hypertension

          -  Patients who are receiving any other anti-myeloma investigational agents

          -  Polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, monoclonal protein, skin changes (POEMS)
             syndrome, primary amyloidosis (AL amyloidosis), and Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia

          -  Patients who have had anti-myeloma treatment, radiotherapy, plasmapheresis, or major
             surgery (as defined by the investigator) within 2 weeks prior to cycle 1 day 1 of the
             study. Patients may be receiving concomitant therapy with bisphosphonates and low dose
             corticosteroids (e.g., prednisone up to but no more than 10 mg by mouth daily or its
             equivalent) for symptom management and comorbid conditions

          -  Uncontrolled illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection,
             symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia,
             myocardial infarction in the preceding 6 months, or psychiatric illness/social
             situations that would limit compliance with study requirements

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because protocol therapy has the potential
             for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential
             risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to protocol treatment of the
             mother, breastfeeding should be discontinued
