    <textblock>
      Currently, there are two types of vaccines available against pertussis (whooping cough), an
      infectious disease of the respiratory tract that can be extremely serious in very young
      children.

      Both have advantages and disadvantages: The acellular form (aP, mainly used in resource-rich
      countries) does not appear to offer as long lasting protection, but the whole cell vaccine
      (wP, mainly used in LMIC) appears to be generally more reactogenic. There is consensus that a
      &quot;better pertussis vaccine&quot; ought to be designed.

      The GaPs trial is part of a series of clinical trials performed by the PERtussIS COrrelates
      of Protection Europe (PERISCOPE) Consortium, an EU-funded group of investigators which aims
      to generate knowledge on immune responses to pertussis. A better understanding of human
      biomarkers of protective immune responses to B. pertussis and its waning immunity is needed
      to accelerate the design and testing of new pertussis vaccines with a longer duration of
      protection.

      This proposal describes the design and objectives of the clinical trial to be conducted in
      the Gambia, which is the only site in Africa involved in the consortium and involves the
      recruitment of 600 mother/infant pairs. Pregnant women will be randomised to receive either
      the usually recommended tetanus vaccination or a combination vaccine against whooping cough,
      diptheria, tetanus and polio. Their infants will receive either aP or wP as part of their EPI
      vaccines, and resulting immune responses will be characterized in detail up to the age of 9
      months. The investigators will use immunological assays to investigate the functional humoral
      and cellular responses to pertussis in infants born to mothers who are randomized to
      receiving pertussis vaccine in pregnancy or not, and their infants who will receive either aP
      or wP vaccine.

      Our research questions are:

      Does vaccination against pertussis in pregnancy have impact on subsequent immune responses to
      pertussis vaccine and other EPI vaccines in the infants Does vaccination of infants with wP
      vaccine induce different levels and functionality of antibody and/or T cell responses than
      vaccination with aP vaccine What is the difference in innate and acquired immunity- as
      measured with novel systems vaccinology tools- between being vaccinated with wP versus aP?
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are conducting a randomised, controlled, double-blinded, clinical vaccine
      trial in pregnant women combined with an open-label controlled Phase IV clinical vaccine
      trial in their infants.

      The trial will examine the differences in immunity generated by aP compared with wP in
      infants at 5 and 9 months of age, and examine the impact of maternal antibodies on the immune
      response of infants receiving aP or wP vaccines at two, three and four months.

      The investigators aim to address two key question: 1. If measures of immunity in infants
      given aP or wP differ by 5 and 9 months of age; and 2: If and- if so- how maternal pertussis
      antibodies affect the development and maintenance of immunity to Bordetella pertussis in
      infants.

      Rationale for the trial:

      Pertussis (whooping cough) is an infectious disease that can be very serious- particularly in
      young infants- but preventable through vaccination. There are two types of vaccines:
      acellular (aP) and whole cell (wP) vaccines, both extensively used worldwide. A clearer
      understanding of how these two different types of vaccines work is fundamental when
      considering adjustments or rethinking vaccination strategies and such knowledge will help the
      future development of new vaccines, given that some LMIC have already introduced aP but the
      current WHO recommendation still continues to recommend wP vaccine for those who have not yet
      switched.

      Increases in the incidence of pertussis infection, including fatal cases in young infants,
      have been recently observed in many regions in the world, more likely associated with the use
      of aP vaccines. As a consequence, it is now recommended in several countries that women
      should receive aP vaccination in pregnancy so that their high levels of pertussis antibody
      which will be passed on via the placenta can protect their babies in early life, before the
      infants have received sufficient doses of pertussis vaccine themselves. However, it is
      currently unclear if and how maternal antibodies affect long-term immunity to pertussis in
      infants.

      Unlike in the UK, where many women of childbearing age would have received aP vaccine in
      childhood, in The Gambia, all women would have been primed with wP vaccine as part of the
      NIP. Hence a study in this group of women is uniquely placed to assess if different priming
      regimens could have different quantitative and qualitative effects on transplacental antibody
      transfer for pertussis antibody, providing additional insights in comparison to parallel
      studies in Europe under the PERISCOPE consortium (PERtussIS COrrelates of Protection Europe).

      A better understanding of human biomarkers of protective immune responses to B. pertussis,
      and its waning immunity is needed to accelerate the design and testing of new pertussis
      vaccines with a longer duration of protection.

      Trial design:

      The investigators will recruit 600 mother/infant pairs. Following informed consent,
      sensitisation and eligibility checks including antenatal ultrasound to date the pregnancy,
      pregnant women will be randomised to receive either Boostrix IPV (contains antigens against
      pertussis, tetanus, diphteria and polio)- a vaccine recommended for pregnant women in the UK
      and other countries where recent pertussis outbreaks have been observed, or the tetanus
      vaccine routinely recommended for women in LMIC.

      Pre vaccination antibody titres will be measured in the women prior to vaccination between
      28-34 week gestation and vaccine responses measured subsequently at the time of giving birth.
      Cord blood will be collected to measure transfer of maternal antibody. Infants will be
      grouped to receive either aP or wP at 2,3 and 4 months of age, in line with routine EPI
      programs. Blood samples will be collected from infants prior to vaccination and following
      doses of vaccines at specific intervals to measure innate and acquired immune responses and
      followed up until 9 months of age. Infants will be allocated to subgroups for blood tests so
      that no infant will have between 4 and max 5 episodes of blood sampling up to the age of 9
      months.

      Samples will be processed for quantitative and qualitative antibody, innate and acquired
      cellular immune responses. Where available, samples will be stored for further investigations
      using transcriptomic and epigenetic methodologies. Samples, results and data will be shared
      with the PERISCOPE consortium members.
