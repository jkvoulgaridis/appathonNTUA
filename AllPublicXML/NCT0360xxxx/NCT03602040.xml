  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inherited heart conditions (IHCs) can cause young sudden deaths due to a genetic trait that
      leads to a thickened heart muscle or abnormal heart rhythms. Relatives of an affected person
      have a 50% chance of inheriting IHCs and this is determined either through a blood test
      (predictive genetic test) and/or physical tests such as a heart tracing (electrocardiogram),
      scan (echocardiogram) and exercise test. When patients find out they are affected or are
      carriers for an IHC, they have numerous questions about medical management, prognosis,
      lifestyle; as well as experiencing stress and anxiety because of the impact on their health
      and risk to their family. Based on published studies and interviews, a psychoeducational
      intervention underpinned by Self-determination Theory was developed to support these patients
      An uncontrolled study to determine the feasibility of the intervention and outcome measures
      will be undertaken. Patients with a new IHC diagnosis or a carrier result aged 16 years and
      older will be recruited from outpatient clinics in London and will be receive the
      intervention consisting of a disease-specific information leaflet, a personalised lifestyle
      consideration guide and participation in a 1-hour group session facilitated by a cardiac
      genetic nurse. Outcome measures to look at degree of self-determination, autonomy support and
      competence; and heart-related anxiety will be collected at baseline and at 3 months post
      intervention. Clinical and socio-demographic data will be obtained from medical notes. The
      feasibility and acceptability of the intervention will be measured by assessment of the study
      procedures such as recruitment, retention and any adverse events. It is expected that there
      will be up to 4 consecutive group sessions and feedback from each session will be used to
      co-design and refine the intervention model for a definitive clinical trial.
