  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will implement a new treatment regimen for patients with advanced and inoperable
      pancreatic cancer using chemotherapy combinations of Folfirinox or gemcitabine-nab paclitaxel
      (abraxane) followed by a short course of high dose radiation called Stereotactic Body
      Radiation Therapy (SBRT). While the chemotherapy is standard of care, the strategy of adding
      SBRT has not been investigated. An increase in the percentage of patients who can proceed to
      have surgery to remove their disease is anticipated with this approach.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study will evaluate safety and tolerability of neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed
      by SBRT. Patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC) and borderline pancreatic
      inoperable cancer will be assigned to one of two treatment arms based upon performance status
      and physician's discretion. The two treatment arms are: Folfirinox or gemcitabine-nab
      paclitaxel (abraxane). There are no study drugs as all treatments are based on standard
      clinical pathways.

      After two cycles of treatment patients will be restaged with CT scans or imaging. If the
      tumor remains resectable, borderline, or unresectable without progression of disease, then
      the patient will proceed to SBRT.

      Follow-up visits will continue every three months for up to one year or until progression of
      disease.
