      Validation Study: A Prospective, Non-Randomized, Single Arm Trial to Assess the Efficacy of
      the Comfort Plug™ in Preventing Urinary Incontinence in Male Subjects with Post Prostatectomy
      Urinary Incontinence (COMFORT STUDY)

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a first-in-human, device assessment, feasibility study to assess the safety,
      effectiveness, comfort and usability of the prototype Comfort Plug™ for controlling urinary
      incontinence in male subjects. No drug treatment will be administered.

    <measure>International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire - Short Form (ICIQ-SF)</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days</time_frame>
    <description>The ICIQ is a psychometrically robust patient-completed questionnaire for evaluating the frequency, severity and impact of urinary incontinence (UI) on Quality of Life in men and women. The ICIQ-SF is scored from 0 to 21, with greater scores indicating increased severity of UI. The change from baseline (Visit Day 0) in the ICIQ-SF score at Visit Days 7 and 30 (cohort 1) or Visit Days 14 and 30 (subsequent cohorts) will be examined.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Incontinence Quality of Life Questionnaire (I-QOL)</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days</time_frame>
    <description>The questionnaire has a scale of 22-110; The higher the score, the less incontinence is having a negative impact on the subject's Quality of Life. Change from baseline (Visit Day 0) in the I-QOL instrument scores at Visit Days 14 and 30 for i) avoidance and limiting behavior ii) psychosocial impacts iii) social embarrassment will be examined.</description>
