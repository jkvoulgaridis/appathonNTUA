      Brief Summary: Low back pain is very common problem in all the developed countries and
      affects children to elderly. Based on the etiology the low back pain is divided into two
      type: nonspecific and specific low back pain. If the pathological reason is known it is
      defined as specific and if the reason for the pain is unknown it is defined as nonspecific
      low back pain. The postulated reason for nonspecific low back pain is the segmental
      instability of the lumbar spine. Diaphragm muscle has a role in maintaining the segmental
      stability. The aim of this study to reduce the severity of the low back pain with improving
      the stability of the lumbar spine by using diaphragm training.

      The study is a randomized controlled trial. The participants are divided randomly into two
      groups. One of the groups take part in a complex training which contains stretching,
      strengthening, mobilizing exercises and proprioceptive training and this training is
      completed by diaphragm strengthening exercises. This group is defined as diaphragm training
      group. The members of the diaphragm training group use the POWERbreathe Medic Plus device.
      Opposed to the diaphragm training group the members of the control group take part only in
      the complex training without strengthening the diaphragm muscle. The pain intensity is
      assessed by Visual Analogue Scale and the diameter of the stabilizer muscles' belly is
      measured by B-mode ultrasound examination, using Zonare Z.One Ultrasound System (Mountain
      View, CA, USA). The thickness of the transversus abdominis muscle, the lumbar multifidus
      muscle and the diaphragm muscle is assessed in two different positions: during lying and
      during sitting position with weightlifting. The muscles are measured in two different states:
      a relaxed and a contracted state. Functional tests and a balance platform (NeuroCom) are used
      to measure the stability, and the function of the diaphragm is assessed by using a
      POWERbreathe KH2 device.

    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The severity of the pain is measured with Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) before and after the intervention. This is a semi-objective, self-report device that is used extensively to measure such complaints as pain. The sclale is a 10 cm line. The scale is anchored by 'no pain' (0 score) and 'worst imaginable pain' (score of 10). Therefore the higher values represent a worse outcome. When using the Visual Analogue Scale, the participants had to mark on a 10 cm long line the average severity of lumbar pain and we measured the distance of their mark from the zero point in cm-s.</description>
