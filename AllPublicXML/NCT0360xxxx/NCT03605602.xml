      This is a descriptive observational study, in which data are collected in an epidemiological
      fashion. This study does not intend to alter or intervene the current medical practice of the
      recruited patients. Data will be collected in prospective manner.

      The eligible patients will be recruited after NGS analysis for tumor tissue and the
      inform-consent is obtained. The study required information will be collected (every 3
      months).
