      This study use a single-center, randomized, open, three-cycle, self-control trial design. It
      is planning to enroll 15 healthy adult male subjects. Fifteen subjects will randomize into 3
      test groups which corresponding to 3 different dosing sequences. Subjects will be giving a
      single oral dose in per cycle, and there will have three types of breakfast administration
      after each treatment. Washing period is 10 days during the cycle.
