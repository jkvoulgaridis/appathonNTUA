  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      BACKGROUND: Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is the third most common endocrine disorder.
      The Ca/P ratio is an accurate tool to differentiate patients with PHPT (&gt;3.5 if Ca and P are
      expressed in mg/dl) from healthy subjects. The reliability of this index is based on the fact
      that serum Ca and P are inversely related together. However, other disorders of the Ca-P
      metabolism, such as hypophosphoremia (HypoP) not related to PHPT, might also impair the Ca/P
      ratio.

      OBJECTIVE: To validate the accuracy of Ca/P ratio in the diagnosis of Ca-P metabolism
      disorders, including also patients with documented HypoP not related to PHPT.

      METHODS: A single-center, retrospective, case-control study will be carried out.

      Biochemical measurements will include parathormone (PTH), vitamin D, serum Ca and P, serum
      albumin and creatinine.
