    <textblock>
      This pilot randomized phase II trial studies who well chlorine dioxide sterilization works in
      reducing oral mucositis in patients with stage I-IV head and neck cancer who are undergoing
      radiotherapy. Chlorine dioxide sterilization may help to treat oral mucositis.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate and compare CloSYS Unflavored Oral Rinse effect on the incidence of severe
      oral oral mucositis (OM) (&gt;= World Health Organization [WHO] grade 3).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate and compare CloSYS Unflavored Oral Rinse effect on the time to onset of severe
      OM (&gt;= WHO grade 3).

      II. To evaluate and compare CloSYS Unflavored Oral Rinse effect on the duration of severe OM
      (&gt;= WHO grade 3).

      III. To evaluate and compare CloSYS Unflavored Oral Rinse effect in patient reported outcomes
      as measured by the Oral Mucositis Weekly Questionnaire (OMWQ).

      IV. To evaluate and compare CloSYS Unflavored Oral Rinse effect on rates of radiation therapy
      (RT) interruption.

      V. To evaluate and compare CloSYS Unflavored Oral Rinse effect on the oral microbiome.

      VI. To evaluate and compare CloSYS Unflavored Oral Rinse effect on salivary TNFalpha,
      IL-1beta, and IL-6 levels.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized into 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive chlorine dioxide sterilization oral rinse over 30 seconds twice daily
      (BID) from the start of radiation therapy (RT) to the evening prior to the 1 month RT
      follow-up appointment.

      ARM II: Patients receive placebo oral rinse over 30 seconds BID from the start of RT to the
      evening prior to the 1 month RT follow-up appointment.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up on day 1.

    <time_frame>Up to 30 days post radiotherapy</time_frame>
    <description>Will be compared between arms. Analysis will be performed by estimating the proportion with exact 95% binomial confidence interval for each group separately. Statistical testing will use a chi-square test. As an alternative, Fisher?s Exact Test will be used if the minimum expected value is &lt; 5.
WHO Scale: Grade 0 (none) - None; Grade I (mild) - Oral soreness, erythema; Grade II (moderate) - Oral erythema, ulcers, solid diet tolerated; Grade III (severe) - Oral ulcers, liquid diet only; Grade IV (life-threatening) - Oral alimentation impossible.</description>
