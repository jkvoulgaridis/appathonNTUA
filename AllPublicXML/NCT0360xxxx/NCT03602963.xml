      1. The accuracy of the sensors (Dexcom G5 vs FreeStyle Libre Flash glucose monitoring) will
           be evaluated by simultaneous wearing of the 2 sensors during 2 weeks. During these 2
           weeks the patients will do at least four capillary blood glucose measurements to compare
           with the sensor results.

        2. Patient satisfaction will be evaluated using a questionnaire that will be completed
           after the Dexcom G5 sensor has been worn for 1 month.

        3. The data recorded by the FreeStyle Libre Flash glucose monitoring system (average
           glucose,% above target, % within target, % under target, amount of hypoglycemia) in the
           month prior to the 2 weeks of double sensor wear will be compared to the same data
           recorded by the Dexcom G5 mobile CGM system during the first month of use.

    <measure>Patients' and parents' satisfaction with the Dexcom G5 mobile CGM system will be evaluated by a standardized questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>Patients' and parents' satisfaction with the Dexcom G5 mobile CGM system will be evaluated by a standardized questionnaire after 1 month of sensor wear. Patients and parents will rate their experience with the Dexcom G5 mobile CGM system on a scale of 1 (strongly agree) to 5 (strongly disagree). There are three questions about sensor application (e.g. It is easy to put the sensor on) and eleven questions about the wearing of the sensor (e.g. The sensor doesn't disturb me for sporting).</description>
