  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The survival rate of children with cancer has improved significantly in recent years thanks
      to the progress of different therapies. The neurocognitive sequelae related to treatments and
      illness are more or less well known. Four factors seem to be associated with neurocognitive
      sequelae: treatment, the tumor itself, environmental factors like the socio-economic status
      of parents and biological factors.

      Main purpose of the study is to establish a score to assess the risk of neurocognitive
      sequelae in these children based on these factors (treatment, tumor, and environmental
      factors)

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Patients treated for a brain tumor</arm_group_label>
    <description>As part of their usual follow-up, these patients have neuropsychological evaluations following their treatment. A complete neuropsychological evaluation will therefore be performed as part of their usual follow-up during the inclusion period of this study and only the data from this evaluation will be taken into account for the statistical analysis of this study.</description>
  </arm_group>
  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Patients treated for a non-cerebral tumor</arm_group_label>
    <description>A single neuropsychological assessment will be proposed to these patients after the end of treatment and during the inclusion period of this study. This evaluation will be carried out during a visit to Gustave Roussy as part of their usual follow-up. If on the occasion of this evaluation, cognitive disorders or psychological disorders were highlighted, a neuropsychological and / or psychological follow-up would be proposed.</description>
  </arm_group>
  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Patients who received Methotrexate</arm_group_label>
    <description>Methotrexate is used in the treatment of certain brain tumors as in that of non-cerebral tumors. Some of these patients, particularly those who have had neurological complications with methotrexate, will already have longitudinal neuropsychological follow-up as part of their usual follow-up. For these patients, only one complete neuropsychological assessment will be performed during the inclusion period and will be considered for statistical analysis.
For patients in the course of treatment with methotrexate, during the period of inclusion of this study, a longitudinal follow-up will be carried out with neuropsychological evaluations close and successive at the time of their coming to Gustave Roussy within the usual framework of their care.</description>

    <description>The WISC-IV (Weschler, 2003) which is measured with several indices:
A Verbal Understanding Index (VUI), which comprehensively assesses the child's verbal skills
Perceptual reasoning index (PRI), which assesses isuoperceptive and visuo-practical capacities
An index of working memory (IWM), which assesses the child's ability to do several things at the same time (double-tasks)
A rate of treatment index (RTI) that assesses grapho-motor speed</description>
