      A prospective double-blinded randomized controlled trial will be performed with a baseline
      assessment 2 weeks after childbirth with follow-up directly and 6 weeks after a treatment
      period with low level laser therapy (LLLT) and pelvic stabilization exercises treatment,
      given at 12 planned treatment sessions during six weeks. 60 women will be included in the
      study.

    <measure>Pain intensity:Visual analogue scale ( VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 6 weeks after treatment .</time_frame>
    <description>Pain will assessed by using Visual analogue scale&quot;VAS&quot; that is a 10 mm calibrated line with zero representing no pain and10 representing worst pain.Worst during the past week Change from baseline to follow-up</description>

    <measure>FABER Test (Patrick's test)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 6 weeks after treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Flexion, Abduction and External Rotation. These three motions combined result in a clinical pain provocation test to find pathologies at the hip, lumbar and sacroiliac region.</description>

    <measure>Pelvic Girdle Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 6 weeks after treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The Pelvic Girdle Questionnaire (PG Q) is a condition-specific measure for women with pelvic girdle pain (PGP). The questionnaire has 25 items under two sub-scales (20 items for activates and 5 items for symptoms), with percentage scores that range from 0 (no disability) to 100 (great disability),thus supplying a gap in research and clinical practice. The PG Q includes items relating to activity/participation and bodily symptoms and has reliability, validity, and feasibility for use in research and clinical practice.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Serum cortisol level:</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 6 weeks after treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Cortisol is high in subjects suffering from pain as compared with healthy and pain free subjects, as there is positive correction between the intensity of pain and increased plasma cortisol level.The blood sample will take for the measurement of plasma cortisol from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. Each patient will be drawn two 5 ml blood samples from cubital vein two times.</description>

    <measure>Posterior pelvic pain provocation test (PPPPT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 6 weeks after treatment .</time_frame>
    <description>used to determine the presence of sacroiliac dysfunction. It is used (often in post pregnant women) to distinguish between pelvic girdle pain and low back pain</description>
