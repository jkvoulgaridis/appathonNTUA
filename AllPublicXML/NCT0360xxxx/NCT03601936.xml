      The study is an evaluation of the Evivo Screening Test's ability to differentiate between
      high and low levels of Bifidobacterium in infant stool specimens.

    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multi-center clinical study of the Evivo Infant Gut Bifidobacterium
      Screening Test (&quot;Evivo Screening Test&quot;).

      Lower levels of bifidobacteria in the infant gut have been linked to increased incidence of
      metabolic and inflammatory disorders. This CLIA Waiver User Testing study is being conducted
      to evaluate the performance of the Evivo Infant Gut Bifidobacterium Screening Test, which was
      designed to differentiate between high and low levels of Bifidobacterium in infant stool.
      This study is intended to confirm the precision of results for this screening test, as well
      as its ease of use, in a setting that closely resembles the conditions of intended use,
      specifically the circumstances of sample collection, the location of test sites, and the
      potential operators.
