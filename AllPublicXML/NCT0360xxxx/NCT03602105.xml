  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Health professions need to prepare for the large increase in the number of older people with
      OA requiring health services including TJA surgery. Older age and poor physical function
      influences the postoperative prognosis of TJA. At discharge from hospital after TJA, studies
      have shown that gait speed can be severely impaired among older patients.

      The investigators hypothesize that an exercise program of 6-12 weeks will be beneficial for
      patients that are undergoing TJA.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      More than 300.000 Norwegians above 20 years of age have osteoarthritis (OA) . There has been
      a significant increase in the prevalence of OA over the decades. In the United States knee OA
      affects 19% of adults aged 45 years or older. OA is associated with an extensive high
      economic and personal burden, largely attributable to the effects of disability, comorbid
      disease, and the expense of treatment.

      Given the aging population, the number of total joint arthroplasty procedures (TJA) for hip
      and knee is likely to increase substantially. In light of poor physical function prior to
      surgery among older patients and the likelihood of an added decrease during hospitalization
      and risk of poorer outcome after surgery, it is hypothesised that prehabilitation
      (preoperative exercise) would improve outcomes after surgery, however evidence for its
      efficacy is still lacking
