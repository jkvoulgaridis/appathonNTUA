  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to determine the predictive value of preimplantation
      genetic screening (PGS) as a marker of embryonic competence. Secondary objectives are to
      define the related or independent predictive values of other proposed markers of embryonic
      and maternal reproductive competence in assisted reproductive technology (ART) cycles.

      Patients participating in the study will undergo a routine in vitro fertilization cycle.
      Trophectoderm biopsy will be performed on all blastocysts however biopsy samples will not be
      analyzed till the clinical outcome has been determined. The single, morphologically best
      embryo available will be selected for transfer. All clinical and laboratory care is identical
      to that of which subjects would receive if they were not participating in the study. This
      includes all pretreatment screening, in-cycle treatment, embryology procedures, single embryo
      transfer, pregnancy testing, and pregnancy follow-up (if pregnancy occurs).
