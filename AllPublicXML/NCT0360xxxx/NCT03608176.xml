  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The accumulation of excess of body weight is one of the most important problems worldwide,
      thus effective and accessible treatments are required. Some authors highlighted that
      treatment is focused solely on lifestyle (diet, physical activity, behavioral therapy) has a
      limited effect on body weight because it does not consider the biological mechanisms linked
      to weight loss in patients with obesity. On the other hand, drugs and bariatric surgery
      consider these biological approaches; however, its costs, safety and effectiveness limits its
      use on a large scale. Research studies support the existence of compounds in plants (such as
      epigallocatechin gallate, caffeine, cinnamaldehyde, fiber), and water with biological
      properties that would contribute to the treatment of overweight and obesity. However, at the
      moment, these compounds have only been evaluated individually and their effects have been
      significant but limited clinically, therefore, more research studies are needed to evaluate
      whether several of these compounds contained in common plants synergistically have a clinical
      impact on the management of overweight and obesity. The present work integrates diverse
      plant-based approaches to stop obesity and it is compared with a control group and a waiting
      list group. The main aim is to evaluate the efficacy of the Plant-based Approaches to Stop
      Obesity diet (PASO diet) compared with a control group on body weight at 3 months in Mexican
      adults with overweight and obesity. This is a pilot study designed as a randomized controlled
      trial. The study will be conducted with a (n=36). The primary outcome is the change in body
      weight from baseline to 3 months. Secondary outcomes will be the changes from baseline to 3
      months in body mass index, waist circumference, systolic and diastolic blood pressure,
      symptoms of depression, quality of life scales and biochemical parameters (fasting glucose,
      total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, triglycerides and gamma glutamyl
      transferase). Additionally two 24-hour dietary recall will be measured at baseline and 3
      months to evaluate adherence to the intervention.

    <description>The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) is a 21-item questionnaire that assesses mood over the previous week. Total scores range from 0 to 63, with higher values indicating greater symptoms of depression. Scores of 0-9 reflect minimal (subclinical) symptoms, values of 10-18, 19-29, and ≥30 indicate mild, moderate, and severe symptoms of depression, respectively.</description>

    <description>The SF-36 Health Survey evaluates aspects of the quality of life in adult populations (over 16 years of age). The result of its application is the generation of eight concepts or scales of health, result of the average of the sum of the questions contained in the questionnaire for each concept. These concepts are: physical function, physical role, corporal pain, general health, vitality, social function, emotional role and mental health. The SF-36 is a self-applied instrument and contains 36 questions. For each scale, the answers to each question are coded and recoded (10 questions), and the results are interpreted on a scale of 0 to 100, lower results indicate poorer health and greater result better health).</description>
