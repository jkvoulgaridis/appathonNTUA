  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to investigate the clinical efficacy of continuous theta burst stimulation
      (cTBS) on the right DLPFC as an add-on treatment in bipolar depression. The study consists of
      three phases.

      Phase 1: Bipolar depressed patients will be selected by a certified psychiatrist, who will
      administer (semi-)structured clinical interviews (M.I.N.I.-Plus 5.0.0, HRSD-17). The presence
      of exclusion criteria will be evaluated. Eligible patients will undergo MRI brain imaging for
      TMS neuronavigation

      Phase 2: Baseline clinical, cognitive and psychomotor assessments will take place. Patients
      will also undergo blood samples for laboratory and research assessments.

      TBS involves applying triple-pulse 50 Hz bursts given at a rate of 5 Hz uninterrupted trains
      (1). Patients will be treated with in total 20 continuous Theta Burst Stimulation (cTBS)
      session (900 pulses per session) over the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, which will be
      spread over 4 days. A stimulation intensity of 100% of the subject's resting motor threshold
      (rMT) of the right abductor pollicis brevis muscle will used.

      Patients will be randomized to receive either the real cTBS or sham treatment. Sham
      stimulation will be applied with a sham coil. The sham coil produces identical sounds but is
      not associated with a stimulus sensation compared to the coil delivering real stimulation
      cTBS. The investigators expect that real cTBS treatment and not sham will result in a
      significant and clinical meaningful response.

      Phase 3: Two post-treatment assessment moments will take place respectively 3 (max. 4) days
      and 10 (max. 11) days after the last treatment day. The assessments are the same clinical,
      cognitive and psychomotor assessments as in phase 2.
