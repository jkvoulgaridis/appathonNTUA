    <textblock>
      While school-aged children in low- and middle-income countries remain highly exposed to acute
      infections, programs targeting this age group remain limited in scale and scope. In this
      study, we evaluate the impact of a new and comprehensive primary school-based health
      intervention program on student health outcomes and academic performance in Lusaka, Zambia.
      The intervention involved the training of teachers to become school health workers and the
      provision of vitamin A supplementation and deworming medication on a bi-annual basis.
      Teachers in intervention schools were trained to deliver health lessons and to refer sick
      students to care. This study is designed as a prospective matched control study. Students
      from the seven intervention schools are matched with students from control schools.
