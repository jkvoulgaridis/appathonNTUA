  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) is a kind of mesenchymal tumor with malignant
      differentiation potential. It originated from mesenchymal stem cells of gastrointestinal
      tract.The most common is that gastric stromal tumors(GST) make up 60-70% of gastrointestinal
      stromal tumors.The first choice for the treatment of non-metastatic gastric stromal tumors is
      to ensure the integrity of the tumor and obtain the negative surgical margin.At present, the
      common surgical methods of resection of gastric stromal tumors include laparotomy and
      laparoscopy, most of them are partial gastrectomy, wedge-shaped resection, proximal subtotal
      gastrectomy, distal subtotal gastrectomy and total gastrectomy, etc.There was no significant
      difference between open surgery and laparoscopic surgery.With the rapid development of
      endoscopic technology in recent years, endoscopes have been continuously explored in
      practice.Laparoscopic endoscopic cooperative surgery(LECS) is different from the past
      technology. It is a new radical resection of GIST presented by Japanese scholars. LECS
      resects the tumor completely by laparoscopy with the help of the precise positioning and
      guidance of endoscopy .This method conforms to the idea of the modern minimally invasive
      surgery, and avoids many problems，such as incomplete resection and disorders of digestion
      caused by excessive tissue resection. Investigators will observe the diffenrence of LECS and
      traditional laparoscopic surgeries.Firstly,the investigators will collect 80 cases of GST
      patients, randomly assigned for the laparoscopic group, the LECS surgical treatment.
      Secondly, to analyzing the basic treatment and follow-up data, including the operation time,
      blood loss, the number of transfer laparotomy or laparoscopy, the number of cut edge
      positive, the distances of cut edge away from the tumor edge, the cases of anastomotic
      fistula bleeding, stenosis, average such confinement, the meal time, cost of treatment, tumor
      recurrence rate, the presence of residual stomach, upset stomach and frequency, reflux
      esophagitis, bile reflux gastritis and other indicators.The purpose of this subject is to
      observe the effectivity and safety of LECS , invent serval LECS equipment patents and provide
      some references for LECS applying to the minimally invasive surgery of the digestive tract
      tumor and multidisciplinary treatment mode.It also provides reference for gastrointestinal
      stromal tumors, leiomyomas, ectopic pancreas, carcinoid, early carcinomas, giant adenomas and
      polyps.
