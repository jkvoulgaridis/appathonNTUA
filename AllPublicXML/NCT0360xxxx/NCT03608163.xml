  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this study is to develop a new and practical way to prevent the
      development of Hypoglycemia Associated Autonomic Failure (HAAF), which is unawareness of
      hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) in individuals with diabetes. Previous studies suggest that
      both naloxone and diazoxide may increase the body's ability to respond to episodes of low
      blood sugar and prevent the development of HAAF (or hypoglycemia unawareness). Only healthy
      subjects are being recruited for this study. The study has three distinct phases. In the
      first phase, healthy, non-diabetic individuals who are susceptible to developing HAAF are
      identified. Only these individuals will be studied in the second and third phases. The second
      phase of this study evaluates the effect of using a naloxone nasal spray versus a placebo
      nasal spray in improving the body's response to episodes of low blood sugar and in preventing
      the development of HAAF. The third phase of this study evaluates the effect of using naloxone
      nasal spray and diazoxide in combination, compared to naloxone nasal spray plus a placebo
      (for diazoxide) or diazoxide plus a placebo (for naloxone) in improving the body's response
      to episodes of low blood sugar and in preventing the development of HAAF.

    <textblock>
      Type I diabetes affects the body's ability to respond to low blood sugar (hypoglycemia).
      Repeated episodes of hypoglycemia may affect an individual's autonomic system, and leads to
      hypoglycemia associated autonomic failure (HAAF) in 2/3 of individuals. This study is looking
      at healthy, non-diabetic individuals who are susceptible to developing HAAF and their
      response to either naloxone nasal spray alone or in combination with diazoxide in improving
      their body's ability to respond to episodes of low blood sugar, and in preventing the
      development of HAAF.

      The body's response to episodes of hypoglycemia is measured using a procedure called a
      hypoglycemic clamp; each phase of this study involves three clamp procedures over a period of
      2 days. During the clamp procedures, glucose (a sugar) and insulin (a hormone produced in the
      pancreas that regulates the amount of glucose in the blood) are infused with an intravenous
      catheter, and blood samples are collected periodically throughout the procedure to measure
      blood sugar levels and the levels of several hormones, including epinephrine, that are found
      in the body and are related to glucose metabolism. The rates of endogenous glucose production
      (a measure of the body's production of sugar) will be measured. Additionally, the level of
      awareness of hypoglycemia symptoms will be monitored using a standardized questionnaire.

      Both hypoglycemia and stress activate the body's opioid system. Recently published data has
      shown that blocking opioid receptors with naloxone may increase the body's ability to respond
      to hypoglycemia.The body's response to hypoglycemia affects many systems, and acting on
      several of these systems may help the body to respond more effectively to episodes of low
      blood sugar, and to prevent the development of HAAF. Studies have shown that potassium
      channels in the hypothalamus, a part of the brain, have an important role in detecting
      hypoglycemia. Diazoxide activates potassium channels in the cells of the brain that respond
      to changes in sugar (glucose) that occur in the body, and may also reduce the development of
      hypoglycemia associated autonomic failure. Additionally, certain glucose-responsive cells in
      the brain have opioid receptors that are combined with potassium channels which may respond
      to both diazoxide and naloxone which may work together to more effectively increase the
      body's ability to respond to episodes of low blood sugar and prevent HAAF.

    <intervention_model_description>This study is a combination of model types. In phase 1 of the study, non-diabetic participants who are susceptible to hypoglycemia-associated autonomic failure (HAAF) are identified. Only participants who are susceptible to HAAF are studied in the second and third phases. Thus, continuation of subjects identified in phase one into phase two and/or three studies follows a sequential model. The second phase follows a crossover design in which subjects receive naloxone or placebo nasal sprays in a randomized, double blinded fashion. In the third phase, subjects will receive either oral diazoxide or oral placebo (for diazoxide), in combination with naloxone nasal spray or placebo (for naloxone) nasal spray in a randomized, double blinded crossover design.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Determined using the Edinburgh Hypoglycemia Symptom Scale Score which determines the participant's awareness of eleven specific symptoms of hypoglycemia. Each symptom is scored 0-1 (0=not present or 1=present), which are then added together to yield a total between 0-11. Higher values mean participant has greater awareness of hypoglycemia, lower values mean participant has impaired awareness of hypoglycemia.</description>
