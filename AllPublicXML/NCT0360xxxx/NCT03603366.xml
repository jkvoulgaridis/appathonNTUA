  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Research shows that low-dose Aspirin prevents diseases of heart and blood vessels as well as
      cancer of the colon and rectum and it is also associated with risk of bleeding. In this
      study, they want to learn how patients regard the benefits and risks of low-dose Aspirin for
      the prevention of these diseases. The researchers also want to learn how patients balance
      these risks and benefits.

        Adult patients who are eligible for and/or taking low-dose aspirin will be recruited for
        qualitative interviews, pilot/cognitive interviews, and the main quantitative survey.
        Medically trained physicians who have experience prescribing low-dose aspirin for CVD
        (cardiovascular disease) and CRC (colorectal cancer) prevention will be eligible for the
        qualitative interviews.
