  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      TB1-K Device is an organ preservation and transportation system, using ultrasound technology
      with a cooling system to preserve the organ in optimal conditions during transport to the
      transplant recipient.

      This is a prospective, single-arm, multi-center study comparing to a historical control for
      cold storage.

      The study is conducted in accordance with the Standard ISO 14155 (Clinical investigation of
      medical devices for human subjects - Good clinical practice), and other legal requirements.

      The study objective is to assess the safety and performance of the TB1-K device in donor
      kidneys intended for transplantation.
