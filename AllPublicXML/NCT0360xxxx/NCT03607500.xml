  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One possible reason that weight gain after transplant may interfere with new kidney function
      is due to the enlargement of a kidney structure called the glomerulus.

      The researchers believe that modest caloric intake reduction (CIR) early after kidney
      transplantation can reduce the enlargement (hypertrophy) of the glomerulus associated with
      kidney transplantation and may improve long term allograft survival, by reducing glomerular
      hypertrophy mediated progressive glomerulosclerosis.

    <description>The intervention group will be seen by the kidney disease dietician at all clinical visits for the first 3 months (weekly for month 1, every other week for months 2 and 3). During months 2 and 3, in the weeks that the patients are not in clinic, they will receive telephone calls from the dietician. Thus the intervention involves weekly assessment for the first 3 months (in person or over the telephone). After 3 months, the patient will not receive any further active dietary intervention from the dieticians unless the patient wishes to continue using the dieticians advice per clinic protocol.</description>
