  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current study is designed to test the effectiveness of online programs for memory and
      executive functions in healthy aging. The investigators are testing online adaptations of two
      cognitive interventions that have been extensively studied, validated, and implemented in
      clinical settings: The Memory &amp; Aging Program (MAP) targets normal memory change in healthy
      aging, and Goal Management Training (GMT) targets executive functioning deficits in a variety
      of cognitive and neurological conditions including healthy aging. Both programs combine
      psycho-education, targeted skills training and clinical support to empower participants with
      knowledge and strategies to harness their cognitive faculties. These programs are being
      tested against a waitlist control as well as against a commercial/research brain training
      platform (Cambridge Brain Sciences) in a design comparing performance on memory and executive
      functioning measures before and after the interventions/controls. The main hypothesis is that
      MAP will lead to memory-specific improvements above control conditions, whereas GMT will lead
      to greater improvements in measures of executive functions relative to controls.

    <intervention_model_description>Participants are screened, undergo a battery of cognitive testing for the pre-test, and then are randomly assigned to one of four intervention groups: MAP, GMT, Cambridge Brain Sciences brain training (active control), or waitlist. After intervention, the participants take the same test battery and complete it once more at 6 week followup.</intervention_model_description>

Randomizer is blinded to all participant pre-test outcomes. Care providers know what their participants are doing, but not aware of the full study design, including details of the other conditions or outcome test characteristics.</masking_description>
