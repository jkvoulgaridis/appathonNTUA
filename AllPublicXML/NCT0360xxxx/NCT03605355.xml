  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The effectiveness of outpatient management of minor TIAs and strokes in the context of a
      dedicated outpatient pathway with specialized care has been demonstrated and has resulted in
      an 80% decrease in stroke in the year followed the AIT (EXPRESS and SOS-TIA studies) At the
      same time, few studies have been conducted on their economic interest and none in France.

      Patient's typology (younger patient, no sequel, no disability) with Transient ischemic attack
      (TIA) and minor stroke (MS) makes them compatible with ambulatory management.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Only two hospitals in France can take care patients with TIA or MS in an outpatient setting
      :Bichat hospital in Paris and Toulouse University Hospital. The effectiveness of this
      management has been demonstrated since recurrence stroke risk is reduced by 80% at one year.
      An English study (EXPRESS study) [2] showed a gain of 624 pounds with an ambulatory
      management compared to a conventional one. No studies are available in France on this
      subject.

      The aim of this study is to test the feasibility of a collection of medical and economic data
      on a prospective way. The investigators collect medical (Cerebrovascular events, Stroke) and
      economic (direct and indirect costs) data concerning patients who were managed in TIA clinic
      in Toulouse Hospital. The medical data will be compiled with available French and
      International literature. The economic data will be compiled with available data in PMSI and
      health insurance database. This study aims to prepare a multicenter cohort to compare the
      cost effectiveness ratio between ambulatory and conventional management.

    <study_pop>
      <textblock>
        Stroke patients, to adapt to the recent change in the typology of new ischemic stroke in
        Western Europe, which for the most part are transient (30%) or minor ischemic strokes
        (35%). %).

        The profile of these patients is indeed compatible with outpatient care which should lead
        to the adaptation of the offer of care.
