      The research protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) for the Protection
      of Human Subjects at National Cheng Kung University Hospital (NCKUH/B-ER-104-070). The study
      procedures were performed according to the rules of IRB and fully explained to the
      participants. Blood and CSF samples were collected and compared the difference in no pain
      group, acute pain group, and chronic pain group.

      Whole blood (10 ml) was collected before surgery using venipuncture: the blood was drawn into
      a test tube that contained the anticoagulant ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA). Blood
      and CSF samples were ice bathed and then transported to laboratory for biological molecule
      analysis. White blood cells and platelets were also counted before operation as a routinely
      pre-operative check
