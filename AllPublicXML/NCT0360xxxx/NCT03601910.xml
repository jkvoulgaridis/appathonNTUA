      This study is an open-label, randomized, fasted, single-dose, 2-way crossover study to
      compare the pharmacokinetic characteristics and safety between CKD-380 10mg and D308 10mg in
      healthy male adults.

    <textblock>
      To healthy male subjects of thirty-four (34), following treatments are administered dosing in
      each period and wash-out period is a minimum of 7 days.

      Reference drug: D308 10mg Tab. / Test drug: CKD-380 10mg Tab.

      Pharmacokinetic blood samples are collected up to 48hrs. The pharmacokinetic characteristics
      and safety are assessed.
