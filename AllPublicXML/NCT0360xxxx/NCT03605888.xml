      health of low-income mothers.

      This study will employ a randomized controlled trial (RCT) design to test a newly developed
      obesity reduction program, Koa Family, among overweight or obese mothers. An exploratory,
      uncontrolled study will assess its acceptance among normal-weight mothers.

      Koa Family consists of a 6-month whole-person lifestyle program (WPLP) combined with text
      messaging and social media support and the opportunity to take part in a neighborhood tree
      planting campaign. This multi-pronged program is intended to reduce weight in the short-term
      while building self-empowerment and connections to community resources so that participants
      can sustain long-term weight loss.

      Koa Family will be implemented in select communities in Yolo and Sacramento counties,
      California. Overweight or obese study participants will be randomized to either an
      intervention or control group; all normal-weight participants will be assigned to the
      intervention. All participants will complete a survey and have their height and weight
      measured at baseline and 3-, 6-, 9- and 12-month follow-up. Intervention participants will
      also take part in a focus group at the 3-month midpoint of the intervention.

    <description>Koa Family is a 6-month program consisting of a whole-person lifestyle program (WPLP) combined with text messaging and social media support and a neighborhood tree planting campaign. The WPLP will bring groups of 8 to 10 mothers living in the same community together for 22 weekly 90-minute support sessions. Each session will cover a topic on whole-person living, including healthy eating, physical activity, stress reduction, coping, and well-being. Participants will receive brief text messages on their cell phones to encourage healthy lifestyle choices. Participants also will be invited to join a &quot;secret&quot; Facebook group where they can support one another in healthy lifestyle change. Finally, participants will have an opportunity to take part in a neighborhood tree planting campaign.</description>
