    <textblock>
      This is a pilot proof-of-concept randomized controlled trial, open-label and unblinded,
      examining the feasibility and acceptability of Buprenorphine extended-release vs. daily
      sublingual buprenorphine-naloxone for the treatment of opioid use disorder in jail and at
      community re-entry.

Collects data regarding 7 functional domains: medical, employment/support, drug and alcohol use, legal, family history, family social relationships, and psychiatric problems. Its yields a severity score and a composite score. The composite scores are useful for summarizing changes in patient status, which can be used in treatment outcome studies.</description>

    <description>XRB is a 300mg pre-mixed subcutaneous injectable formulation to be administered monthly. XRB is for abdominal subcutaneous injection only. Participants in the XRB treatment arm will be given 1 or more XRB injections prior to release from jail and one more at week 5 post-release, depending on their release date.</description>

    <description>SLB (SUBOXONE, Zubsolv, or generic tablets) is a daily sublingual film or tablet ranging from 8-24mg/day or equivalent (Zubsolv is dosed 5.7-17.1 mg/day). The film or tablet is placed under the tongue for 5 to 10 minutes until dissolved completely. Participants in the SLB treatment arm will be provided SLB daily by observed dosing in-jail (controlled substances are not self-administered in-jail) and and encouraged to continue SLB treatment in weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly quantities for unobserved, daily, self-administration through week 5. Patients may also elect to obtain SLB care free-of-charge from the Bellevue Hospital Center Addiction Medicine clinic or from non-NYU/Bellevue providers and pharmacies per usual care standards. SLB will not be provided via the study.</description>

    <description>SLB is administered sublingually or buccally as a single daily dose. Medication should be prescribed in consideration of the frequency of visits. Provision of multiple refills is not advised in early treatment or without appropriate follow-up visits. After treatment induction and stabilization, the maintenance dose of SLB is generally in the range of 4mg/1mg buprenorphine/naloxone to 24mg/6mg buprenorphine/naloxone per day depending on the individual patient and clinical response.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adults &gt;18yo incarcerated in NYC jails with known release dates.

          -  DSM-V criteria for current opioid use disorder (DSM-IV opioid dependence).

          -  Currently maintained on sublingual buprenorphine-naloxone in the NYC jail opioid
             treatment program.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Individual not interested in XRB treatment. Current SLB patients are otherwise by
             definition appropriate for XRB.

          -  Pregnant or planning conception. A urine dipstick pregnancy (hCG) test will be
             administered at baseline. The test detects human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) in urine
             with a sensitivity/specificity of: 25 mIU hCG/ml, &gt;99%. Time to result is four
             minutes. If negative, a urine pregnancy test will be administered bi-weekly thereafter
             to ensure that a participant is not pregnant

          -  No severe or acute medical or psychiatric disability preventing safe study
             participation or making follow-up unlikely.
