  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alzheimer's disease and related dementia (ADRD) is one of the most challenging chronic health
      conditions in the United States and considerable disparities exist in the diagnosis and
      prevalence of ADRD among communities of color. Research suggests that ADRD caregiver
      interventions have demonstrated efficacy, however, it remains unknown whether existing ADRD
      caregiver interventions are useful or accessible to African American ADRD caregivers in
      community settings.

      The primary goal of the proposed project is to develop an in-home psychoeducational
      intervention (The Senior Companion Program Plus, or SCP Plus) that is accessible,
      sustainable, and affordable for African American ADRD caregivers. The SCP Plus will focus on
      African American ADRD caregivers who are particularly affected by poverty, discrimination,
      and barriers to health care services and supports. A recent pilot study has established the
      feasibility and utility of SCP Plus. With the assistance of 6 student research assistants
      over the course of the project, we will implement the SCP Plus at sites in Texas, Louisiana,
      and Arkansas, recruiting approximately 114 participants. The participants will be randomized
      with 57 caregivers receiving the SCP Plus and 57 caregivers receiving services as usual with
      the Senior Companion Program. A weekly, 60 minute psychoeducational module will be delivered
      face-to-face across 9 weeks and will focus on education about ADRD, behavior management,
      communication skills, and aspects of providing care that enhance meaning such as
      spirituality. In order to provide an accessible and cost effective intervention that is
      potentially sustainable, senior companions will be trained to provide the intervention in the
      homes of the African American ADRD caregivers.

      Specific Aim 1. Determine whether SCP Plus reduces level of burden and stress among African
      American caregivers over a 3- and 6-month period when compared to a usual care control group.

      Specific Aim 2. Ascertain if SCP Plus improves coping skills among African American
      caregivers over a 3- and 6-month period when compared to a usual care control group.

      Specific Aim 3. Examine whether SCP Plus improves the level of satisfaction with support
      social among African American caregivers over a 3- and 6- month period when compared to a
      usual care control group.

      Specific Aim 4. Explore and interpret the statistical results obtained in the first
      quantitative phase to help explain why participants who scored in the lower and upper
      quartiles on caregiver burden/stress were impacted or not by the usefulness of the
      intervention.

      Successful design, delivery, and evaluation of the SCP Plus will lead to a cost effective,
      sustainable, and accessible intervention that can be implemented in other Senior Companion
      programs across the country, thus maximizing its impact as a community-based program to
      address the needs of African American ADRD caregivers.

    <description>The Brief Cope Scale will be used to measure coping skills. The Brief Cope questionnaire consists of 28 items measuring the ways/strategies caregivers have been coping with the stress in their life with 4-point scale ranging from &quot;I have not been doing this at all&quot;(1) to &quot;I have been doing this a lot&quot; (4). This Brief Cope scale consists of 14 subscales (with 2 items for each subscale). Sum scores for each subscale will be calculated, ranging from 2 to 8, with higher scores indicating better coping skills. A final total sum score will also be calculated by combining all the sum scores of the 14 subscales, ranged from 28 to 112. The higher the total scores, the better the coping skills.</description>
