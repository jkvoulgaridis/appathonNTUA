  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ulcerative colitis is a form of inflammatory bowel disease characterized by diffuse
      inflammation of the colonic mucosa. It affects the rectum and extends proximally along a
      variable length of the colon. Ulcerative colitis is a chronic condition with a relapsing
      remitting course. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are a subset of adult stem cells residing in
      many tissues, including bone marrow (BM), adipose tissue, umbilical cord blood. Recent
      experimental findings have shown the ability of MSCs to home to damaged tissues and to
      produce paracrine factors with anti-inflammatory properties, potentially resulting in
      reduction of inflammation and functional recovery of the damaged tissues. The purpose of our
      study is to evaluate safety and efficacy of the intracolonic injection by using a colonoscope
      of allogeneic adipose MSCs in patients with moderate active ulcerative colitis.

    <time_frame>Baseline, 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Short Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (SIBDQ) is a health-related quality of life (HRQoL) tool measuring physical, social, and emotional status. It includes 10-item form of questions. Each question is scored on a Likert scale from 1 (worst) to 7 (best), scores from each item are summed to produce a total score, increased more than 3 scores were considered remission.</description>

    <measure>Histologic Evaluation of Ulcerative Colitis</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A 10 to 20 centimeter (cm) biopsy sample of inflamed mucosal tissue was taken from the worst affected area and scored using the Riley Index. The Riley Index is a histologic scoring system for the assessment of the activity and severity of ulcerative colitis, ranging from 0 to 24. It consists of 6 histologic features (acute inflammatory cell infiltrate, crypt abscesses, mucin depletion, surface epithelial integrity, chronic inflammatory cell infiltrate, and crypt architectural irregularities), all scored on a 4-point scale (higher scores indicate more severe disease).</description>
