  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a feasibility and acceptability study of a 16-month single-blind randomized
      controlled trial (RCT) designed to test the initial effectiveness of a well-being and small
      lifestyle changes intervention aimed at promoting weight loss and stress reduction in
      overweight and obese patients with type 2 diabetes. Primary goals of this study are to 1)
      evaluate study feasibility and patient acceptability, 2) develop a tailored protocol of a
      behavioral intervention for overweight or obese patients with type 2 diabetes that takes
      stress and well-being into consideration, 3) evaluate appropriateness of research procedures
      and measures, 4) examine effect size estimates of key outcomes to provide essential data to
      inform a larger efficacy trial, 5) determine whether clinically significant improvements
      occurred in any key outcomes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Overweight and obese patients with type 2 diabetes will be recruited at 2 different diabetes
      clinics. Physicians will screen every patient attending to each clinic during the enrollment
      period for the presence of main eligibility criteria. Those patients who appear to be
      eligible will be introduced to the study and referred to a researcher for a more in-depth
      screening evaluation. Eligible patients who are interested in participating in the study will
      be asked to sign the informed consent. Consecutive patients will be randomly assigned in a
      1:1 ratio to an experimental group or a control group. During the first month, participants
      in the experimental group will receive a well-being promoting intervention in adjunction to
      the treatment as usual (TAU), while those in the control group will be asked to follow the
      TAU. In the following 3 months participants in both groups will receive the small change
      intervention in adjunction to the the TAU. All in person sessions of the intervention will
      take place in an office of both the 2 diabetes clinics involved. Data about psychological and
      clinical variables will be collected for each participant through questionnaires and
      interviews at baseline, at post-intervention, and at 6 and 12 months of follow-up.
      Participants' weight will be measured at each assessment point using a scale. Medical charts
      will be accessed to collect further data about physiological parameters, treatment received
      and medical history.

    <measure>Change in Psychological Distress</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, post-intervention (intended to be 4 months), 6 months post-intervention, 12 months post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Measured by the Symptoms Questionnaire (SQ), a 92-item self-rating scale with yes/no responses (or true/false for some questions to avoid double-negative statements) divided into four domains: anxiety, depression, somatic, and anger-hostility.
Each domain is further divided into two sub-scales: one sub-scale with 17 symptom questions and one sub-scale with 6 questions that are antonyms of some of the symptom questions in order to measure well-being.
A response of yes/true for a symptom question gives 1 point, and a response of no/false for a well-being question gives 1 point for a score ranging from 0-17 for each symptom sub-scale and 0-6 for each well-being sub-scale, where a higher score indicates greater distress. If the well-being score is calculated separately the raw score can be subtracted from 6 for a score ranging from 0-6, where a higher score indicates greater well-being.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, post-intervention (intended to be 4 months), 6 months post-intervention, 12 months post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Measured by the Psychosocial Index (PSI), a 55-item self-rating scale divided into five domains:
Sociodemographic and clinical data: 12 questions including routine medical and demographic information. Stress: 17 yes/no questions with a score from 0-17. A higher score indicates greater stress. Well-being: 6 yes/no questions with a score from 0-6. A higher score indicates greater psychological well-being. Psychological distress: 15 four-point questions from 0-3, with a total score from 0-45. A higher score indicates greater psychological distress. 4 questions referring to sleep may be scored separately. Abnormal illness behavior: 3 four-point questions from 0-3, with a total score from 0-9. A higher score indicates more severe abnormal illness behavior. Quality of life: 1 four-point question, with a score from 0 to 4. A higher score indicates a higher quality of life. Psychological well-being and quality of life scores can be summed for a global well-being score from 0-10.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, post-intervention (intended to be 4 months), 6 months post-intervention, 12 months post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Measured by the GOSPEL questionnaire, a 32-item self-rating instrument for the assessment of physical activity levels, eating habits, and stress tailored to the dietary variation among Italian adults:
Seven 4-point items regarding physical activity with a total score from 0 (least active) to 20 (most active).
Ten 4-point items regarding diet based on frequency of consumption, with scores summed to obtain a Mediterranean diet score from 0 (worst) to 30 (best).
Three 4-point items on eating habits summed for a score ranging from 0 (worst habits) to 9 (best habits).
Diet and eating habits are summed to give a total diet score from 0 (worst) to 39 (best).
Seven 4-point items regarding stress management summed for a total score from 0 (optimal management) to 21 (inadequate management).
Four 4-point items on family risk behaviors with a score ranging from 0 (least risky) to 4 (most risky).
One 4-point item on family support scored from 0 (least support) to 3 (most support).</description>

    <description>The small change intervention is a behavioral intervention to help people gradually lose weight by making small changes in their lifestyle. At the beginning of the intervention participants will be met in person to be guided in setting an eating and a physical activity goal. Participants will be then contacted through the phone or met in person weekly for 3 months to check on their adherence to the selected goals and to discuss about facilitators and barriers to goal completion, in order to increase their motivation and problem solving skills. Every weekly contact will last about an hour and will be administered in an individual setting. At each contact selected goals can be revised, changed or another goal can be added based on levels of adherence.</description>
