  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well atezolizumab and cobimetinib work in treating patients
      with non-small cell lung cancer that has spread to other places in the body (metastatic), has
      come back (recurrent), or does not respond to treatment (refractory). Immunotherapy with
      monoclonal antibodies, such as atezolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the
      cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Cobimetinib may
      stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving
      atezolizumab and cobimetinib may work better in treating patients with non-small cell lung
      cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To evaluate durable overall response rate with atezolizumab plus cobimetinib in patients
      with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) resistant or refractory to prior PD-1 or
      PD-L1 therapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the overall response rate of atezolizumab plus cobimetinib in patients with
      metastatic NSCLC resistant or refractory to prior PD-1 or PD-L1 therapy.

      II. To evaluate the progression-free survival (PFS) of atezolizumab plus cobimetinib in
      patients with metastatic NSCLC resistant or refractory to prior PD-1 or PD-L1 therapy.

      III. To evaluate the overall survival (OS) of atezolizumab plus cobimetinib in patients with
      metastatic NSCLC resistant or refractory to prior PD-1 or PD-L1 therapy.

      IV. To evaluate the duration of response (DOR) of atezolizumab plus cobimetinib in patients
      with metastatic NSCLC resistant or refractory to prior PD-1 or PD-L1 therapy.

      V. To evaluate the grade 3 and 4 toxicity rate in patients with metastatic NSCLC resistant or
      refractory to prior PD-1 or PD-L1 therapy when treated with atezolizumab plus cobimetinib.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the consequences of treatment with atezolizumab plus cobimetinib on the tumor
      microenvironment in patients with metastatic NSCLC resistant or refractory to prior PD-1 or
      PD-L1 therapy.

      II. To correlate genomic characteristics including tumor mutation burden to response to
      therapy with atezolizumab plus cobimetinib in patients with metastatic NSCLC resistant or
      refractory to prior PD-1 or PD-L1 therapy.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive atezolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30-60 minutes on days 1, and
      cobimetinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unaccepted toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 90 days.

             day 1

          -  Major surgical procedure within 28 days prior to cycle 1, day 1 or anticipation of
             need for a major surgical procedure during the course of the study

          -  Administration of a live, attenuated vaccine within 4 weeks before cycle 1, day 1 or
             anticipation that such a live, attenuated vaccine will be required during the study
             and up to 5 months after the last dose of atezolizumab

               -  Influenza vaccination should be given during influenza season only (approximately
                  October to March); patients must not receive live, attenuated influenza vaccine
                  within 4 weeks prior to cycle 1, day 1 or at any time during the study

          -  Uncontrolled pleural or pericardial effusion or ascites requiring recurrent drainage
             procedures

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, active tuberculosis (TB), symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable
             angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that
             would limit compliance with study requirements

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because both atezolizumab and cobimetinib
             are expected to cause fetal harm if used during pregnancy; because there is an unknown
             but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the
             mother with cobimetinib or atezolizumab, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the
             mother is treated with either therapy; these potential risks may also apply to other
             agents used in this study

          -  Inability or unwillingness to swallow pills

          -  History of malabsorption syndrome or other condition that would interfere with enteral
             absorption
