  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Teaching first aid to laypeople is a cost-effective way to improve public health.
      However, it is currently unclear what the most effective ways are to teach first aid. It has
      already been shown that simulated patients have an added value in teaching emergency care to
      healthcare professionals.

      This paper describes the protocol for a cluster-randomized controlled trial that will
      investigate the influence of using a simulated patient during basic first aid training for
      laypeople on laypeople's knowledge, skills and self-efficacy.

      Hypothesis: The null hypothesis of this research is that the use of simulated patients during
      basic first aid training does not result in a statistically significant change in knowledge,
      skills and self-efficacy concerning the first aid topics for which a simulated patient is
      used. The alternative is that knowledge, skills and self-efficacy will be influenced by using
      simulated patients.

      Methods: This study will be a cluster-randomized controlled trial, that will take place from
      September 2018 to June 2020. The study population will consist of employees taking a three
      day first aid certification course with the Belgian Red Cross. The employers requesting a
      first aid course will be randomised in receiving a course with or without simulated patient.
      The simulated patient will only be used for the topics first aid for burns and first aid for
      stroke in the intervention group. The participants will complete a questionnaire to measure
      their knowledge and self-efficacy before and after the course, and complete a practical
      skills test after the course testing these first aid topics. To test whether the retention of
      first aid knowledge and self-efficacy is influenced by using a simulated patient during a
      certification course, participants following a refresher course one year after the
      certification course will complete a follow-up questionnaire.

      This cluster-randomized controlled trial will be, to the investigator's knowledge, the first
      to investigate the added value of simulated patients during first aid courses for laypeople.
