  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For patients with at least one eye with non-tractional diabetic edema refractory to 6 months
      of anti-VEGF injections (anti Vascular endothelial growth factor injections), a randomization
      is done: one group of patients will receive the standard treatment (anti-VEGF injections,
      switch to another anti-VEGF drug, additional photocoagulation or any other treatment except
      vitrectomy during the first 6 months after the randomisation) and the other group of patients
      will receive vitrectomy (with only additional photocoagulation during the first 6 months,
      then any treatment from 6 months after the randomization).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In case both eyes present refractory diabetic macular edema (DME) and are eligible, the eye
      with the worst DME will be included and randomized.
