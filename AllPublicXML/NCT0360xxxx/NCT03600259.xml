    <textblock>
      Acute myocardial infarction(AMI) is the most serious manifestation of coronary artery
      disease. AMI is characterized by high mortality, high disability, and high cost. However,
      multicenter research on AMI with large sample size in Tianjin or even China is limited. By
      including AMI in 36 hospitals,this multicenter study will capture the changes in
      epidemiological trends ,analyze the status of treatment in Tianjin, and explore the best
      treatment strategies.

    <description>Due to recent cardiac causes (eg myocardial infarction, low-volume heart failure, fatal arrhythmias), any deaths from unknown and unexplained deaths and all surgical-related deaths (including treatment-related deaths) will be attributed to cardiac death.Unless there is a clear non-cardiological cause, all deaths are considered heart disease. Specifically, even patients with concurrent potentially fatal non-cardiac diseases (such as cancer, infections) who have any accidental death should be classified as having a heart attack.</description>

        Hospitalized patients with acute myocardial infarction from 36 hospitals in Tianjin were

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Hospitalized patients with acute myocardial infarction according to Cardiac biomarker
             values [Selective cardiac troponin (cTc) elevation and/or decline detection, at least
             one value exceeds the 99% reference limit (URL) and at least one of the
             following:（1）Symptoms of myocardial ischemia；（2）New or suspected new obvious ST-T
             changes or new left bundle branch block (LBBB)；（3）ECG pathological Q waves；（4）Image
             evidence of recent loss of viable myocardium, or new regional wall motion
             abnormalities；（5）Coronary thrombosis confirmed by angiography or autopsy.]

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Those who did not meet the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction (no myocardial
             ischemia-related symptoms, elevation of markers of myocardial necrosis and imaging
             findings of myocardial infarction); those who met the inclusion criteria but refused
             to participate in the study; The researchers judged that the subjects had poor
             compliance and could not Complete follow-up as required.
