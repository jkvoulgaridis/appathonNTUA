      This is a Phase III randomized controlled multi-center trial comparing anlotinib plus
      Gemcitabine/Cisplatin with placebo plus Gemcitabine/Cisplatin in previous untreated patients
      with recurrent/metastatic Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma, in order to verify the efficacy and
      security of anlotinib in mNPC patients.
