  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators aim to compare the quality of pain relief provided by local infiltration
      analgesia delivered by surgeon and Pecs block delivered by anaesthetist under ultrasound
      guidance for patients undergoing mastectomy with axillary dissection.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Total breast removal with armpit dissection may be a painful surgery. Pectoral nerve block
      (Pecs block) is common pain relief method used to reduce pain after breast surgery.

      The Pecs block is a pain relief method technique at targeted body part. The Pecs block numbs
      nerves which supply sensation to the upper chest wall, armpit and upper arm. This procedure
      is only possible under ultrasound guidance and is carried out by the anaesthetist (medical
      specialist who administers anaesthetics) after patients are put under general anaesthesia.

      Despite the advantages of Pecs block in pain management, this method is not always available
      to all patients due to various reasons. These reasons include the availability of ultrasound
      machine to facilitate the method, presence of anaesthetist to carry out the procedure and
      additional time required to perform this method in the operating theatre.

      Another method has been modified by our surgeons (medical specialist who performs surgery, a
      different specialty from anaesthetist) to achieve pain relief among patients undergoing
      breast removal surgery. This method is called local infiltration analgesia (LIA). The pain
      control is achieved by having the surgeons to deliver a pain control drug surgically during
      the breast removal operation. LIA could be a good pain control alternative when a Pecs block
      could not be performed.

      The investigators hope to compare the quality of pain relief provided by local infiltration
      analgesia delivered by surgeon and Pecs block delivered by anaesthetist under ultrasound
      guidance. The investigators hope to show that LIA delivered by surgeon is as effective as
      Pecs block in patients undergoing mastectomy with axillary dissection.
