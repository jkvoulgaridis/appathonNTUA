    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well nab-paclitaxel and durvalumab with or without
      personalized synthetic long peptide vaccine (neoantigen vaccine) work in treating
      participants with triple negative breast cancer that has spread to other places in the body.
      Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as nab-paclitaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth
      of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping
      them from spreading. Monoclonal antibodies, such as durvalumab, may interfere with the
      ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Vaccines made from peptides may help the body
      build an effective immune response to kill tumor cells. It is not yet known whether giving
      nab-paclitaxel and durvalumab with or without neoantigen vaccine will work better in treating
      participants with triple negative breast cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the clinical response to nab-paclitaxel + MEDI4736 (durvalumab) + neoantigen
      vaccine (Arm 1) versus (vs.) nab-paclitaxel + MEDI4736 (durvalumab) (Arm 2) in patients with
      metastatic triple negative breast cancer (TNBC).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the safety of nab-paclitaxel + MEDI4736 (durvalumab) + neoantigen vaccine vs.
      nab-paclitaxel + MEDI4736 (durvalumab) in patients with metastatic TNBC.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess the immune response induced by nab-paclitaxel + MEDI4736 (durvalumab) + neoantigen
      vaccine vs. nab-paclitaxel + MEDI4736 (durvalumab) in patients with metastatic TNBC.

      II. Biomarkers of response to therapy will be assessed based on the research biopsies
      performed at baseline, following the chemotherapy run-in (Part A) and following
      nab-paclitaxel + MEDI4736 +/- neoantigen vaccine (Part B).

      OUTLINE:

      PART A: Participants receive gemcitabine hydrochloride intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes and
      carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 6 courses
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Participants with progression
      of disease within the first 18 weeks may switch and receive nab-paclitaxel IV over 30 minutes
      on days 1, 8, and 15 of each remaining course.

      PART B: Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Participants receive personalized synthetic long peptide vaccine and poly-ICLC
      subcutaneously (SC) on days 1, 4, 8, 15, 22, 50, and 78 in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity. Participants also receive durvalumab IV over 60 minutes on day 1
      and nab-paclitaxel IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15. courses repeat every 28 days in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Participants receive durvalumab IV over 60 minutes on day 1 and nab-paclitaxel IV
      over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up for 52 weeks.

          -  Evidence of post-menopausal status or negative urinary or serum pregnancy test for
             female pre-menopausal patients. Women will be considered post-menopausal if they have
             been amenorrheic for 12 months without an alternative medical cause. The following
             age-specific requirements apply:

               -  Women &lt; 50 years of age would be considered post-menopausal if they have been
                  amenorrheic for 12 months or more following cessation of exogenous hormonal
                  treatments and if they have luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone
                  levels in the post-menopausal range for the institution or underwent surgical
                  sterilization (bilateral oophorectomy or hysterectomy).

               -  Women &gt;= 50 years of age would be considered post-menopausal if they have been
                  amenorrheic for 12 months or more following cessation of all exogenous hormonal
                  treatments, had radiation-induced menopause with last menses &gt; 1 year ago, had
                  chemotherapy-induced menopause with last menses &gt; 1 year ago, or underwent
                  surgical sterilization (bilateral oophorectomy, bilateral salpingectomy or
                  hysterectomy).

          -  The effects of MEDI4736 (durvalumab) and neoantigen vaccine on the developing human
             fetus are unknown. For this reason and because these agents may be teratogenic, women
             of child-bearing potential must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or
             barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry, for the duration of
             study participation, and through 180 days after the last dose of durvalumab. Should a
             woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is
             participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.

          -  Patient is willing and able to comply with the protocol for the duration of the study
             including undergoing treatment and scheduled visits and examinations including follow
             up.

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have had chemotherapy, radiotherapy (to more than 30% of the bone
             marrow), or biologic therapy within 30 days (42 days for nitrosoureas or mitomycin C)
             prior to entering the study.

          -  Patients who have received prior immunotherapy for metastatic disease.

          -  Any previous treatment with a PD1 or PD-L1 inhibitor, including MEDI4736 (durvalumab).

          -  Patients who have not recovered from adverse events due to prior anti-cancer therapy
             (i.e., have residual toxicities &gt; grade 1).

          -  Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents or who have received an
             investigational agent within the last 30 days.

          -  Receipt of live attenuated vaccination within 6 months prior to study entry or within
             30 days of receiving MEDI4736 (durvalumab).

          -  Major surgical procedure within 28 days prior to the first dose of MEDI4736
             (durvalumab). Local surgery of isolated lesions for palliative intent is acceptable.

          -  Current use or prior use of immunosuppressive medication within 28 days before the
             first dose of MEDI4736 (durvalumab), with the exceptions of intranasal and inhaled
             corticosteroids or systemic corticosteroids at physiological doses which are not to
             exceed 10 mg/day of prednisone or an equivalent corticosteroid.

          -  Known central nervous system (CNS) disease, except for treated asymptomatic CNS
             metastases. Patients with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical
             trial because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive
             neurologic dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other
             adverse events.

          -  Leptomeningeal disease.

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to MEDI4736 (durvalumab). Known allergy, or history of serious adverse
             reaction to vaccines, such as anaphylaxis, hives or respiratory difficulty.

          -  Mean QT interval corrected for heart rate using Fridericia's formula (QTcF) ≥ 470 ms
             calculated from 3 electrocardiograms (ECGs) (within 15 minutes at 5 minutes apart).

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, uncontrolled hypertension, unstable
             angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, interstitial lung disease, serious chronic
             gastrointestinal conditions associated with diarrhea, evidence of any acute or chronic
             viral illness or disease, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit
             compliance with study requirements.

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because MEDI4736 (durvalumab) has the
             potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but
             potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the
             mother with MEDI4736 (durvalumab), breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother
             is treated with MEDI4736 (durvalumab). These potential risks may also apply to other
             agents used in this study. A negative serum pregnancy test is required no more than 7
             days before study entry.

          -  Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients are ineligible because of the
             potential inability to generate an immune response to vaccines.

          -  Active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2 years
             (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids, or immunosuppressive
             drugs). Replacement therapy (e.g. thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid
             replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a
             form of systemic treatment.

          -  History of pneumonitis or interstitial lung disease.

          -  History of active primary immunodeficiency.

          -  Active infection including tuberculosis (clinical evaluation that includes clinical
             history, physical examination, and radiographic findings, and TB testing in line with
             local practice), hepatitis B (positive test for hepatitis B virus (HBV) surface
             antigen (HBsAg)), or hepatitis C (positive test for hepatitis C virus ribonucleic acid
             (HCV RNA) indicating acute or chronic infection.

          -  The patient with a previous history of non-breast malignancy is eligible for this
             study only if the patient meets the following criteria for a cancer survivor. A cancer
             survivor is eligible provided the following criteria are met:

               -  Patient has undergone potentially curative therapy for all prior malignancies.

               -  Patients have been considered disease free for at least 1 year (with the
                  exception of basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin or
                  carcinoma-in-situ of the cervix).

          -  Patients with a strong likelihood of non-adherence (such as difficulties in adhering
             to follow-up schedule due to geographic distance from the treatment facility) should
             not be knowingly registered.

          -  Patients with a history of prior allogeneic stem cell or solid organ transplantation.
