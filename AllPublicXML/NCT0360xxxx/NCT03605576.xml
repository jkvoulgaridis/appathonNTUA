    <textblock>
      This is a randomized controlled trial to compare the efficacy of Fu's subcutaneous needle
      (FSN) and Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) on chronic neck pain by using
      more objective assessment tools such as Neck Disability Index, Visual Analog Scales, Pressure
      Pain Threshold and Myotone of MTrPs of Upper Trapezius Muscles, Range of Motion of Stretch of
      Upper Trapezius Muscle, and Pittsburgh sleep quality index.

      Neck pain combining limited range of motion is very common. Lasting for only a few days, it
      will taper off without any treatment. If the neck pain symptoms persist for more than two
      months without any improvement, it will be categorized as chronic neck pain causing not only
      pain but also functional impact, even in daily life, working, and sleep quality.

      Fu's subcutaneous needling is utilized in treating disease related with myofascial trigger
      point, including soft tissue pain, joint pain, even some internal problems. Indeed it reduce
      pain immediately with no obvious side effects. There were some clinical articles of
      subjective symptoms description published lacking scientific accessment of efficacy.

      Research team leading by Professor Chang-Zern Hong has already prove that excitability can be
      reduced by distal acupuncture. Needling TE5 and LI11 can reduce pain intensity and average
      amplitude of MTrPs end plate in upper trapezium m., and increase pain pressure threshold.

      Comparing to traditional acupuncture, whether safer and pain-less Fu's subcutaneous needle
      also has the distal treatment effect or not still needs more scientific experiment to prove.
      This is a randomized controlled trial to compare the efficacy of Transcutaneous electrical
      nerve stimulation and Fu's subcutaneous needle on chronic neck pain by using more objective
      assessment tools such as Neck Disability Index, Visual Analog Scales, Pressure Pain Threshold
      and Myotone of MTrPs of Upper Trapezius Muscles, Range of Motion of Stretch of Upper
      Trapezius Muscle, and Pittsburgh sleep quality index.

    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>The visual analogue scale or visual analog scale (VAS) is a psychometric response scale which can be used in questionnaires. It is a measurement instrument for subjective characteristics or attitudes that cannot be directly measured. When responding to a VAS item, respondents specify their level of agreement to a statement by indicating a position along a continuous line between two end-points.</description>

    <time_frame>1 week</time_frame>
    <description>The NDI is a modification of the Oswestry Low Back Pain Disability Index . It is a patient-completed, condition-specific functional status questionnaire with 10 items including pain, personal care, lifting, reading, headaches, concentration, work, driving, sleeping and recreation. The NDI has sufficient support and usefulness to retain its current status as the most commonly used self-report measure for neck pain</description>

    <measure>Pressure Pain Threshold</measure>

    <description>Pressure pain threshold (PPT) is defined as the minimum force applied which induces pain. This measure has proven to be commonly useful in evaluating tenderness symptom.</description>

    <description>Muscle tone is the muscle's resistance to passive stretch during resting state. Myotone will help the investigators to get muscle parameters such as tone, elasticity and stiffness.</description>

    <measure>Pittsburgh sleep quality index</measure>
    <time_frame>1 week</time_frame>
    <description>The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) is a self-report questionnaire that assesses sleep quality over a 1-month time interval. The measure consists of 19 individual items, creating 7 components that produce one global score, and takes 5-10 minutes to complete. Developed by researchers at the University of Pittsburgh, the PSQI is intended to be a standardized sleep questionnaire for clinicians and researchers to use with ease and is used for multiple populations. The questionnaire has been used in many settings, including research and clinical activities, and has been used in the diagnosis of sleep disorders. Clinical studies have found the PSQI to be reliable and valid in the assessment of sleep problems to some degree, but more so with self-reported sleep problems and depression-related symptoms than actigraphic measures</description>

    <description>Fu's Subcutaneous Needle (FSN), is an innovation for the treatment of myofascial pain and trigger points. The needle is a non-injection needle, and the fact that both needles are manipulated and act on soft connective tissue.
FSN abstains from the muscle and deep fascia layers and is confined to only the subcutaneous layer where collagen fibers are most abundant. As the subcutaneous layer is poorly innervated, pain is less than other needling therapies.
FSN is also currently being used successfully to treat non-musculoskeletal conditions.</description>

    <intervention_name>Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation</intervention_name>
    <description>Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS or TNS) is the use of electric current produced by a device to stimulate the nerves for therapeutic purposes.
TENS, by definition, covers the complete range of transcutaneously applied currents used for nerve excitation although the term is often used with a more restrictive intent, namely to describe the kind of pulses produced by portable stimulators used to treat pain. The unit is usually connected to the skin using two or more electrodes. A typical batteryoperated TENS unit is able to modulate pulse width, frequency and intensity. Generally TENS is applied at high frequency (&gt;50 Hz) with an intensity below motor contraction (sensory intensity) or low frequency (&lt;10 Hz) with an intensity that produces motor contraction.</description>
