  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite the high prevalence (20% of the hand fractures) of unstable neck metacarpals
      fractures (boxer's fractures) there is still no consensus concerning the preferred method and
      ideal moment of treatment, especially in active patients where the time or type of management
      can have a strong psychological impact on the outcomes.

      The use of intramedullar technique (headless intramedular screws or bouquet technique
      fixation) as definitive treatment of unstable boxer's fractures in active patients at the
      first week, may be a good choice of treatment. This technique is fast, safe, minimally
      invasive and easily performed reproducible method, without address the extensor tendon to
      prevent tendon adhesion and joint stiffness, unable earlier functional recovery and shorten
      the working return time of these patients. Choose a reproducible and effective method, which
      presents a cost / benefit compatible with our reality.

      The goal of the present study is to compare working return time, VAS (visual analogue score),
      quick DASH (disability arm, shoulder and hand) and radiographic outcomes of two methods of
      definitive internal fixation in active patients in boxer's fractures, operated in the first
      week.

      A double center, parallel group, prospective, randomized clinical trial was conducted at the
      department of Hand Surgery, ABC University hospital, Santo Andre, Brazil and Hospital M達e de
      Deus, Porto Alegre, Brazil. Two implants used for fixation in closed reduction of boxer's
      fractures were compared: the headless cannulated screws (Synthes速, Davos) and the Bouquet
      technique with k-wires (Synthes速, Davos). The protocol was approved by the local research
      ethics committee. All patients received, signed and are aware of what was recommended in the
      Informed Consent (IC). Inclusion criteria were; presence of an acute (0 to 7 days), closed
      and simple fracture of the metacarpal neck, absence of an ipsilateral injury or deformity,
      Start January 2017.
