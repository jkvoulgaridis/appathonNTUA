  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Early laryngeal cancer can be treatment by laser surgery or radiotherapy, intermediate and
      advanced laryngeal carcinoma mainly surgical treatment. Laryngeal cancer is at risk of
      recurrence after treatment, whether in surgery, laser or radiotherapy. The recurrence rate of
      laryngeal cancer is about 10% reported at home and abroad. Local pain, ulcers, breathing and
      eating difficulties caused by recurrent laryngeal cancer seriously reduce the quality of life
      of patients and seriously endanger their lives. Therefore, head and neck surgeons are
      required to make every effort to give them saving treatment in order to improve their quality
      of life. Prolong the patient's life.
