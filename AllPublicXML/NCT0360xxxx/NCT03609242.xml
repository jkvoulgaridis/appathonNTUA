  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Most adolescents who receive human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine are vaccinated in pediatric
      practices, yet missed opportunities (MOs) for HPV vaccination occur often and lead to low HPV
      vaccination rates. This cluster randomized clinical trial (RCT) will test the effectiveness
      (and cost-effectiveness) of HPV vaccine communication, performance feedback reports and
      provider prompts (the bundle) to reduce MOs and increase HPV vaccination rates.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      HPV vaccine rates remain lower than rates for other adolescent vaccines. Missed opportunities
      (MOs) are healthcare visits during which a patient is eligible, but does not receive a
      vaccine. MOs for vaccination contribute strongly to low HPV vaccination rates. This cluster
      randomized clinical trial will test the effectiveness (and cost-effectiveness) of a bundled
      intervention training providers first in HPV vaccine communication skills (done through
      online educational modules and live office practice sessions), with the addition of
      performance feedback reports (that pull from electronic health record (EHR) data, and compare
      participants' performance to their own previous performance and performance of others)
      followed by the addition of provider prompts (via EHR and also office staff prompts, e.g.,
      placing Vaccine Information Statements (VISs) on desk) to reduce MOs and increase HPV
      vaccination rates. Throughout the intervention participants will also receive weekly text
      message mini-lessons that will remind participants of the project.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Practice Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The practice provides HPV vaccination services to adolescents.

          -  The practice is part of Physician's Computer Company (PCC), Office Practicum (OP) or
             (a) yet-to-be selected health system(s).

          -  The practice has had the same EHR system in place for a year or more (with special
             consideration on a case by case basis if they are close to but not do not reach a
             year).

          -  The practice agrees to not participate in other HPV-related QI projects or research
             interventions during the study period (with special consideration on a case by case
             basis).

        Practice Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The practice plans to change EHR systems in the next three years.

          -  The practice participated in the last year, is currently engaged in, or plans to
             participate in an office-based HPV-related quality improvement (QI) project or
             research intervention during the study period (with special consideration on a case by
             case basis).

          -  Estimated 20% or more of adolescents at the practice receive HPV vaccinations at
             schools or health department clinics (given standard practice and published data, the
             investigators expect that few to no practices will need to be excluded based on this
             restriction).

        Patient inclusion criteria:

        -All patients of participating practices (intervention and comparison) aged 11-17 years who
        have at least 1 visit to the practice within the past two years.

        Patient exclusion criteria:

        -None apart from age of patients (above).
