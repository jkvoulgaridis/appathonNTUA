  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that optimize our risk prediction for pelvic floor disorders
      after childbirth by taking into account intrinsic women's pelvic floor characteristics and
      their changes during pregnancy. Shear Wave Elastography (SWE) is a new technology that
      allowed an in vivo assessment of elastic properties of tissues. The main endpoint of this
      study is to describe biomechanical changes that occurs into women's pelvic floor during
      pregnancy using SWE technology.

      An ancillary study will investigate the reproducibility of the assessement of the
      viscoelastic properties of the levator ani muscle, the biceps brachii muscle and the
      gastrocnemius medialis muscle using shear wave elastography in a nulliparous non-pregnant
      women cohort

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Each woman included in the princeps study undergo 3 visits during pregnancy (14-18 weeks,
      24-28 weeks and 34-38 weeks).

      Each visit contain a clinical pelvic floor assessment (POP-Q), an ultrasound pelvic floor
      assessment, an ultrasound pelvic floor muscles (levator ani and external anal sphincter)
      viscoelastic properties assessment using shear wave elastography and an ultrasound peripheral
      muscles (biceps brachii and gastrocnemius medialis) using shear wave elastography.

      The main objective is to describe changes in viscoelastic properties of pelvic floor muscles
      during pregnancy. Secondary objectives are to compare muscular behavior of pelvic floor
      muscles and peripheral muscles during pregnancy.

      Data about the delivery are also collected in order to analyse preliminary data about the
      hypothetic association between viscoelastic properties of women's pelvic floor and both mode
      of delivery and perineal trauma at childbirth.

      An ancillary study involve non-pregnant nulliparous women in oder the investigate the
      reproducibility of shear wave elastography assessment of the levator ani muscle. Secondary
      objective is to investigate this reproducibility for biceps brachii and gastrocnemius
      medialis muscles.

    <description>women were assessed in lithotomy position with an empty bladder at rest, perineal contraction and Valsalva maneuver using a linear translabial probe. We measure the distance between symphysis and ano-rectal angle. In the same position we investigate the levator ani viscoelastic properties using shear wave elastography at rest, Valsalva maneuver and maximal contraction. During the same examination, we assess the viscoelastic properties of the external anal sphincter using shear wave elastography for the 3 conditions: rest, Valsalva, contraction.
This pelvic floor muscles assessment is performed for each of the three planned visits
For the ancillary study on non pregnant women: viscoelastic properties of levator ani are assessed at rest, stretch and contraction using shear wave elastography.
This pelvic floor muscle assessment is performed for each of the two planned visit in the ancillary study.</description>
