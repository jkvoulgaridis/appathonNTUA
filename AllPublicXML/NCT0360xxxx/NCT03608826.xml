    <textblock>
      The purpose of the ReLINQuish study is to characterize the relationship between subcutaneous
      impedance and hemodynamic measurements in patients with heart failure. Additionally, the
      relationship between changes in subcutaneous impedance and other physiologic parameters
      during acute decompensated HF events will be characterized.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients meeting at least 1 of 3 criteria will be included in the study:

               -  Patients with symptomatic systolic or diastolic heart failure who in the
                  clinician's judgment have a high likelihood of undergoing serial right heart
                  catheterizations to aid in clinical management of their heart failure

               -  Patients with dyspnea on exertion in whom exercise hemodynamics is indicated to
                  diagnose diastolic dysfunction

               -  Patients who have or will be implanted with a pulmonary artery pressure monitor

          -  Patient is 18 years of age or older

          -  Patient (or patient's legally authorized representative) is willing and able to
             provide written informed consent

          -  Patient is willing and able to comply with the protocol, including follow-up visits
             and Carelink transmissions.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient has an existing Medtronic implantable cardiac device

          -  Patient has a left ventricular assist device (LVAD)

          -  Patient is pregnant (all females of child-bearing potential must have a negative
             pregnancy test within 1 week of enrollment)

          -  Patient is enrolled in another study that could confound the results of this study,
             without documented pre-approval from a Medtronic study manager
