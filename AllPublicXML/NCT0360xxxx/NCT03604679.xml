    <textblock>
      This study is an open-label, multicenter, phase 1 study of SyB C-0501 by continuous daily
      oral administration in patients with advanced solid tumors, who have previously received
      anticancer therapy and consists of two parts. Part 1 is a dose escalation study to evaluate
      tolerability of SyB C-0501 in the patients, and to find the maximum tolerated dose (MTD),
      recommended dose (RD) and optimum dosing schedule. Part 2 is being done to evaluate safety
      and anti-tumor activity of SyB C-0501 preliminarily at RD, and to assess its target cancer
      exploratory.
