  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) and safety profile of
      asciminib following a single oral dose in adult subjects with renal impairment compared to a
      matched group of healthy subjects with normal renal function.

      The results will determine whether or not a dose adjustment should be recommended when
      treating patients with asciminib who have impaired renal function.
