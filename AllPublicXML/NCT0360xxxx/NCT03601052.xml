  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Remlarsen (MRG-201) is designed to mimic the activity of a molecule called miR-29 that
      decreases the expression of collagen and other proteins that are involved in scar formation.
      Remlarsen is being studied to determine if it can limit the formation of fibrous scar tissue
      in certain diseases. The objectives of this study are to investigate the safety and
      tolerability of remlarsen in subjects with a history of keloid scars, and to investigate the
      activity of remlarsen in prevention or reduction of keloid formation. Another objective is to
      study the pharmacokinetics of remlarsen (the movement of a drug into, through and out of the
      body). A group of 12-16 study volunteers will undergo two small skin biopsies in the upper
      back/shoulder region that will be closed with sutures. One biopsy site will be injected with
      up to 6 doses of remlarsen over a period of 2 weeks and the second site will be injected
      similarly with a placebo solution. Participants will be monitored for keloid formation at the
      two biopsy sites, for signs or symptoms of adverse effects on the body, and for the levels of
      remlarsen in the blood over time. A second 2-week cycle of treatment may be administered if
      there are signs that a keloid may be forming at one or both biopsy sites. Subjects will be
      followed for about 1 year following their final course of treatment to assess the long-term
      safety of remlarsen and the potential for later appearance of a keloid scar. Additional
      groups of subjects may be enrolled to test lower doses of remlarsen or an extended dosing
      schedule.
