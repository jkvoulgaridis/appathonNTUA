    <description>All colorectal polyps found are removed using a rotary polypectomy snare (Disposable Polypectomy Snare). The technique is hot snare resection of the polyp with electrocautery. Details are as follows: (1) insert the snare into the colonoscopy; (2) connect the snare with the high-frequency device;(3) advance sliding handle to open the loop; (4) adjust the direction of the snare by rotating the handle as required, rotate the loop until the loop reaches target polyp; (6) encircle the target polyp with loop; (7) pull the sliding handle, lasso the target polyp;(8) resect the polyp with electrocautery, then inhaling the transected polyp into a trap followed by submission to the histological evaluation. The hemostatic clipping is used after hot snare polypectomy if removing a flat polyp or bleeding on the wound after treatment.</description>

    <description>All colorectal polyps found are removed using a regular polypectomy snare (polypectomy snare, symmetrical). The technique is hot snare resection of the polyp with electrocautery. Details are as follows: (1) insert the snare into the colonoscopy; (2) connect the snare with the high-frequency device;(3) advance sliding handle to open the loop; (4) adjust the bending section angulation of the colonoscopy as required, advance the snare until the loop reaches target polyp; (6) encircle the target polyp with loop; (7) pull the sliding handle, lasso the target polyp;(8) resect the polyp with electrocautery, then suction of the transected polyp into a trap followed by submission to the histological evaluation. The hemostatic clipping is performed after hot snare polypectomy if a flat polyp or bleeding on the wound after treatment.</description>
