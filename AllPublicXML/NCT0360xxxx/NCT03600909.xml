  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to see if the study therapy can decrease the chemotherapy-related
      side effects while maximizing the effectiveness of disease control. The physicians will also
      be studying the effect of removing T-cells from the donor‟s stem cells before transplant.
      T-cells are a type of white blood cell that may help cause a serious side effect of
      transplant called Graft versus Host Disease (GVHD). The way it removes the T-cells from the
      donor stem cells is actually by selecting only the stem cells (called CD34 cells) by using a
      device called CliniMACS. This process is called CD34 selection. The CliniMACS® device is
      currently under the supervision of the FDA .

    <description>Primary non-engraftment is diagnosed when the patient fails to achieve an ANC ≥500/µl at any time in the first 28 days post-transplant. If (1) after achievement of an ANC ≥500/mm^3, the ANC declines to &lt;500/mm^3 for more than 3 consecutive days in the absence of relapse, or, (2) there is absence of donor cells in the marrow and/or blood as demonstrated by chimerism assay in the absence of relapse, a diagnosis of secondary graft failure is made. The patient is not evaluable for graft failure or rejection if recurrence of host MDS is detected concurrently.</description>
