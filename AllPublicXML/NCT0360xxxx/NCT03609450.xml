  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study compares the effectiveness of an 8-week mindfulness-based intervention
      (Mindfulness Training for Primary Care[MTPC]) vs. a low-dose mindfulness comparator on
      self-regulation targets, specifically the primary outcome of emotion regulation. Secondary
      outcomes include sustained attention/response inhibition and interoceptive awareness. A
      secondary analysis will investigate the extent to which these self-regulation targets mediate
      the impact of MTPC group on action plan initiation.

    <textblock>
      The current Phase 3 comparative effectiveness randomized controlled trial examines impact of
      MTPC on specific mechanisms of change such as emotion regulation (primary outcome),
      interoceptive awareness and sustained attention/response inhibition (secondary outcomes).
      This study will also investigate the extent to which these self-regulation targets mediate
      the impact of MTPC group on action plan initiation. Participants randomized to 8-week MTPC
      are compared with participants randomized to a low-dose mindfulness comparator condition, in
      which they receive a 1-hour introduction to mindfulness with a referral to community
      mindfulness resources. Outcome assessments are conducted at baseline and study weeks 8-10.
      This study builds on the Phase 2 study, which demonstrated that Mindfulness Training for
      Primary Care enhanced chronic illness self-management action plan initiation among primary
      care patients receiving care in an urban, community, multi-cultural safety net healthcare
      system.

    <time_frame>Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The Difficulties in Emotion Regulation (DERS) Scale is a 36-item self-report scale designed to assess emotional dysregulation using a 5 point Likert scale. The scale assesses 6 aspects of emotional dysregulation: non-acceptance of emotional responses, difficulties engaging in goal directed behavior, impulse control difficulties, lack of emotional awareness, limited access to emotion regulation strategies, and lack of emotional clarity. Subscales are summed and a lower total score represents a better outcome.</description>

    <description>MTPC is a referral-based, insurance-reimbursable 8-week program delivered as group psychotherapy by Patient-Centered Medical Home-integrated behavioral clinicians or as an 8-week primary care group visit delivered by a primary care provider. MTPC groups are 2 hours for 8 weeks with a 7-hour weekend day of silent practice. MTPC emphasizes mindfulness-oriented skills for self-regulation, self-management of chronic illness, and health behavior change. All participants complete an action plan during Week 7. Participants are called every two weeks for the first eight weeks for 5-10 minute engagement calls which focus helping participants cultivate a relationship with study staff, giving participants a place to ask questions, and supporting participants in completing study visits.</description>
