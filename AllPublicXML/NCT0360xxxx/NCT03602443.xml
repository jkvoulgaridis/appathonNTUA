  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Evaluate feasibility (acceptability, subject recruitment/retention, willingness to be
      randomized, and adherence rates) of delivering the Lee Silverman Voice Treatment®-BIG
      (LSVT®BIG) intervention with individuals with chronic stroke. Evaluate preliminary effect of
      the LSVT®BIG intervention on motor function and occupational performance with individuals
      with chronic stroke.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Literature suggests the Lee Silverman Voice Treatment®-BIG (LSVT-BIG®) program is an
      effective intervention for individuals with Parkinson's Disease (Ebersbach et al., 2015);
      however, no literature or research exists on the use of this program as an intervention for
      individuals with stroke. Therefore, this project aims to measure the effectiveness of the
      LSVT®BIG program with one individual with a stroke to determine if LSVT®BIG is a feasible and
      effective occupational therapy intervention for this population. The LSVT®BIG program is an
      intensive program with hands-on treatment sessions 4 days per week for 4 weeks. Clients
      complete home exercises every day that enhance the hands-on treatment and help promote
      carry-over of skills learned to daily tasks. The investigators have completed two case
      studies with clients with chronic stroke who demonstrated improved outcomes in upper
      extremity motor function and occupational performance. The purpose of this study is to test
      the LSVT®BIG intervention with a larger clinical population and to demonstrate that LSVT®BIG
      is an effective and feasible treatment option for improvement in occupational performance and
      upper extremity motor function with individuals with stroke.
