    <description>SNDX-6352 is a high affinity antibody targeting the colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF-1R). CSF-1R signaling has been demonstrated in nonclinical studies to be the key regulatory pathway involved in the expansion and infiltration of donor derived macrophages that mediate the disease processes involved in cGVHD.</description>

             a. Active cGVHD is defined as the presence of signs and symptoms of cGVHD per 2014 NIH
             Consensus Development Project on Criteria for Clinical trials in cGVHD.

          4. Subjects may have persistent active acute and cGVHD manifestations (overlap syndrome),
             as defined by 2014 NIH Consensus Development Project on Criteria for Clinical trials
             in cGVHD.

             screening.

          3. History or other evidence of severe illness, uncontrolled infection or any other
             conditions that would make the subject, in the opinion of the Investigator, unsuitable
             for the study.

          4. Known history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or active hepatitis C virus (HCV)
             or hepatitis B virus (HBV).

          5. Diagnosed with another malignancy (other than malignancy for which transplant was
             performed) within 3 years of enrollment, unless previously treated with curative
             intent and must be approved by Sponsor medical monitor (e.g., completely resected
             basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, resected in situ cervical
             malignancy, resected breast ductal carcinoma in situ, or low-risk prostate cancer
             after curative resection).

          6. Female subjects who is pregnant or breastfeeding.

          7. Previous exposure to study intervention or known allergy/sensitivity to study
             intervention.

          8. Taking agents other than a corticosteroid and one calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) for
             treatment of cGVHD (This does not include agents being prescribed expressly for the
             treatment of acute GVHD).

          9. Receiving an investigational treatment within 28 days of study entry.
