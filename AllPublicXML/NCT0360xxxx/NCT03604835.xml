      The objectives of this study are to characterize MPS VII disease presentation and progression
      and assess long-term effectiveness and safety, including hypersensitivity reactions and
      immunogenicity of vestronidase alfa.

      The Mucopolysaccharidosis VII Disease Monitoring Program (MPS VII DMP) is a global,
      prospective, multicenter, longitudinal protocol designed to characterize MPS VII disease
      presentation and progression, assess long-term effectiveness and safety of vestronidase alfa,
      including hypersensitivity reactions and immunogenicity , as well as prospectively
      investigate longitudinal change across biomarker(s), clinical assessments, and patient/
      caregiver-reported outcome measures in a representative population. The aim of this DMP is to
      collect data on patients with MPS VII to provide a comprehensive dataset on the clinical
      presentation, heterogeneity, and disease progression, and meaningful standardized ICH
      GCP-quality data collected in-clinic across multiple sites globally. The DMP is not a
      randomized study and both treated and untreated patients will be enrolled.
