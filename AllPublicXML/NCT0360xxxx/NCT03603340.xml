  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cigarette smoking is the leading cause of preventable death in Switzerland and still more
      than a quarter of the Swiss population smokes cigarettes. Smoking and depression are strongly
      associated. Individuals with depression are twice as likely to be smokers than persons
      without a depression. Studies have shown that attempts to quit tobacco smoking are more
      likely to fail for individuals with depression than without. Depressive symptoms are common
      in prolonged nicotine withdrawal and individuals with depression are more nicotine dependent
      and more likely to suffer depressive symptoms during nicotine withdrawal compared to smokers
      in the general population.

      Recently, electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS; also called vaporizer or electronic
      cigarette) have become popular with smokers who want to stop smoking or reduce their exposure
      to inhaled chemicals since ENDS use appears to be safer than tobacco smoking. ENDS with
      nicotine containing e-liquids may be effective in assisting with tobacco smoking cessation
      without suffering depressive symptoms.

      This study will therefore test the efficacy of ENDS for cigarette smoking cessation, the
      safety of ENDS on adverse events and the effect of ENDS on health-related outcomes such as
      depression and exposure to inhaled chemicals.

      For this trial, cigarette smokers motivated to quit smoking cigarettes will be included.
      Participants in the intervention group will receive an ENDS and nicotine-containing
      e-liquids, which they will be allowed to use ad libitum. Additionally, they will receive
      smoking cessation counseling. Participants in the control group will receive smoking
      cessation counseling only. All participants will be followed over a 24-month period. Presence
      and severity of depression will be assessed using the 9-question depression scale from the
      patient health questionnaire (PHQ-9) at baseline and at 6, 12 and 24 months' follow-up.
