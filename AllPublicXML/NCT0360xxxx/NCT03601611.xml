      Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) might induce inflammatory potentially serious and even
      lethal immune related Adverse Events (irAEs). Diarrhea and/or colitis are ones of the most
      frequently reported irAEs in patients taking ICI. Although the immune mechanisms underlying
      irAEs have not been fully elucidated, studies suggest that Th17 and Tregs cells, increases in
      expression of immunologically-related genes, eosinophilia, microbiome among others and
      cytokines may be involved in the pathophysiology of immune-related complications in some
      diseases that resemble irAEs, such as colitis and rheumatic manifestations. Importantly,
      interleukin-6 (IL-6) promotes the differentiation of naïve CD4+ T cells into Th17 cells (17),
      and IL-6 inhibition may rebalance the altered Th17-Treg axis without inhibiting the Th1-CD8+
      T-cell subsets that govern antitumor immunity. These findings raise the possibility of using
      IL-6 blockade as a strategy for treating colitis and arthritis induced by immune checkpoint
      blockade.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) targeting cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4
      (CTLA-4) and the programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1)/programmed cell death ligand-1
      (PD-L1) pathway might induce inflammatory potentially serious and even lethal immune related
      Adverse Events (irAEs). Diarrhea and/or colitis are ones of the most frequently reported
      irAEs in patients taking ICI, occurring after an average of three infusions. The incidence is
      higher among patients taking combination anti-CTLA-4/ anti-PD-1 therapy (44%) than those
      receiving anti-CTLA-4 (23-33%) or anti-PD-1 (≤19%) monotherapy. The most common autoimmune
      and musculoskeletal irAEs reported in clinical trials are represented by arthralgia and
      arthritis. The incidence of arthralgia and/or inflammatory arthritis secondary to nivolumab
      therapy ranges from 5% to 16% and 5%, respectively. Although the immune mechanisms underlying
      irAEs have not been fully elucidated, studies suggest that Th17 and Tregs cells, increases in
      expression of immunologically-related genes, eosinophilia, microbiome among others and
      cytokines may be involved in the pathophysiology of immune-related complications in some
      diseases that resemble irAEs, such as colitis and rheumatic manifestations. Previous studies
      report Th-17, that drives interleukin-17 (IL-17) production, as a key mediator of many immune
      diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease and ICI-induced colitis, and IL-17 elevations
      have been observed in experimental colitis. Importantly, interleukin-6 (IL-6) promotes the
      differentiation of naïve CD4+ T cells into Th17 cells (17), and IL-6 inhibition may rebalance
      the altered Th17-Treg axis without inhibiting the Th1-CD8+ T-cell subsets that govern
      antitumor immunity. An imbalance of Th17/Treg may cause the onset and progression of
      immune-mediated side effects. Thus, a 3-fold increase of IL-17 and IL-6 by week 12,
      concomitant with the development of fulminant colitis has been reported in a patient who
      developed presumed ipilimumab-induced colitis. These findings raise the possibility of using
      IL-6 blockade as a strategy for treating colitis and arthritis induced by immune checkpoint
      blockade.

    <intervention_model_description>- Patients will receive tocilizumab 8 mg/kg given as an IV infusion over 60 minutes every 4 weeks (Q4W) for at least 2 cycles or until worsening or lack of improvement of diarrhea and/or colitis and/arthritis, in case of unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent or clear clinical deterioration, according to investigator's judgment.
At the initial stage, 7 patients will be enrolled and evaluated for symptom improvement. In case of ≤ 4 patients with at least one grade improvement, accrual will be terminated. If ≥ 5 patients with at least one grade improvement will be observed at the first stage, 13 additional patients will be entered at the second stage to achieve a target sample size of 20 evaluable patients. Further exploration of the treatment strategy is warranted, if at least one grade improvement is observed for ≥14 patients.</intervention_model_description>
