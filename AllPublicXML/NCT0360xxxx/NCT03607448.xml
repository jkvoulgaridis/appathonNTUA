    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to characterize the Freestyle Libre Flash Glucose Monitoring
      System performance with respect to YSI reference venous plasma sample measurements.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Up to 200 subjects will be enrolled in this study at a total of 6 clinical research sites in
      the United States. Subjects will wear a total of two (2) sensors, one on the back of each
      upper arm. Each Sensor will have a paired Reader that will be given to the subject. All
      Readers will be masked during the study (i.e. subjects will not be able to view glucose
      results obtained from the Sensor on the Reader screen). Subjects will be asked to perform at
      least 8 capillary Blood Glucose (BG) tests per day using the primary Reader. Interstitial
      glucose readings from each Sensor will be obtained with the corresponding Readers immediately
      following each BG test. Subjects will be instructed to report any problems with the device.
      Subjects will make six (6) scheduled visits to the clinical study site, including the
      Enrollment/Screening Visit (Visit 1). Subjects will have three (3) in-clinic visits during
      which intravenous blood draws and YSI reference testing will occur.

    <description>Subjects will wear the Abbott Sensor Based Glucose Monitoring Systems and expected to perform at least 8 capillary BG test per day. Site Staff will determine when subject will undergo either a hypoglycemia induction or a hyperglycemia induction. Study staff will perform IV blood draw to obtain blood plasma for YSI sampling every 15 min when glucose as measured by YSI is above 70mg/dL and below 240 mg/dL.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject must be at least 18 years of age.

          -  Subject must have type 1 or type 2 diabetes.

          -  Subject must require insulin therapy through an insulin pump and/or multiple daily
             insulin injections (at least 3 injections daily).

          -  Willing to perform a minimum of 8 finger sticks per day while wearing the sensor in
             the study.

          -  Subject must be able to read and understand English.

          -  Willing to have their blood sugar manipulated during in-clinic sessions.

          -  In the investigator's opinion, the subject must be able to follow the instructions
             provided to him/her by the study site and perform all study tasks as specified by the
             protocol.

          -  At the time of enrollment, subject must be available to participate in all study
             visits.

          -  Subject must be willing and able to provide written signed and dated informed consent.

          -  Additional criteria for hypoglycemia induction.

          -  Known insulin sensitivity factor.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has a history of hypoglycemia unawareness.
