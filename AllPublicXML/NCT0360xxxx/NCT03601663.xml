  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Physical activity has been shown to reduce the risk of chronic diseases and promote physical
      and mental health and wellbeing, yet few women are active enough to see these benefits.
      Wearable activity trackers show promise for helping people increase their physical activity
      levels by supporting self-monitoring. However, few researchers have examined how providing
      people with these devices impacts physical activity levels, or motivation for physical
      activity which is a significant and robust predictor of physical activity. Based on previous
      research, it is possible that women's physical activity levels would be more likely to
      increase if they received an autonomy-supportive intervention to enhance motivation in
      addition to a wearable activity tracker. A pilot, three-armed randomized controlled trial was
      developed to test this hypothesis and to assess if changes in perceived autonomy-support,
      basic psychological need satisfaction/thwarting, motivational regulations, wellbeing
      indicators are associated with changes in physical activity over time.
