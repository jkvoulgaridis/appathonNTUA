      This study was a one-arm, single-center, phase II clinical study. Patients who meet the
      enrollment criteria will receive CM082 tablets 200mg once daily (qd) orally (taken within
      half an hour after daily breakfast) in combination with JS001 (3mg/kg, once every 2 weeks,
      q2w), every 28 days a treatment cycle until the disease progresses , the toxicity is
      intolerable, the investigator or subject decides to withdraw, loses to follow up, starts
      using other anti-tumor treatments or dies.
