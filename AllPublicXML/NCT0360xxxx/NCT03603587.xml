  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aging of skin, especially that of the scalp, is a combination of intrinsic and extrinsic
      aging factors secondary to the chronic sun exposure. For men with an alopecia genetic (= bald
      men), the solar part, in skin aging process, is major.

      The helio-dermal scalp is frequently the site of cancers mainly after 65 years. Objectives
      are to identify specific biomarkers involved in the photo-aging of the alopecic scalp
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Investigators can also hope to understand and to explain the inter-individual inequality of
      the aging of skin. They can hope to a better understanding of the biological mechanisms
      between photo-induced skin aging and photo-induced carcinogenesis.

      Investigators propose to study 40 male patients aged 65 and over in order to compare the
      state of aging of their scalp skin in the alopecic zone :

      not hairy photo-exposed (= ZH sun damage zone) versus occipital hair zone protected photo (=
      ZT control zone).

      Patients will be recruited in the dermatology department of the St-Etienne University
      Hospital who will benefit from the removal of a scalp tumour in the alopecic zone.

      This study aims to identify biological markers, by transcriptomic analysis, associated with
      aging of the scalp, by comparing for each patient the skin of the scalp exposed to the light
      (&quot;ZH&quot;) to an unexposed witness skin (&quot;ZT&quot;).

      The study will include :

        -  examinations to characterize components of the scalp: transcriptomic, proteomic and
           immunohistochemical analysis of skin biopsies, and a swab sampling will identify the
           cutaneous microflora of the scalp

        -  noninvasive examinations, in vivo
