  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Phase II of this study will examine the efficacy of the OC-Go application via a randomized
      controlled trial comparing standard exposure and response prevention (ERP) treatment for
      pediatric obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) to exposure/response prevention (ERP) augmented
      with OC-Go. A cross-over design will be implemented for these 12 sessions of treatment, in
      which participants that were randomized to standard ERP will receive OC-Go augmented ERP for
      the second half of treatment, and vice versa. Efficacy will be investigated in a sample of 32
      children with OCD.

    <textblock>
      This project seeks to refine and assess OC-Go, a HIPAA-compliant web-based clinician portal
      and patient-side mobile application designed to increase patient adherence to evidence-based
      treatment (EBT) for OCD, a common and impairing condition, and provider ability to
      effectively implement EBTs. OC-Go allows clinicians to create and push tailored assignments
      to patients on their mobile devices with an optimized user interface that includes patient
      accountability and support features. Accordingly, patients can be guided to do assignments by
      themselves between sessions with increased fidelity over the course of treatment. Once
      therapy assignments are created and shared to a crowd-sourced and curated public library, any
      clinician can assign any task to any patient for homework or in-session use with one touch.
      Use of OC-Go is expected to increase patient engagement, compliance, treatment efficiency,
      dissemination of EBTs, and therapist confidence and expertise.

    <intervention_model_description>All participants will receive 12 weeks of exposure/response/prevention (ERP). Sessions 1 (psychoeducation/hierarchy creation) and 12 (relapse prevention &amp; generalization training) will be identical across both randomization groups.
Treatment sequences for the randomization groups will be as follows:
OC-GO-FIRST - Sessions 2-6: ERP+OC-Go, Sessions 7-11: Standard ERP
STANDARD ERP-FIRST - Sessions 2-6: Standard ERP, Sessions 7-11: ERP+OC-Go</intervention_model_description>
