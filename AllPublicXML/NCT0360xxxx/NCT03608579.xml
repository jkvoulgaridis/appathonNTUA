    <textblock>
      Will injection(s) of autologous culture-expanded AMSCs be safe and efficacious for treatment
      of painful Hip OA, and if so, which dosing regimen is most effective?
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This phase I study will enroll 24 subjects with mild to moderate osteoarthritis of the hip.
      Subjects will receive either a single dose of 30 million autologous culture-expanded
      adipose-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (AMSCs), or two doses of AMSCs (with one month
      interval between doses) via ultrasound guided intra-articular hip injection. Patients will be
      followed for 24 months past their last injection to determine the local and systemic safety
      of single and two-dose injections of AMSCs in the treatment of symptomatic hip OA.

        Inclusion Criteria

        To be eligible for inclusion into this study, the subjects must fulfill all of the
        following criteria:

          1. Male or female ages 18-65 years

             â€¢ Persons of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test prior to
             receiving the study drug and will agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or
             barrier method or abstinence) from the time of screening to a period of 1 year
             following completion of the drug treatment cycle. Females of childbearing potential
             are defined as premenopausal and not surgically sterilized, or post-menopausal for
             fewer than 2 years. A urine pregnancy test will be performed prior to the
             administration of the study drug to confirm negative results. If the urine pregnancy
             test is positive, the study drug will not be administered and the result will be
             confirmed by a serum pregnancy test. Serum pregnancy tests will be performed at a
             central clinical laboratory, whereas urine pregnancy tests will be performed by
             qualified personnel using kit

          2. Persons becoming pregnant during the study will continue to be monitored for the
             duration of the study or completion of the pregnancy, whichever is longer. Monitoring
             will include perinatal and neonatal outcome. Any SAEs associated with pregnancy will
             be recorded.

          3. Chronic (&gt; 3 months), unilaterally symptomatic, primary hip OA. Patients with episodes
             of contralateral hip pain that is asymptomatic at the time of enrollment will be
             eligible for inclusion. However, as outlined in the primary study endpoints, patients
             with previous episodes of contralateral hip pain who experience a repeat episode of
             contralateral pain similar to their established pattern of pain during the course of
             the trial will not be considered as having experienced an adverse event.

          4. Radiographic hip OA of TÃ¶nnis Grade 1 - 2, accompanied by at least mild sclerosis and
             joint space narrowing, as agreed upon by two study co-investigators without underlying
             structural hip abnormalities

          5. Previous 6 week or longer trial of one of the following conservative treatments:
             activity modification, weight loss, physical therapy, anti-inflammatory medications or
             injection therapy (e.g. cortisone)

          6. Able to routinely walk without assistance (e.g. cane, walker)

          7. Clinically stable target hip

             12 months of enrollment

         10. Fully understanding of the requirements of the study and willingness to comply with
             the treatment plan, including fat harvesting, laboratory tests, diagnostic imaging,
             and follow-up visits and assessments

         11. Can provide written informed consent and complete HIPAA documentation after the nature
             of the study is fully explained and prior to any study-related procedure

        Exclusion Criteria
