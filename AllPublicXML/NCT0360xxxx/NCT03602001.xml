      This trial examined whether a smartphone application designed to encourage a more attentive
      eating style could help people to lose weight, compared to a control group.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is evidence that enhancing memory for recent eating and focusing attention on food
      being consumed influences later energy intake. Studies have shown that attending to food
      being eaten can reduce food intake. This has since been implemented into a smartphone based
      'attentive eating' application. In a feasibility trial of this mobile phone application,
      adults with overweight or obesity were encouraged to eat attentively by photographing their
      meals and making satiety ratings after they had eaten. Participants were also required to
      review what else they had eaten that day before entering their next meal, with an overall aim
      of encouraging a more attentive eating style. Adherence data and qualitative interviews
      suggested that the mobile phone app was generally acceptable to participants and easy to use.
      Participants reported that they felt the application increased their awareness of what they
      had been eating. There was also an average weight loss of 1.5kg across the 4 week period that
      participants used the application for. Given that the previous feasibility trial included no
      control condition, the aim of the current trial was to examine initial proof of concept for
      effectiveness of an attentive eating smartphone weight loss application.

      In the current study the investigators hypothesised that participants randomised to the
      attentive eating smartphone based condition (experimental condition) would lose significantly
      more weight than participants randomised to the control condition.

      The study is a single centre, parallel, two arm, individually randomised 8 week controlled
      trial in adults with overweight and obesity in the Merseyside area of England.

    <time_frame>Measured at baseline.</time_frame>
    <description>Participants beliefs about how confident they are that the intervention will help them to eat less and lose weight will be measured. The scale consists of 2 questions scored on 100-point visual analogue scales. If responses to both questions are strongly correlated (r ≥ 0.7), the average of the items will be computed to form a single composite measure. The possible score range is 0-100, with higher scores indicating higher beliefs that the intervention will help participants reduce food intake and aid weight loss.</description>
