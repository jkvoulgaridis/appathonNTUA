  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of the model of
      delivering CHW-driven home-based comprehensive NCD control services aimed to prevent
      premature deaths from cardio-vascular diseases, stroke and breast, cervix and oral cancers in
      the hard-to-reach women.

      Specific objectives of this study are the evaluation of:

        1. The social, cultural and behavioral factors that impact the uptake of the NCD control
           services among rural women using the Rapid Assessment, Response and Evaluation (RARE)
           approach;

        2. The feasibility and acceptability of the strategy to deliver the following NCD control
           services to the rural women at their homes by the trained CHWs:

             -  Counselling of the tobacco habitu√©s to give up the practice

             -  Early detection of hypertension and diabetes to ensure prompt and regular treatment

             -  Creating breast awareness and ensuring access to prompt diagnosis and treatment of
                the women with symptoms suggestive of breast cancer

             -  Screening for cervical cancer by self-collected HPV test and ensuring prompt
                treatment of screen detected precancers and cancers

             -  Screening of the habitual tobacco/alcohol users for oral cancer by OVE and ensuring
                prompt treatment of screen detected precancers and cancers
