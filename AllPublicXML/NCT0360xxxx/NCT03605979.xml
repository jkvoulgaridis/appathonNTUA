  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Looking for strict normoglycemia in type 1 diabetes increases the risk of hypoglycemia,
      exposing to hypoglycemia unawareness. It has been shown that the early correction of
      hypoglycemia can help recovering the perception of hypoglycemia. The purpose of this
      prospective study was to assess the value of sensor-augmented insulin-pump therapy to treat
      hypoglycemia unawareness.

    <textblock>
      To confirm hypoglycemia unawareness, patients answered a questionnaire based on the items
      explored by the model of Clarke 19 about hypoglycemia and hypoglycemia awareness. The
      eligibility of patients was confirmed by a blinded CG M recording using the trademark iPro ™
      2 sensor for 6 days. During this period the patient reported on a logbook the perception of
      their hypoglycemia, symptoms and how any hypoglycemia was corrected. Hypoglycemic
      manifestations were divided into adrenergic (shakiness, anxiety, palpitations, sweating,
      hunger, nausea, headache, coldness and pallor) and neuroglycopenic effects (impaired
      judgment, moodiness, paresthesia, emotional lability, confusion, ataxia, double vision,
      amnesia, seizures and lethargy). The confrontation of hypoglycemia detected by the blinded CG
      M and self-reported hypoglycemia validated the diagnosis of hypoglycemia unawareness.

      Patients used the Paradigm® Veo™ pump and glucose sensors (trademark : Enlite®) with an
      hypoglycemia alarm set at sensor glucose value of 70 mg/dL while the LG S option was set to
      suspend insulin delivery at a sensor glucose value of 50 mg/dL or less. These thresholds
      allowed an active correction of hypoglycemia by the patient between 50 and 70 mg/dL. Patients
      were educated to use the system and to treat and manage hypoglycemia. Pump data were uploaded
      using the trademark Medtronic CareLink™ Management Software for Diabetes during visits at 10
      days (D10), 2 months (M2) and 3 months (M3). Hypoglycemia awareness was assessed by an
      initial quiz that was repeated at M3 and 6 months (M6). A blinded CGM iPro ™ 2 was also
      realized at M3 to validate the modifications after sensor-augmented insulin-pump therapy.
