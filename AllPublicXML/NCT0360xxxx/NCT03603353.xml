  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cigarette smoking is the leading cause of preventable death in Switzerland and still more
      than a quarter of the Swiss population smokes cigarettes. Recently, electronic nicotine
      delivery systems (ENDS; also called vaporizer or electronic cigarette) have become popular
      with smokers who want to stop smoking or reduce their exposure to inhaled chemicals since
      ENDS use appears to be safer than tobacco smoking.

      The majority of attempts to quit tobacco smoking do not end in success due to unpleasant
      withdrawal symptoms. One of such symptoms is disturbed sleep. Sleep disturbances are a
      problem for smokers who are trying to quit. Sleep disturbances results from difficulty
      falling asleep or frequent arousals after sleep onset, and have negative daytime consequences
      such as sleepiness and dysphoric mood. Studies indicate that awakenings during night affect
      the cardiovascular system by providing repetitive bursts of sympathetic nervous system
      activation, likely contributing to elevated levels of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular
      morbidity. ENDS with nicotine containing e-liquids may be effective in assisting with tobacco
      smoking cessation by reducing withdrawal-induced sleep disturbances.

      This study will therefore test the efficacy of ENDS for cigarette smoking cessation, the
      safety of ENDS on adverse events and the effect of ENDS on health-related outcomes and
      exposure to inhaled chemicals.

      For this trial, cigarette smokers motivated to quit smoking cigarettes will be included.
      Participants in the intervention group will receive an ENDS and nicotine-containing
      e-liquids, which they will be allowed to use ad libitum. Additionally, they will receive
      smoking cessation counseling. Participants in the control group will receive smoking
      cessation counseling only. All participants will be followed over a 24-month period. Sleep
      quality will be assessed using the Pittsburgh sleep quality index- questionnaire at baseline
      and at 6, 12 and 24 months' follow-up.
