  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well alpelisib works in treating participants with human
      papillomavirus(HPV)-associated stage I-IVA head and neck cancer that can be removed by
      surgery. Alpelisib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed
      for cell growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the preliminary efficacy of neoadjuvant Alpelisib (BYL719) in patients with
      transorally-resectable, HPV+ head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), as measured by
      quantitative change in tumor size (change in T) following 14-21 days of treatment.

      II. To evaluate the relationship between genomic PIK3CA activation to change in T.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe the tolerability of brief neoadjuvant exposure to BYL719. II. To assess the
      effect of BYL719 on the tumoral Ki-67 proliferation index. III. To evaluate viral and
      molecular mediators of response and resistance to BYL719, including viral messenger
      ribonucleic acid (mRNA), E6 and E7 oncoproteins, and phosphorylated (p)HER3.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants receive Alpelisib orally (PO) once daily (QD) for 14-21 days in the absence of
      disease progression of unacceptable toxicity and then undergo surgery. Participants may
      receive Alpelisib for up to 28 days if surgery is delayed.

      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up for up to 12 weeks.

             with clinical study procedures, e.g. infection/inflammation, intestinal obstruction,
             unable to swallow oral study medication as a whole tablet or a drinkable suspension,
             social/psychological complications

          -  Pregnant or nursing (lactating) women, where pregnancy is defined as the state of a
             female after conception and until the termination of gestation, confirmed by a
             positive human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) laboratory test (&gt; 5 mIU/mL)

          -  Patient who does not apply highly effective contraception during the study and through
             the duration as defined below after the final dose of study treatment:

               -  Sexually active males should use a condom during intercourse while taking BYL719
                  and for 16 weeks after the final dose of BYL719, and should not father a child in
                  this period, but may be recommended to seek advice on conservation of sperm; a
                  condom is required to be used also by vasectomized men in order to prevent
                  delivery of the drug via seminal fluid; moreover, sexually active males should
                  not father a child for 6 months after completion of radiation; per standard
                  clinical practice

               -  Women of child-bearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of
                  becoming pregnant, must use highly effective contraception during the study and
                  through at least 12 weeks after the final dose of BYL719; moreover, per standard
                  clinical practice, women should not become pregnant for 12 months after
                  completion of radiation; highly effective contraception is defined as either:

                    -  Total abstinence: When this is in line with the preferred and usual
                       lifestyle of the subject; (periodic abstinence [e.g., calendar, ovulation,
                       symptothermal, postovulation methods] and withdrawal are not acceptable
                       methods of contraception)

                    -  Female sterilization: have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or
                       without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks before taking
                       study treatment; in case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive
                       status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment

                    -  Male partner sterilization (with the appropriate post-vasectomy
                       documentation of the absence of sperm in the ejaculate); (for female study
                       subjects, the vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner for that
                       patient)

                    -  Use a combination of the following:

                         -  Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS)

                         -  Barrier methods of contraception: Condom or occlusive cap (diaphragm or
                            cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/vaginal
                            suppository.

                         -  Note: Hormonal contraception methods (e.g. oral, injected, and
                            implanted) are not allowed as BYL719 may decrease the effectiveness of
                            hormonal contraceptives.

                    -  NOTE: Women are considered post-menopausal and not of child-bearing
                       potential if they have had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea
                       with an appropriate clinical profile (e.g. age appropriate, history of
                       vasomotor symptoms) or have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or
                       without hysterectomy) at least six weeks ago

          -  Severe and/or uncontrolled medical conditions such as infection requiring systemic
             antibiotics or anti-fungals; chronic hepatitis; severely impaired lung function

          -  Prisoners or subjects who are compulsorily detained (involuntarily incarcerated) for
             treatment of either a psychiatric or physical (e.g., infectious) illness
