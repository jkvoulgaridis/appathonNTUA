      This study is designed to compare the effectiveness of different doses of brain health
      supplement MMFS relative to placebo on cognition, mood, and sleep quality.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2 study in older adults with at least mild progressive behavioral symptoms,
      subjective sleep maintenance problems, and at least mild progressive cognitive deficit. The
      study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, three-way crossover design, in which
      participants will receive oral placebo, low dose MMFS, and high dose MMFS twice daily for 6
      weeks. Over three study periods (2 weeks each), subjects will receive two different dosages
      of MMFS (low dose: ~22.5 mg/kg LBM/day and high dose: ~35 mg/kg LBM/day) and placebo. After
      periods 1 and 2 there will be a one week washout period in which the subject will not take
      any study tablets. Randomized patients and their informants (required) will complete 5
      assessments total: at baseline in the clinic (visit 1; prior to taking any study tablets),
      and 4 times at home via online assessments (at the beginning of period 1 and at the end of
      periods 1, 2, and 3. The effectiveness of different MMFS dosages on cognition, mood, and
      sleep quality will be assessed using a Neuropsychological Test Battery, Profile of Mood
      States-Brief Form, daily sleep diaries, and Insomnia Severity Index. The safety profile of
      different MMFS dosages will be determined by monitoring the AE/SAE and subjective remarks
      during the study period. A range of safety and tolerability assessments will also be
      performed (including vital signs and laboratory tests).

    <measure>Neuropsychological Test Battery (NTB; computerized, at home, on-line) composite score</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks each dose</time_frame>
    <description>NTB consists of 5 cognitive tests, including: 1) N-Back Test for working memory; 2) Trail Making Test (TMT) assessing psychomotor processing speed and cognitive flexibility; 3) Backwards Digit Span Test for working memory; 4) Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST) measuring psychomotor processing speed; and 5) Block Tapping Test assessing visuo-spatial working memory. For each test, scores will be normalized using a z-score transformation. The mean of the 5 z-scores for each subject will be compared between low dose MMFS, high dose MMFs, and placebo groups. A score of 0 designates average performance. Each point above 0 designates 1 standard deviation above average and each point below 0 designates 1 standard deviation below average.</description>

    <time_frame>2 weeks each dose, mean of days 3-7 of week 2 in each of the 3 periods</time_frame>
    <description>POMS-BF is a self-rated questionnaire on different moods over the past day. It consists of 30 questions pertaining to 6 domains of mood. Each question is rated on a 5-point scale (0-4). Lower scores indicate a better mood state. Comparison of the mean score between low dose MMFS, high dose MMFs, and placebo groups.</description>
