      Hypercortisolism leads to long term physical and cognitive sequelae. This also holds true for
      quality of life, even several years after remission. This altered quality of life, highly
      subjective, is however, badly evaluated by the family of the patient. This could lead to
      misunderstanding, avec worsen the general physical and mental health of the patient. To our
      knowledge, this theoretical difference of perception has never been evaluated up to now.

      The aim of our study is to evaluate the difference of perception of the quality of life and
      body image between patients in remission of hypercortisolism, and their caregivers. Secondary
      objectives will be to evaluate the quality of life of the caregivers, the coping strategies,
      and the depression/anxiety parameters of both the patient and the caregiver. Patients and
      methods: the study is Observative, prospective and non-randomized. Inclusion criteria will be
      patients, aged more than 18, with hypercortisolism in remission for at least 1 year.
      Self-questionnaires on quality of life, body image, coping, depression and anxiety will be
      provided to the patient and his/her caregiver. Fulfilling will be blind between the patient
      and his/her caregiver. Inclusion period will be 12 months.

      Results will be compared between the patient and his/her caregiver. Expected results:
      investigators anticipate that some caregivers will have a different perception of the general
      physical and mental condition as stated by the patient. The first time that the quality of
      life of the caregiver would be also altered.

      This original project might lead to modify the management of Cushing's syndrome, by
      considering both the patient and his/her caregiver on a long term basis after remission.

      Introduction: Hypercortisolism leads to long term physical and cognitive sequelae. This also
      holds true for quality of life, even several years after remission. This altered quality of
      life, highly subjective, is however, badly evaluated by the family of the patient. This could
      lead to misunderstanding, avec worsen the general physical and mental health of the patient.
      To our knowledge, this theoretical difference of perception has never been evaluated up to
      now. Aims: The aim of our study is to evaluate the difference of perception of the quality of
      life and body image between patients in remission of hypercortisolism, and their caregivers.
      Secondary objectives will be to evaluate the quality of life of the caregivers, the coping
      strategies, and the depression/anxiety parameters of both the patient and the caregiver.
      Patients and methods: the study is Observative, prospective and non-randomized. Inclusion
      criteria will be patients, aged more than 18, with hypercortisolism in remission for at least
      1 year. Self-questionnaires on quality of life, body image, coping, depression and anxiety
      will be provided to the patient and his/her caregiver. Fulfilling will be blind between the
      patient and his/her caregiver. Inclusion period will be 12 months. Results will be compared
      between the patient and his/her caregiver. Expected results: investigators anticipate that
      some caregivers will have a different perception of the general physical and mental condition
      as stated by the patient. The first time that the quality of life of the caregiver could be
      also altered. Perspectives: This original project might lead to modify the management of
      Cushing's syndrome, by considering both the patient and his/her caregiver on a long term
      basis after remission.

    <description>the World health organisation Quality Of Life ( WHOQOL) is a specific scale of Cushing's syndrome studying: Physical health (Activities of daily living, Dependence on medicinal substances and medical aids, Energy and fatigue, Mobility, Pain and discomfort, Sleep and rest, Work Capacity) Psychological (Bodily image and appearance, Negative feelings, Positive feelings, Self-esteem, Spirituality / Religion / Personal beliefs, Thinking, learning, memory and concentration Social relationships (Personal relationships, Social support, Sexual activity) Environment (Financial resources, Freedom, physical safety and security, Health and social care, Home environment, Opportunities for acquiring new information and skills, Participation in and opportunities for recreation / leisure activities, Physical environment, Transport) intensity of items is rated from not at all (=0), a little (=1), moderately (=2), very much (=3) to extremely (=4).</description>

    <description>using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale The HAD scale is an instrument for detecting anxiety and depressive disorders. It has 14 listed items from 0 to 3. Seven questions relate to anxiety (total A) and seven others to the depressive dimension (total D), allowing thus obtaining two scores (maximum score of each score = 21)

    <description>using the Scale of Estime of Self of Rosenberg:
10 questions for which it must be indicated how true it is (rated from 1 to 4). Then, simply add your scores to questions 1, 2, 4, 6 and 7. For questions 3, 5, 8, 9 and 10, the quotation is reversed, that is to say, it is necessary to count 4 if you surround the number 1, 3 if you surround the 2, 2 if you surround the 3 and 1 if you surround the 4.
results: If score below 25, self-esteem is very low. Work in this area seems desirable. If score between 25 and 31, self-esteem is low. Work in this area would be beneficial. If score between 31 and 34, self-esteem is average. If score between 34 and 39, your self-esteem is strong. If score above 39, self-esteem is very high and you tend to be strongly affirmed.</description>
