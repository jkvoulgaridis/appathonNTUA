  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to investigate the effectiveness of a technique designed to
      improve divided attention and set-shifting impairments in persons with a traumatic brain
      injury (TBI). The study is designed to evaluate how well this technique can help people with
      TBI increase their attention and ability to function better in everyday life.

    <textblock>
      A pilot study will be conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of a technique designed to
      improve higher level attention (switching between tasks and multi-tasking) for persons with a
      traumatic brain injury. 14 individuals with TBI will be recruited. Baseline assessment
      includes neuropsychological evaluation using traditional measures as well as a completion of
      a number of questionnaires designed to measure everyday attention and everyday functioning.
      Participants are random assigned to either the experimental or control groups. Experimental
      and control treatments include two 60 minute sessions, twice per week, for 5 weeks. Follow-up
      assessment includes a neuropsychological evaluation using traditional measures as well as a
      completion of a number of questionnaires designed to measure everyday attention and everyday
      functioning. Protocol efficacy will be determined by improvements between baseline and
      follow-up on several objective and functional measures of divided attention and set-shifting.
