  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This a randomized, open-label, multi-site Phase III study to evaluate the efficacy and safety
      of SHR-1210 plus FOLFOX4 in subjects with advanced HCC who has never received prior systemic
      treatment. The primary study hyposis is that SHR-1210 combine with FOLFOX4 treatment improves
      Respose Rate and Overall Survival when compare with Standard Treatments.
