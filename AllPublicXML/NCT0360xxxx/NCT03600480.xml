  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to find out how NNC0174-0833 taken with semaglutide works in people
      who are overweight or obese. Both study medicines have been investigated on their own. The
      study also looks at how the study medicines behave in participant's body and how they are
      removed from the participant's body. Participants will get 1 of the following 2 treatments -
      which treatment any participant gets is decided by chance: Semaglutide (a new medicine) and
      NNC0174-0833 (a potential new medicine), or semaglutide and placebo (a &quot;dummy medicine
      similar to the study medicine but without active ingredients). Participants will get 2
      injections per week for 20 weeks. A study nurse at the clinic will inject the medicine with a
      needle in a skin fold in the participant's stomach area. The study will last for about 16
      months, but duration of participation for any participant will last up to about 7.5 months.
      Participants will have 28 clinic visits with the study staff and some will be overnight
      visits. Participants will be asked about their health, medical history and habits including
      mental health questionnaires.
