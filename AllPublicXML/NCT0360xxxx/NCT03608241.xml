        Inclusion Criteria

        Subjects must meet all of the following inclusion criteria to be eligible for enrollment in
        the study:

          1. Healthy female subjects of non childbearing potential

             Female subjects of non childbearing potential must meet at least 1 of the following
             criteria:

               1. Achieved postmenopausal status, defined as follows: cessation of regular menses
                  for at least 12 consecutive months with no alternative pathological or
                  physiological cause; and have a serum follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level
                  confirming the postmenopausal state;

               2. Have undergone a documented hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy;

               3. Have medically confirmed ovarian failure. All other female subjects (including
                  female subjects with tubal ligations) are considered to be of childbearing
                  potential and are not eligible for this study.

          2. Body mass index (BMI) of 17.5 to 35 kg/m2; and a total body weight &gt;50 kg (110 lb).

        Exclusion Criteria

        Subjects with any of the following characteristics/conditions will not be included in the
        study:

          1. Evidence or history of clinically significant hematological, renal, endocrine,
             pulmonary, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, hepatic, psychiatric, neurological, or
             allergic disease (including drug allergies, but excluding untreated, asymptomatic,
             seasonal allergies at the time of dosing).

          2. History of drug abuse with less than 6 months of abstinence prior to the baseline
             visit.

          3. History of regular alcohol consumption exceeding 7 drinks/week for female subjects (1
             drink = 5 ounces [150 mL] of wine or 12 ounces [360 mL] of beer or 1.5 ounces [45 mL]
             of hard liquor) within 6 months before screening.

          4. Any medical reason which would contraindicate the administration of oral
             contraceptives (as per the label) or history of discontinued use of oral
             contraceptives due to medical reasons.

          5. Subjects with a known immunodeficiency disorder or a first degree relative with a
             hereditary immunodeficiency.

          6. Subjects who have a malignancy or a history of malignancy, with the exception of
             adequately treated or excised non metastatic basal cell or squamous cell cancer of the
             skin or cervical carcinoma in situ.

          7. Any current evidence of untreated active or latent or inadequately treated infection
             with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB).

          8. History of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B, or hepatitis C; positive
             testing
