    <textblock>
      This study is a multi-cohort, open-label, multicenter Phase 2 study to evaluate the efficacy
      and safety of bb2121 in subjects with relapsed and refractory MM (Cohort 1), in subjects with
      MM having progressed within one 18 months of initial treatment including autologous stem cell
      transplantation (ASCT) (Cohort 2a), and without ASCT (Cohort 2b) or, in subjects with
      inadequate response post ASCT during initial treatment (Cohort 2c) Approximately 181 subjects
      will be enrolled into one of two cohorts. Cohort 1 will enroll approximately 73 RRMM subjects
      with ≥ 3 prior anti-myeloma treatment regimens. Cohort 2a will enroll approximately 39 MM
      subjects, with 1 prior anti-myeloma therapy including ASCT and with early relapse. Cohort 2b
      will enroll approximately 39 MM subjects with 1 prior anti-myeloma therapy not including ASCT
      and with early relapse. Cohort 2c will enroll approximately 30 MM subjects with inadequate
      response to ASCT during their initial anti-myeloma therapy. The cohorts will start in
      parallel and independently.
