  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to compare the effectiveness of two interventions for
      intimate partner violence (IPV). In most states, men who are convicted of domestic assault
      court-mandated to complete a Batterers Intervention Program (BIP) as part of their
      sentencing. The most commonly used BIP is based on The Duluth Model, which has been shown to
      decrease the recidivism of IPV offenders, but only marginally. The Duluth Model is a group
      intervention based on feminist theory and cognitive behavioral therapy. A new BIP called
      Achieving Change Through Values-Based Behavior (ACTV) has recently been developed by the PI
      as an alternative to Duluth. ACTV is currently being used statewide within the Department of
      Corrections (DOC) in Iowa. ACTV is a group intervention that utilizes acceptance and
      mindfulness techniques in addition to techniques from cognitive behavior therapy. The current
      study will use a randomized control trial to compare Duluth and ACTV, in order to assess the
      interventions' relative impact reducing IPV behaviors (physical aggression, psychological
      aggression, stalking, harassment, etc). Data on these outcomes will be collected via official
      criminal justice reports (i.e., criminal charges) as well as reports from victims. Other
      processes and outcomes of interest (attitudes toward women, emotion regulation, parenting
      behaviors, etc) will be collected from offenders.

    <description>Achieving Change Through Values-Based Behavior (ACTV) - pronounced &quot;ACTIVE&quot; - is a new Batterers Intervention Program (BIP) for domestic violence offenders. ACTV was developed as a collaboration between researchers, practitioners, and the criminal justice system in the state of Iowa (Zarling, Lawrence, Oregno, 2017). It is based on Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT; Hayes, Strosahl, &amp; Wilson, 1999), which is an evidence-based cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy. ACTV is an innovative BIP in two primary ways; first, ACTV applies the ACT model to the treatment of domestic violence, and second, ACTV is specifically designed for use in the correctional setting as part of criminal justice programming.</description>

    <description>The Duluth Model Men's Nonviolence Classes is the most widely used BIP. The Duluth Model is based on the premise that domestic abuse happens when men believe they have the right to authority over women who are their intimate partners. The Duluth Model's Men's Nonviolence Classes (The Duluth Model for short) help men stop battering and explore the consequences of the violence for themselves, their partner and their children.</description>
