  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cigarette smoking is a habit that has spread all over the world and is a significant risk
      factor for many diseases including cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary
      disease(COPD),asthma and lung cancer.

      Evaluation and understanding of tobacco health effects are of major interest worldwide and
      answer to important societal concerns.

      Identification of new biomarkers of exposure to tobacco smoke potentially implicated in COPD
      or lung carcinogenesis would allow a better observation of tobacco exposed population, thanks
      to screening establishment at reversible stages of pathological processes.

      In this study, we question whether cigarettes smoking alters miRNA profiles of extracellular
      vesicles (EVs) present in human broncho alveolar lavages (BALs), which could affect
      surrounding normal bronchial epithelial cells status.

      Extracellular vesicles (EVs) include a variety of nanoscale membranous vesicles (exosomes,
      microvesicles, microparticles). EVs are released into the interstitial fluid from a wide
      variety of normal or diseased cells.

      Analysis of EVs and their content maybe useful as disease biomarkers as they reflect the
      contents of cells of origin, differ between normal and diseased tissue and can be reliably
      detected.

      EVs may thus act as biomarkers of diverse pathologies like cancer, and detection of these
      biomarkers maybe applied to early diagnosis or assessment of prognosis in patients with
      cancer. EVs indeed contain both mRNAs and non-coding RNAs, such as small regulatory microRNAs
      (miRNAs).
