  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in preterm infants
      conducted at least 4 centers in France, consisting of 2 parallel groups. The experimental
      group will receive a neonatal supplement containing 2 specific HMOs. The control group will
      receive a placebo neonatal supplement that does not contain any HMOs, but matched to the
      experimental product in energy content.

      This study will include a total of approximately 160 male and female preterm infants born
      between 27 and 32 weeks' gestational age with birth weight ≤1700 g, who are younger than 7
      days of age.

      The primary objective of the study is to demonstrate the safety and tolerance of HMOs in
      preterm infants by monitoring weight gain rates in both of the two randomized groups.
