  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the side effects and how well radiation therapy and durvalumab
      with or without tremelimumab work in treating participants with bladder cancer that cannot be
      removed by surgery, has spread to nearby tissue or lymph nodes, or that has spread to other
      parts of the body. Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays to kill tumor cells and shrink
      tumors. Monoclonal antibodies, such as durvalumab and tremelimumab, may interfere with the
      ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. It is not yet known whether giving radiation
      therapy and durvalumab with or without tremelimumab will work better in treating participants
      with bladder cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety profile of radiation therapy (RT) and durvalumab with or without
      tremelimumab. (Safety lead-in cohort) II. To determine the median progression-free survival
      with RT and durvalumab with or without tremelimumab. (Expansion cohort)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the efficacy of RT and durvalumab with or without tremelimumab in terms of local
      control of irradiated bladder tumor.

      II. To assess the efficacy of RT and durvalumab with or without tremelimumab in terms of
      pathologic complete response (CR) rate of irradiated bladder tumor.

      III. To assess the efficacy of RT and durvalumab with or without tremelimumab in terms
      overall response rate.

      IV. To assess the efficacy of RT and durvalumab with or without tremelimumab in terms of
      abscopal response rate.

      V. To assess the efficacy of RT and durvalumab with or without tremelimumab in terms of
      duration of response.

      VI. To assess the efficacy of RT and durvalumab with or without tremelimumab in terms of
      disease specific survival.

      VII. To assess the efficacy of RT and durvalumab with or without tremelimumab in terms of
      overall survival.

      VIII. To further determine the safety and tolerability of RT + durvalumab with or without
      tremelimumab (expansion cohorts).

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To explore the immunologic changes associated with the combination of durvalumab and RT
      +/- tremelimumab.

      OUTLINE: Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 regimens.

      REGIMEN A: Participants receive durvalumab intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on day 1.
      Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 13 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Participants also undergo external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) for 5
      fractions beginning on day 8 of course 1.

      REGIMEN B:

      Participants receive tremelimumab IV over 60 minutes on day 1 for up to 2 courses and
      durvalumab IV over 60 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 13 courses
      in the absence of disease progression of unacceptable toxicity. Participants also receive
      undergo EBRT for 5 fractions beginning on day 8 of course 1.

      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up at 8 weeks and then every
      12 and 16 weeks.

             using Fridericia?s formula (QTcF) &gt;= 470 ms calculated from 3 ECGs).

          -  Current or prior use of immunosuppressive medication within 14 days before the first
             dose of durvalumab or tremelimumab, with the exceptions of intranasal and inhaled

          -  History of primary immunodeficiency.

          -  History of allogeneic organ transplant.

          -  History of hypersensitivity to durvalumab, tremelimumab, or any excipient.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, uncontrolled hypertension, unstable
             angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, active peptic ulcer disease or gastritis, active
             bleeding diatheses including any subject known to have evidence of acute or chronic
             hepatitis B, hepatitis C or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), or psychiatric
             illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements or
             compromise the ability of the subject to give written informed consent.

          -  Active infection including tuberculosis (clinical evaluation that includes clinical
             history, physical examination, and radiographic findings, and tuberculosis [TB]
             testing in line with local practice).

          -  History of leptomeningeal carcinomatosis.

             (asymptomatic, no evidence of new or emerging brain metastases) and off steroids for
             at least 14 days prior to the start of study treatment. Following radiotherapy and/or
             surgery, patients with suspected brain metastases at screening should have a magnetic
             resonance imaging (MRI)(preferred)/CT, preferably with IV contrast.

          -  Subjects with uncontrolled seizures.

          -  Female patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding or male or female patients of

             therapy or 90 days after the last dose of durvalumab monotherapy, whichever is the
             longer time period.
