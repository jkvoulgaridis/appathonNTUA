        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis undergoing elective transfemoral TAVR with
        a self-expanding transcatheter heart valve

          1. Considered at increased surgical risk by the Multidisciplinary Heart Team

          2. Informed written consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Non-cardiovascular co-morbidity reducing life expectancy to &lt;3 years

          2. Any factor precluding 1 year follow-up

          3. Inadequate CT image acquisition to perform area-based annular CT sizing, exclude
             adverse root features, and determine a coaxial valve deployment angle (CT is not
             required for valve-in-valve procedures)

          4. Predicted inability to perform uncomplicated percutaneous vascular access and closure

          5. Illiofemoral diameter &lt;6 mm (for 23 and 25 mm valves) and &lt;6.5 mm (for 27 and 29 mm
             valves) measured at or below the femoral head

          6. Surgical prosthesis &lt;23 mm (labelled size) for valve-in-valve procedure

          7. In-patient (unless clinically stable, mobilizing at baseline, and primarily in
             hospital for logistical reasons)

          8. Language barriers (inability to understand peri-procedural and discharge instructions)

          9. Insufficient social support post procedure to allow next day discharge

         10. Airway unfavourable for emergent intubation

         11. Inability to lay supine without conscious sedation or general anaesthetic
