      In this retrospective cohort study, we mapped the care cascades for both Hypertension and HIV
      within a HIV program in Uganda with the goal of identifying opportunities for developing
      contextually appropriate integrated care models, .

      Persons living with HIV (PLHIV) and receiving anti-retroviral therapy (ART) are at increased
      risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) due to direct effects of ART and HIV infection itself,
      compounded by traditional CVD risk factors such as increased life expectancy and Westernized
      diet. Additionally, in sub-Saharan Africa, as is the case globally, hypertension (HTN) is a
      major risk factor for CVD. The prevalence of HTN in the setting of HIV reported in the
      literature is variable but may be higher than in the HIV-negative population.

      World Health Organization (WHO) and Ugandan national HIV guidelines have recommended the
      integration of hypertension care into HIV programs since 2014 and 2016, but there has been
      limited uptake of this recommendation in practice. There have been successful efforts to
      integrate tuberculosis, malaria, nutrition, maternal-child health, and family planning into
      HIV programmes in Uganda. In this study, with the goal of identifying opportunities for
      developing contextually appropriate integrated care models, we mapped the care cascades for
      both HTN and HIV within a HIV program in Uganda.
