  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 1 year longitudinal study to establish a related index system for chronic
      obstructive pulmonary disease(COPD) quality control.Clinical and economic data of COPD
      patients will be collected and analyzed.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sixteen hospitals in Guangdong Province were randomly divided into control group and
      intervention group.Doctors and nurses of intervention group were trained treat chronic
      obstructive pulmonary disease according to the GOLD(Global InitiaTive of Chronic Obstructive
      Lung Disease) guidelinesï¼Œwhile those in the control group will not receive any training from
      research team. Hospital patient cohort and outpatient cohort will be setted. Subjects were
      interviewed and received pulmonary function tests.All patients will be followed and events of
      acute exacerbation will be recorded.Factors that influence patient prognosis and
      economic-health benefits will be analyzed.
