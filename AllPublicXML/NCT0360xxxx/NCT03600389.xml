    <textblock>
      Patient Priorities Care aligns healthcare decision-making and care by all clinicians with
      patients' own health priorities. Patient Priorities Care involves not only the health outcome
      goals that patients want to achieve, but also their preferences for healthcare. This approach
      is about aligning what outcomes patients want from their healthcare with what they are
      willing and able to do to achieve these outcomes. The approach begins with a member of the
      healthcare team helping patients identify their health outcome goals and their care
      preferences and preparing them to interact with their clinicians around these goals and
      preferences. The goals and preferences are transmitted to the patient's clinicians who use
      them in decision-making and communication with the patient and other clinicians.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Many older adults with Multiple Chronic Conditions receive conflicting recommendations and
      care that may be fragmented across clinicians. Older adults vary in what's most important
      when faced with tradeoffs and vary in the health-related activities they are willing and able
      to complete to achieve their desired outcomes. A potential solution to these problems is to
      move from decision-making predicated solely on disease-guidelines to decision-making based on
      achieving each patient's own specific health outcome goals (e.g., relief of symptoms
      sufficient to allow specific functional activity) within the context of what they are willing
      and able to do (i.e. care preferences) to achieve these outcomes.

      The primary aims of the Patient Priorities Care (PPC) pilot is to assess the feasibility of
      aligning primary and specialty care to focus on the health priorities (i.e. specific and
      actionable outcome goals and care preferences) of older adults with multiple chronic
      conditions (MCC)

    <measure>Treatment Burden Questionnaire (TBQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>6-12 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Measure to assess treatment burden among patients with one or more chronic conditions. Summary score is 0-150 with lower numbers indicating less burden. This is an exploratory study and the investigators will compare the intervention to control group to determine if the intervention group scores are lower on the TBQ (i.e. less burden).</description>

    <measure>Older Patient Assessment of Care for Chronic Conditions (O-PACIC)</measure>
    <time_frame>6-12 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Measure to assess chronically-ill patients' perceptions of the degree to which health care delivery is integrated and coordinated. Summary score is 1-5 with higher score indicated greater integration. This is an exploratory study and the investigators will compare the intervention to control group to determine if the intervention group scores higher on O-PACIC (i.e. greater integration).</description>

    <description>Measure of shared decision making in clinical encounters. Summary score is 0-100 with higher score indicated greater shared decision making. This is an exploratory study and the investigator will compare the intervention to control group to determine if the intervention group scores higher on CollaboRATE (i.e. greater shared decision-making).</description>
