  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      CAR-T therapy was proposed and has been recently used for cancer treatment. It has been
      hailed for its promising remission rates after early stage clinical trials for acute
      lymphoblastic leukemia. However, CAR-T therapy is seldom used for autoimmune diseases.
      Researchers only use it for the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).
      Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders (NMOSD), that include the neuromyelitis optica (NMO),
      are a group of inflammatory disorders of the central nervous system characterized by episodes
      of immune-mediated demyelination and axonal damage mainly involving optic nerves and spinal
      cord. NMO is characterized by the presence of an anti-Aquaporin-4 (AQP4) antibody, which can
      only be produced by differentiation of B cells to plasma cells. Because these anti-AQP4
      antibodies may be pathogenic, B cells recognizing AQP4 may be directly involved in the
      disease process as well. B cells also play a role as potent antigen presenting cells in NMO.
      NMO has the characteristics of high recurrence rate and poor prognosis. In the conventional
      treatment options, NMOSD could be treated with corticosteroids and immunosuppressive drugs
      immunosuppressant (e.g. azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, rituximab). But these drugs
      could barely completely cure NMOSD. And now, chimeric antigen receptor modified T cell
      infusion maybe an effective treatment to solve these problems. The rationale for using CAR-T
      therapy in NMOSD is based on the known roles of B cells, antibody production and plasma cells
      in the pathophysiology of NMOSD. The strongest evidence of the importance of B cells in NMO
      comes from studies of B cell depletion, most commonly with anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody,
      rituximab. Emerging evidence indicates that peripheral B cells are activated during a relapse
      and plasmablast production of anti-AQP4 antibodies spikes. The investigators infuse
      tanCART19/20 to completely deplete B cells. The purpose of this study is to assess the safety
      and efficacy of this tanCART19/20 in the treatment of NMOSD.

      This study is being conducted to assess anti-CD19/20 CAR T cells safety and efficacy in
      treating patients with AQP4-IgG seropositive NMOSD.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the safety of the tanCART-19/20 cells in treating NMOSD patients. II. Determine
      duration of in vivo survival of tanCART-19/20 cells.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the efficacy of the tanCART-19/20 cells in treating NMOSD patients.

      II. The secondary outcome measures: annual relapse rate (ARR), Expanded Disability Status
      Scale Score(EDDS), Best Corrected Visual Acuity (Log MAR), Spectral-Domain Optical Coherence
      Tomography (SD-OCT), Flash Visual Evoked Potential (FVEP) and Immunological assessments.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive anti-CD19/20-CAR (coupled with CD137 and CD3 zeta signalling
      domains) vector-transduced autologous T cells on days 0 in the absence of unacceptable
      toxicity. The infusion dose is 1E5-2E6 CAR positive T cells/kg, and dose escalation methods
      obey the traditional 3+3 design (three doses groups: 1-2E5, 3-6E5, 1-2E6 CAR-T cells).

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed intensively for 6 months, every 6
      months for 2 years, and annually thereafter for 3 years.
