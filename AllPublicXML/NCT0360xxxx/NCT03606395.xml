      Randomized, two-part, placebo-controlled study of single ascending doses of NV-5138 in
      healthy volunteers, and a single dose of NV-5138 in subjects with Treatment-Resistant
      Depression (TRD)
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, two-part, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of single ascending
      dosage levels of NV-5138 in healthy volunteers and a single dose of NV-5138 in subjects with
      TRD. The study includes an up to 28-day screening period, an in-house period during which
      NV-5138 or placebo will be administered, and a 3- to 7-day follow-up period after discharge.

      In Part A of the study (single-ascending-dose [SAD] portion in healthy volunteers), up to
      approximately 48 healthy volunteers will be randomly assigned to double-blind treatment.
      Eight (8) subjects will be randomized in each of six dosage-level cohorts (150, 300, 600,
      1000, 1600, or 2400 mg NV-5138, or placebo, administered as an oral solution). Within each
      cohort, six subjects will be randomized to receive NV-5138 and two subjects will be
      randomized to receive placebo. Each subject will receive only one dose of either NV-5138 or
      placebo on Day 1. Within each cohort, initially one subject will receive NV-5138 and one
      subject will receive placebo. Provided no clinically significant safety issues are noted in
      the 24 hours after dosing the initial two subjects in the cohort, the six subjects remaining
      in the cohort may be dosed.

      In Part B of the study (single-dose portion in subjects with TRD), up to approximately 40
      subjects will be randomly assigned to double-blind treatment in one cohort. The dosage level
      for this cohort will be determined based on the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic
      data from Part A of the study. However, in no case will the dose in Part B of the study
      exceed the highest dose administered in Part A of the study. Within this cohort, after
      potential eligibility has been confirmed by a site-independent review process, twenty (20)
      subjects will be randomized to receive NV-5138 and twenty (20) subjects will be randomized to
      receive placebo.

    <description>The MADRS is a clinician-rated scale designed to measure depression severity and detects changes due to antidepressant treatment. The scale consists of 10 items, each of which is scored from 0 (item not present) to 6 (severe or continuous presence of the symptoms), for a total possible score of 60. Higher scores represent a more severe condition. The MADRS evaluates apparent sadness, reported sadness, inner tension, sleep, appetite, concentration, lassitude, inability to feel (interest level), pessimistic thoughts and suicidal thoughts.</description>
