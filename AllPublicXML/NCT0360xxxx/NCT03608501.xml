  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to determine the overall response rate (ORR) during
      induction therapy with the combination of ixazomib, thalidomide and low-dose dexamethasone in
      specific time points.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drugs being tested in this study are a combination therapy of ixazomib, thalidomide and
      low-dose dexamethasone. This combination therapy is being tested to treat people who are
      newly diagnosed with multiple myeloma and non-eligible to autologous stem cell
      transplantation (ASCT). This study will assess the ORR during induction therapy in specific
      timepoints.

      The study will enroll approximately 40 participants. All participants will receive:

      Ixazomib citrate 4 mg + Thalidomide 100 mg and Dexamethasone 40 mg.

      All participants will be asked to take their study medication at approximately the same time
      each day.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in Brazil. The overall time to participate in this
      study is approximately 5 years. Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic, and
      will be contacted by telephone or will make a final visit 30 days after receiving their last
      dose of drug or resolution of serious adverse event (SAE), whichever occurs later for a
      follow-up assessment.

                  proliferative disorder, specifically:

                    -  Hypercalcaemia: serum calcium greater than (&gt;) 1 mg/dL higher than the upper
                       limit of normal (ULN) or &gt;11 mg/dL;

                    -  Renal insufficiency: creatinine clearance &lt;40 milliliter (mL) per minute (as
                       per validated equations) or serum creatinine &gt;2 mg/dL;

                    -  Anemia: haemoglobin value of &gt;20 gram per liter (g/L) below the lower limit
                       of normal, or a haemoglobin value &lt;100 g/L;

                    -  Bone lesions: one or more osteolytic lesions on skeletal radiography,
                       computed tomography (CT), or positron emission tomography (PET)-CT.

               -  Any one or more of the following biomarkers of malignancy:

                    -  Clonal bone marrow plasma cell percentage &gt;=60%.

                       or immunofluorescence. Bone marrow plasma cell percentage should preferably
                       be estimated from a core biopsy specimen; in case of a disparity between the
                       aspirate and core biopsy, the highest value should be used.

          2. Ineligibility to autologous transplantation, as per investigator's discretion,
             regardless of age (the reason for such ineligibility should be recorded on the

             published standard or institutional standard of care, as prophylactic anticoagulation.

          5. Note: For participants with prior history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), low molecular
             weight heparin (LMWH) is mandatory.

          6. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &gt;=50%.

             study drug:

               -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt;=1,500 per cubic millimeter (/mm^3), unless
                  related to bone marrow infiltration by malignant plasma cells.

               -  Hemoglobin &gt;=8.0 g/dL

               -  Platelet count &gt;=75,000/mm^3, unless related to bone marrow infiltration by
                  malignant plasma cells (platelet transfusions to help participants meet
                  eligibility criteria are not allowed).

               -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (AST) less than or
                  equal to (&lt;=) 1.5 times the institutional ULN.

                  meter (m^2) according to the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) study
                  abbreviated formula. If not on target, this evaluation may be repeated once after
                  at least 24 hours.

               -  Prothrombin time (PT) or activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) within
                  normal limits.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Presence of non-secretory or oligo-secretory myeloma, smoldering MM, monoclonal
             gammopathy of undetermined significance, plasma-cell leukemia, Waldenstrom's

             cancer (Ta [non-invasive tumor], Tis [carcinoma in situ] and T1 [tumor invades lamina
             propria]), or localized prostate cancer.

          7. With evidence or history of bleeding diathesis. Any hemorrhage or bleeding event
             &gt;=common terminology criteria for adverse events (CTCAE) Grade 3 within 4 weeks of
