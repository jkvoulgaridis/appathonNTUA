  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the efficacy and safety of direct acting anti-viral agents (DAA) therapy in
      chronically infected Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) patients using an individualized response guided
      therapy (RGT) model.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Treatment of HCV infection is directed at achieving sustained virological response (SVR),
      defined as the continued absence of detectable HCV RNA for 12 or more weeks after completion
      of therapy Given the limited resources available for the costly DAA treatment, implementation
      of a response-guided treatment (RGT) model to individualize length of DAA therapy in a
      prospective setting could result in substantial cost saving on HCV drug expenditure in
      addition to improving patients' compliance to treatment. Furthermore, if adopted at a larger
      scale, incorporation of such model into clinical practice may enable expansion of access to
      DAA therapy for patients who are currently not included in the various treatment programs,
      especially in resource-limited countries.

             of hepatocellular carcinoma within 6 months of enrollment.
