  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to provide pilot data on the clinical situations in which
      ordering a 18F-DCFPyL positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) was thought
      to be clinically useful, and to document how the results of the 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT affected
      patient management. The results of this study could then serve as a guide to help OHIP to
      consider these scenarios when deciding the precise indications for funded 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT
      scans in the future. In this study the investigators will image subjects with prostate cancer
      using 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT and record how the result of the study affected patient management.

    <description>To acquire pilot data on the use of 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT following conventional imaging (CT and bone scan) for the detection of metastases in men with prostate cancer when: 1. The CT scan shows indeterminate lymph node(s) in the pelvis that could potentially be treated radically with radiotherapy if found to be positive on 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT; 2. The subject is suspected to have oligometastatic disease (&lt; 4 sites of disease) that could potentially be treated with stereotactic/ radical doses of radiotherapy.</description>

    <description>A bolus of less than or equal to 9 mCi (333 MBq) of 18F-DCFPyL will be injected IV by slow IV push.
After administration of the 18F-DCFPyL the line will be flushed with saline (0.9% w/v).
Subjects should be encouraged to drink up to 500 mL of water shortly after the administration of 18F-DCFPyL.
At 60-minutes (± 10 minutes) after administration of 18F-DCFPyL, the PET/CT scan will be acquired with the subject in the supine position and the FOV including the mid-thighs to skull base.</description>

        This study will image male subjects with PCa using 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT for detection of
        disease with correlation to standard-of-care imaging (CT and bone scan) and clinical
        follow-up over a 1-year time period.
