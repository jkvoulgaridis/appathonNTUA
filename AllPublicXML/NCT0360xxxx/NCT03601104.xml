      Introduction: studies on resistance training of low intensity associated with blood flow
      restriction in recent years, although there are still gaps that can be explored in relation
      to their physiological phenomena when associated with eccentric training. In this way, from
      there the exploration becomes relevant the investigation of eccentric training associated to
      an RFS. Objective: To analyze and compare the effects of a high intensity and low intensity
      intensive resistance training associated with an RFS (TREAI-RFS and TREBI-RFS) with a high
      intensity eccentric resistance training without RFS (TREAI) in knee extensors. Method: The
      study will consist of 45 male participants, allocated from a stratified randomization into
      three groups: TREAI (n = 15), TREAI-RFS (n = 15) and TREBI-RFS (n = 15). Participants
      underwent a training program with a minimum of 40% without RFS, 80% with RFS and 40% with CVS
      of CVIM, 3 times a week, and the outcomes of muscle strength, muscle structure, power test
      and Endothelial growth will be assessed one week before, the fourth week and one week after
      the end of the training program. In addition, clinical markers of perception and recovery
      effort are investigated before and after a session. The graph used is descriptive and
      descriptive, as it is used as a model of analysis of variance for the analysis of
      replications without a two-factor scheme, which provides detailed information on how the
      measures are repeated, neither. A whole statistical analysis can reach the level of
      significance of 5%.
