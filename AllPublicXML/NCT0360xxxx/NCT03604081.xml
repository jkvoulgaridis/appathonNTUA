  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective randomized control trial of patients with unilateral impairment of the
      lower extremity after stroke. Patients will be randomized to intervention group and control
      group. Intervention group will receive one hour of intense massed practice of lower extremity
      either in the form of shaping or task practice. Control group will receive conventional
      physical therapy for 1 hour as per current standard of care that follows stroke clinical
      practice guideline.
