  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a neuropsychiatric disease characterised by intrusive,
      recurrent and persistent thoughts, urges or images (obsessions) and the resulting excessive
      repetitive behaviours or mental acts according to rigid rules unrealistically aimed at
      reducing distress (compulsions).

      Its lifetime prevalence in the general population is usually estimated between 1 - 3%
      (Ruscio, Mol Psychiatry, 2010). Despite appropriate pharmacological and cognitive-behavioural
      treatments, it is commonly estimated that 10% of patients are therapy-refractory and that
      among improved or recovered patients, sustained efficacy is uncertain.

      For treatment refractory OCD patients, a neurosurgical treatment by deep brain stimulation
      (DBS), has emerged in the late 1990s as a new therapeutic option (Nuttin et al, Lancet,
      1999).

      The objective of the current study is to report the long-term treatment effects (safety and
      effectiveness) of DBS from the cohort of six severe and therapy-refractory OCD patients
      implanted at the French university hospital of Montpellier since 2003.

      The data needed to carry out the study will be extracted from the medical files of the 6
      patients concerned.

      The following data will be collected:

        -  Age, sex

        -  Medical, surgical and psychiatric history

        -  History of pharmacological treatments

        -  Elements from clinical examination

        -  any reported adverse effect

        -  scores of the various questionnaires completed throughout the follow-up (including
           Y-BOCS and GAF)

        -  results of biological, morphological, neuropsychological tests

        -  Stimulation parameters applied since implantation.
