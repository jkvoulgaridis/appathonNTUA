  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects must meet the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Fifth
             Edition (DSM-5) criteria for ADHD (including predominantly inattentive presentation,
             hyperactive presentation, or combined presentation) as confirmed by the Adult ADHD
             Clinical Diagnostic Scale (ACDS) Version 1.2. To confirm that ADHD is the primary
             diagnosis, the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) will be used to
             identify and exclude other psychiatric conditions which would preclude enrollment.

          -  Subjects who were not receiving any pharmacological treatment for ADHD must have an
             Adult ADHD Investigator Symptom Rating Scale (AISRS) score of ≥ 28 at screening and
             baseline. Subjects who were receiving pharmacological treatment for ADHD at screening
             must have a minimum AISRS score of ≥ 22 at screening, and a score of ≥ 28 at baseline.

          -  All subjects must be willing to discontinue all prohibited psychotropic medications
             starting from the time of signing the informed consent through the 7-day follow-up
             period. Subjects that do not rollover into Trial 405-201-00015 must be willing to
             discontinue all prohibited psychotropic medications starting from the time of signing
             the informed consent until after the follow-up telephone call 10 days after the last
             dose of IMP.

          -  Subjects must have a Clinical Global Impression-Severity of Illness Scale (CGI-S)
             score of ≥ 4 (≥ moderate impairment) at baseline.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with a DSM-5 diagnosis of Other Specified or Unspecified Attention
             Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder.

          -  Subject has a current comorbid psychiatric disorder that either could be expected to
             require treatment with medications prohibited in this trial, or to confound efficacy
             or safety assessments. Examples include, but are not limited to, psychotic disorder,
             bipolar disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, panic
             disorder, a current major depressive episode, or posttraumatic stress disorder, as
             established by the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI).

          -  In the opinion of the investigator, subject has not derived significant therapeutic
             benefit from 2 or more ADHD therapies of 2 different classes (eg, amphetamine and
             methylphenidate) given with an acceptable dose and duration during adulthood (aged 18
             or older). NOTE: If subject has not derived significant therapeutic benefit due to an
             inability to tolerate side effects, eligibility can be discussed on case-by-case basis
             with the medical monitor.

          -  Subjects who have a positive alcohol test (via breathalyzer or blood), a positive drug
             screen assessed prior to the baseline visit for cocaine, other illicit drugs
             (including marijuana), or prescription or OTC ADHD medications will be early
             terminated. This includes medications such as opioids or benzodiazepines taken without
             prescription.

          -  In the opinion of the investigator, the subject is unable to adhere to the treatment
             regimen or other requirements outlined in the protocol.
