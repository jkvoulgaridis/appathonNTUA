  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the trial is to investigate the safety and tolerability of BI 690517
      in healthy Japanese male subjects following oral administration of multiple rising doses over
      14 days.

      Secondary objective is the exploration of the pharmacokinetic(s) (PK) and pharmacodynamic(s)
      (PD) of BI 690517 in healthy Japanese male subjects after multiple dosing.
