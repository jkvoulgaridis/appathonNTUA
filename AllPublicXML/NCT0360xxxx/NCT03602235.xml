  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I single-arm open-label clinical study primarily assessing the safety and
      secondarily, the relative efficacy of low dose melphalan + high dose ascorbate acid (HDAA) in
      relapsed refractory patients with multiple myeloma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1 study for patients with relapsed refractory multiple myeloma. Patients will
      receive a 15-gram test dose, and a maximum of 3 cycles, each composed of 4 doses of high-dose
      ascorbic acid (HDAA) and 2 doses of melphalan. This study will enroll 9 patients with
      relapsed refractory multiple myeloma. The starting dose of ascorbic acid will be 50 grams.
      Using a 3+3 dose escalation, the dose will potentially increase to 75 grams then 100 grams.

HDAA on day 1 and day 4 in combination with melphalan 12.5 mg/m2, followed by 2 additional doses of HDAA on day 2 and day 5.
A 3 + 3 cohort method will be used for this study. After successfully completing the test dose, subjects will receive 50gms, 75gms and 100gms of ascorbate per infusion in 3 different cohorts. Dose modifications are not made for weight or body surface area.</description>

             proteasome inhibitors, immuno-modulatory agents such as lenalidomide and monoclonal
             antibodies such as daratumumab, and have progressed within past 6 months. Participants
             with previous failed autologous transplant and progressed within 6 months after
             autologous transplant. Note: induction with or without hematopoietic stem cell
             transplant and with or without maintenance therapy is considered a single regimen.

          3. Patients have failed treatment with, are intolerant to or are not candidates for
             available therapies that are known to confer clinical benefit to patients with
             relapsed and refractory MM.

          4. Subjects must have measurable disease (as determined by the central lab), including at
             least one of the criteria below:

                  and an abnormal kappa/lambda (κ/λ) ratio in patients without detectable serum or
                  urine m-protein or

               -  For patients with immunoglobulin class A (IgA) myeloma whose disease can only be
                  reliably measured by quantitative immunoglobulin measurement, a serum IgA level
                  &gt;/= 500 mg/dL.

             Non-secretory participants are eligible provided the participant has &gt; 20% bone marrow
             plasmacytosis OR multiple (&gt;/= 3) plasmacytomas or lesions on MRI at the time of
             diagnosis or study enrollment, OR the presence of lesions (&gt;/= 3) on PET/CT scan.

                  PFTs due to disease-related pain or other circumstances that make it difficult to
                  reliably perform PFTs, documentation of pulmonary function adequate for
                  transplant will occur via a CT scan without evidence of major pulmonary disease,

          4. Participants must not have life-threatening comorbidities.

          5. History or evidence of myeloma associated with immunodeficiency states (e.g.:

          6. Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease (requires negative test for
             clinically suspected HIV infection).

          7. Evidence of CNS myeloma.

          8. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, recent (within 6 months) myocardial infarction, uncontrolled or symptomatic
             congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, uncontrolled
             hypertension on appropriate therapy or psychiatric illness/social situations that
             would limit compliance with study requirements.

          9. Concurrent use of Coumadin (warfarin)

         10. Patients with G6PD deficiency

             stones

         12. Diabetic patients who rely on a glucometer to dose insulin as ascorbate can interfere
             with glucometer readings
