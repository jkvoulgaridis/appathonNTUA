  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Radiotherapy plays an important role in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and concurrent
      chemoradiation is considered to be the standard treatment for locally advanced NSCLC.
      However, due to the patient's physical condition, comorbidities and other reasons, only about
      1/3 of patients can receive concurrent chemoradiation. Radiotherapy alone or sequential
      chemoradiation has become the treatment protocol for most patients. Hypofractionated
      radiotherapy can be used in NSCLC because it can shorten the over treatment time and may
      potentially reduce the effect of accelerated repopulation and obtain higher biological
      effective dose（BED）. So far, the vast majority of radiotherapy prescriptions have given a
      uniform dose of 60 Gy. This unified prescription dosage approach is completely inconsistent
      with the concept of precision treatment. The Netherlands MAASTRO put forward the concept of
      in silico radiotherapy prescription, that is: the normal tissue limits are uniform, such as:
      V20% ≤ 30%, spinal cord V0&gt; 45Gy, etc., and each patient receives a different dose of
      radiation therapy. This radiation prescription could reach the limits of the normal tissue of
      every patient; if no one tissue limits were reached, the highest dose was set up to 79.2 Gy
      (1.8 Gy, BID). MAASTRO applied this &quot;iso-toxic&quot; radiotherapy prescription and used
      accelerated hyperfractionation technology so that each patient received the maximum
      individualized radiation dose as possible. We will integrate this concept with
      hypofractionated radiotherapy in order to further improve efficacy.

      Radiotherapy plays an important role in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and concurrent
      chemoradiation is considered to be the standard treatment for locally advanced NSCLC.
      However, due to the patient's physical condition, comorbidities and other reasons, only about

      chemoradiation has become the treatment protocol for most patients. Hypofractionated
      radiotherapy can be used in NSCLC because it can shorten the total treatment time and may
      potentially reduce the effect of accelerated repopulation and obtain higher BED. So far, the
      vast majority of radiotherapy prescriptions have given a uniform dose of radiotherapy to all
      patients, regardless of individual factors such as tumor size, location, and adjacent vital
      organs, which may cause two consequences: First, small-volume tumors may, not receive enough
      radiation dose, resulting in a decrease in local control rate. Second, for large volumes of
      tumors or tumors adjacent to vital organs, even the &quot;so-called&quot; standard dose (60 Gy) may
      cause serious damage to normal tissues. This unified prescription dosage approach is
      completely inconsistent with the concept of precision treatment. The Netherlands MAASTRO put
      forward the concept of in silico radiotherapy prescription, that is: the normal tissue limits
      are uniform, such as: V20% ≤ 30%, spinal cord V0&gt; 45Gy, etc., and each patient receives a

      and used accelerated hyperfractionation technology so that each patient received the maximum
      individualized radiation dose as possible.From the model study to the long-term survival
      results, a series of encouraging results were achieved. The use of an individualized
      radiotherapy prescription based on iso-toxicity for the treatment of NSCLC in large-segment
      radiotherapy is expected to achieve: 1. For patients with small tumor volumes and no adjacent
      to vital organs, a higher radiation dose is given under safe conditions. 2. For patients with
      larger volumes of tumors or adjacent to vital organs, give safer doses.
