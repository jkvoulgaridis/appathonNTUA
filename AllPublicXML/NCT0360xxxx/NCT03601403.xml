    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a public health problem with great morbidity.
      The main therapeutic strategy is inhalers. The objective of this study is to determine the
      efficacy of a tablet-assisted training in the use of inhalers in patients with COPD including
      ventilatory re-education and video recordings of the patients themselves.

    <textblock>
      The importance of this pathology lies not only in its high prevalence, which is expected to
      increase due to the aging of society but also in its high mortality. In Europe, it is
      estimated that 50% of adult patients do not use the inhaler correctly. The clinical
      development of COPD includes periods of stability interspersed with symptomatic
      exacerbations, which usually involve hospitalization. During these hospitalizations,
      respiratory symptoms are worsening.Nevertheless, in Europe, it is estimated that 50% of adult
      patients do not use the inhaler correctly. Thus, it is very important the pharmacological
      education in this patients.

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Knowledge of the Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease</measure>
    <time_frame>[Time Frame: Baseline, 12 months]</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluated at baseline by Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Questionnaire (COPD-Q). COPD knowledge was evaluated using the Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Knowledge Questionnaire (COPD-Q; Maples, Franks, Ray, Stevens, &amp; Wallace, 2010). The COPD-Q is a valid, readable, and reliable 13-item (each one score 0 to 3) self-administered true/false questionnaire assessing COPD knowledge in patients with low health literacy skills. A higher punctuation indicates better results.</description>

    <measure>Cognitive Level</measure>
    <time_frame>[Time Frame: Baseline]</time_frame>
    <description>Cognitive level was assessed using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Functional independence</measure>
    <time_frame>[Time Frame: Baseline]</time_frame>
    <description>Functional independence was assessed using the Functional Independence Mease Scale (FIM). This scale has 18 items that are grouped into 2 dimensions, 13 motor items, and 5 cognitive items. The total score range between 18 points (total dependence) to 126 points (Independence completes).</description>

    <measure>Anxiety-depression level</measure>
    <time_frame>[Time Frame: Baseline, 12 months]</time_frame>
    <description>Changes from baseline to postintervention in anxiety and depression measured with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Patients are going to complete this questionnaire composed of statements relevant to either generalized anxiety or depression. It is composed of 14 items, 7 for anxiety and 7 for depression and higher values are related to higher depression and anxiety.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Adhesion to inhalers</measure>
    <time_frame>[Time Frame: Baseline]</time_frame>
    <description>Level of adhesion to inhalers was assessed with TAI (Inhaler Adhesion Test).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Dyspnea level</measure>
    <time_frame>[Time Frame: Baseline]</time_frame>
    <description>Perceived perception of dyspnea was collected through the Modified Borg Scale. Patients have to choose a number between 0 ( no dyspnea) to 10 (higher dyspnea).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Physical fitness</measure>
    <time_frame>[Time Frame: baseline, 12 months]</time_frame>
    <description>Physical fitness was assessed by performing the five-times-sit-to-stand test. It consists of getting up and sitting five times in a row without a support. The time period in which the exercise is performed is the patient's score with a maximum of 60 seconds</description>

    <measure>Technique of the inhaler</measure>
    <time_frame>[Time Frame: baseline, 12 months]</time_frame>
    <description>The evaluation of the technique of the inhalers was carried out by means of a checklist composed of 5 items. Checked those points that were done correctly obtaining 5 points if the technique that was done correctly.</description>

    <description>The first day of the intervention consisted primarily of ventilatory re-education. During the realization of the technique, he was videotaped with a Tablet so that later the patient could be seen and on the video to be able to give him the guidelines for the correction. On the second and third day of the intervention, ventilation re-education was performed and the inhalation technique was subsequently trained.</description>
