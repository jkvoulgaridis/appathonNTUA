  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This US study aims to assess hemophilia A patient characteristics and reasons for switching
      from both patient/caregiver and physician perspectives. For this purpose, this research study
      will include hemophilia A patients who have switched from an existing therapy to Kovaltry or
      Jivi. In doing so, real world evidence will be obtained from both patient and physician
      perspectives offering key insights for effective therapeutic management of patients with
      hemophilia A and to more fully understand what drives patient switching from a patient
      perspective and a physician perspective.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This observational study consists of a patient and a physician survey. This survey will
      consist of questions developed by Bayer and submitted to the Steering Committee of the
      existing registry, ATHN-2. Once enrolled to participate in the ATHN-2 registry and provided
      consent to participate in the Bayer nested study, patients who have switched from another
      product to Kovaltry or Jivi within the past 50 weeks or at the time of enrollment will be
      prompted to answer the additional survey questions.

      Conclusion of the ATHN-2 registry is scheduled for 2021. Once data is cleaned and locked by
      the registry, the data will be delivered to Bayer for conduct of our analyses.
