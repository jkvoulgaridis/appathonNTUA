  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Assessment of the clinical safety and performance of the Orsiro drug-eluting stent in a real
      world setting in patients with small vessels with reference vessel diameter ≤2.75 mm.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prospective, single-arm, multi-center, all-comers registry with clinical follow-up visits at
      the hospital or by phone at 6 and 12 months post-procedure.

      A minimum of 1000 patients will be enrolled in approximately 15 sites in Brazil, including at
      least 415 patients with reference vessel diameter ≤2.75 mm as assessed by online QCA.
