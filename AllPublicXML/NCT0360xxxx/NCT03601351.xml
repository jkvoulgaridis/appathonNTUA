  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a global burden and one of the most frequent types of cancer.
      Colorectal cancer therapy is complex and surgery remains the cornerstone for its treatment,
      combined with chemotherapy and radiotherapy. At diagnosis time, stage II / III is the
      predominant . There is a growing interest on the potential effect of perioperative anesthetic
      management on cancer growth and spread. Preclinical studies suggest that opioids could
      promote direct tumor growth, angiogenesis, metastasis and immunosuppression of cellular and
      humoral responses, mainly mediated by Mu opioid receptor 1 (MOR-1) activation. Association
      between increased expression of MOR-1and or perioperative opioids use and shorter DFS or OS
      has been demonstrated in lung, prostate, gastric and esophagus cancers. Furthermore a pooled
      analysis suggested that methylnaltrexone, a peripherally acting Mu-opioid receptor antagonist
      (PAMORA) was associated with increased survival in patients with advanced cancer.

      Thus, the expression of the MOR-1 is an indicator of poor prognosis in some cancer types, but
      its relevance in colon cancer is unknown. The hypothesis of this study is that the increased
      MOR-1expression in tumor samples from colorectal cancer could be associated to poor disease
      free survival.

      These findings would be of great clinical relevance in order to avoid perioperative opioid
      use in oncological patients. Moreover PAMORAs could be a valuable tool in perioperative
      antitumor treatment, since currently these drugs are currently used with confirmed
      tolerability and low adverse effects in the management of opioid-induced constipation (Opioid
      Induced Constipation-OIC). Besides MOR 1 expression could constitute a biomarker that guide
      the investigators to perform neoadjuvant therapy.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      To evaluate the association between Mu opioid receptor 1 (MOR-1) expression in patients with
      colorectal cancer stage II / III submitted to scheduled curative surgery and disease-free
      survival (DFS) five years follow up after surgery.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      To evaluate the association between the MOR-1 expression in patients with colorectal cancer
      stage II / III undergoing scheduled curative surgery and overall survival (OS) five years
      follow up after surgery.

      To evaluate the association between MOR-1 expression in patients with colorectal cancer stage
      II / III submitted to scheduled curative surgery and perioperative complications until
      postoperative day 28th after surgery.

      To evaluate the association between perioperative opioids dose (morphine equivalents) and
      disease-free survival/overall survival until five years after surgery.

      To evaluate MOR-1 expression differences in paraffin samples from patients with colorectal
      cancer stage II / III submitted scheduled colorectal surgery between the tumor tissue and the
      adjacent nontumorous tissue.
