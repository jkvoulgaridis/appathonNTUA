  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Severe combined immunodeficiency disorder (SCID) is a heterogeneous group of inherited
      disorders characterized by a profound reduction or absence of T lymphocyte function,
      resulting in lack of both cellular and humoral immunity. SCID arises from a variety of
      molecular defects which affect lymphocyte development and function. The most common form of
      SCID is an X-linked form (SCID-X1), which accounts for 30-50% of all cases. SCID-X1 is caused
      by defects in the common cytokine receptor gamma chain, which was originally identified as a
      component of the high affinity interleukin-2 receptor (IL2RG).

      Allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), which replaces the patient's bone
      marrow with that of a healthy donor, is the only treatment that definitively restores the
      normal function of the bone marrow. HSCT is the first choice of treatment for patients with
      signs of bone marrow failure and a fully-matched related donor. However, patients without a
      fully-matched related donor have much worse overall outcomes from HSCT.

      This study will investigate whether patients with SCID-X1 without a fully matched related
      donor may benefit from gene therapy. To do this the investigators propose to perform a phase
      I/II clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy (effect) of gene therapy for SCID-X1
      patients using a lentivirus delivery system containing the IL2RG gene. Up to 5 eligible
      SCID-X1 patients will undergo mobilisation and harvest of their haematopoietic stem precursor
      cells (HPSCs). In the laboratory the disabled lentivirus will be used to insert a normal
      human IL2RG gene into the patient's harvested HPSCs. Patients will receive chemotherapy
      conditioning prior to cell infusion, in order to enhance grafting. The genetically corrected
      stem cells will then be re-infused into the patient. Patients will be followed up for 2
      years. This trial will determine whether gene therapy for SCID-X1 using a lentiviral vector
      is safe, feasible and effective

    <description>Single arm, non-randomised cohort of up to 5 patients with X-linked Severe Combined Immunodeficiency. CD34+ cells will be collected via bone marrow harvest or leukapheresis.

A minimum of 2.5 x 106/kg CD34+ cells after transduction with a minimum transduction efficiency of 0.7 copies/cell is required for infusion into the patient. The patient will receive non-myeloablative conditioning with intravenous busulfan the two or three days prior to cell infusion. The frozen cells will be thawed on the day of infusion and the cells administered according to hospital procedures. The patient will remain in hospital until sufficient cover of the patient's immune system</description>

    <description>Gene therapy for X-linked Severe Combined Immunodeficiency will be performed by introduction a normal copy of the IL2RG gene into the blood forming stem cells (CD34+ cells) of the patient's bone marrow by using a type of gene delivery system (in this trial called a lentiviral vector).

             (proliferation to PHA &lt;10% of the lower limit of normal for the laboratory) AND
             confirmed by a mutation in IL2RG

          2. Lack of an HLA identical (A, B, C, DR, DQ) related donor

          3. Age &lt;5 years

          4. Signed informed consent

          5. Documentation of willingness to follow up for 15 years post-infusion

             infectious agent is repeatedly isolated despite a minimum of 2 weeks of appropriate
             therapy and is associated with significant organ dysfunction (including but not
             limited to abnormalities listed below).

               1. Mechanical ventilation including continuous positive airway pressure

               2. Abnormal liver function defined by AST and ALT &gt;10 times the upper range of
                  normal OR Bilirubin &gt;2 mg/dL

             disease

          6. Patients with evidence of infection with HIV-1

          7. Previous allogeneic transplant with cytoreductive chemotherapy

          8. Major (life-threatening) congenital anomalies. Examples of &quot;major (life-threatening)
             congenital anomalies&quot; include, but are not limited to: unrepaired cyanotic heart
             disease, hypoplastic lungs, anencephaly or other major central nervous system
             malformations, other severe non-repairable malformations of the gastrointestinal or
             genitourinary tracts that significantly impair organ function.

          9. Other conditions which in the opinion of the P.I. or Co-investigators, contra-indicate
             collection and/or infusion of transduced cells or indicate patient's inability to
             follow the protocol. These may include for example clinical ineligibility to receive
             anaesthesia, severe deterioration of clinical condition of the patient after
             collection of bone marrow but before infusion of transduced cells, or documented
             refusal or inability of the family to return for scheduled visits. There may be other
             unforeseen rare circumstances that would result in exclusion of the patient, such as
             sudden loss of legal guardianship.
