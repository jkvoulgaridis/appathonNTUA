    <textblock>
      Patients with medically inoperable primary soft tissue lesion of the lung will have
      transbronchial microwave ablation performed via transbronchial approach by an interventional
      pulmonologist or thoracic surgeon using CT imaging. Prior to the ablation procedure, the
      treating physician will use endobronchial ultrasound to confirm staging. Patients will be
      followed for one year following the ablation procedure for efficacy and safety.

    <textblock>
      Patients with medically inoperable primary soft tissue lesion of the lung (lesions less than
      or equal to 2cm and located in the outer two-thirds of the lung and not closer than 1cm to
      the pleura) will have transbronchial microwave ablation performed using CT imaging. All
      ablations will be performed under general anesthesia via transbronchial approach by an
      interventional pulmonologist or thoracic surgeon.

      Prior to the ablation procedure, the treating physician will use endobronchial ultrasound to
      confirm staging.

      Patients will be followed for one year following the ablation procedure for efficacy and
      safety with specific follow-up visits at 30 days, 6 months, and 12 months post-ablation. A
      user experience questionnaire is completed by the treating physician to better understand the
      ease of the procedure.

    <time_frame>Within 23 hours of ablation procedure</time_frame>
    <description>Device user experience will be collected from the treating physician who will complete the User Experience Survey on the same day as the ablation procedure. The questionnaire includes, but is not limited to procedure workflow and the user's assessment on ease/difficulty of using the device. The User Experience Survey will augment the Product Development Specialist's understanding of the usability of the Flexible system and determine which enhancements, if any, are needed in the future. This is not a validated questionnaire that asks 30 questions which have a yes/no answer or response from 1-5 where 1 is lowest and 5 is highest. A summary of responses to scored questions and yes/no questions will be generated across all completed questionnaires to summarize the overall user experience of the device.</description>
