  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with previously untreated advanced or metastatic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma
      are recruited to this prospective non-randomized study comprising two separate cohorts.
      Patients will receive SHR-1210, a novel anti-PD-1 antibody, with apatinib and either
      irinotecan or paclitaxel liposome plus nedaplatin. The primary endpoint is to determine the
      objective response rate (ORR) of patients in both cohorts. The regimen(s) of promising
      efficacy will be further verified in subsequent randomized studies to define the optimal
      combination of immunotherapy, anti-angiogenesis and chemotherapy in advanced esophageal
      cancer patients.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Histologically or cytologically confirmed squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus,
             locally advanced, unresectable, recurrent or metastatic disease.

          2. Have not received prior systemic therapy.

          3. Measurable disease based on Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1.

          4. Eastern Collaborative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status ≤ 1.

          5. Life expectancy &gt;12 weeks.

          3. Prior therapy with any of the immune check-point inhibitors.

          4. Known immediate or delayed hypersensitivity reaction to SHR-1210, apatinib,
