  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to determine whether greater rectal cancer downstaging and
      regression occurs when surgery is delayed to 12 weeks after completion of
      radiotherapy/chemotherapy compared to 8 weeks.

      Hypothesis: Greater down-staging and tumor regression is observed when surgery is delayed to
      12 weeks after completion of chemoradiotherapy compared to 8 weeks.

    <time_frame>8-12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of mesorectum resection assessed by TME completeness scale:
Mesorectal resection (MRR)/good/complete: intact mesorectum and smooth mesorectal surface with only minor irregularities; no defects deeper than 5 mm; no coning of the specimen towards the distal margin; and smooth macro-circular resection margin (CRM) on slicing.
Intramesorectal resection (IMR)/intermediate/nearly complete: intermediate bulk of the mesorectum with an irregular surface; a defect deeper than 5 mm, and no visible muscularis propria other than inserted levator; intermediate coning; intermediate irregularity of macro-CRM on slicing.
Muscularis propria resection (MPR)/poor/incomplete: small bulk of the mesorectum with a very irregular surface; defect down to the muscularis propria; severe coning; severe irregularity of macro-CRM on slicing.</description>

    <measure>Quality of Life assessed by Low anterior resection syndrome score</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The Low anterior resection syndrome score (LARS) score consists of five items concerning the following: incontinence for flatus, incontinence for liquid stool, frequency of bowel movements, clustering of stools, and urgency. Each symptom of bowel dysfunction is weighed according to its impact on the quality of life. The calculated score ranges from 0 to 42, with a score of 0-20 representing no ARS, a score of 21-29 representing minor ARS, and a score of 30-42 representing major ARS.</description>
