    <textblock>
      Lateral epicondylitis, also called tennis elbow, is the most common disease in elbow-pain
      symptoms. The symptoms can have a major impact on the patient's activity of daily life,
      including turning a doorknob, lifting a full coffee cup to mouth, or wringing out a dish rag.

      This is a randomized study, the investigators will evaluate the immediate, short-term, and
      long-term effect of Fu's subcutaneous needling on the patients suffering with lateral
      epicondylitis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lateral epicondylitis, also called tennis elbow, is the most common disease in elbow-pain
      symptoms. The major mechanism is overuse of the flexors, extensors and supination muscles in
      the wrist, causing micro-trauma in the muscles attachment to the lateral epicondyle of the
      elbow. The long-term accumulated and poor repaired trauma causes myofascial trigger points in
      the related muscles. Patients often describe pain at the lateral aspect of the elbow. Pain
      can be further elicited with passive wrist flexion and by resisting active wrist extension.
      Symptoms also include weakness in the grip strength and limitation of elbow motion.
      Therefore, it can have a major impact on the patient's activity of daily life, including
      turning a doorknob, lifting a full coffee cup to mouth, or wringing out a dish rag.

      Fu's subcutaneous needling (FSN), as one of the dry needle treatments, performed by swaying a
      disposable Fu's subcutaneous needle parallel to the underlying muscles after penetrating the
      skin to the subcutaneous fascia. With the reperfusion activities, myofascial pain and soft
      tissue pain caused by myofascial trigger points can be decreased effective simultaneously. So
      far, there is no solid research or clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of the treatment
      yet.

      The investigators will conduct the randomized experiment to evaluate the immediate,
      short-term, and long-term effect of FSN. The outcome measures include visual analog scale,
      patient-rated tennis elbow evaluation questionnaire, pressure pain threshold, pain-free grip
      test, muscle tone changes and ultrasonographic evaluaton of the common extensor tendon.

    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>The visual analogue scale or visual analog scale (VAS) is a psychometric response scale which can be used in questionnaires. It is a measurement instrument for subjective characteristics or attitudes that cannot be directly measured. When responding to a VAS item, respondents specify their level of agreement to a statement by indicating a position along a continuous line between two end-points.</description>

    <measure>Pressure Pain Threshold</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>Pressure pain threshold (PPT) is defined as the minimum force applied which induces pain. This measure has proven to be commonly useful in evaluating tenderness symptom.</description>

    <measure>Myotone of MTrPs</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>Muscle tone is the muscle's resistance to passive stretch during resting state. Myotone will help the investigators to get muscle parameters such as tone, elasticity and stiffness.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain-free grip test</measure>
    <time_frame>1day</time_frame>
    <description>The pain-free grip (PFG) test is used to measure the amount of force that the patient generates to the onset of pain; when there is no pain the test result could be regarded as maximum grip strength. It is commonly performed in patients with lateral epicondylalgia (LE). LE is characterised by the presence of pain over the lateral humeral epicondyle which is provoked by at least two of: gripping, resisted wrist or middle finger extension, or palpation (Stratford et al 1993) in conjunction with reduced PFG over the affected side (Stratford et al 1993; Vicenzino et al 1996; Vicenzino et al 1998).</description>

    <description>Fu's Subcutaneous Needle (FSN), is an innovation for the treatment of myofascial pain and trigger points. The needle is a non-injection needle, and the fact that both needles are manipulated and act on soft connective tissue.
FSN abstains from the muscle and deep fascia layers and is confined to only the subcutaneous layer where collagen fibers are most abundant. As the subcutaneous layer is poorly innervated, pain is less than other needling therapies.
FSN is also currently being used successfully to treat non-musculoskeletal conditions.</description>

    <intervention_name>Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation</intervention_name>
    <description>Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS or TNS) is the use of electric current produced by a device to stimulate the nerves for therapeutic purposes.
TENS, by definition, covers the complete range of transcutaneously applied currents used for nerve excitation although the term is often used with a more restrictive intent, namely to describe the kind of pulses produced by portable stimulators used to treat pain. The unit is usually connected to the skin using two or more electrodes. A typical batteryoperated TENS unit is able to modulate pulse width, frequency and intensity. Generally TENS is applied at high frequency (&gt;50 Hz) with an intensity below motor contraction (sensory intensity) or low frequency (&lt;10 Hz) with an intensity that produces motor contraction.</description>
