      Title: Guided Occupational Therapist (OT) Cognitive Interventions for Critically Ill Patients

      Short Title: GOTCI

      Methodology: Randomized Control Trial

      Study Duration: 12-15 months

      Study Centre: Single Center - South Health Campus, ICU, Calgary, Alberta, Canada

      Objectives: The aim for this study is to evaluate the effect of specific OT guided cognitive
      interventions on delirium in adult critically ill patients.

      Number of Subjects: 112

      Primary Outcome: Delirium Prevalence and Duration

      Secondary Outcomes: Cognitive function, physical function, quality of life, ICU length of
      stay, hospital length of stay and days of mechanical ventilation.

      Inclusion Criteria: Adult Critically Ill Patients admitted to South Health Campus ICU,
      Calgary, Alberta

      Type of Intervention: OT guided cognitive intervention based on RASS score

      Dose: One on one therapeutic sessions with an OT. Five days a week, Monday to Friday, between
      0800-1600. There will be twice daily sessions for 20 minutes each.

      Duration of administration: Cognitive Therapy to be initiated Monday to Friday, for the
      duration of participant ICU admission.

      Reference therapy: Standard of care within the Department of Critical Care Medicine in
      Calgary is delirium prevention strategies using the ABCDEF bundled approach.

      Statistical Methodology: Descriptive statistics (mean, median, proportion) will be employed
      to describe the study population. The primary outcome of delirium prevalence will be explored
      using multivariable logistic regression, which will provide an estimate of the odds ratio and
      accompanying 95% confidence intervals. Both per protocol and intent to treat analyses will be
      performed.

    <time_frame>From date of patient enrolment to ICU discharge, an average of 6.7 days.</time_frame>
    <description>Ever Delirium: Measured using the Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist (ICDSC). If the patient has a positive score in the ICDSC at any point during the patient's ICU stay then the patient is considered to have delirium and qualifies for Ever Delirium.
Delirium Duration: Number of days the patient has a positive score on the ICDSC. This does not have to be consecutive days.</description>

    <description>Johns Hopkins Adapted Cognitive Exam (ACE)
o The Adapted Cognitive Exam is the first valid and reliable examination for the assessment and quantification of cognition in critically ill patients. It provides a useful, objective tool that can be used by any member of the interdisciplinary critical care team to support clinical assessment and research efforts.</description>

    <measure>ICU length of stay</measure>
    <time_frame>ICU admission date to ICU discharge date is the time the patient will be given the treatment which is an average of 6.7 days.</time_frame>

    <measure>Physical Function</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured within 48 hours of ICU admission and again after the treatment period is completed which is an average of 6.7 days.</time_frame>
    <description>The Functional Status Score for the ICU (FSS-ICU). The Functional Status Score for the ICU (FSS-ICU) is an assessment of physical function specifically designed for ICU patients. It is scored based on 5 mobility domains (rolling in bed, lying to sitting, sitting balance, sitting to standing and walking) and the level of assistance the patient requires to complete the task. Each item is out of 7, with total scores ranging from 0-35 and a high score correlating to high function. The FSS-ICU has good validity when compared to other functional measures in the ICU, it has been demonstrated to have good interrater reliability and has minimal floor and ceiling effect.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of Life using the EQ5D-5L (EuroQual 5 Dimensions-5 Levels). This is a health quality of life measure assessing five domains; mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression.</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured after the treatment period is completed (within 24 hours of discharge) which is an average of 6.7 days.</time_frame>
    <description>The 5 Level EQ 5D version is a standardized measure of health status developed by the EuroQol Group in order to provide a simple, generic measure of health for clinical and economic appraisal (Van Reenan &amp; Janssen, 2015). It covers five dimensions; mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression which are measured with one of five response options (no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, and extreme problems). A total of 3125 possible health states is defined in this way. Each state is referred to in terms of a 5 digit code. For example, state 11111 indicates no problems on any of the 5 dimensions, while state 12345 indicates no problems with mobility, slight problems with washing or dressing, moderate problems with doing usual activities, severe pain or discomfort and extreme anxiety or depression (Reenan &amp; Janssen, 2015, p. 9). The EQ5D-5L also includes a visual analog scale to measure health state (0-100).</description>

    <description>RASS is defined as the level of sedation and agitation of a patient. Cognitive interventions are evidence based strategies that enhance the cognition of patients and include memory training using visual imagery; metacognitive training using self-awareness and self-regulation approaches for recovery of executive functioning; and neuropsychological rehabilitation to help improve cognitive and functional deficits. Interventions will be adjusted according to the RASS score. Cognitive interventions include discussion of patient status and education of family around reorientation, cognitive screening and graded exercises according to patient ability. The deepest levels of sedation and highest levels of agitation will be included in the intervention arm.
Interventions will be provided by the Occupational Therapist; Monday to Friday, BID, 20 minutes per session, for the duration of ICU admission.</description>
