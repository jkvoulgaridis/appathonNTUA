  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study in patients with relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma who have undergone at
      least 3 lines of therapy. Patients will receive abexinostat 80 mg (4 × 20 mg tablets) twice a
      day (BID) in a &quot;one week on, one week off&quot; schedule.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be evaluated for objective response, Duration of Response (DOR), Progression
      Free Survival (PFS), Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR), Overall survival (OS), safety and
      tolerability, pharmacokinetic (PK), pharmacodynamic (PD), and changes in health related
      quality of life. Patients may receive treatment until disease progression, death,
      unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal of consent. An independent data safety monitoring
      committee (iDMC) will evaluate the data pertaining to the futility and decide whether the
      study should stop or continue to the second stage. If the study continues to the second
      stage, a total of 139 patients will be studied.
