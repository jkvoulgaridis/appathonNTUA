  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The concept of natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) (1) has evolved to
      endoscopic full thickness resection (EFTR). It represents innovation in technique that allows
      endoscopists to advance further into the endoscopic surgical space. EFTR has transformed the
      ability to tackle subepithelial tumors (SETs) and early mucosal neoplasm that are not
      amenable to classic ESD technique, enhance the staging accuracies for marginal lesions, and
      even increase the diagnostic capabilities for infiltrative disorders. Thus far, multiple
      methods have been described to perform EFTR, including nonexposed and exposed techniques,
      with the closure occuring before resection or after resection, respectively (2). Early
      comparative studies show no difference between the two methods (3). However, the procedures
      themselves are limited by the current tools available and by described techniques to achieve
      resection.

      Investigators are described here a novel non-exposed technique, with closure before
      resection, using the Endomina device.
