             located on the upper extremities

          -  Selected AK study lesions have clearly defined margins and are mild to severe (grades
             I to III):

          -  Mild grade (I): Slight palpability, better felt than seen

          -  Moderate grade (II): Moderately thick AK, easily felt

          -  Severe grade (III): Very thick and/or obvious AK

          -  Skin sun sensitivity type I to IV according to Fitzpatrick

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  PDT Non-responder

          -  Pre-treatment of the AK lesions eligible for study procedures with pharmaceuticals
             approved for the treatment of AK during the 4 weeks preceding PDT (e.g. antineoplastic
             topical formulations as e.g. Metvix®, Ameluz®, Luxerm®, Solaraze®, Aldara®, Picato®,
             Actikerall®, 5-FU or vitamin A acid containing formulations)

          -  Pre-treatment of the AK lesions eligible for study procedures during the 2 weeks
             preceding PDT with keratolytic agents e.g. TCA, urea or salicylic acid containing
             formulations

          -  Pre-treatment with hypericin during the 2 weeks preceding PDT

          -  Treatment with systemic retinoids during the 3 months preceding PDT

          -  Treatment with cytostatics or radiation during the 3 months preceding PDT

          -  Female patients of childbearing potential (A female is considered of childbearing
             potential unless she has had tubal ligation, hysterectomy or has been postmenopausal,
             i.e. with spontaneous amenorrhea for at least 12 months.)

          -  Patients with clinically relevant suppression of the immune system

          -  Diagnosis of Porphyria

          -  Known photodermatoses of varying pathology and frequency, e.g. metabolic disorders
             such as aminoaciduria, idiopathic or immunological disorders such as polymorphic light
             reaction, genetic disorders such as xeroderma pigmentosum, and diseases precipitated
             or aggravated by exposure to sun light such as lupus erythematosus or pemphigus
             erythematosus

          -  Concomitant use of medicinal products with known phototoxic or photoallergic potential
             such as hypericin, griseofulvin, thiazide diuretics, sulfonylureas, phenothiazines,
             sulphonamides, quinolones and tetracyclines

          -  Skin diseases that might interfere with response evaluation of study PDT

          -  Skin sun sensitivity type V or VI according to Fitzpatrick

          -  Known intolerance to one or more of the ingredients of the study medication

          -  Dementia or psychic condition that might interfere with the ability to understand the
             study and thus give a written informed consent

          -  Simultaneous participation in another clinical study or participation in another
             clinical study in the 30 days directly preceding inclusion

          -  Suspected lack of compliance
