  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Information regarding the likely progress of post-stroke symptoms is vitally important to
      stroke survivors to allow them to plan for the future and to adjust to life after stroke.
      Moreover, the prevalence of morbidity secondary to stroke is of central importance to Health
      Professionals to understand the prognosis of the disease in the patients under their care.
      Additionally, it will also allow commissioners of care, planners and third sector
      organisations to adapt to and answer the needs of a post-stroke population.

      Currently, the data collected by national audit programmes are concentrated on what can be
      termed 'process or process of care' data. The utility of these data are in the ability to
      audit the care received by stroke survivors on stroke units against evidenced standards for
      care, thus ensuring evidence based practice. Nevertheless, process of care is only one form
      of measuring stroke unit care and the audit programmes collect some limited functional status
      data, data relating to risk-factor co-morbidities and treatment received data. Therefore, the
      scope of this study is to build on the minimum data set currently collected and to collect
      post-stroke data in domains not currently collected.

      The International Consortium for Health Outcomes Measurement (ICHOM) takes important steps to
      collect data outside of process of care data such as a Patient Reported outcome data in their
      minimum outcome data set for stroke [currently under review].. Nevertheless, the ICHOM
      doesn't currently advocate the specific collection of data relating to cognitive impairment
      or emotional problems secondary to stroke. It is in these important aspects that this study
      will augment the data set currently advocated by ICHOM to collect data in the areas of
      cognitive impairment and emotional problems secondary to stroke.

      Therefore, the aim of this study is to quantify the prevalence of morbidity at six months
      post-stroke.
