      The purpose of this investigational study is to study the effects of Stimgenics Spinal Cord
      Stimulation (SGX-SCS) in subjects with chronic, intractable pain of the trunk with lower limb
      pain, including unilateral or bilateral pain associated with the following conditions: failed
      back surgery syndrome, intractable low back pain and leg pain.

      This is an open-label prospective, randomized, controlled, multi-center study comparing
      Stimgenics Spinal Cord Stimulation (SGX-SCS) programming approach to Standard SCS programming
      approach.

      Subjects meeting study entrance criteria will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of two
      study treatment groups:

        -  Test treatment group with SGX-SCS programming approach

        -  Control treatment group with Standard SCS programming approach

      Data at follow-up visits will be compared between the two treatment groups, and in reference
      to baseline assessments collected at the beginning of the study.
