    <textblock>
      Sintilimab is expected to increase the PFS from 6 months to 9.2 months. Anti-PD-1 therapy in
      Chinese non-squamous NSCLC naïve patients will be investigated in this clinical trial.

      Additionally the correlation between PD-L1 expression and the response to Sintilimab
      treatment in Chinese non-squamous NSCLC as well as the role of iRECIST in immune checkpoint
      inhibitor treatment evaluation will also be assessed.

    <description>The Lung Cancer Symptom Scale (LCSS) consists of nine graphical subscales that measure the quality of life of patients over the past 24 hours. The scale is divided into two parts: the patient fills in and the physician fills in. The patient part consists of 9 items, and the answers for each item are marked on one line segment. The physician part mainly evaluates the number and severity of symptoms of the patient, and uses the grade method to answer. The LCSS's nine subscales include the six major symptoms of lung cancer patients: loss of appetite, fatigue, cough, difficulty breathing, hemoptysis and pain. The remaining three subscales include the patient's self-leveling of lung cancer symptoms and how the disease affects daily activities.</description>
