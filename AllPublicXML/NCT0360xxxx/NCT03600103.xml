  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection has disproportionately persisted as a public
      health threat to adolescents and young adults (AYA) from minority communities in the United
      States. HIV has evolved into a chronic disease, which can be managed in the outpatient
      setting with antiretroviral therapy (ART) designed to achieve virologic suppression and life
      expectancy equivalent for uninfected individuals. Community health nurse (CHN) interventions
      have been shown to increase access to appropriate resources, enhance health care utilization,
      and promote risk-reducing behavior among AYA. Use of short messaging service (SMS) messaging
      can further enhance clinical care by improving attendance at medical visits, medication
      adherence, and communication with the health care team.Investigators have used these two
      modalities in randomized trials of youth with complex sexually transmitted infections (STIs)
      in low-income minority communities with high feasibility and acceptability amongst AYA and
      families, remarkable improvements in visit completion, medication adherence, and reduction in
      recurrent STIs. The overarching goal of this project is to build on the evidence from this
      trial and to re-purpose the intervention for Young people Living with HIV (YLHIV) in the same
      community who are having challenges with care and medication non-adherence.Investigators aim
      to compare the effectiveness of a technology-enhanced community health nursing intervention
      (TECH2CHECK) to a standard of care control group using a randomized trial design. The central
      hypothesis is that the intervention will result in higher rates of adherence to ART and
      virologic suppression. Investigators have demonstrated investigators' interdisciplinary
      team's capacity to follow urban AYA in the community, utilizing the combination of CHNs and
      outreach workers to optimize care according to national standards. TECH2CHECK aims to enroll
      120 YLHIV followed at clinics specializing in HIV care in the Baltimore-Washington
      Metropolitan area who are challenged with treatment adherence and randomizing participants to
      receive TECH2CHECK vs. standard of care. Results of this trial will inform best practices for
      engaging YLHIV by addressing the distal component of the continuum, critical to achieving the
      elusive 90-90-90 HIV goals.

    <measure>Viral suppression</measure>

    <description>Viral suppression will be assessed by measuring plasma HIV-1 RNA (copies/mL). Viral suppression is defined as a viral load &lt;20 copies/mL.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Management Cost difference</measure>
    <time_frame>18 months</time_frame>
    <description>To compare the cost of TECH2CHECK as compared to Standard of Care (SOC) for management of HIV in the outpatient setting. The costs of administering the different components of TECH2CHECK intervention and the standard of care will be based on a combination of direct observations, project records, and clinic invoices. The amount of staff and patient time (e.g. hours worked for CHN, patient transportation/visit time), consumable supplies (including miles traveled, antiretroviral costs, SMS costs, etc.), and equipment utilized (e.g., cell phones) for the intervention and SOC will be collected. Costs related to other health service utilization will be derived from ACASI, care utilization data.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Adherence to care as assessed by patient visits</measure>
    <time_frame>18 months</time_frame>
    <description>We will examine attendance to clinical visits (proportion of appointments attended/appointments scheduled). This will be based on a binary (Yes/No) response to a questionnaire given out to patients.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Adherence to care as assessed by HRSA retention measure</measure>
    <time_frame>18 months</time_frame>
    <description>We will also assess whether patients meet the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) retention measure (2 provider visits in a 12-month period, with one appointment in each 6 month period, separated by at least 3 months)</description>

    <description>The intervention uses behaviors to improve HIV adherence and self-care. Investigators will use the Center for Disease Control (CDC) Partnership for Health (PfH) Medication Adherence.The CHN will administer PfH at all home/venue-based encounters, using communication styles that are more receptive to adolescents and young adults. Resources will be provided. At the end of the session, the participant will be able to state/demonstrate: goals of HIV care and adherence, meaning of CD4 and Viral Load (VL) measurements and the significance of their own measurements,signs of complications or problems for which participants need to seek additional care,understanding of optimal self-care.Further, CHNs will also provide tips to stay on schedule with taking their ART and problem-solve adherence barriers.</description>
