  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective, non-randomized pilot study looking to evaluate the effectiveness
      of Closed Loop Stimulation (CLS) in sinus node dysfunction patients with HIS bundle
      placement. Patients with sinus node dysfunction who have previously received a Biotronik
      pacemaker with His bundle lead placement as part of routine care will be recruited for the
      study. A hand-grip exercise will be performed at the conclusion of bicycle exercise testing
      in order to assess the performance of CLS during isometric exercise. After the study exercise
      testing is completed, data will be collected from the pacemaker.

    <description>Exercise testing will be scheduled on the same day as the enrollment visit and within 30 days after post-implant visit.
The standard protocol will be typically set at an initial workload of 15Watts and go up by increments of 10 Watts every 3 minutes, as follows:
Stage 1 - 15 W Stage 2 - 25 W Stage 3 - 35 W Stage 4 - 45 W</description>
