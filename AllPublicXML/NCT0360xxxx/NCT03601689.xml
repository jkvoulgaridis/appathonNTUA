  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many data suggest that patients with low rectal adenocarcinoma who achieved ypT0N0 status
      have improved survival and disease-free survival (DFS) compared to all other stages however
      only few data are available regarding the specific prognosis factors of this subgroup. This
      retrospective multicentric study aimed to predict the prognosis of patients with complete
      pathological response after neoadjuvant treatment.
