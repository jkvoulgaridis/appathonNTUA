    <textblock>
      The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of three methods for removal of
      dental biofilm when compared to dental toothbrushing control. Twenty patients were diagnosed
      and randomized into four groups according to the method tested: 1) apple 2) Rolly Brush 3)
      chewing gum and 4) brushing control. Subjects were evaluated four times according to the
      method used. All were evaluated before performing any method and after using each of the four
      methods separately. The patient's evaluation interval was 24 hours between the use of the
      methods. In the first stage, they underwent a clinical examination in which the needs of
      supragingival scraping or definitive restorations and prophylaxis were detected. After this
      step, all methods of oral hygiene and the consumption of fibrous foods and chewing gum were
      suspended for twenty-four hours. In the second stage, with a minimum of twenty-four hours
      after the first, volunteers received approximately 10 ml of basic fucsin to perform a
      mouthwash. The dental examination was then carried out for measurement on each dental surface
      and the plaque index was recorded on each surface. In the latter, four evaluations were
      performed with at least a 24-hour interval until the patients used the four methods
