  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In order to investigate the difference of intra-articular hyaluronate's distribution and
      compare the clinical outcomes of viscosupplementation for mild-to-moderate knee
      osteoarthritis (mKOA) between the anteromedial (AM) and medial midpatellar (MMP) approach
      groups. This study included two parts, cadaver study (n=64) and random controlled trial
      (n=100). Hyaluronic acid (HA) traced by methylene blue was injected into the knee, and the
      intra-articular distribution of HA was assessed using a five-point scale in the cadaver
      study. The clinical outcomes of 5-weekly injections of HA were evaluated by WOMAC and
      Lequesne index and the follow-up times were at weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 14, and 24 after the
      injections in the random controlled trial.

    <intervention_model_description>64 osteoarthritic knees of cadavers were randomly assigned to two groups: the anteromedial (AM) group (n=32) and the medial midpatellar (MMP) group (n=32).
100 patients with unilateral mKOA were enrolled and randomly divided into two groups according to the injection portal of HA: the AM group (n=50) and the MMP group (n=50).</intervention_model_description>
