  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In sedation applications performed by an endoscopist or anesthetist during colonoscopy, it
      was investigated whether there were differences in pain levels evaluated by VAS (Visuel
      analog scale), patient satisfaction, duration of procedure and side effects

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gastrointestinal endoscopes are an invasive and unpleasant procedure that is increasingly
      being performed worldwide (1). Colonoscopy; is one of the endoscopic procedures that can be
      used to diagnose and treat large intestine and cause pain and excessive discomfort in the
      patient (2). For this reason, intravenous (iv) sedative agents are used in endoscopy centers
      where endoscopy will be performed. However, side effects such as hypoxia and hypotension,
      which are usually dose-dependent, caused by these sedative agents, play an important role
      among risk factors associated with colonoscopy (3). For this reason, the use of propofol as
      an anesthetic is prohibited in some countries, which is a commonly used agent for sedation.
      However, the presence of an anesthetist during each endoscopy procedure is difficult because
      there are not enough anesthetists. This application is also more costly. For this reason,
      studies have been carried out during the gastrointestinal endoscopy when sedation is
      delivered by someone other than the anesthetist (4). For this purpose, several studies
      comparing patient-controlled sedation or sedation applied by an endoscopist to sedation
      performed by anesthesiologist were performed (4, 5). Investigators aimed to investigate
      whether there is any difference between the two groups in terms of pain levels assessed by
      VAS (Visuel analog scale) and patient satisfaction by comparing sedation protocols applied by
      endoscopist or anesthesist during colonoscopy in this study.
