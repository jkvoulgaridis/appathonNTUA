  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, Phase 3 study to evaluate the efficacy of
      the administration of phenobarbital Sodium Injection, United States Pharmacopeia, (USP), in
      participants who have suffered from a clinical seizure. As neonatal seizures can have
      long-term adverse effects, including death, placebo-controlled studies are not appropriate
      for this population. This study is designed to show phenobarbital is effective at preventing
      subsequent seizures by demonstrating greater efficacy at the higher (40 mg/kg) dose compared
      to the lower dose (20 mg/kg). It is important to note that, although phenobarbital is not
      approved for the treatment of neonatal seizures, it is commonly used for this indication and
      is considered the first-line therapy in the US and by the World Health Organization. The
      minimum recommended dose of phenobarbital used to treat neonatal seizures is 20 mg/kg.
      Therefore, the lower dose of phenobarbital used in this study is considered an &quot;effective&quot;
      dose for the treatment of neonatal seizures. The design of this study allows for assessment
      of the minimum recommended dose with the maximum recommended dose to show the increased
      efficacy of the high dose in various measures of reduction in seizures.

      of the minimum recommended dose with the maximum recommended dose to show the increased
      efficacy of the high dose in various measures of reduction in seizures.

      Study participants undergoing electrographic or electroclinical seizures lasting 10 seconds
      or longer will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion between the 2 treatment arms. Participants will
      receive either a 20-mg/kg or 40-mg/kg loading dose of Phenobarbital Sodium Injection, USP
      upon confirmation that the seizure was not due to metabolic imbalances. Randomization of
      participants with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, (HIE), will be stratified between the
      dosing groups. Participants will further be stratified by treatment group for
      pharmacokinetics, (PK), analysis timepoints due to the limitations on the number of
      pharmacokinetics, (PK), samples that can be taken from each patient. After cessation of
      seizures the participants will remain in the hospital for 24 hours for continuous monitoring
      by electroencephalogram, (EEG).

      According to recommended dosing of phenobarbital, participants in the 20-mg/kg treatment arm
      in whom seizure activity does not resolve after the first dose (20 mg/kg) will be given
      phenobarbital in 10-mg/kg increments (each hour) until the seizure activity resolves, up to a
      maximum total dose of 40 mg/kg. If the seizure activity is still not resolved, participants
      will be given a second-line anticonvulsant. The second-line therapy given will be determined
      by the attending physician and recorded in the study documentation. Participants in the
      40-mg/kg treatment arm in whom seizure activity does not resolve after the initial loading
      dose of phenobarbital will be given a second-line anticonvulsant. The second therapy given
      will be determined by the attending physician and recorded in the study documentation.

    <masking_description>All efforts will be made to blind the investigator and other key personnel of which dosage the participant was randomized to. Study drug will be dispensed by the pharmacy via a syringe to the investigator or their designee. The study medication label should only contain the protocol number, subject number and any other pertinent information. If after 1 hour following the completion of the study drug infusion, the seizure is not controlled with the initial loading dose, the patient will be considered a treatment failure in the primary efficacy analysis of this protocol/study. At this point, the blinding for the treating provider/investigator will be lifted.</masking_description>

    <description>Once a neonate has been identified as having a seizure by electroencephalogram he/she will be randomized to one of two doses of phenobarbital sodium injection, (20 mg/kg or 40 mg/kg). The number of neonates in each group will be observed for the end of any further seizures, also verified by electroencephalogram. In addition to observing when all seizure activity ended after the initial loading dose, the number of infants requiring a second dose of phenobarbital or second-line anti-convulsant therapy to treat unresolved or subsequent seizures will be observed in each randomization group, (phenobarbital sodium injection 20mg/kg or 40mg/kg) following the initial loading dose.</description>
