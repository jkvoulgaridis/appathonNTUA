    <textblock>
      No studies have investigated the effects of a Sciatic nerve mobilization in subjects with
      neck pain. This study aims to determine the immediate effects of a lower limbs neural
      mobilization on cervical range of motion and on the perception of pain in the most common
      trigger points located in the cervical musculature.

      A convenience sample will be used to obtain subjects The subjects will be recruited through
      posted advertisements on social networks. The inclusion and exclusion criteria will be
      applied to the volunteers. The sample wil comprise university students and administrative
      workers with neck pain. The subjects will be screened by a screening questionnaire and all of
      them, they will be required to sign an inform consent before participating to the study.
      After signing it, they will be randomly divide into control group subject to a placebo
      technique and the intervention group subject to an active mobilization of the sciatic nerve.

      To assess changes in cervical articular range, will be used, a cervical goniometer (CROM) and
      for changes in pressure pain threshold of the trigger points will be used a mechanical
      algometer. Furthermore, to asses changes in pain perception will be used a visual numerical
      scale. The statistical analysis will be performed using the statistical program SPSS 25.0,
      comparing the results between both groups.

    <time_frame>Change from baseline in Visual Analog Scale at 2 minutes after intervention</time_frame>
    <description>A Visual Analog Scale, will be used for recording level of pain at rest. The VAS evaluates levels of pain intensity using an 10-point scale (range 0-10), with 0 being classified as &quot;no sensation&quot; and 10 &quot;pain as bad as could be&quot;.</description>

    <measure>The Neck Disability Index, Spanish version</measure>
    <time_frame>Before intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The Neck Disability Index questionnaire is a reliable instrument to assess functional disability in neck pain patients. Will be used to assess the subjects' perceived disability level and how their neck pain affect to their daily live.
Each section is scored on a 0 to 5 rating scale, in which zero means 'No pain' and 5 means 'Worst imaginable pain'. All the points can be summed to a total score. The test can be interpretated as a raw score, with a maximum score of 50, or as a percentage.
0 points or 0% means : no activity limitations , 50 points or 100% means complete activity limitation.</description>
