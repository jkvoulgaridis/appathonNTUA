  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite available therapies, MM uniformly fatal and participants who have received prior
      lenalidomide (Len) and bortezomib have a median overall survival (OS) of 9 months.

      Pomalidomide (Pom) plus low-dose dexamethasone (Dex) significantly improved efficacy
      parameters in terms of progression free survival (PFS), OS, and overall response (ORR)
      compared with high-dose Dex in participants with refractory or relapsed, and refractory MM,
      including participants with disease refractory to both bortezomib and lenalidomide.

      Alkylating agents also represent standard therapies for participants with MM. There are some
      reports demonstrating combination of Len and continuous cyclophosphamide (Cy) achieve an ORR
      of 50% in Len refractory participants, suggesting Cy may be able to overcome resistance to
      Len.

      The investigators aimed to assess the safety in Mexican MM participants in relapse/refractory
      stage of the triple combination: IV Cy in combination with Pom plus Dex until disease
      progression. A multicenter study is proposed.

      Primary endpoint: Safety. Efficacy as secondary endpoint: PF, OS and ORR.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Multiple myeloma is a plasma cell malignancy with accounts for about 1% of all cancers.
      Despite available therapies, the disease remains uniformly fatal and participants who have
      received prior lenalidomide and bortezomib have a median overall survival of 9 months.

      Combination therapy is often used in clinical practice. In an attempt to overcome drug/clone
      resistance, other report with pomalidomide, dexamethasone and cyclophosphamide (PomCyDex)
      show efficacy and safety information, regimen for refractory myeloma patients with higher
      overall response rate than pomalidomide and dexamethasone.

      In this case a phase II trial scheme is proposed: 1. Pomalidomide at 4 mg orally on days 1-21
      of a 28 day cycle, 2. Cyclophosphamide 300 mg IV on days 1 and 15 of a 28 day cycle; and 3.
      Dexamethasone 40 mg PO weekly. Participants who were &gt;75 years of age or those who were known
      to be intolerant to 40 mg weekly dexamethasone are going to receive 20 mg dexamethasone on
      the same schedule.

      Pomalidomide is a drug wide studied in American and European population, but not in México.
      Even it has been approved by local Regulatory authority, there is not any trial supporting
      data about safety and efficacy in Mexican population. Alkylating agents are very active in
      MM, and in combination with novel therapies, such as immunomodulatory drugs, has shown to
      enhance efficacy in relapsed/refractory setting.

      It is proposed phase 2 study to assess safety and efficacy of treatment with Pomalidomide in
      combination with Cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone in a sample of Mexican RRMM participants
      from ISSSTE.
