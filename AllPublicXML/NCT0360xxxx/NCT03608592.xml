  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a devastating inflammatory and destructive
      disease in critical ill patients. Preclinical studies have shown a promising perspective of
      mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) therapies in ARDS. But the safety and efficacy of umbilical
      cord MSCs (UCMSCs) have not yet been convinced in clinical trails. This study will explore
      the safety and life-rescue potential of UCMSCs in refracotry ARDS.

      This is a single arm study. According Berlin definition (2012), moderate or severe adult ARDS
      patients who fail to improve oxygenation (PaO2/FiO2 increase over 20%) in the first 24h or 8h
      after diagnosis will be enrolled. A salvage package of 10^6/kg suspended UCMSCs in 100ml
      normal saline or only 100ml normal saline will be infused through central venous catheter.
      Infusion associated events (IAEs) in 24 hours will be closely monitored. Compared with
      propensity score matched controls, mortality in 28 days as the primary outcomes. oxygenation
      index, ventilator parameters, lung injury biomarkers and clinical outcomes as secondary
      outcomes will be analyzed.

      This is a revised trail from its previous registered pilot RCT, approved by Ethic Committe of
      Stem Cells Trails (ECSCT) of 3rd affiliated hospital of Sun Yat-Sen university

    <measure>Lung injury score(LIS)</measure>
    <time_frame>From day 0 to day 7, day0,1,3,7</time_frame>
    <description>Murray lung injury scores (LIS) consist of the following 4 parts:
A.Hypoxemia (PaO2/FiO2≥300, 225-299,175-224,100-174,&lt;100, assigned 0,1,2,3,4 scores respectively); B.PEEP (cmH2O) (≤5,6-8,9-11,11-14,≥15, assigned 0,1,2,3,4 scores respectively) ; C.Compliance (ml/cmH2O)(≥80,60-79,40-59,20-39,≤19, assigned 0,1,2,3,4 scores respectively); D.Quadrants infiltrated in Chest X-Ray(CXR) (0,1,2,3,4, assigned 0,1,2,3,4 scores respectively).
The total LIS score is obtained by dividing the total sum of points by the number of criteria present. For example, if only 3 criteria are answered to, the total sum is divided by 3 to reveal the final score.
The LIS score ranges between 0 and 4, with scores closer to 4 indicating severe acute lung injury.</description>
