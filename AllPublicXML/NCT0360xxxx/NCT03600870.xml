    <textblock>
      This proof-of-concept clinical trial will determine the safety and tolerability of midodrine
      in patients with hepatopulmonary syndrome (HPS). Exploratory endpoints will assess the effect
      of midodrine on oxygenation, intrapulmonary shunting and symptoms.

    <description>Outcome will be defined by the incidence of adverse events (AEs) that occur during the study period. An adverse event is defined as any symptom, sign, illness or experience that develops or worsens in severity during the course of the study. Abnormal results of diagnostic procedures are considered to be AEs if the abnormality results in study withdrawal, is associated with a serious AE, is associated with clinical signs or symptoms, leads to additional treatment or further diagnostic tests or is considered by the investigator to be of clinical significance. Each adverse event will be further characterized by severity and relationship to the study drug. Adverse event are classified as serious if they are: fatal, life-threatening, require or prolongs hospital stay, lead to persistent or significant disability or incapacity or a congenital anomaly or birth defect.</description>
