    <textblock>
      A double-blind, randomized, intra-subject placebo-controlled, multicenter, multiple dose
      study, evaluating safety, proof of mechanism, preliminary efficacy and systemic exposure in
      subjects with confirmed DDEB or RDEB diagnosis with one or more pathogenic mutations in exon
      73 in the COL7A1 gene.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial will evaluate the safety and tolerability, proof of mechanism, systemic
      exposure and preliminary efficacy following topical application of QR-313 to subjects with
      confirmed DDEB or RDEB with one or more pathogenic mutations in exon 73 in the COL7A1 gene.

      Up to two Target Wound Areas (TWAs) per subject will be selected and randomized. Each TWA
      will be treated with IMP for 8 weeks, either QR-313 or matching placebo. All subjects will
      continue to be followed up for 8 weeks post last dose.

      Subjects will be monitored through home visits and site visits. An imaging system will be
      used to assess the target wound at all home and study site visits.

      QR-313 is a 21-nucleotide antisense oligonucleotide (AON) designed to hybridize to a specific
      sequence in the COL7A1 pre-messengerRNA (pre-mRNA).

          2. Have at least one TWA, ie, a skin area of 7 x 7 cm that ishows no signs of local
             infection, and contains a target wound that is either new or shows dynamic wound
             healing and complies to the following additional criteria:

               1. surface area of the target wound ranging from 5 to 30 cm2, located centrally in

             gene and cell therapy.

          9. Known hypersensitivity to oligonucleotide treatment or excipients of the IMP.

         10. Bleeding disorder or condition requiring the use of anticoagulants to be confirmed by
             aPTT by local lab within 48 hours of first treatment.

         11. Use of systemic or topical steroids within 1 month prior to the baseline visit
