    <textblock>
      Background:

      Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) accounts for 15-20% of all strokes in Western Europe, and
      contributes profoundly to mortality and disability. Thirty day case fatality is 40% and of
      those surviving, only few gain independence. Except for stroke unit care and early blood
      pressure lowering there is currently no treatment of proven benefit. Important predictors of
      poor outcome are increasing age, decreasing Glasgow Coma Scale score, increasing ICH volume,
      presence of intraventricular hemorrhage and deep or infratentorial location. In addition,
      secondary injury due to development of edema and inflammatory response, contribute to
      disability and death. Surgical treatment, mostly comprising craniotomy, has so far not been
      proven effective. In the largest trials STICH and STICH II, the median time to treatment was
      more than 24 hours, which may be an important explanation for the lack of treatment effect.

      The investigators hypothesize that early, minimally-invasive, endoscopy-guided surgery
      improves outcome in patients with spontaneous supratentorial ICH.

      Objective: to study safety, feasibility and technical effectiveness of minimally-invasive
      endoscopy guided surgery for treatment of spontaneous supratentorial ICH and to estimate the
      potential effect on outcome.

      Study design: a multicenter, prospective intervention study (phase II) with a telephonic
      follow up interview at 90 and 180 days.The pilot study serves as a prelude to a randomized
      phase III trial in which the investigators aim to assess whether this intervention improves
      functional outcome at 90 and 180 days.

      Study population: patients with spontaneous supratentorial ICH of 18 years and older. Forty
      patients in three participating centers (Radboudumc, Erasmus MC and AMC) will undergo
      minimally-invasive endoscopy-guided surgery. Three-hundred-and-sixty patients undergoing
      standard medical treatment in one of 7 other participating centers, will be included as a
      control group.

      Intervention: minimally-invasive endoscopy-guided surgery within 8 hours of symptom onset, in
      addition to standard medical management.

      Primary study outcomes: safety (death within 24 hours, 7-day procedure related complications,
      7-day mortality, 30-day mortality) and technical effectiveness (proportional volume
      reduction, proportion of participants with volume reduction &gt; 60 and &gt;80%, and proportion
      with remaining clot volume &lt;15mL).

      Secondary outcomes: modified Rankin Scale score at 90 and 180 days after ICH (functional
      outcome).
