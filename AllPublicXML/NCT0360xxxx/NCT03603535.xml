  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      sensiTVT is a relatively new tape. The aim of this study is to analyze the objective and
      subjective outcome at one year follow-up.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stress urinary incontinence (SUI) is defined as the involuntary leakage during physical
      activity and situations that result in an increase of abdominal pressure like sneezing,
      coughing or laughing and affects up to 25% of women. Currently there are a number of tapes on
      the market with GYNECARE TVT EXACTÂ® (Tension free Vaginal Tape) and TVT- Obturator being one
      of the tapes with the highest subjective and objective cure rates and relatively low adverse
      events in women with normal sphincter pressure. Due to the recent FDA announcements several
      tapes have been withdrawn from the market and several new ones have been designed. Data from
      other tapes are available, however data especially from newer tapes is lacking.

    <measure>objective success of stress urinary incontinence</measure>
    <time_frame>one year</time_frame>
    <description>determined by a standardized cough stress test at 300 ml bladder, a negative cough stress test is a success.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Subjective success as determined using the Patient Global Impression of Improvement questionnaire.</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months+ one year</time_frame>
    <description>defined as very much improved/much improved (1,2) on the Patient Global Impression of Improvement scale, while any other response (improved, same, worse, or much worse- 3-7) will be considered as failures.
The Patient Global Impression of Improvement is a seven item scale validated for incontinence.</description>

    <measure>Subjective incontinence cure rate using the Incontinence Outcome Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months+ one year</time_frame>
    <description>The Incontinence Outcome Questionnaire was validated for postoperative assessment of quality of life after surgical treatment for stress urinary incontinence and has 27 items with lower scores indicating worse treatment outcome. The total score is calculated.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>quality of life using the Kings Health Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months+ one year</time_frame>
    <description>The Kings Health Questionnaire was validated in women with stress urinary incontinence and assesses the impact of incontinence on quality of life. The eight subscales (&quot;domains&quot;) scored between 0 (best) and 100 (worst). The Symptom Severity scale is scored from 0 (best) to 30 (worst); lower scores indicate better QoL. Success in terms of the study is defined as 10 points improvement on the total Kings Health Questionnaire score.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Subjective bother using the Patient Global Impression of Severity</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months+ one year</time_frame>
    <description>Patient Global Impression of Severity The Patient Global Impression of Severity is a 7-item urinary symptom severity scale that is used to rate the severity of a specific condition -a single-state scale. The higher the number the worse the outcome of subjective bother of stress urinary incontinence.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient satisfaction measured using a visual analogue scale</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months+ one year</time_frame>
    <description>Patient satisfaction is defined as a score 8 to 10 on a 10-point visual analogue scale</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Sexual health using the Pelvic Organ Prolapse Incontinence Sexual Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months+ one year</time_frame>
    <description>The Pelvic Organ Prolapse Incontinence Sexual Questionnaire is a 20 item questionnaire and is the primary measure used to assess sexual function in women with urinary incontinence and prolapse. Mean subscale scores are calculated by summing the valid responses to items in the subscale and then divided by the number of items with valid responses. The higher the subscores, the worse the outcome.</description>
