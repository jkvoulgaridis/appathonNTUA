    <textblock>
      This multi-site randomized controlled trial (RCT) will compare the effectiveness of two
      models of post-discharge tobacco cessation treatment for adult smokers who are admitted to 3
      large hospital systems in 3 U.S. regions (MA, PA, TN). All patients will receive
      guideline-based tobacco cessation treatment delivered in hospital by each site's existing
      Tobacco Treatment Service that is directed by a study investigator. Patients who plan to quit
      smoking after hospital discharge will be randomly assigned to 1 of 2 post-discharge tobacco
      treatment interventions and followed at 1, 3, and 6 months. One arm uses bidirectional
      electronic referral (eReferral) to the state tobacco quitline. The other arm, Personalized
      Tobacco Care Management (PTCM), combines proactive messages delivered by automated
      interactive voice response (IVR) phone calls, text messaging, and/or email with health
      coaching provided by a hospital-based tobacco counselor. Both groups will receive at least 1
      month of nicotine replacement therapy.
