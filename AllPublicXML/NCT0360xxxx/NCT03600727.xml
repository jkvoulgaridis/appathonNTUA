  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dexmedetomidine, was reported to prevent postoperative delirium in elderly patients following
      its use in intensive care units. Possible mechanisms included improved quality of sleep and
      an inhibitory effect on inflammation. A greater number of studies indicated that propofol has
      negative effect on postoperative cognitive function. In this study, we planned to investigate
      the influence of these two different sedative drugs on peripheral inflammation induced by
      surgery and postoperative cognitive function of patients who will receive hip and knee
      arthroplasty.

      Dexmedetomidine, was reported to prevent postoperative delirium in elderly patients following
      its use in intensive care units. Possible mechanisms included improved quality of sleep and
      an inhibitory effect on inflammation. A greater number of studies indicated that propofol has
      negative effect on postoperative cognitive function. In this study, patients who will receive
      hip and knee arthroplasty will be divided to two groups: Propofol group and Dexmedetomidine
      group. Spinal anesthesia will be used to meet the requirement of intraoperative analgesia.
      Patients in two groups will be sedated by propofol and dexmedetomidine, respectively. TNF-α
      and IL-6 in blood will be detected. And postoperative cognitive function of patients will be
      investigated. The objective of this study is to clarify the influence of these two different
      sedative drugs on peripheral inflammation induced by surgery, and the relationship with the
      change of postoperative cognitive function.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The patients included in this study were 65 years or older, were undergoing total hip
             arthroplasty, and were classified as American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA)
             physical health class I-IV.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Contraindications to spinal anesthesia (i.e., coagulopathy, concurrent use of
             anticoagulants, infection at puncture site, and refusal of spinal anesthesia),
             patients with infectious diseases, patients with mental or language barriers, patients
             who had been anesthetized within the past 30 days, severe congestive heart failure
             (New York Heart Association, class IV) and/or severe chronic obstructive pulmonary
             disease (Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease Guidelines, stages
             III-IV), sick sinus syndrome, severe sinus bradycardia (&lt; 50 beats per min), and
