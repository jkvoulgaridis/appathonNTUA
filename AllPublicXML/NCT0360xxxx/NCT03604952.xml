      Purpose: To analyze the effects of Ramadan observance (RO) on pulmonary variables, exercise
      performance and postural balance in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
      (COPD).

      Methods: Twenty COPD patients (age=72.7 Â± 4.1 yr, non-smokers, without cardiac or
      neuromuscular complications) were evaluated. Tests performed one week before Ramadan (C), and
      during the second (R-2) and the fourth weeks of Ramadan (R-4) included standard spirometry, a
      quality of life questionnaire (VQ11), a 6-min walking test (6MWT), measurement of maximal
      voluntary contraction force of the quadriceps (MVC), Timed Get Up and Go (TUG), Berg Balance
      Scale (BBS) and Unipedal Stance (UST).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality
      worldwide ; prevalence is high in Tunisia, with 7.8 % and 4.2 % of the population in disease
      stages 1 and 2 respectively . Patients with COPD show an impaired exercise tolerance, often
      with severe dyspnea, a decreased ability to participate in the activities of daily living,
      and a poor health-related quality of life.

      The common practice of those observing Ramadan is to have two meals per day: a large meal
      shortly after sunset and a much lighter one immediately before dawn. Ramadan observance (RO)
      is characterized by many changes in diet and sleep patterns , often with a decrease in the
      time available for nocturnal sleep . Studies in athletes have shown altered muscle metabolism
      , hormonal changes , and an impaired physical performance depending on the time of day at
      which test sessions were performed . Sometimes there are disturbances of cognitive function ,
      and Patel et al noted decreases in postural control even in young adults, due to momentary
      lapses of attention after sleep deprivation . Such changes are of particular concern in
      elderly patients with COPD, since their ability to carry out the activities of daily living
      may initially be marginal, and any disturbances of balance and cognitive function associated
      with RO could increase the risk of falls .

      To date, only one previous study has examined the effects of Ramadan observance in patients
      with COPD ; this report focused almost exclusively upon changes in medication use during RO.
      Most Muslim patients with COPD observe Ramadan (for example, 93% in Turkey ), but little is
      known about the clinical and physiological effects of such fasting in COPD .Thus, the aim of
      the present study was to analyze the effects of RO on pulmonary variables, exercise
      performance and postural balance in patients with COPD.

    <description>Pulmonary function was tested using a Zan 100 spirometer (Inspire Health GmbH, Germany) according to Respiratory Society recommendations, with data related to Tunisian norms</description>

    <measure>6-min walking test</measure>
    <time_frame>6 min</time_frame>
    <description>Exercise Performance was assessed by 6MWT , performed indoors, along a flat, straight, 30 m walking course with a tiled surface; chairs were placed in case participants needed to rest</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The timed get up and go (TUG),</measure>
    <time_frame>15 seconds</time_frame>
    <description>The TUG score reflects both balance and functional mobility . The time taken to stand from a chair, walk a distance of 3 meters, turn around, return to the chair, and sit down was recorded</description>

    <description>The BBS is a psychometrically robust clinical measurement of balance for older adults. It assesses performance on 5 levels, from 0 (cannot perform) to 4 (normal performance), with14 items involving functional balance control, including transfer, turning and stepping; a perfect score is 56</description>

    <measure>the Unipedal stance</measure>
    <time_frame>45 secondes</time_frame>
    <description>The UST measures the participant's ability to stand on his preferred leg. A unipedal stance is maintained for a long as possible; failure is defined as shifting the stance foot or placing the lifted foot on the floor. The UST was considered normal if the unipedal stance was maintained for 45 seconds or longer</description>

    <measure>Isometric leg force assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>5 secondes</time_frame>
    <description>After a warm-up phase of the leg extensor muscle consisting of 5 min cycling at 60% of maximum HR reached at the end of 6MWT, 3 maximal voluntary isometric contractions (MVC) were made, separated by 5 min rest intervals</description>

    <measure>Quality of life questionnaire (VQ 11)</measure>
    <time_frame>10 min</time_frame>
    <description>The VQ11 is a reliable and valid measure of COPD-specific health related quality of life (HRQoL) [27]. The 11 items cover three main components: functional (dyspnea, fatigue and mobility), psychological (physical confidence, anxiety, depression and sleep), and social (life project, social life, closeness and emotional life). A high total score indicates a poor HRQoL</description>
