      this study will investigate the effectiveness of PRP in wound healing among diabetic patients
      undergoing elective cesarean sections

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this balanced, randomized, and controlled prospective study, 100 pregnant ladies at full
      term diabetic patients will be admitted to Minia University hospital. The patients will be
      randomly assigned into two groups. The intervention group will receive PRP at surgery,
      whereas the control group will receive the usual care. All patients will be evaluated at
      baseline, one week, two weeks, four weeks and eight week after the cesarean section.

    <description>REEDA descriptive scale will assess degree of wound healing which formed of 4 points in a categorical score assessing 5 items of healing, redness, edema,ecchymosis,discharge ,approximation of the wound edges. each item is rated on a scale of 0-3 and total score may range between 0-15. lower scores indicating good healing</description>

    <time_frame>4-8weeks</time_frame>
    <description>at 4 and 8 weeks post-operatively the wound healing will be completed and will be assessed using VSS,Vancouver scar scale, which detect formation of keloid or hypertrophic scars. it will assess vascularity, scar thickness, pliability and pigmentation</description>
