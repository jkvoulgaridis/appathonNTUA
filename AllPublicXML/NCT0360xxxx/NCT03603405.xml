    <textblock>
      Study to assess the safety and efficacy of HSV-tk (gene therapy), valacyclovir, radiotherapy
      and chemotherapy in newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) or anaplastic astrocytoma
      (AA).

    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, phase I-II study to assess the efficacy and toxicity of HSV-tk +
      valacyclovir gene therapy in combination with radiotherapy and standard of care chemotherapy
      for anaplastic astrocytoma (AA) or glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). This study is comprised of
      newly diagnosed patients with AA or GBM.

      Clinical response will be evaluated by neurological evaluation, neuropsychological testing,
      and imaging studies as well as by histological examination. Blood samples will be taken for
      systemic immunological response, blood counts, and liver functions tests. Genetic testing of
      tumor tissue will be performed, including genetic analysis and cell cultures. Toxicity will
      be graded by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.03 and Radiation
      Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) neuro-toxicity scores (see Appendices). Patients will also be
      followed to assess median time to progression and median survival.

The gene therapy investigational product, HSV-tk will be injected during the surgery. Within 24 hours valacyclovir will be given for 14 days. Radiotherapy will be administered over 30 sessions (over 6 weeks) starting within 9 days of surgery. Standard of care/routine chemotherapy will be started concurrent with the radiotherapy dependent on patient status based on best clinical judgment following the Stupp protocol.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All patients must have frozen section biopsy proven anaplastic astrocytoma or
             glioblastoma multiforme without evidence of multifocal tumor or leptomeningeal
             metastatic disease or brainstem involvement as well as radiographic evidence
             consistent with these diagnoses.

          -  Life expectancy â‰¥ 12 weeks.

          -  Patients should have the following characteristics: newly diagnosed anaplastic
             astrocytoma or glioblastoma demonstrated by frozen section biopsy, ECOG performance
             status of 0-1. No evidence of other active malignancy (except squamous or basal cell
             skin cancers).

          -  Signed informed consent to participate in the study must be obtained from patients
             after they have been fully informed of the nature and potential risks of the study by
             the investigator (or his/her designee) with the aid of written information.

          -  Willing to provide biopsies as required by the study.
