    <textblock>
      1. Total Glucosides of Paeony(TGP) As a traditional Chinese medicine, peony root is the
           dried root of peony of Ranunculaceae, cultivated all over the country.The main
           ingredient is a group of glycosides, including paeoniflorin, hydroxy paeoniflorin,
           paeoniflorin, paeoniflorin, benzoyl paeoniflorin etc, collectively referred to as total
           glucosides of paeony（TGP）. Paeoniflorin accounted for more than 90% of the TGP, is the
           main active ingredient of white peony root.By pharmacological and clinical studies of
           TGP, it have found that the mechanism of TGP is unique and mainly acts on the upstream
           of the immune response - inhibiting the presentation of antigens. It is different from
           immunosuppressive agents on T, B lymphocytes, or hormones and other drugs acting on the
           whole process.

        2. Vitiligo Vitiligo is a pigment deprived skin disease caused by the destruction of
           melanocytes, the global incidence of about 1%. The pathogenesis is not yet clear, the
           current study shows that oxidative stress and autoimmunity is an important part of its
           occurrence and development.

        3. The basic and clinical research of TGP used in vitiligo The ratio of cluster of
           differentiation 4+ / cluster designation 8+ T cell vs. cluster of differentiation 4+
           chronotropic dose 25+ in the peripheral blood of patients with vitiligo could be
           significantly increase, after patients treatment by TGP combined with tacrolimus.
           Thereby enhancing the patient's maintenance of immune self-stability and Immune
           tolerance ability, promoting the healing of skin lesions. It showed significant effect
           in stable vitiligo,when patients treated by autologous epidermal grafting combined with
           TGP.
