  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background/Purpose:

      A novel transvaginal mesh (TVM) surgery for women with pelvic organ prolapse (POP) had been
      reported. However, factors affecting the efficacy of this novel TVM surgery are unknown; and
      the above information should be important for preoperative consultation, especially for POP
      women with concomitant urodynamic stress incontinence (USI). Thus, the aim of this study is
      to investigate the factors responsible for anti-incontinence effect of this novel anterior
      TVM surgery.

      Patients and Methods:

      All women with POP and concomitant overt or occult USI, who underwent the novel anterior TVM
      surgeries, were enrolled in this study. Medical records, including urodynamic studies,
      questionnaires and 3-day bladder diaries, were retrospectively reviewed. Linear regress
      analysis was used to identify factors that were responsible for the changes in pad weights
      from baseline [i.e., 100 * (postoperative pad weight - baseline pad weight)/baseline pad
      weight].

      Expected Results:

      The investigators will get the factors responsible for anti-incontinence effect of this novel
      anterior TVM surgery. Key Words: pelvic organ prolapse, stress urinary incontinence, pad
      test, urodynamic stress incontinence

      Methods:

      surgeries between November 2011 and December 2015 at the Department of Obstetrics &amp;
      Gynecology, were enrolled in this study. Medical records, including urodynamic studies,
      questionnaires and 3-day bladder diaries, were retrospectively reviewed. Linear regress
