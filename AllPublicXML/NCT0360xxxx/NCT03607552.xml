  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) is a short (under 5 minutes) non-contrast MRI technique that
      has shown promise for the detection and characterization of breast cancer. Our preliminary
      data has shown that DWI holds potential for detecting mammographically and clinically-occult
      breast cancers. However, current technical limitations reduce the sensitivity of DWI for
      screening applications.

      The identification of a screening tool to complement mammography that is more accurate than
      ultrasound and faster, less expensive, and safer than conventional contrast-enhanced MRI
      would have significant clinical impact by improving the early detection of cancer in women
      with dense breasts. We hypothesize that an optimized DWI approach will enable detection of
      mammographically occult breast cancer in women with dense breasts with high sensitivity and
      low false positive rate.

      Hypothesis: With technical optimizations, non-contrast DWI can detect clinically and
      mammographically occult breast cancer in women with dense breasts with high sensitivity and
      low false positive rate.

      Aim 1: Improve the breast DWI technique to maximize spatial resolution, reduce distortion,
      and increase lesion contrast.

        -  Develop novel DWI acquisition to increase spatial resolution and reduce distortion
           (using reduced field of-view and/or multishot echo planar imaging techniques)

        -  Identify optimal diffusion sensitization (b-value) to maximize conspicuity of cancers in
           women with dense breasts

      Aim 2: Develop interpretation tools to optimize diagnostic performance for detecting cancer
      on DWI.

        -  Determine quantitative DWI thresholds (contrast-to-noise ratio, apparent diffusion
           coefficient [ADC]) that best differentiate benign and malignant lesions (i.e. maximize
           sensitivity and specificity)

        -  Develop computer aided assessment tools to facilitate clinical implementation and
           optimize reader accuracy

      Aim 3: Test the performance of the optimized DWI approach for detecting clinically and
      mammographically-occult cancer in women with dense breasts.

        -  Conduct a controlled reader study of non-contrast DWI alone for breast cancer detection

        -  Perform receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis and determine the sensitivity
           and specificity for detection of mammographically occult cancer
