  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a research study to find out if an off-label use of carboxymethylcellulose foam
      (CMC), an absorbable nasal packing, combined with triamcinolone acetonide, a steroid, is more
      comfortable postoperatively for participants and is as effective in decreasing scarring,
      swelling and crusting after surgery than an FDA approved steroid eluting implant. Anticipated
      sample size will be 30. Study is an intrapatient control design. Subjects will be randomly
      assigned to receive CMC foam with triamcinolone in one nare and the steroid-eluting implant
      in the other. Participants will fill out preoperative and follow-up visit surveys at 7, 14,
      30 and 90 days. Subjects at each visit will also have pictures taken of the nasal cavities to
      be scored for later analysis. Paired t-tests will be performed for analysis.

      Our primary objective is to demonstrate that triamcinolone-impregnated carboxymethylcellulose
      foam is noninferior to steroid-eluting implants in improving postoperative ethmoid
      inflammation, middle turbinate position, preventing intranasal synechiae and reducing
      polypoid change with objective measurement scales Our secondary objects include assessing the
      quality-of-life and nasal obstruction symptoms before and after functional endoscopic sinus
      surgery with validated SNOT-22 and NOSE questionnaires and to assess the cost-effectiveness
      of triamcinolone-impregnated carboxymethylcellulose foam versus steroid-eluting implant in
      management of CRSwNP in the early postoperative period.

      The endpoints are the POSE scores, the SNOT-22 and NOSE scores at days 7, 14, 30 and 90.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Postoperative Perioperative Sinus Endoscopy Score</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days</time_frame>
    <description>The Perioperative Sinus Endoscopy score sums the combined scores determined from middle turbinate position, middle meatal status, ethmoid cavity appearance, as well as secondary sinus blockage (frontal and sphenoid). Each category is scored from 0-2, with 0 being not present, 1 as partially present, and 2 being fully present. The highest total score is 16, with scores ranging from 18-20 when the frontal and sphenoid sinuses are also included. The higher the score, the worse the status of the nasal cavity.
Comparison of the mean POSE scores for the two treatments at day 30 to determine there is noninferiority</description>

Experimental drug is triamcinolone-acetonide 40mg/mL. 2mL will be combined with 5mL sterile water and mixed with carboxymethylcellulose foam and placed in the nares at the conclusion of the surgery. This will only be applied once and will remain in the nares until it dissolves or 7 days.</description>
