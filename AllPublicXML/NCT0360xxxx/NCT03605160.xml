      Residual lens fibers (RLFs) on the posterior lens capsule during cataract surgery can cause
      after cataract, affecting visual quality and increasing the medical cost for further laser
      posterior capsulotomy. However, conventional polish is inconvenient and time-consuming. We
      use an innovative fluid-jet method to remove RLFs, and compare the efficacy of fluid-jet and
      polish to prevent posterior capsular opacity after phacoemulsification.

      Purpose: Residual lens fibers (RLFs) on the posterior lens capsule during cataract surgery
      can cause after cataract, affecting visual quality and increasing the medical cost for
      further laser posterior capsulotomy. However, conventional polish is inconvenient and
      time-consuming. We use an innovative fluid-jet method to remove RLFs, and compare the
      efficacy of fluid-jet and polish to prevent posterior capsular opacity after
      phacoemulsification.

      Design: Single-center, prospective, randomized controlled clinical study Subjects of study:
      Age-related cataract patients receiving phacoemulsification from Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center,
      Guangzhou, China.

      Methods: patients are 1: 1 randomized to two groups. Polish group: After irrigation and
      aspiration (I/A), the RLFs on the posterior capsule are removed by polishing before
      intraocular lens (IOL) implantation; Fluid-jet group: Polish is not performed. RLFs on
      posterior capsule are removed by jetting fluid with an irrigating syringe after IOL
      implantation. The posterior capsular images of all the patients are obtained immediately
      before and after IOL implantation, and at the end of surgery, then the amount of RLFs is
      quantitatively analyzed by using LYZ-PCO, a software we developed. Best corrected visual
      acuity and parameters of visual quality, such as objective scattering index(OSI), Strehl
      ratio (SR) and Modulation Transfer Function (Mtf)-cut off are evaluated by objective visual
      quality analyser (OQAS) at 1 day, 1 week and 1 year after surgery. The patients receives
      telephone follow-up every month. The severity of posterior capsular opacification (PCO) and
      incidence of laser posterior capsulotomy is recorded.

      Main indicators for the study: The incidence of laser posterior capsulotomy a year after
      surgery.

    <description>Perform conventional continuous curvilinear capsulorhexis. After phacoemulsification and I/A, switch to polish mode and use I/A instrument to remove the RLFs visible on the posterior capsule before injection of viscoelastic agent. IOP: 55mmHg; Aspiration: 0-10; Vacuum: 0-20. The standard for stopping polish is that the RLFs can no longer be absorbed by the side holes on the I/A instrument in this mode, or there are no discernible RLFs on the posterior capsule. If RLFs on the posterior capsular are found after IOL implantation, polish to remove them after the removal of viscoelastic agents. All operations are videotaped during the whole operation. The total polish time is recorded as the time of all polish procedures.</description>

    <description>Perform conventional continuous curvilinear capsulorhexis. After phacoemulsification and I/A, inject viscoelastic agent and implant IOL without polish. Use I/A instrument to remove viscoelastic agent. A 27G irrigating syringe was used, and the RLFs on the posterior capsule were gently aligned to make a fluid-jet basically parallel to the iris. The liquid pressure of 50-120 mmHg is produced. The standard for stopping in this mode is that the RLFs can no longer be washed down from the capsule, or there are no discernible RLFs on the posterior capsule. All operations are videotaped during the whole operation. The total time of all jet procedures recorded in the videotape is the total time of jet.</description>
