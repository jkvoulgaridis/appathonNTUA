  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To measure coronary calcium score in adults treated during childhood or adolescence for
      irradiation cancer in the heart and / or anthracycline area and compare them to determine
      whether irradiation of the heart area is associated with increased calcium score after
      adjustment for other cardiovascular risk factors (age, sex, smoking, dyslipidemia, obesity,
      diabetes, high blood pressure and renal failure).

    <description>A medical interview with clinical examination by a cardiologist for screening cardiovascular risk factors, including smoking, and looking for symptoms of heart disease as part of routine care.
In accordance with routine care, a fasting and fasting blood test will be performed performed on exam day at Bichat Hospital or at another time, close to the patient's home according to his availability. The biological blood test will include the measurement of plasma triglyceride concentrations, total cholesterol and its HDL and LDL fractions, blood glucose, glycated hemoglobin and serum creatinine with estimated glomerular filtration rate according to the CKD-EPI formula. . Sample urinalysis will include measurement of creatinine, proteinuria, and microalbuminuria.
An electrocardiogram (ECG) rest, a cardiac ultrasound, a test and respiratory function tests (EFR) will be performed as part of routine care. Coronal calcium score measurement will be performed as part of the research.</description>
