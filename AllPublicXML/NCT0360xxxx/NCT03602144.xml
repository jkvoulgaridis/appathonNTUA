  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One in every three children ages 2-19 years is overweight or obese. Although multifactorial
      in nature, obesity is primarily attributed to a mismatch between energy intake and energy
      expenditure (EE). Daily EE (DEE) can be partitioned between resting metabolic rate (RMR), EE
      associated with physical activity, and the thermic effect of food (TEF). RMR corresponds to
      the energy needed to sustain the body functions at rest and is also related to body
      composition (i.e., ratio of skeletal muscle mass to fat mass). Skeletal muscle mass is a
      large contributor to RMR; the more skeletal muscle mass, the higher the RMR (i.e., more
      energy expended at rest). In addition, muscle plays a central role in whole body protein
      metabolism and disrupted muscle metabolism is associated with the development of many common
      chronic diseases associated with obesity such as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease.
      Although the contribution of disrupted muscle metabolism to chronic disease is
      well-established in older adults, the potential impact in children is unknown. The overall
      objective for this primary project application is to determine the role of breakfast protein
      consumption in improving energy metabolism, energy balance and skeletal muscle health in
      obese, school-aged children.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Whole body energy expenditure (WBEE)</measure>
    <time_frame>WBEE will be measured as the change between WBEE during day 1 and day 42 of the intervention.</time_frame>

    <measure>Appetite (VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>VAS will be measured on day 1 and day 42.</time_frame>
    <description>Appetite response to test beverages will be measured using visual analog scales. Appetite and palatability were assessed using a traditional 100-mm visual analog scale (VAS) [33] with opposing anchors (e.g., &quot;extremely hungry&quot; or &quot;not hungry at all&quot;) at time points 0, 15, 30, 60, 90, and 120 min. Questions consisted of: &quot;how hungry do you feel at this moment&quot;, &quot;how full do you feel at this moment&quot;, &quot;how strong is your desire to eat this moment&quot; and &quot;how much food do you think you can eat at this moment&quot;. A higher number is associated with increased hunger.</description>

    <measure>Muscle mass</measure>
    <time_frame>Change in muscle mass will be determined by the difference in muscle mass between day 1 and day 42.</time_frame>

    <measure>Muscle fractional synthesis rate (FSR)</measure>
    <time_frame>FSR will be determined as the change between baseline (day 0) and day 42.</time_frame>
    <description>FSR will be measured using deuterated water and markers of muscle health in plasma.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Whole body protein turnover (WPT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change in WPT will be determined by the difference in WPT between day 1 and day 42.</time_frame>
