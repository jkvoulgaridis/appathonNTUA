    <description>The SAD part will consist of 6 escalating dose cohorts and 1 fed cohort of healthy male participants, 2 dose escalating cohorts of healthy female participants, and 1 solid dose formulation (capsule) cohort of healthy male participants, who will be dosed after completion of the dose escalation cohorts. Participants in each cohort (except for the solid dose formulation cohort) will receive JNJ-64264681 or Placebo on Day 1, orally. In the solid dose formulation cohort, participants will receive JNJâ€‘64264681 capsule on Day 1. Doses for the female cohorts and fed cohort will be selected based on safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK),and pharmacodynamic (PD) data from preceding cohorts and the dose for the solid dose formulation cohort will be selected and approximately equal to a dose previously studied in the single ascending dose cohorts.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participant must have a body mass index (BMI) between 18.0 and 30.0 kilogram per meter
             square (kg/m^2) (BMI = weight[kg]/height[m]^2), and a body weight of not less than 50
             kilogram (kg)

          -  Participant must be healthy on the basis of physical examination, medical history,
             vital signs, and 12-lead Electrocardiogram (ECG) performed at screening and Day -1

          -  Participant must be healthy on the basis of clinical laboratory tests performed at
             screening and Day -1. If the results of the serum chemistry panel, coagulation,
             hematology, or urinalysis are outside the normal reference ranges, the participant may
             be included only if the investigator judges the abnormalities or deviations from
             normal to be not clinically significant. This determination must be recorded in the
             participant's source documents and initialed by the investigator

          -  Participant must sign an informed consent form (ICF) indicating that he or she
             understands the purpose of, and procedures required for, the study and is willing to

             criteria below: a) Be over 45 years of age with no menses for 12 months without an
             alternative medical cause, with screening follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) levels of
             greater than (&gt;)40 International Units Per Liter (IU/L) or milli-international units
             per milliliter (mIU/mL). b) Be permanently surgically sterile. Permanent surgical
             sterilization methods include hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy, bilateral tubal
             occlusion/ligation procedures, and bilateral oophorectomy. Documentation of FSH levels
             is not required in the case of surgical sterility

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participant has current, or history of clinically significant medical illness
             including, but not limited to, liver or renal insufficiency, significant cardiac
             (including heart valve disease), vascular, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, endocrine,
             neurologic, hematologic, rheumatologic, psychiatric, or metabolic disturbances

          -  Participant has a history of abnormal bleeding or bruising

          -  Participant has a history of atrial fibrillation or history of arrhythmias

          -  Participant has history of malignancy within 5 years before screening (exceptions are
             squamous and basal cell carcinomas of the skin and carcinoma in situ of the cervix, or
             malignancy, which in the opinion of the investigator, with concurrence with the
             sponsor's medical monitor, is considered cured with minimal risk of recurrence)

          -  Participant has known allergies, hypersensitivity, or intolerance to polyethylene
             glycol 400 (PEG400) (vehicle for JNJ-64264681 for oral solution dosing) for
             participant in a cohort where study drug is to be dosed as an oral solution, or to
             microcrystalline cellulose, lactose monohydrate, croscarmellose sodium, silica
             dioxide, sodium lauryl sulfate, magnesium stearate, or gelatin (excipients in the
             solid dose formulation (capsule) of JNJ-64264681) for participant in a solid dose
             formulation cohort
