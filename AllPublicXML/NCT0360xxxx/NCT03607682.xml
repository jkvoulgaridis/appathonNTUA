  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial studies how well tumor-treating fields therapy works in preventing brain tumors in
      participants with small cell lung cancer that has spread to other places in the body.
      Tumor-treating fields therapy involves the use of the NovoTTF-200A which delivers alternating
      electrical fields, or tumor treating fields, through ceramic discs placed on the head. This
      electric force may slow and/or reverse tumor growth by disrupting the way cancer cells grow.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To measure the feasibility and compliance of NovoTTF-200A as prophylactic cranial tumor
      treatment fields (TTF) therapy, determined by percent (%) of patients continuing TTF therapy
      until intracranial tumor progression, discontinuation due to dose limiting toxicity (DLT), or
      6 months.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate time to intracranial failure after NovoTTF-200A. II. To evaluate overall
      survival after NovoTTF-200A. III. To evaluate the rates of intracranial failure at 2, 4, 6,
      8, 10, 12 months after NovoTTF-200A.

      IV. To evaluate intracranial failure free survival after NovoTTF-200A. V. To evaluate the
      rate of decline in Hopkins Verbal Language Test-Revised (HVLT-R) free recall, delayed recall
      and delayed recognition, Controlled Oral Word Association Test (COWAT) and Trail Making Test
      (TMT) Parts A and B at 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 months after NovoTTF-200A.

      VI. To evaluate time to neurocognitive failure after NovoTTF-200A. VII. To evaluate
      neurocognitive failure-free survival after NovoTTF-200A. VIII. To evaluate quality of life
      using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life
      Questionnaire Core 30 (EORTC Quality of life Questionnaire C30) with BN20 addendum after
      NovoTTF-200A.

      IX. To assess adverse events, severity, and frequency associated with NovoTTF-200A using the
      Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants undergo tumor-treating fields therapy using the NovoTTF-200A device over 18
      hours per day for a minimum of 4 weeks and up to 1 year in the absence of disease
      progression, unacceptable toxicity, or intracranial failure.

      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up at 8 weeks.
