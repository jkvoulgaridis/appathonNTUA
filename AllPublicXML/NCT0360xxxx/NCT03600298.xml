      Open interventional before and after study on the effect of on-site full-scale simulation
      with a subsequent course follow-up and a three month follow-up observation pertaining to
      behavioural changes in communication of the paediatric intensive care unit staff that is
      participating in the on-site simulation training.

    <textblock>
      Closed-Loop Communication (CLC) is a proposed, taught and practiced Crisis Resource
      Management (CRM) strategy thought to be effective for enhancing patient safety by enforcing
      reiteration and clarity, thus reducing ambiguity during verbal communication among health
      care providers. The transfer of this CRM strategy into clinical practice seems to require
      recurring exposure. Teaching and training is needed to help health care providers develop
      routine in communicating. This training is most effective if practiced in the clinical
      setting that is familiar to the health care provider (in situ simulation). As trainees become
      more proficient, the ultimate goal is to integrate Closed-Loop Communication into daily
      habits of verbal interaction in every health care setting. One way to practice the
      utilization of Closed-Loop Communication is simulation. The investigators seek to investigate
      if simulation participants can incorporate CRM strategies such as Closed-Loop Communication
      into their communication repertoire. This shall serve as an example of attitude transfer
      following a simulation based learning experience.The primary study objective is to measure
      the success of simulation training for increasing Closed-Loop Communication as a behavioural
      change in the clinical setting.

    <description>measurement of difference regarding the employment of Closed-Loop Communication in the clinical setting after three months of the simulation training focusing on crisis resource management (CRM) in communication and assessed by external raters and compared to baseline before such training. Based on a study by HÃ¤rgestam et al. (2013) we classified the call-outs as command (com), question (que), observation (obs) or suggestion (sug). Furthermore, after our experience during the pilot phase we added the category information (inf), since we could not sort a number of call-outs into the existing four categories</description>

    <description>measurement of difference regarding the employment of Closed-Loop Communication while reacting to a call-outs in the clinical setting after three months of the simulation training focusing on crisis resource management (CRM) in communication and assessed by external raters and compared to baseline before such training. Inspired by the study by Boyd et al (2014) the reaction to the call-out will be as follows categorized: no response (no-check), call-back (check), verbal response (verb-res.), nonverbal response (noverb-res.) and closed-loop (check-close).</description>

    <description>Phase I: During the month leading up to the simulation two trained observers / raters will observe the rate of Closed-Loop Communication in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) among study participants.
Intervention phase: Study participants will be subjected to on-site simulation training focusing on communication, including CRM and non-technical skills in the PICU setting.
Phase II + III: During the follow up phase, trained raters will again observe the study-participating PICU staff relative to their communication behaviour in the month following simulation training (Phase II) and again three months later (Phase III).</description>
