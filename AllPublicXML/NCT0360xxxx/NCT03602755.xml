    <textblock>
      This is an observational, post-authorization, retrospective, multicenter study (PAS-OD) that
      will be conducted in approximately 20 centers in Spain. In all cases, only data recorded
      prior to the date of study start will be collected to ensure its retrospective nature, thus
      reflecting real clinical practice, avoiding any influence on the physician's clinical
      practice.
