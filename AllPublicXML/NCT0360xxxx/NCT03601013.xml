  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) is leading cause of death worldwide. Most of them underwent
      coronary angiography and they have to use dual anti-platelet therapy. As mentioned novel
      guidelines for CAD, the estimated number of patients requiring dual anti-platelet therapy has
      increased over time, and DAPT time is controversial. Acting on the behalf of 2017 ESC focused
      update on dual anti-platelet therapy in coronary artery disease developed in collaboration
      with EACTS guideline, this study is amid to determine PRECISE-DAPT score which predicts out
      of hospital bleeding risk in patients receiving dual anti-platelet treatment and to detect
      the prevalence of patients with high bleeding risk, and to determine DAPT score which
      predicts benefit/risk ratio of continuing or discontinuing dual ant-iplatelet therapy after
      12 months and to detect the prevalence of patients with high ischemic or hemorrhagic
      complication risk in centers included in this study.

      Design

      The study is a national, multicenter, non-interventional, observational, prospective
      registry.

      Population

      Patients older than 18 years old of age, have acute coronary syndrome or percutaneous
      coronary intervention electively and with available admission hemoglobin, white blood cell
      and creatine clearance data will be enrolled for Precise-DAPT,and Patients older than 18
      years old of age and completed 12 months of dual anti-platelet therapy without having
      hemorrhage and ischemic coronary event and with available data of age, history of smoking,
      presence of diabetes mellitus, history of percutaneous coronary intervention, paclitaxel
      eluting stent, stent diameter, history of myocardial infarction, saphenous vein graft
      intervention, ejection fraction or presence of heart failure. Patients that do not approve
      informed consent will be excluded.

      Aim

      This study is amid to investigate the demographic and clinical profile of patients with CAD
      and on dual anti-platelet therapy, mean precise -DAPT and DAPT scores of Turkey.
