  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Scanning the heart using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) enables detailed assessment of its
      structure and function. MRI can give more detailed information about the heart by using a
      contrast 'dye' that is injected into a vein during the scan. This can highlight abnormal
      areas within the heart. Current contrast dyes help identify scarring within the heart, which
      is useful in people who have had heart attacks. The investigators plan to test new contrast
      dye containing manganese, which works differently to current agents. They believe it will
      provide unique insight into how the heart works.

      There are many different causes of heart problems and the investigators plan to use this new
      contrast agent to scan three patient groups; (i) heart disease caused by heart attacks, (ii)
      heart disease with abnormal thickening of the heart muscle, and (iii) heart disease where the
      heart becomes stretched and enlarged. Healthy volunteers will be scanned for comparison.

      The study will be carried out at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh. Adults between 18 and 65
      with stable heart failure can be considered. Women who may be pregnant are unable to
      participate, as is anyone who has some types of metal in their body, as these people can't
      have an MRI scan safely. All participants will have 2 MRI scans lasting about an hour each,
      at least 2 days apart. Some participants will be have 4 MRI scans, over a longer time period.
      The investigators will also take some blood samples and record a tracing of the heart rhythm
      and will ensure there are no abnormal side-effects by telephone follow up.

      The investigators believe this new agent has potential to better measure disease in the
      heart, improve the ability to establish the cause of heart disease and help monitor the
      disease over time as well as guide future treatment for individual patients.
