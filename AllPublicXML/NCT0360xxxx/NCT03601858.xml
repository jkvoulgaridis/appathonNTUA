  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to carry out a descriptive study of the clinical and
      demographic characteristics of patients having consulted for a specialized opinion about ADHD
      in adults of the psychiatric service of the Strasbourg University Hospital.

      The characteristics of patients were collected during the first consultation, by the
      psychiatrist, and analyzed retrospectively.

      The secondary objective is to evaluate the evolution at one year in terms of follow-up,
      maintenance under medical treatment and perceived effects of it.

      The patients who had a prescription for pharmacological treatment of ADHD were contacted
      between 9 and 15 months after the first consultation and responded to a questionnaire
      assessing the evolution.
