  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The optimal way to restore serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D sufficiency is currently debatable. UV
      irradiation through sunshine exposure promotes endogenous vitamin D synthesis, although this
      can also be associated with a risk of UVR-induced skin cancer. Dietary supplements represent
      an alternative, which are increasingly being used in clinical trials to correct deficiency.
      However, it is unclear whether sunshine exposure and vitamin D supplementation induce
      comparable changes in immune function, or whether additional UVR-induced molecules may be
      responsible for proposed health benefits. Several studies report an inverse correlation
      between exposure to UVR and immune-mediated diseases, further supporting the theory that UVR
      may also be protective through non vitamin-D mediated pathways. So far it has been difficult
      to distinguish between immune-regulation by vitamin D and other mediators induced by UVR as
      the downstream effects are similar. A direct comparison of the biological effects of vitamin
      D obtained by UVR versus supplementation has never been made. This study aims to elucidate
      the differences in vitamin D generated by UVR exposure versus supplementation by comparing
      immunological endpoints
