  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with kidney transplant have blood tests very often. This is normally done in
      hospital and using a needle inserted into the vein. Two tests are important for kidney
      transplant patients - creatinine to monitor the health of the kidney; and tacrolimus to
      measure the level of the medicine which prevents rejection. The investigators would like to
      compare a fingerprick microsampling method to the standard venous blood. The fingerprick test
      is the same done by patients with diabetes and we use a microsampling tip which looks like a
      cotton bud to draw up a small amount of blood. Each tip draws up exactly 10 microlitres which
      is two drops. The investigators want to compare the results of creatinine and tacrolimus done
      through the two methods. In the future, this would allow patients to do their creatinine and
      tacrolimus test at home. The tips dry completely and can be posted to a laboratory. We hope
      this will make life easier for transplant patients and also help them engage more with the
      care of their condition.

    <description>When the patients have their bloods done through venepuncture, an additional 5-10mls will be taken (one EDTA bottle for tacrolimus and one serum bottle for creatinine; and two Mitra VAMs). Patients will also have a fingerprick test and 20 microlitres of blood taken using Mitra volumetric absorptive microsampling (VAMs)</description>
