  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a non randomized study to determine the effects of Gentle Jogger(GJ), a passive
      jogging device on oxygen consumption in 2 postures supine and seated. Oxygen consumption
      measurements will be performed via indirect calorimetry in duplicate at rest ( supine and
      seated posture) , and repeated in duplicate during GJ (in supine and seated posture)

      The Gentle Jogger (GJ) is a patented non-FDA regulated wellness device in which GJ; 1) as
      part of a healthy lifestyle may help prevent certain chronic diseases or conditions such as
      heart disease, high blood pressure, and type 2 diabetes and 2) may help living well with
      certain chronic diseases or conditions such as heart disease, high blood pressure and type 2
      diabetes. GJ is a passive simulated jogging device which moves the feet up and down
      passively, simulating jogging. GJ addresses the major health problem of physical inactivity.

      This is a non randomized study of adult subjects on the effects of Gentle Jogger (GJ) on
      resting oxygen consumption (VO2).

      This study will determine whether or not the use of GJ in either sitting or supine postures
      changes resting oxygen consumption, measured using indirect calorimetry method.

      Potential study subjects will be invited to participate, and informed consent obtained from
      each subject.

      Each subject will me asked to lie in supine posture for 20 mins followed by duplicate
      measurements of VO2. The GJ will be started in supine posture for 20 min followed by
      duplicate measurements of VO2. The subject will then be asked to sit in a chair for 20 min,
      followed by duplicate measurement of VO2, The GJ will be started for 20 min in seated posture
      followed by duplicate measurements of VO2.
