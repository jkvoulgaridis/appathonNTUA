  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center, retrospective, observational cohort study to assess the safety and
      efficacy of drug coated balloon (DCB) angioplasty in all forms of coronary artery disease.
      The Investigators intend to report outcomes of all patients who received DCB angioplasty at
      their center during the above mentioned period for up to 10 years.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Investigators expect to assess outcomes of all patients who received Drug Coated Balloon
      Angioplasty treatment, which is a novel therapy as opposed to standard Drug Eluting Stent
      insertion, for all types of coronary artery disease from 01/01/2009 till 31/12/2015 in their
      center. The Investigators believe the number exceeds 1000 patients.

      The Investigators plan to collect demographic and procedural data from their existing data
      base. They will request up to date follow-up events from NICOR (National Institute for
      Cardiovascular Outcomes Research, UK) in 2017(data ending December 2016), by which time all
      patientswould have had minimum of 12 months follow up. The Investigators plan to incorporate
      these findings to their data set and report the comprehensive outcomes. Primary end point
      will be major adverse cardiac outcomes (MACE) defined as a composite of death, myocardial
      infarction and target vessel revascularisation. Secondary end points will be acute vessel
      closure and target lesion revascularisation. The Investigators also have a long term plan of
      requesting follow-up events from NICOR for up to 10 years, so they can report on long term
      outcomes of drug coated balloon treatment.

. Target vessel revascularisation (TVR) A TVR is defined as any repeat percutaneous intervention or surgical bypass of any segment of the target vessel. The latter is defined as the entire major coronary vessel proximal and distal to the target lesion, including upstream and downstream branches and the target lesion itself.</description>

    <description>Acute Vessel Closure Acute vessel closure is defined as an event where a patient had to be taken back to cardiac catheterisation lab and require repeat angioplasty (during the same hospital stay) for a complete or partial occlusion of the artery due to a dissection.
TLR A TLR is defined as any repeat percutaneous intervention of the target lesion or bypass surgery of the target vessel performed for restenosis or other complication of the target lesion. The target lesion is defined as the treated segment from 5 mm proximal and 5 mm distal to the treated lesion (by visual assessment).</description>

    <arm_group_label>Patients treated with DCB angioplasty</arm_group_label>
    <description>Patient cohort is comprised of all patients who received drug coated balloon angioplasty at NNUH during the above period. Within this cohort there will be two main groups which are drug coated balloon (DCB) angioplasty for de novo coronary artery disease (CAD) and DCB angioplasty for ISR/ST. Graft cases will be reported as a small third group.
Outcomes will also be reported for three sub groups of de novo disease group, namely, dcb-only angioplasty for de novo disease, dcb-only angioplasty as primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI) and dcb-only angioplasty group using a DCB with a diameter of 3mm or more in de novo disease.</description>

    <intervention_name>Drug coated balloon angioplasty</intervention_name>
    <description>Drug coated balloons are semi compliant percutaneous coronary angioplasty balloons coated with a chemotherapeutic drug such as Paclitaxel used with an excipient which allows rapid absorption to vessel wall upon balloon expansion for 30-60s. This allows coronary angioplasty without any permanent or semi- permanent stent or scaffold provided there are no vessel threatening dissections or significant acute recoil.</description>
