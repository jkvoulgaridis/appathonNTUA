  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prior research studies have shown benefit for use of a technique called High-resolution,
      relational, resonance-based, electroencephalic mirroring (HIRREM®), to reduce symptoms of
      moderate to severe insomnia. HIRREM uses scalp sensors to monitor brain electrical activity,
      and software algorithms translate selected brain frequencies into audible tones in real time.
      Those tones (acoustic stimulation) are reflected back to participants via ear buds in as
      little as four milliseconds, providing the brain an opportunity to self-adjust and balance
      its electrical pattern.

      The purpose of this research study is to determine the effects of HIRREM-SOP, an updated
      version of this technology that is based on the HIRREM approach, but now includes new
      hardware and software, a standardized series of HIRREM protocols, and a fixed number of
      sessions. Adults over the age of 18 who have documented sleep trouble that place them in the
      category of subthreshold (mild), moderate, or severe clinical insomnia as defined by the
      Insomnia Severity Index, are eligible to participate in the study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      High-resolution, relational, resonance-based, electroencephalic mirroring (HIRREM®) is a
      closed-loop, allostatic, acoustic stimulation neurotechnology that uses software-guided
      algorithmic analysis to identify and translate selected brain frequencies into audible tones
      to support real-time self-optimization of brain activity. Prior research demonstrates that
      the use of HIRREM is associated with reduced symptoms of insomnia, and traumatic stress and
      anxiety, and improved autonomic cardiovascular regulation across heterogeneous cohorts.
      HIRREM has been safe and well tolerated in about 500 people across six IRB-approved studies.
      However, the current in-office HIRREM approach remains very operator dependent (extensive
      Technologist education and experience) and takes a sizeable time commitment from the
      participant (typically ten or more sessions of 90-120 minutes each). To reduce participant
      time required, and operator dependence, while increasing scalability, a new generation of
      hardware and software has been developed. While based on the same core technology and
      algorithms to mirror brainwaves with audible tones, this includes the use of faster, 64-bit
      processing architecture for faster feedback, the use of 4 sensors, and the use of standard
      protocols, all done with eyes closed (HIRREM-SOP). Although only 2 sensors are active at a
      time, applying 4 sensors, for which the software can switch from one pair to the other
      automatically, cuts in half the number of sensor placement changes needed, with reduced
      session time and interruptions. A modified placebo condition now includes random timing and
      pitch of the tones, which have not been acoustically engineered. This pilot study will
      evaluate feasibility of this standardized, enhanced approach, and the effectiveness of
      blinding for the placebo condition in participants with symptoms of insomnia.
