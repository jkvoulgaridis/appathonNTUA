  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT) assessing the
      impact of CBT on neural responses to binge eating stimuli.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Females with a BMI&gt;/=25 kg/m2 and BED will be randomized to either a 16-week, one-on-one CBT
      intervention (n=20) or a waitlist control (WL; n=20). Both groups will have blood oxygen
      level-dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans at baseline and
      after the 16-week intervention. During the scans, participants will complete the following
      tasks: 1) food-specific stop signal task (SST), and 2) script-driven imagery of binge foods.
