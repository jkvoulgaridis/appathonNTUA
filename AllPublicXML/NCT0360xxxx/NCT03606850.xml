  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Depression is a common issue but there is no marker of response to an antidepressant
      treatment.The measurement of variation of the cortical excitability in responders to a
      selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) (compared to no-responders) had never been done
      before. In the study of Robol et al. (2004) concerning the acute effects of citalopram on
      markers of cortical excitability, the authors have pointed out an increase on the cortical
      silent period (CSP) after administration of citalopram (2.5 hours). The investigators
      hypothesize that this effect remains later and that the diminution of cortical excitability
      could be a biomarker of antidepressant response. In this case, they expect that the variation
      of CSP between day 1 and day 28 is higher in responders to a SSRI (citalopram) compared to
      non-responders. the investigators lead a pilot, prospective, multicentric study in drug-naive
      patients to compare the variation of the markers of cortical excitability (the CSP but to the
      resting motor threshold RMT, the motor evoked potential MEP, the intra-cortical inhibition
      ICI and the intra-cortical facilitation ICF) between day 1 and day 28 in responders to
      citalopram, compared to non-responders.
