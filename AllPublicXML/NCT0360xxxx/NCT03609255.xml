  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A recent review indicated that sedentary behavior has been associated with increased
      morbidity and mortality but the intervention studies frequently focus only on changing
      sedentary behavior (reducing sedentary time) without measuring health-associated outcomes.
      Elevated cortisol (related to stress) has been linked with health risks. Improved physical
      fitness has been linked with improved cortisol responses to psychosocial stressors. In
      addition, increased physical activity induced favorable effects upon low density lipoprotein,
      high density lipoprotein, and total cholesterol. Previous study also indicated that
      increasing daily steps have positive effect on blood glucose in people with impaired glucose
      tolerance. Ultimately, the investigators think that sedentary intervention and stress
      management may have benefits on these health indicators. As such the investigators will
      examine whether sedentary intervention or stress management can have positive effect on human
      health by measuring salivary cortisol, blood lipid profile, fasting blood glucose, blood
      pressure, resting energy expenditure, and body composition.
