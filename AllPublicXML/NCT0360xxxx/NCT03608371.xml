  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and
      efficacy of BTRX-246040 in subjects with PD who have motor fluctuations and predictable early
      morning off periods.

      Study treatment is 1 day and total duration of the study is up to 36 days, including an
      approximate 28-day screening period. The study will consist of 4 sequential, ascending dose
      cohorts of 8 subjects each with a 6:2 randomization to BTRX-246040 or placebo. The planned
      dosing for each cohort will be 40, 80,120 and 160 mg. After enrollment of the first cohort
      has been completed, doses for subsequent cohorts may be modified based on review of the
      available data (safety, tolerability, efficacy, and PK) by an unblinded Dosing Review
      Committee (DRC). A similar review and determination of dosing for the subsequent cohort will
      be performed after completion of each cohort and based on all data available from previous
      cohorts.

      Subjects who meet entry criteria assessed at the screening visit (up to 28 days prior to Day
      1) will present to the clinic on the morning of Day 1 (treatment day) in the practically
      defined OFF state (having withheld anti-parkinsonian medications after 10:00 PM the evening
      prior). Subjects will be dosed with study drug and remain on site for an 8-hour observation
      period with UPDRS Part III motor response, dyskinesia rating and ON/OFF status assessed
      pre-dose, every 30 minutes for 4 hours post-dose, and then hourly for 4 additional post-dose
      hours (i.e., 8 hours total post-dose) prior to being discharged. Blood for pharmacokinetics
      will be collected 6 times at scheduled intervals within the 8-hour observation period. A
      follow-up safety visit is scheduled 7 days later.

        significant abnormalities (i.e., laboratory deviations requiring acute medical intervention
        or further medical evaluation) in laboratory results at screening including clinical
        chemistries, hematology, and urinalysis, that, in the judgment of the Investigator, should
        preclude a subject's participation at study entry.

        Investigator, are clinically significant related to the subject's participation

        to determine eligibility when in doubt):

          1. proton pump inhibitors within 5 half-lives of Screening

        Have participated in a clinical trial or any other type of medical research judged by the
        Investigator to be scientifically or medically incompatible with this study within 30 days

        eligibility when in doubt.
