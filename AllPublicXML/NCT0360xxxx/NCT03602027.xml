      The purpose of this clinical study is to evaluate the tolerability and toxicity of different
      dose of Anlotinib puls Gefitinib in First-line Treatment of Advanced Gene Positive
      Non-squamous Non-small Cell Lung Cancer , to provide a reference of dosage for Phase II
      clinical trials

    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, single -center study conducted in China to compare the tolerability and
      toxicity of different dose of Anlotinib Plus Gefitinib in patients of Advanced GenePositive
      Non-squamous Non-small Cell Lung Cancer.From low dose group up to high dose group, each one
      had 3 patients at least.Primary group received anlotinib 8mg. The dose of Anlotinib would
      increase gradually until MTD. Eligible patients were instructed to take Gefitinib 250mg
      orally daily for three weeks and 8mg/10mg/12mg Anlotinib orally daily on day 1 to 14 of a
      21-day cycle.

    <description>This study will include a sequential evaluation of 3 subjects per dose group. low-dose groups: Anlotinib 8mg per day and Gefitinib. middle-dose groups: Anlotinib 10mg per day and Gefitinib. high-dose groups: Anlotinib 12mg per day and Gefitinib.
A dose limiting toxicity (DLT) event is defined as any of the following events:
CTCAE Grade 4 event (ANC&lt;1000/ul, body temperature≥38.5°C);
Grade 3 non-hematologic toxicity (except for nausea and vomiting that could be improved with optimal supportive care, escalation of alkaline phosphatase) If a DLT is experienced in any dose group, the cohort will be expanded to 6 subjects. If 2 DLTs are experienced in any dose group, the dose escalation ceased. The MTD was defined as the dose having at most two out of six patients experience DLT.</description>
