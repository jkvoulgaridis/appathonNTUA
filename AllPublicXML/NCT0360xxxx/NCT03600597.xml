  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study was to determine construct validity, discriminant validity and intra-
      and interrater reliability of the Selective Control of the Upper Extremity Scale (SCUES).

      This study included children diagnosed with unilateral cerebral palsy. Children's upper
      extremity-selective motor controls were evaluated by video recording. Manual Ability
      Classification System and Taylor Hand Function Test were used to determine upper extremity
      functions

    <description>SCUES administration required patients to perform specific isolated movement patterns at the shoulder (abduction/adduction), elbow (flexion/extension), forearm (supination/pronation), wrist (flexion/extension), and fingers/ thumb (grasp/release). Presence of mirror movements, movement of additional joints and motion less than available ROM are graded for movement at each joint level. Motion at each of the five joint levels is graded on a four-point scale: no SMC, moderately diminished SMC, mildly diminished SMC, and normal SMC.</description>

    <description>The JTT measures movement, speed and manual dexterity. The subtests to assess hand function included turning over cards, simulated feeding, picking up small common objects, stacking checkers, picking up large objects, and picking up large heavy objects. Each task completion time was limited to 2 minutes.</description>
