    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of centanafadine
      sustained-release tablets, administered twice daily in the treatment of adults with ADHD.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This open-label study will assess the overall safety and tolerability of 400 mg total daily
      dose centanafadine sustained-release tablets in subjects, over the course of approximately 52
      weeks. This study will accept rollover subjects from both the 405-201-00013 and 405-201-00014
      trials. For individuals that did not participate in one of the studies mentioned above, they
      will be able to enroll if they meet the inclusion criteria as outlined below.

        De Novo Subjects [De Novo Enrollment has ended 20Sep2019. Only enrolling Rollover subjects
        at this time.]

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  De novo subjects must meet the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders,
             Fifth Edition (DSM-5) criteria for ADHD (including predominantly inattentive
             presentation, hyperactive presentation, or combined presentation) as confirmed by the
             Adult ADHD Clinical Diagnostic Scale (ACDS) Version 1.2. To confirm that ADHD is the
             primary diagnosis, the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) will be
             used to identify and exclude other psychiatric conditions which would preclude
             enrollment.

          -  Subjects are 18 to 55 years of age, inclusive, at the time of consent.

          -  Subjects have BMI of 18 to 40, inclusive

          -  Subjects are willing to discontinue all prohibited psychotropic medications starting
             from the time of signing the informed consent and up to the 10-day safety follow-up
             period.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has a DSM-5 diagnosis of Other Specified or Unspecified
             Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder as confirmed by ACDS Version 1.2.

          -  Subject has a current comorbid psychiatric disorder that is either controlled with
             medications prohibited in this trial or is uncontrolled and associated with
             significant symptoms, including but not limited to: a current major depressive episode
             (per DSM-5 criteria), current symptoms (past 90 days) meeting the DSM-5 criteria for a
             diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, panic
             disorder, or posttraumatic stress disorder, as established by the MINI. NOTE: Subjects
             with mild mood or anxiety symptoms that do not meet criteria for diagnosis, who do not
             require treatment based on the Investigator's assessment, and do not confound efficacy
             or safety assessments in the opinion of the examining Investigator, may be included.

          -  Subjects that have a positive alcohol test (via breathalyzer or blood), a positive
             drug screen for cocaine, or other illicit drugs (excluding marijuana). Subjects with a
             positive drug screen for confirmed prescription medications at baseline will not be
             permitted to continue participation in Trial 405-201-00015. NOTE: Subjects that tested
             positive for marijuana may be permitted to be enrolled if they have no evidence of a
             substance use disorder, and if they agree to refrain from use for the duration of the
             trial. Allowance for subjects testing positive for marijuana at screening require
             explicit approval from the medical monitor.

        Rollover Subjects

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who completed the double-blind treatment period and 7-day follow-up after
             last dose of investigational medicinal product (IMP) in double-blind trials and who,
             in the opinion of the investigator, could potentially benefit from centanafadine for
             ADHD.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who, during the double-blind phase 3 trial experienced, in the opinion of the
             investigator, poor tolerability to trial medication or whose safety assessments
             resulted in new concerns that would suggest the subject may not be appropriate for a
             52-week treatment with trial medication.

          -  Subjects who have re-initiated any therapy for adult ADHD during the 7-day follow-up
             period after the final treatment visit of the double-blind phase 3 trial.

          -  Subjects that have a positive alcohol test (via breathalyzer or blood), a positive
             drug screen for cocaine, or other illicit drugs (excluding marijuana). Subjects with a
             positive drug screen for confirmed prescription medications at baseline will not be
             permitted to continue participation in Trial 405-201-00015. NOTE: Subjects that test
             positive for marijuana may not be permitted to rollover into the open label study, and
             must agree to refrain from use for the duration of the open label trial. Allowance for
             subjects testing positive for marijuana at time of rollover requires explicit approval
             from the medical monitor.
