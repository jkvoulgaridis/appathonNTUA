    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the effects on placebo-corrected change from baseline
      QT interval corrected for individual heart rate (QTcI) of JNJ-64565111 close to steady state
      on Day 26 and on electrocardiogram morphology at supratherapeutic exposures in otherwise
      healthy overweight/obese adults after 4 weeks of treatment with JNJ 64565111 administered
      subcutaneously once weekly.
