  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study is designed to characterize the safety and efficacy of a new extravascular
      implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) system in humans.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will recruit male and female adult subjects that meet all of the inclusion criteria
      and none of the exclusion criteria. All subjects will be indicated to receive an ICD.

      The EV ICD system will be implanted and the subjects will be followed for at least 3 months
      following implantation of the system.

      Subjects will be exited after follow-up is completed.

    <time_frame>At Implant</time_frame>
    <description>Each subject will demonstrate a successful defibrillation outcome if either 2 successive induced ventricular fibrillation episodes are terminated by the subject's device delivering a shock at the required energy level, or if one such episode is successfully terminated by the subject's device delivering a shock at a lower energy level. Up to 5 such episodes may be induced to test device efficacy.</description>
