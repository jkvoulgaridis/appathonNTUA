  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is an open-label, non-randomized study to evaluate rate and severity of
      infusion-related reactions (IRRs) of ocrelizumab infused over a shorter time period than the
      approved administration rate in participants with PPMS or RMS in the United States (U.S.).
      Participants will be enrolled into two cohorts. Cohort 1 will examine the effect of
      administering ocrelizumab per a shorter infusion protocol for Dose 2 or Dose 3. This cohort
      will consist of patients who have already received one or two doses of ocrelizumab according
      to the approved infusion protocol (i.e., per the currently U.S. label) and have reported no
      serious IRRs and who will then receive the next infusion of ocrelizumab at a higher rate in
      order to deliver 600 mg over the course of approximately 2 hours. Cohort 2 will examine the
      effect of administering ocrelizumab per a shorter infusion protocol for the second infusion
      of Dose 1. This cohort will consist of ocrelizumab naïve patients who, after receiving
      Infusion 1/Dose 1 of ocrelizumab at the approved rate (300 mg over approximately 2.5 hours or
      longer) have no reported serious IRRs, will then receive the second 300-mg shorter infusion
      over approximately 1.5 hours.
