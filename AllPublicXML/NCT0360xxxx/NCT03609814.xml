  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fludarabine and clofarabine are chemotherapy drugs used extensively in bone marrow
      transplantation. The goal of this study is to determine what causes some children to have
      different drug concentrations of clofarabine and fludarabine in their bodies and if drug
      levels are related to whether or not a child experiences severe side-effects during their
      bone marrow transplant. The hypothesis is that clinical and individual factors cause changes
      in clofarabine and fludarabine drug levels in pediatric bone marrow transplant patients and
      that high levels may cause severe side-effects.

      Fludarabine and clofarabine are nucleoside analogs with potent antitumor and
      immunosuppressive properties used in conditioning regimens of pediatric allogeneic
      hematopoietic cell transplantation (alloHCT) to promote stem cell engraftment.

      This is a single-center, prospective, non-interventional pharmacokinetic (PK) study
      investigating the clinical pharmacology of combination nucleoside analogue therapy in 24
      children undergoing alloHCT at UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital.

      Patients would receive clofarabine and fludarabine regardless of whether or not they decide
      to consent to PK sampling.

      Clofarabine and fludarabine doses will not be adjusted based on PK data.

      The investigators will apply the combination of a limited sampling strategy and population PK
      methodologies to determine specific factors influencing clofarabine and fludarabine exposure
      in pediatric alloHCT recipients and identify exposure-response relationships.

      Subjects will undergo PK sampling of clofarabine and fludarabine drug concentrations over the
      duration of combination therapy (3 to 5 days).

      To evaluate sources of variability impacting clofarabine and fludarabine exposure clinical
      data will be obtained from the patient's medical chart on each day of PK sampling.

      To assess exposure-response relationships neutrophil engraftment, treatment-related toxicity,
      and survival data will be collected through day 100 post-transplant.

        The target population for the proposed study includes children 0-17 years of age undergoing
        alloHCT for the treatment of malignant and nonmalignant disorders. Patients receiving
        clofarabine and fludarabine over 3 to 5 days are eligible to participate. All patients
        enrolled in this study will undergo PK sampling on the inpatient pediatric BMT unit at UCSF
        Benioff Children's Hospital. The proposed research will not study any patients receiving
        clofarabine and fludarabine in a clinic or any other out-patient setting.
