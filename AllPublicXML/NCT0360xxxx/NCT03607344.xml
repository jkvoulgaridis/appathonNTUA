      Facing the stakes of hospital beds, this study assessed day case variant technic of
      laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy with or without robotic assistant.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pelvic organ prolapse (POP) is an increasingly common functional disorder which affects
      approximately 40% of female population. Of these 12% are symptomatic and suffer of physical
      and emotional distress. 11% will undergo a surgical procedure. Since its introduction by Lane
      in 1982, Sacrocolpopexy (SCP) became the surgical &quot;gold standard&quot; for correcting vaginal
      vault .

      With minimal invasive approach, SCP had an mean hospitalization time of 3 to 7 days .

      With rising health care cost and its inherent economic burden, safe and viable options to
      reduce cost must be sought.

      Day case surgery has developed rapidly in the USA since the 1970s, and has spread to Europe,
      especially in Great Britain. But the High Authority of Health in France found a delay in its
      development.

      In view of the evolution of surgical and anesthetic techniques, and the low complication rate
      of SCP, it seemed natural to imagine that this intervention could be done in an ambulatory
      setting.

        The study cohort is selected from the investigators institution. All consecutive patients
        undergoing ambulatory laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy performed by two experimented urologist
        surgeons at the investigators university hospital, with an ambulatory department, was
        enrolled.
