  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the safety (clinical and biological) and
      pharmacokinetics (plasma and urine) profile of P03277 following single administration at
      ascending dose levels in healthy subjects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This single-center, single ascending dose, phase I/IIa study was divided into 2 parts,
      involving both healthy subjects and patients with brain lesions:

        -  Study Part I included healthy subjects: double-blind, randomized, placebo control;

        -  Study Part II included patients with brain lesions: open-label.

      In Part I, the following 6 dosing groups were investigated:

        -  Group 1: 0.025 mmol/kg

        -  Group 2: 0.05 mmol/kg

        -  Group 3: 0.075 mmol/kg

        -  Group 4: 0.1 mmol/kg

        -  Group 5: 0.2 mmol/kg

        -  Group 6: 0.3 mmol/kg

      Healthy subjects were included and were then administered with P03277 or placebo and were to
      undergo MRI examination according to the randomization scheme.

      In Part II, the following 4 doses groups were investigated:

        -  Group 7: 0.05 mmol/kg

        -  Group 8: 0.075 mmol/kg

        -  Group 9: 0.1 mmol/kg

        -  Group 10: 0.2 mmol/kg

      Patients with brain lesions were included and were then administered with P03277 and
      underwent MRI examination.
