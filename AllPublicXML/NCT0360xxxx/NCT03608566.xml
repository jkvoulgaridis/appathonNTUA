    <textblock>
      The Russian Severe Asthma Registry is a Russian initiative to collect anonymous long-term
      evidence for patients with severe asthma in Russia. The RSAR initiative is realized under the
      efforts of the Interregional Public Organization &quot;Russian Respiratory Society&quot; and LLC &quot;RSMI&quot;
      with the sponsorship of &quot;AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals&quot; LLC.

      The developed RSAR electronic database is a Russian software product that meets the current
      requirements of the Russian legislation in the field of working with personal data and the
      implementation of similar observational studies.

      Participating researchers also agree to grant access and share anonymous data at the patient
      level as part of the work to implement the RSAR initiative. Participants will provide
      high-quality data for the development of data sets for research, approved by the Russian
      Respiratory Society (RPO), which has priority in owning and implementation in scientific
      field of the gained data. Based on ethical, legal and regulatory authorizations, anonymous
      data will be collected in the Central Database (CDB) on respiratory diseases (referred to
      here as the RSAR database) to create sets of important data and the necessary analysis. CDB
      is part of the software &quot;Medical online platform ROSMED.INFO&quot;.

    <description>• Parameters of the analysis of the questionnaire ACQ-6 in patients with severe asthma at the time of study enrollment (medians, percentilies); THE ASTHMA CONTROL QUESTIONNAIRE (ACQ) The ACQ has 6 questions. In questions 1-6, patients recall their experiences during the previous 7 days and respond using a 6-point scale (0=totally controlled to 6=extremely poorly controlled).
INTERPRETING ACQ SCORES Patients with a score of 0.75 or lower have adequately controlled asthma. Between 0.75 and 1.5 is a grey area where patients are on the borderline of adequate control. Scores over 1.5 are a strong indication of inadequate control. If a patient's score increases or decreases by greater than 0.5 between assessments, the change can be considered clinically important (justifying a change in treatment).
SHORT-ACTING β2 AGONIST (SABA) USE NOT AVAILABLE If patients do not use a SABA, question 6 may be omitted and the mean score calculated using questions 1-5 (total score / 5).</description>

    <time_frame>03.2020 till 11.2022</time_frame>
    <description>Parameters of the analysis of the questionnaire ACQ-6 in patients with severe asthma at the 2 year of follow-up (medians, percentilies); THE ASTHMA CONTROL QUESTIONNAIRE (ACQ) The ACQ has 6 questions. In questions 1-6, patients recall their experiences during the previous 7 days and respond using a 6-point scale (0=totally controlled to 6=extremely poorly controlled).
INTERPRETING ACQ SCORES Patients with a score of 0.75 or lower have adequately controlled asthma. Between 0.75 and 1.5 is a grey area where patients are on the borderline of adequate control. Scores over 1.5 are a strong indication of inadequate control. If a patient's score increases or decreases by greater than 0.5 between assessments, the change can be considered clinically important (justifying a change in treatment).
SHORT-ACTING β2 AGONIST (SABA) USE NOT AVAILABLE If patients do not use a SABA, question 6 may be omitted and the mean score calculated using questions 1-5 (total score / 5).</description>
