  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Participants with neurological disorders will be recruited to complete sessions of virtual
      reality (VR) immersion. VR has been shown to have therapeutic benefit in certain patient
      populations and requires further clinical study to determine the extent to which VR can be
      used to rehabilitate and reduce symptom burden. This study seeks to pilot newly developed VR
      methods and collect preliminary data in order to support research grants and inform larger
      clinical trials. Additionally, this proposed study will explore the tolerability and
      preliminary efficacy of Virtual Reality (VR), specifically to determine whether VR can
      acutely reduce the severity of symptom burden caused by neurological disorders.
