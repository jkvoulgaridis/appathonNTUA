  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators want to compare the safety and efficacy between the combined
      spinal-epidural analgesia and epidural analgesia during labor.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants who request neuraxial labor analgesia are randomized to receive combined
      spinal-epidural analgesia or epidural analgesia during labor. The investigators collect the
      data on the duration of three stages of labor, the mode of delivery, neonatal Apgar scores,
      VAS scores, modified Bromage scores.

    <intervention_model_description>Participants who request neuraxial labor analgesia are randomly assigned into two groups by a computer-generated random number table using Excel. One group received combined spinal-epidural analgesia during labor, the other group received epidural analgesia during labor.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>One anesthetist who were not involved with clinical care or data collection performed the randomization procedure and the neuraxial block according to the group allocation. The other anesthetist blinds to the procedure preform the analgesia management after neuraxial block. This anesthetist and the obstetrician, the midwives, the patients , the outcomes collector and assessor are all blind to group allocation throughout.</masking_description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>1 minute and 5 minutes Apgar scores</measure>
    <time_frame>1 min after delivery, 5 min after delivery.</time_frame>
    <description>Neonatal Apgar scores at the first and fifth minute.The score indicates the infant s' conditions, including heart rate, breathing, muscle tone, reflex response, color. Each characteristic is given an individual score; two points for each of the five categories if all is completely well; then all scores are totaled. The score is from 0 to 10.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Visual Analogue Scores(VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>At 5min before analgesia; at 5min, 15min, 30min, 1h after the first dose of analgesic drugs； at cervical dilation of 3cm , 6cm and 10cm; at the time of birth of infant; at the time of delivery of placenta.</time_frame>
    <description>VAS is the most common pain scale for quantification. The score is higher, the patient will be more painful. That will indicate if the analgesia is effective. Visual analog scale (VAS) ranging from 0 to 10 (with 10 representing the worst pain imaginable) to measure the degree of pain for participants.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Modified Bromage scores</measure>
    <time_frame>At 5min before analgesia; at 5min, 15min, 30min, 1h after the first dose of analgesic drugs； at the cervical dilation of 3cm , 6cm and 10cm; at the time of birth of infant; at the time of delivery of placenta.</time_frame>
    <description>The modified Bromage score is the most frequently used measure of motor block. In this scale, the intensity of motor block is assessed by the patient's ability to move their lower extremities(0: no motor paralysis; 1: inability to raise extended leg, but able to move knee and foot; 2: inability to raise extended leg and to move knee, but able to move foot; 3: inability to raise extended leg or to move knee and foot).</description>

    <description>The combined spinal epidural analgesia technique was used to maintain analgesia for parturients in the combined spinal-epidural analgesia group. First, the investigator injected a dose of 5 ug sufentanil into cerebrospinal fluid. If no adverse effects were observed 10 minutes after the first dose, the parturient then received mixed liquids of 0.075% ropivacaine and 0.2ug/ml sufentanil citrate through a patient-controlled epidural analgesia (PCA) pump, which provided patients themixed solution at 8-10ml/h to optimize their pain relief until the delivery of neonates.</description>

    <description>The epidural analgesia technique was used to maintain analgesia for parturients in the epidural analgesia group, which involved placing a thin catheter through a needle inserted into the epidural space. First, the investigator injected a test dose of 5ml 1% lidocaine through it. If not adverse effects were observed 10 minutes after the test dose, the parturient then received a bolus injection of an initial dose of 8-10 ml mixed liquids of 0.075% ropivacaine and 0.2ug/ml sufentanil citrate. We then connected the catheter with a patient-controlled epidural analgesia (PCA) pump, which provided patients the same mixed solution at 8-10ml/h to optimize their pain relief until the delivery of neonates.</description>
