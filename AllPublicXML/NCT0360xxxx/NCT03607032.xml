  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Secretive (or obstructive), acute or chronic pathologies are common in an increasing number
      of elderly patients. The medical teams are confronted with difficulties in the management of
      these patients: they do not benefit from optimal respiratory physiotherapy, whether manual or
      mechanical, due to functional deficiencies, cognitive functions that are sometimes limited or
      poorly adapted equipment.

      The objective of this pilot study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a new RespinPAD device
      in the bronchial de-encapsulation of elderly patients who cannot benefit from optimal
      physiotherapy compared to conventional treatment (nasal or bucco-tracheal aspiration and
      aerosols).

      The study will include 20 non-dementia patients and 20 dementia patients who will benefit
      from the use of RespinPAD and 20 patients who will benefit from conventional therapy. All the
      patients included will be over 70 years old and will be recruited when they are admitted to
      hospital in the geriatric hospital of the CHU de Nice. They will be included if they present
      a bronchial obstruction secondary to a respiratory pathology secreting whatever the etiology
      and for which optimal respiratory physiotherapy is not possible after evaluation by a
      physiotherapist.

      Patients using the RespinPAD device will benefit from a 20-minute session twice daily for 5
      days.

      The primary endpoint (quantitative criterion) will be the measurement of oxygen consumption
      (VO2) and carbon dioxide production (VCO2) volumes for each patient included before and after
      each session of RespinPAD use or conventional treatment for the control group.

      Secondary judging criteria will be a heteroassessment of the SEVA (Airway Overcrowding
      Score), the Borg Scale and the Algoplus or Digital Comfort Scale. For the effectiveness
      assessment, the SEVA score will allow for a qualitative assessment to complement the primary
      endpoint. The collection of volumes of secretions, pulse oximeter, mean length of stay, O2
      withdrawal time and drug aerosols will also be used to compare results with previous studies.
      With regard to secondary safety and feasibility criteria, hemodynamic constants,
      electrocardiogram and the actual duration of the sessions will be recorded.
