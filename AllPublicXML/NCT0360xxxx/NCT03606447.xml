      The purpose of the study is to measure how the radiolabelled test medicine [14C]-Uproleselan
      (GMI-1271) is taken up, broken down and removed from the body when given intravenously (into
      a vein) in a group of 6 males. 'Radiolabelled' means that the test medicine has a radioactive
      component which helps us to track where the drug is in the body. Blood urine and fecal
      samples will be collected at specific times throughout the study to measure amounts of the
      test medicine in the body.
