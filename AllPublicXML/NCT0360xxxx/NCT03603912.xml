  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to perform a prospective, randomized study for the reduction of
      atrial fibrillation (AF) burden and progression, targeting metabolic upstream therapies. The
      study aims to determine if metformin and/or lifestyle/risk factor modifications reduce AF
      burden and progression. A secondary aim will attempt to determine clinical, genomic, and
      biomarker predictors of AF progression that can be used to personalize upstream therapies.
      This is a prospective randomized open-label blinded endpoint (PROBE) 2x2 factorial study of
      metformin extended release up to 750 mg twice daily and lifestyle and risk factor
      modification (LRFM) in patients with implanted pacemakers or defibrillators with atrial leads
      and at least 1 ≥5 minute episode of AF over the prior 3 months.
