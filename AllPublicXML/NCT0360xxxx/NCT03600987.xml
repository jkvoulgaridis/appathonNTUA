  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this investigation is to examine the evidence on emotion, language, and music,
      and propose a first step, in the form of a single-subject research design, to determine the
      most effective and efficient method for application to the rehabilitation of patients with
      aphasia. A single-subject adapted alternating treatment design will be used to compare two
      music conditions, using music with sung lyrics simultaneously with reading of the lyrics, and
      priming with music and sung lyrics followed by a reading of the lyrics, with a control
      condition using reading lyrics without music. Results are expected to provide evidence of
      independent versus shared processing of music and language at the phrase level applied to the
      behavior of human subjects with aphasia.

      Quality assurance plan that addresses data validation and registry procedures, including any
      plans for site monitoring and auditing.

      Data checks to compare data entered into the registry against predefined rules for range or
      consistency with other data fields in the registry.

      Data verification to assess the accuracy, completeness, or representativeness of data by
      comparing the data to external data sources (reliability) Data dictionary: detailed
      descriptions of each variable Standard Operating Procedures: patient recruitment, data
      collection, data management, data analysis, reporting for adverse events change management.
      Sample size: A minimum of four participants will be required to demonstrate replication of
      treatment effects. A maximum of ten participants will be requested to account for attrition.

      Plan for missing data, data inconsistency,or out-of-range results. Statistical analysis plan
      describing the analytical principles and statistical techniques to be employed in order to
      address the primary and secondary objectives, as specified in the study protocol or plan.
