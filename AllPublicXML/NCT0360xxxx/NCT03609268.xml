  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prognosis of small liver cancer (≤5 cm) who had underwent stereotactic body radiotherapy
      (SBRT) is encouraging, with the 1-year local control rate has been reported to be 95-100%,
      3-year local control rate about 91%, 3-year overall survival rate around 70%. Local ablation
      therapy has become the standard treatment for recurrent liver cancer after surgery and
      interventional treatment. The ablation rate of tumors with a diameter of 3.1-5.0 cm reached
      90%. The 1, 2, and 3-year survival rates had been reported to be 89%, 74%, and 60%,
      respectively, which is similar to that of surgical resection. At present, there is no
      randomized controlled study of SBRT and microwave ablation (MWA) for small liver cancer. It
      is hoped that this study will further compare the efficacy of SBRT and MWA for recurrent
      small hepatocellular carcinoma.

      Recurrent small hepatocellular carcinoma after surgery or local ablation therapy are chose
      for this study. The patients are divided into two groups randomly. Patients in group A
      receive MWA, group B patients receive SBRT. The 3-year progression free survival, 3-year
      local recurrence free survival, 3-year overall survival and other endpoints events were
      recorded and analyzed, to assess whether SBRT is non-inferior to MWA.
