  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a multi-site, group sequential, adaptive, randomized, double-masked, 2×2
      crossover design, 1-week dispensing study. Subjects will wear bilaterally both Test and
      Control lenses in a random order for 1-week each as a daily disposable modality with a
      wash-out period of 1 week between the wearing periods.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    This study was terminated due to the released lenses not representing what will be made
    commercially available and thus the objectives could not be met

    <description>Subjective assessment of comfort will be performed using the Contact Lens User ExperienceTM (CLUE) questionnaire. CLUE is a validated patient reported outcomes (PRO) questionnaire used to assess patient experience attributes of soft contact lenses (comfort, vision, handling, and packaging) in a US contact-lens wearing population between 18 and 65 years of age. CLUE composite scores are derived using Item Response Theory (IRT) and follow a normal distribution with a population average score of 60 (SD 20), where higher scores indicate a more favorable/positive response. A 5-point increase in an average CLUE score translates into 10% shift in the distribution of scores for the population of soft disposable contact lens wearers.</description>

        <title>Overall Comfort Scores</title>
        <description>Subjective assessment of comfort will be performed using the Contact Lens User ExperienceTM (CLUE) questionnaire. CLUE is a validated patient reported outcomes (PRO) questionnaire used to assess patient experience attributes of soft contact lenses (comfort, vision, handling, and packaging) in a US contact-lens wearing population between 18 and 65 years of age. CLUE composite scores are derived using Item Response Theory (IRT) and follow a normal distribution with a population average score of 60 (SD 20), where higher scores indicate a more favorable/positive response. A 5-point increase in an average CLUE score translates into 10% shift in the distribution of scores for the population of soft disposable contact lens wearers.</description>

          <description>Subjective assessment of comfort will be performed using the Contact Lens User ExperienceTM (CLUE) questionnaire. CLUE is a validated patient reported outcomes (PRO) questionnaire used to assess patient experience attributes of soft contact lenses (comfort, vision, handling, and packaging) in a US contact-lens wearing population between 18 and 65 years of age. CLUE composite scores are derived using Item Response Theory (IRT) and follow a normal distribution with a population average score of 60 (SD 20), where higher scores indicate a more favorable/positive response. A 5-point increase in an average CLUE score translates into 10% shift in the distribution of scores for the population of soft disposable contact lens wearers.</description>

      <restrictive_agreement>The only disclosure restriction on the PI is that the sponsor can review results communications prior to public release and can embargo communications regarding trial results for a period that is more than 60 days but less than or equal to 180 days. The sponsor cannot require changes to the communication and cannot extend the embargo.</restrictive_agreement>
    </certain_agreements>
    <limitations_and_caveats>This study was terminated after additional lens metrology testing revealed that the lens thickness of the contact lenses were thinner than the lens design targets. This reduction in thickness may have altered the handling of the contact lenses.</limitations_and_caveats>
