  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study is a randomized study of actively smoking veterans cared for at the Miami
      VA Medical Center. Subjects are randomized into 2 groups and will all receive a regimen of
      nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) standardized to their smoking habit. Subjects are followed
      biweekly for smoking cessation by using biochemical tests (exCO and COHb) to determine
      smoking abstinence. The first group called the Banked-Money Group will have $50 placed in a
      'bank account' for every clinic visit where their tests reveal abstinence from smoking. As a
      modified commitment contract, the Banked-Money Group can only withdraw the accrued money at
      the end of the trial if they complete the trial by quitting smoking for the entire 6 months.
      The second group called the Reward Group will directly receive $50 for every clinic visit
      where their tests reveal abstinence from smoking.
