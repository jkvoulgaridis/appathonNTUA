  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Reconstruction of the aortic valve using the tri-leaflet repair technique is non-inferior
      with regard to effective orifice area (EOA) to surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) with
      a biological prosthesis (St. Jude Trifecta GT) as gold- standard.
