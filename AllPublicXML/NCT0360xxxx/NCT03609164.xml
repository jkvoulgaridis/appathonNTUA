  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are several associated structural changes when dealing with massive rotator cuff
      repair, which include tendon retraction and fragility, muscle atrophy and fatty infiltration,
      as well as osteoporosis over the tendon insertion. Those changes may lead to difficult in
      applying double-row repair, suture cutting through the tendon, too much tension over the
      repair and loosening or pull-out of anchors, which may results in poor tendon-bone healing
      and subsequent high re-tear rate. Therefore decreasing the tension over the repair site may
      increase the healing over tendon bone junction as well as decrease the risk of anchors
      loosening. A suture-spanning augmentation with two set of suture loops passing over
      musculotendinous junction medially and fixed with anchor at the lateral cortical wall may
      solve the problem. In order to define the clinical benefit of this adjuvant procedure, a
      prospective randomized control study is designed to compare the adjunctive reinforce suture
      with the single-row simple suture repair in massive rotator cuff tear.

      Around sixty patients were randomized divided into two groups. The study group was used
      adjunctive reinforce suture repair technique, which was one lateral cortical anchor holding 2
      separated set of transverse looping sutures over the medial musculotendinous junction in
      addition to single row repair, while the control group was used single row repair technique
      in simple stitch fashion. All patients will have clinical evaluation in pain (VAS score) and
      functional recovery (ASES and UCLA score) as well as MRI image for the tendon integrity.

      If the suture-spanning augmentation of single-row repair can yield an improved healing rate
      and fewer complications, massive rotator cuff tear should be repaired earlier in order to
      prevent the late development of irreparable tear.
