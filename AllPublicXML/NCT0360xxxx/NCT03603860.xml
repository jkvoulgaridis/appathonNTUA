  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this clinical study the investigators will compare blood pressure measurements obtained
      using the non-invasive, continuous and wireless Biobeat monitoring device (a wrist watch or a
      patch configuration) to an invasive arterial line (radial or femoral) in 30 patients
      immediately after cardiac surgery, at the intensive care unit.

      The Biobeat non-invasive, continuous and wireless monitoring device is based on
      photoplethysmograph technology. It measures several vital signs, including blood pressure,
      stroke volume, pulse rate, pulse pressure, heart rate variability, respiratory rate,
      saturation, cardiac output, cardiac index, and more. The data is transmitted to Biobeat's
      application (in both Apple and Google Play), and is available on the individual's cellular
      phone, tablet, or as a full monitoring system in a hospital department. The aim of this study
      is to compare the Biobeat monitor with the invasive method of blood pressure measurement, an
      arterial line. The study population includes 30 patients undergoing cardiac surgery. As per
      local protocol, each one of the participants will come out from the operating room with an
      arterial line. Once in the intensive care unit, the investigators will attach the Biobeat
      non-invasive monitor (either wrist watch or a patch, these two configurations are identical
      in terms of the monitoring system), and monitor the participants for 4 hours. Though both
      methods are continuous, the investigators will record the vital signs every 15 minutes during
      the 4 hours of the study.

        30 patients immediately after cardiac surgery arriving to the intensive care unit, and
        connected to an arterial line transducer. Usually the arterial line is left for 24 hours.
        Right after arrival and once connected to an arterial line, the participants will be
        connected to the Biobeat monitor (either wrist watch or a patch). Vital signs will be
        monitored for 4 hours, and recorded every 15 minutes, for comparison. After 4 hours, the
        Biobeat monitor will be disconnected.
