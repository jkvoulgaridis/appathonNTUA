  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the proposed pilot project, MRI data will be prospectively collected to show the
      feasibility of the segmentation algorithm and the potential relation to final lead
      positioning. Patients will be selected from those undergoing GPi DBS placement. This pilot
      data will serve as a basis for pursuing funding for a larger trial evaluating the prospective
      ability of the 3T targeting study to improve outcomes and decrease complications in GPi DBS
      placement. Improved outcomes and patient experience would be expected to further contribute
      to our facility as a center of excellence for treatment of movement disorders.

    <description>Patients selected to undergo GPi DBS placement will be eligible for enrollment in the study. In addition to standard-of-care tests, subjects will undergo an MRI consisting of the proposed novel imaging protocol prior to placement of DBS. The patient will subsequently undergo standard-of-care therapy for DBS placement. Once the stimulator has been programmed post-operatively, the stimulation parameters and corresponding clinical changes will be collected and used to model the volume of activated tissue. The patient will additionally undergo a follow-up MRI used to localize the electrode within the brain to further localize the volume of activated tissue.</description>
