    <textblock>
      CVM-1118 (TRX-818) is a new small molecule chemical entity being developed as a potential
      anti-cancer therapeutic by TaiRx, Inc. CVM-1118 is a potent anti-cancer agent in numerous
      human cancer cell lines. The safety of administrating CVM-1118 on human is evaluated from the
      phase 1 study. The objectives of the phase 2 study is to further investigate the efficacy of
      CVM-1118 for patients with advanced neuroendocrine tumors.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) are a group of uncommon heterogeneous malignancies originating
      from neuroendocrine cells localized throughout the body. Approximately 50% of patients with
      NETs would have metastatic cancer, where 65% of patients with metastatic cancer would result
      in mortality within 5 years of diagnosis.

      The current treatments of NETs do not follow single discipline and the effective agents are
      largely still under clinical investigations. Apparent formation of vasculogenic mimicry (VM)
      has been reported in at least two types of NETs. Moreover, VM has been found as part of
      multiple microvascular alterations in mouse models of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors.

      Wih the high potential of inhibiting VM formation, CVM-1118 is considered to have therapeutic
      potentials in treating NET tumors.

             therapy.

          3. Major surgery, radiation therapy, or systemic anti-cancer therapy within 4 weeks of

             ischemic attack; within 6 months prior to starting study treatment for pulmonary
             embolus. However, upon agreement between the investigator and sponsor, the 6-month
             post-event-free period for a patient with a pulmonary embolus can be waived if due to
             advanced cancer. Appropriate treatment with anticoagulants is permitted.

          9. Hypertension that cannot be controlled by medications (&gt; 150/100 mmHg despite optimal
             medical therapy).

         10. Current treatment with therapeutic doses of warfarin (low dose warfarin up to 2 mg PO
             daily for deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis is allowed).

         11. Known history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) seropositivity and/or is receiving
             anti-retroviral therapy.

         12. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV) with evidence of chronic active
             disease or receiving/requiring antiviral therapy.

             immunosuppressant agent therapy.

         14. Pregnancy or breastfeeding. Female patients must be surgically sterile or be
             postmenopausal or must agree to the use of effective contraception during the period
             of therapy. All female patients with reproductive potential must have a negative
             pregnancy test (serum or urine) prior to enrollment. Male patients must be surgically
             sterile or must agree to use effective contraception during the period of therapy. The
             definition of effective contraception will be based on the judgment of the
             Investigator or a designated associate.

         15. Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric conditions or laboratory
             abnormalities that would impart, in the judgment of the investigator and/or Sponsor,
             excess risk associated with study participation or study drug administration, which
             would make the patient inappropriate for entry into this study.
