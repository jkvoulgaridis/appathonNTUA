  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates an accelerated schedule of theta-burst stimulation for depressive
      symptoms in psychiatric inpatients.

      Firstly, a small pilot study (n=20) will be carried out to demonstrate feasibility, using the
      FDA-approved stimulation site for depression treatment (L-DLPFC). Once this pilot study is
      complete, patients will randomized to one of two stimulation sites (L-DLPFC or ACC) for the
      main study.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study intends to investigate whether modifying stimulation parameters enables typical
      6-8 week long rTMS protocols to be compressed to only five days. The influence of this
      accelerated protocol on the length of patient stay in the hospital will be investigated.

    <intervention_model_description>Firstly, a small pilot study (n=20) will be an open-label study in which all participants receive stimulation to the L-DLPFC to demonstrate feasibility of delivering this accelerated protocol on an inpatient unit.
For the main portion of the study, patients will receive stimulation to one of two brain areas. Patients will be randomized to either stimulation site.
If patients are enrolled that have a psychiatric diagnosis other than MDD, scales measuring symptoms related to their other diagnosis/(es) will also be collected in addition to measuring change in depressive symptoms (see 'other pre-specified outcome measures' for a list of measures used to measure symptoms related to psychiatric diagnoses other than depression).</intervention_model_description>

    <time_frame>After all stimulation sessions have been completed (approximately 48 hours after the final session)</time_frame>
    <description>A 10-item clinician-administered scale, designed to be particularly sensitive to antidepressant treatment effects in patients with major depression. Severity gradations for the MADRS have been proposed: 9-17 = mild depression, 18-34 = moderate depression, and â‰¥ 35 = severe depression. Scores range from 0-60.
Response is defined as a 50% reduction or greater in MADRS score compared to baseline. Remission is defined as a MADRS score of &lt;10.</description>

    <measure>Change in Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>After all stimulation sessions have been completed (approximately 48 hours after the final session)</time_frame>
    <description>The Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) is one of the most frequently utilized rating scales to assess manic symptoms. The scale has 11 items and is based on the patient's subjective report of his or her clinical condition.
There are four items that are graded on a 0 to 8 scale (irritability, speech, thought content, and disruptive/aggressive behavior), while the remaining seven items are graded on a 0 to 4 scale. These four items are given twice the weight of the others to compensate for poor cooperation from severely ill patients.
Typical YMRS baseline scores can vary a lot. They depend on the patients' clinical features such as mania (YMRS = 12), depression (YMRS = 3), or euthymia (YMRS = 2).</description>

    <description>The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II) is a 21-item, self-report rating inventory that measures characteristic attitudes and symptoms of depression. BDI-II items are rated on a 4-point scale ranging from 0 to 3 based on severity of each item. The maximum total score is 63.

    <measure>Change in Quick Inventory Depressive Scale-Self Reported (QIDS) score</measure>
    <time_frame>After all stimulation sessions have been completed (approximately 48 hours after the final session)</time_frame>
    <description>Self-report measure of depressive symptoms. The questionnaire consists of 16 questions. Each question can score between 0 to 4 points.
Severity of depression is determined as follows: 0=None, 1=Mild, 2=Moderate, 3=Severe, 4=Very Severe.
Total scores range from 0-27. Total scores: 0-5= no depression, 6-10= mild depression, 11-15= moderate depression, 16-20= severe depression, 21-27= very severe depression.
The total score is obtained by adding the scores for each of the nine symptom domains of the DSM-IV MDD criteria: depressed mood, loss of interest or pleasure, concentration/decision making, self-outlook, suicidal ideation, energy/fatigability, sleep, weight/appetite change, and psychomotor changes (Rush et al. 2003).</description>
