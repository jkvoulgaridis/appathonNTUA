  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the accuracy of using an imaging technique called
      breath-holding functional magnetic resonance imaging (BH fMRI) in addition to the standard
      imaging test described above. This study will allow the researchers to find out whether using
      BH fMRI in combination with the standard approach is the same as, better, or worse than the
      standard approach used alone.

    <description>The primary objective is to examine if the false negative results of BOLD fMRI adjacent to brain tumors can be compensated for by measurements of BH-MRI and subsequent calibration of the BOLD response. We will have two sets of data: 1) the data obtained using routine techniques to analyze the BOLD fMRI data; and 2) the data obtained where the BOLD fMRI data was analyzed incorporating BH data. Every data point obtained in 1) will have a corresponding data point using 2), the BH MRI data, to adjust the BOLD fMRI analysis.</description>

    <description>The interventions for this study are non-invasive. For patients, routine pre-operative MRI that includes task based fMRI and perfusion data acquisition will be performed on a 3T scanner. Patients who participate in this study, will have approximately 5 minutes added to their scan time for the below described breath holding fMRI (BH fMRI) paradigm, which will be done for research purposes. For healthy volunteers, participation will involve having a high resolution anatomical MRI done with the same paradigms which patients will have, listed below. the total scanner time will be approximately 25 minutes, and the scan will not be billed to the healthy volunteer.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Health Volunteers

          -  Volunteers between the ages of 18 and 80 years

          -  Volunteers must be able to perform the language paradigms on cue while inside the
             scanner Patients

          -  Patients between the ages of 18 and 80 years

          -  Patients must be able to perform the language paradigms on cue while inside the
             scanner

          -  Women of child bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test prior to the
             study intervention (Serum or Urine)

          -  Patients diagnosed with primary glial neoplasm, meningioma and metastasis (from prior
             histology) or must be suspected to have primary glial neoplasm, meningioma and
             metastasis on imaging (to be confirmed by post-operative histology).

          -  Patient‟s location of the tumor must involve the expected location of Broca‟s area
             (left pars opercularis and/or pars triangularis), or the expected location of the
             primary motor area (the pre-central gyrus). This determination will be made on the
             basis of a pre-operative MRI by a fellowship-trained Neuroradiologist

             o MSK site only - see Appendix 2

          -  Volunteers who are unable to perform the language paradigms on cue while inside the
             scanner (due to weakness, deafness, inability to understand or follow instructions
             etc.)

          -  Volunteers with a history of neurological disorders, psychiatric disorders or cancer
             Female volunteers who are pregnant or nursing.

          -  Volunteers who have MRI safe pacemakers.

          -  Patients who are unable to comply or complete MRI exams as per the site‟s standards.
             (e.g.: claustrophobia, high levels of anxiety, pacemaker etc.)

             °MSK site only - see Appendix 2

          -  Patients who have MRI safe pacemakers.
