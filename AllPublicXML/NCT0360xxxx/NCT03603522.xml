  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cough in asthma is a very common and troublesome symptom in asthma, which predicts severity
      and poor prognosis. Previous studies have shown that asthmatics have an exaggerated cough
      response to capsaicin. Currently available asthma treatment is not designed to target the
      cough reflex directly, so this presents an unmet need for patients. The treatment being
      tested in this study is the commercially available over the counter oral probiotic BioGaia®
      DSM17938. Based on clinical and pre-clinical evidence, it is hypothesized that TRPV1
      antagonism with BioGaia® DSM17938 will result in a reduction in capsaicin evoked coughs in
      patients with asthma.

      Visit 1: Baseline Screening and Beginning of Treatment Period 1 Subjects will undergo
      consent, complete history, physical examination, spirometry, capsaicin cough challenge, skin
      prick testing (allergen and histamine), methacholine challenge, induced sputum and blood
      sampling. Eligible subjects will then be randomized with matched oral BioGaia DSM17938 and
      placebo and will be given for the next 4 weeks.

      Visit 2: End of Treatment Period 1 Subjects will undergo spirometry, capsaicin cough
      challenge, skin prick testing, methacholine challenge, sputum induction and blood testing.

      Washout: 28 day washout period prior to Visit 3.

      Visit 3: Beginning of Treatment Period 2 Subjects wills undergo all the same tests performed
      in visit 2. Drug/Placebo will be given for the next 28 days.

      Visit 4: End of Treatment Period 2 Subjects will undergo all the same tests performed in
      visit 2.
