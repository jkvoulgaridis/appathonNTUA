  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This plan will be implemented on the staff of the Qazvin University of Medical Sciences. The
      Insomnia Severity Index questionnaire will be used to screen for insomnia and low sleep
      health. This questionnaire is provided online to the staff through communication channels
      such as telegrams to help people who are interested in participating in this research.
      Individuals who scored more than 8 were randomly assigned to intervention and control groups
      and completed the Insomnia Index Index. The intervention group will then receive an app-based
      educational intervention designed to improve sleep hygiene. Control group: Participants in
      the control group perform routine activities. The intervention and control group will fill
      out the relevant questionnaire one and three and six months after the completion of the
      training to assess the impact of the intervention online.

    <description>The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index includes seven components of subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, the use of sleep medications and day time dysfunctions provide a total score of these seven components that allows us to better understand the quality and quantity of one's sleep. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index is a self-reporting instrument consisting of nine questions designed to measure the quality of sleep disorders in a period of one month. The scale scores range from 0 to 21, with higher scores indicating poor quality of sleep and scores less than 5 considered as high quality of sleep</description>

    <measure>Anxiety and Depression</measure>
    <time_frame>changes in Anxiety and Depression baseline , 1 month, 3 months and 6 months follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Zigmond and Snaith developed the 14-item HADS to measure the anxiety (7 items) and depression (7 items) of patients with both somatic and mental problems. The response descriptors of all items are Yes, definitely (score 3); Yes, sometimes (score 2); No, not much (score 1); No, not at all (score 0); except for items 7 and 10, which are scored reversely. A higher score represents higher levels of anxiety and depression: a domain score of 11 or greater indicates anxiety or depression; 8-10 indicates borderline case; 7 or lower indicates no signs of anxiety or depression. The two-factor framework of the HADS has been supported in cancer patients.</description>
