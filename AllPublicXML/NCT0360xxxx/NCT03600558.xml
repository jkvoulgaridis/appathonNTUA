  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The long-term efficacy of chemotherapy in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) has been
      significantly improved in recent years. The combination of anthracycline plus cytarabine
      (Ara-C) has been a standard induction regimen for patients with AML. However, the optimal
      consolidation therapy after induction chemotherapy has not reached a consensus. The FLAG
      regimen consisting of fludarabine and high-dose cytarabine combined with G-CSF which is one
      of the first-line consolidation treatment options for relapsed and refractory AML. This study
      conducted a retrospective analysis of the intensive treatment of AML with the FLAG regimen
      from January 2007 to May 2018 in our hospital to evaluate the efficacy of the FLAG regimen.
      To provide the basis for the choice and timing of treatment for patients with AML treated
      with the FLAG regimen.
