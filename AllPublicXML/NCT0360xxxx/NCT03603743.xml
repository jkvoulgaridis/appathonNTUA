  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Purpose: Exaggerated sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activity associated with low heart rate
      variability (HRV) is considered as a trigger of cardiac arrhythmias and sudden death. Regular
      exercise training is efficient to improve autonomic balance. In 2013, the investigators
      published that a single session of an optimized short-high intensity interval exercise with
      passive recovery (HIIT) protocol was efficient in chronic heart failure (CHF) patients for
      enhancing vagal tone and to decrease arrhythmias in the 24-h post exercise period when
      compared to a single session of moderate intensity continuous exercise (MICT). Nevertheless
      the effects of HIIT training performed on several weeks have never yet been studied on the
      parameters described by Coumel's triangle (the arrhythmogenic substrate, the trigger factor
      as premature ventricular contraction and the modulation factors of which the most common is
      the autonomic nervous system). The aim of this study was to verify the superiority of HIIT to
      enhance parasympathetic activity, cardiorespiratory fitness and cardiac function when
      compared to MICT in a short and intense cardiac rehabilitation program.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Before and after the Rehabilitation Program (RP), all patients underwent a 24-hour ECG
      recording, an echocardiography, a cardiopulmonary exercise test.

      The RP consisted of 2 types of exercise training according to the randomization:

        1. a short-high intensity interval exercise with passive recovery

        2. a classical moderate and continuous exercise training at 60% of peak power output

      The RP lasted 4 weeks.
