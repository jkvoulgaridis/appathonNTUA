  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Penicillin antibiotics are safe and inexpensive, and target selected bacteria rather than
      killing a broad range. Unfortunately, around 10% of the population are labelled as
      'penicillin allergic'. This is often based on side effects such as rash and diarrhoea, and
      90-95% of people with the label are not actually allergic to the drug.

      The label leads to the use of alternative antibiotics, which tend to more toxic, and less
      specific about which bacteria they kill; this increases the risk of infections with so-called
      'super-bugs', compared to patients without the label. People with the label also have an
      increased length of hospital stay and rates of readmission. These are significant problems
      for individuals, as well as wider society. Where the diagnosis is in doubt, the gold standard
      test for allergy is an oral challenge. Patients undergo skin +/- blood tests prior to a
      challenge, as these can help make the diagnosis. This combined pathway is expensive and time
      consuming, so testing cannot be offered routinely to all patients. However in patients with
      'historic' reactions (many years previously), skin and blood tests become much less useful;
      in one study, 100% of patients who skin tested positive for amoxycillin allergy, tested
      negative 5 years later. Patients with historic reactions can therefore proceed directly to an
      oral challenge without prior skin or blood testing, since these offer little help in making
      the diagnosis. This streamlines the pathway, making it quick, non-invasive and cheap. Already
      established practice in several centres in Europe and beyond, this abbreviated pathway is
      offered on an ad-hoc basis in some centres in the UK.

      The aim is to demonstrate that this pathway offers a safe and effective way to perform
      large-scale delabelling of elective surgical patients, who might not otherwise meet NICE
      criteria for testing.

    <description>A graded oral challenge test, using amoxicillin in syrup form, will be administered as follows:
50mg amoxicillin (10% total dose)
250mg amoxicillin (50% total dose)
200mg amoxicillin (remainder needed to complete a 500mg full dose) A 20 minute interval will separate each dose given, and participants will be observed throughout the test. They will be required to stay for one hour after the final dose has been administered. Fully trained staff and all equipment for emergency resuscitation will be immediately available.</description>
