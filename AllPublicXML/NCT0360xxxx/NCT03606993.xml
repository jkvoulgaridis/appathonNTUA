  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the feasibility of cooking with an iron ingot, Lucky Iron Fish™ (LIF),
      and evaluate the natural history of hemoglobins and iron status among infants of families
      using this iron ingot in a population with a high prevalence of iron-deficiency anemia.
      Participants are mother-infant dyads, and are randomized to one of two arms: Lucky Iron
      Fish™or enhanced standard of care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Iron deficiency and iron-deficiency anemia contribute significantly to global pediatric
      morbidity, predominantly affecting women and preschool aged children in resource-limited
      settings. Iron-deficiency in infancy has been linked to neurodevelopmental delay.

      Current methods of iron repletion and supplementation have proved inadequate. The Lucky Iron
      Fish™ is a iron ingot, the size of a small bar of soap, that is made of pure iron. When
      boiled, it releases bioavailable iron into water, which is then used for food preparation
      and/or drinking. Participants in the LIF arm are instructed to acidify the water with citrus
      juice (provided).

      All participants are followed at the same intervals to complete questionnaires and
      study-related labs.

    <time_frame>6-months and 12-months</time_frame>
    <description>Investigators will assess changes in hemoglobin within each study arm and compare hemolgobin levels between study arms (intervention vs. standard of care). Hemoglobin will be measured in grams per deciliter (g/dL) and measured at 6-months, and 12-months. If data is normally distributed, a paired/dependent t-test will be used, if non-normal, a non-parametric test like Wilcoxon's Matched pairs test will be used.</description>

    <time_frame>12-months</time_frame>
    <description>Within each study arm (Iron ingot vs. Oral iron supplementation), will calculate proportion lost to follow-up. Number of subjects lost to follow up divided total number of subjects enrolled at study entry.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Adherence to iron ingot use</measure>
    <time_frame>12-months</time_frame>
    <description>Using a questionnaire with several likert-scale questions, we will assess adherence to iron ingot use. Questions include &quot;When was the last time you used the Fish&quot;, &quot;how often do you use the fish for meal preparation&quot;, &quot;how often do you use the fish to prepare water&quot;, &quot;how long do you typically boil the fish&quot;. The answer to each question has between 4-5 possible ordinal responses which will be converted into numerical data (1,2,3,4,5) and cumulative scores will be created to assess degree of use/adherence.</description>
