    <textblock>
      Performing fluoroscopic HSG with oil based contrast medium has been shown to increase
      pregnancy rates in a subfertile population. This is a pilot study to test the efficacy of as
      well as the tolerability and safety of using lipid based oil medium for sonographic based
      hysterosalpingography (Sono HSG) compared to water based contrast (i.e. normal saline) for
      women seeking fertility. The double blind study will randomize 56 women at the time of Sono
      HSG in a 1:1 ratio to receive through the SHG catheter either up to 10 cc of Lipiodol UF® or
      normal saline. The investigators will collect subjective pain experience and follow the
      subjects for 6 months after the test for pregnancy and collect all adverse events during and
      after the procedure.
