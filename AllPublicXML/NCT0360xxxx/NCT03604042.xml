  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to compare weight gain (g/day) of infants receiving new protein
      fortifier (PF) according to a blood urea nitrogen (BUN)-driven fortification regimen to
      weight gain (g/day) of infants receiving PF according to a weight-driven fortification
      regimen (standard of care) over a 21 day period.
