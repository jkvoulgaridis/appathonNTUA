  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate a web application tool that hemodialysis patients can use outside of dialysis
      time to log and prioritize their concerns for the nephrologists. Specifically, the
      investigators will compare the usability of a web application tool to a structured paper
      form. The investigators will also use data from semi-structured interviews to better
      understand the experience and acceptability of the web app among patient participants
      randomized to the web application and among participating nephrologists.

      Primary outcome

      -Usability (effectiveness, efficiency, satisfaction)

      Secondary outcomes

      -Quality of the patient-physician interaction (Communication Assessment Tool (CAT-14))
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Usability is defined as Effectiveness (&gt;70%)

        -  Number of people submitting a concern/ number of people with opportunity to submit a
           concern

        -  Number of concerns entered/number of times concern was satisfactorily addressed

      Efficiency

        -  Proportion of non-completed tasks (&lt;70%)

        -  The amount of time to complete one concern

      Satisfaction

        -  Semistructured interviews

        -  Usability survey
