  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An open-label, single center, three-arm observational study to examine emissions from
      e-cigarettes versus conventional cigarettes under three environmental settings of typical
      residential, office and hospitality facilities.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Specific constituents will be measured in exhaled breath samples (EBS) from adult e-vapor
      product users and smokers when they are using e-vapor products or smoking conventional
      cigarettes. These constituents and particle counts (PC), will be measured in the room air
      samples (RAS) collected in the environmental exposure chamber (EEC) where adult e-cigarette
      users and smokers are using electronic cigarettes or smoking conventional cigarettes.

      All subjects will undergo a Screening Visit to assess if they meet study eligibility
      criteria. If all eligibility criteria are met and the subject signs informed consent, the
      subject will be assigned to one of three groups: Group I (JUUL), Group II (VUSE Solo), or
      Group III (Conventional Cigarettes).

      All three Groups will be sequentially observed in environmental settings 1 (residential), 2
      (office), and 3 (hospitality). The observation period allocated for each environmental
      setting will be 2-days and 2-overnights for Groups I and II, and 1-day and 1-overnight for
      Group III. Each observation period will be referred to as a &quot;Clinic Visit&quot;.

      Subjects will move on to subsequent Environment Settings (Clinic Visits 2 or 3) after
      completion of the previous Clinic Visit (1 or 2).

      Subjects must return to the clinic for Clinic Visit 1 within 60 days of the Screening Visit.
      Clinic Visit 2 must occur 7 ± 2 days after the Clinic Visit 1, and Clinic Visit 3 must occur
      7 ± 2 days after Clinic Visit 2.

             The Investigator must be satisfied that the volunteer has the ability to read and
             communicate in English in order to participate in the study.

          2. Subjects screened as a part of an IRB-approved General Screening Protocol at the CRO
             site may be included in this study without additional Screening procedures provided
             all the required Screening procedures have been performed within 60 days prior to
             Clinic Visit 1.

          3. Be a healthy male or female volunteer aged 21 - 65 years at the time of Screening

          5. Report a history of drug or alcohol addiction or abuse within the past 1 year.

          6. Have positive screen for alcohol or drugs of abuse at Screening (Screening Visit) or
             check-in at Clinical Visit 1.

          7. Have positive test for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B surface antigen
             (HbsAg), or hepatitis C virus (anti-HCV).

          8. Have body mass index (BMI) greater than 40 kg/m2 or less than 18 kg/m2 at Screening
             (Screening Visit).

             months of Screening (Screening Visit).

         10. Have taken medication for depression or asthma within 6 months of Screening (Screening
             Visit).

         11. Have used prescription or over-the-counter bronchodilator medication (eg, inhaled or
             oral β-agonists) within 6 months of Screening (Screening Visit).

         12. Be breast-feeding or pregnant female subjects (confirmed by a positive pregnancy
             test). Female subjects, who are considered women of child bearing potential (WOCBP)
             and sexually active, must be willing and able to use an acceptable method of
             contraception from Screening (Screening Visit) through the end of the study.
