      Case control Study to assess the difference of immune cell responses between patients with
      chronic HCV- related liver cirrhosis who develop HCC after treatment with DAAs and those who
      do not develop HCC

      Clinical and laboratory assessment with measurement of Child-Pugh and MELD scores to assess
      the severity of liver disease and measurement of alpha fetoprotein level for HCC cases will
      be done.

      Radiological assessment using abdominal ultrasound and triphasic CT will be done to determine
      the extent of the HCC and staging.

      Blood sample from all patients will be withdrawn. Plasma will be isolated and stored at - 20C
      and further analysis for a panel of cytokines, caspases and growth factors using ELISA will
      be monitored.

      Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) will be isolated using ficoll gradient method and
      will then be stored at -80C.

      B and T cell proliferation in response to specific antigens will also be investigated using
      CFSE staining assay followed by flow cytometry analysis for CD4, CD8 and PD-1.

      Cell cycle analysis and apoptosis will be detected using Annexin V/PI staining method and
      flow cytometry analysis. The phosphorylation and activation of cytoplasmic proteins will be
      tested using Western blot analysis.
