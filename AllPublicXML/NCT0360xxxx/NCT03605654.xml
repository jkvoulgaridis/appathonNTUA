    <textblock>
      The Phase 2 primary objective is to evaluate achievement of persistent mixed chimerism and
      withdrawal of at least one immunosuppression drug for a minimum of 6 months with no episodes
      of biopsy-proven acute rejection or transplant kidney loss induced by cellular immunotherapy
      with MDR-102 in recipients of 1, 2, or 3 out of 6 human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-mismatched,
      living donor kidney transplants.

      The Phase 3 primary objective is to evaluate achievement of induction of immune quiescence by
      cellular immunotherapy with MDR-102 in recipients of 1, 2, or 3 out of 6 HLA-mismatched,
      living donor kidney transplants. Immune quiescence is defined as remaining on maintenance
      immunosuppression monotherapy with Tac or CsA for 12 months or more after completion of
      anti-rejection immunosuppression drug therapy reduction with no episodes of biopsy-proven
      acute rejection, transplant kidney loss, or subject deat.

      Currently, patients receiving a transplanted kidney are required to take life-long
      immunosuppressive medications to prevent rejection of the transplanted kidney. These
      medications carry substantial side effects. In addition, these medicines often do not
      completely control damage to the kidney from the recipients' immune system, ultimately
      causing the kidney to fail.

      Medeor Therapeutics is developing a novel cell-based therapy as personalized cellular
      immunotherapies to improve outcomes in organ transplant recipients.

      The purpose of the current Phase 2/3 study is to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of
      MDR-102 for the induction of immune quiescence in a prospective, randomized, open-label,
      multi-center clinical trial. MDR-102 is intended to induce mixed lymphohematopoietic
      chimerism and donor specific immune quiescence in order to preserve transplant kidney
      function, avert transplant kidney rejection, and reduce the cumulative and serious side
      effects associated with immunosuppression drugs.

    <description>Immune quiescence is defined as:
Achievement of the required duration of persistent donor mixed chimerism (i.e., 6 months) to permit mycophenolic acid drug (e.g., mycophenolate mofetil) immunosuppression stoppage without a taper at approximately 12 months post-kidney transplant surgery,
Successful stoppage of mycophenolic acid drug (e.g., mycophenolate mofetil) at 12 + 1 months post-kidney transplant surgery, and
Subsequent successful maintenance on calcineurin inhibitor monotherapy for at least 12 additional months (out to at least 24 months post-kidney transplant surgery) without biopsy-proven acute rejection, transplant kidney loss, or subject death</description>
