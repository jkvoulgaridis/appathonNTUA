  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The number of surgical procedures performed in ambulatory hospitalization for cancers of the
      skin or breast is increasing for medical and economic reasons. But the protocols of care and
      the clinical pathways are poorly adapted for elderly patients with physical or cognitive
      impairment.

      The goal of this study is to test the impact of an oncology ambulatory surgical care in
      patients aged 75 years or older, with breast or skin cancer and treated in Henri Mondor
      hospital on the increase in the proportion of patients operated on an outpatient basis
