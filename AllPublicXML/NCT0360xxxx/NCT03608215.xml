  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary Dysmenorrhea (PDM), defined as menstrual pain without discernable organic causes, is
      inexorably common in adolescent women, about 40-90% of women may suffer from it, and 20% of
      them can be severe in the context of being refractory to medication, daily function
      impairment, and having pain of severe degree. Novel therapeutic method is in need for pain
      alleviation for this particular phenotype. It has been reported that PDM females may engage
      motor-cortex based descending pain modulation system in our resting-state functional Magnetic
      Resonance Imaging (rs-fMRI) and thermal pain-activation fMRI studies. Based on the reported
      analgesic efficacy of transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) on the motor cortex for
      various experimental painful conditions and clinical pain disorders, it is plausible that
      tDCS can be effective for the severe and medication-refractory PDM patients. This study aim
      to investigate the analgesic efficacy of tDCS in severe PDMs and to elucidate the dynamic
      brain neuroplasticity in the context of experimental pain after tDCS intervention. Thirty
      severe PDMs will be recruited and randomly allocated to either real or sham group in a
      triple-blind manner. Experimental pain electrical stimulation will be performed before and
      after the tDCS intervention. The experimental pain-evoked magnetoencephamographic (MEG) data
      will be correlated with behavioral and psychological measurements. This is the first study in
      the literature investigating the tDCS efficacy for acute pain in severe PDM. The result can
      promise a new possibility for clinical application.
