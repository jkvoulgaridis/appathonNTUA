  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this trial is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of BI
      905677 given as an intravenous infusion and to determine the recommended dose and dosing
      schedule for further trials in the development of BI 905677. The MTD will be defined based on
      the frequency of patients experiencing Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT)s during the MTD
      evaluation period, which is defined as the first cycle of treatment. Separate MTDs will be
      determined for dosing Schedule A and dosing Schedule B. Recruitment into Schedule B will
      start after the MTD of Schedule A is reached.

      The secondary objective of the trial is:

      - To determine the pharmacokinetic profile of BI 905677

                  ULN.

             after a confirmed menstrual period within the past 4 weeks and a negative pregnancy
             test at screening. WOCBP with irregular menstruation may be included after two
             negative pregnancy tests during screening between 2 and 4 weeks apart. WOCBP and men
