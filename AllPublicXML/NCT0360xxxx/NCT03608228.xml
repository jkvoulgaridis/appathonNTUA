  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The brain networks controlling movement are complex, involving multiple areas of the brain.
      Some neurological diseases, like Parkinson's disease, cause abnormalities in the brain
      networks. Deep brain stimulation is a treatment that is used to treat these types of
      neurological diseases. Through this research, the investigators will take advantage of the
      unique opportunity provided by awake deep brain stimulation surgery to learn more about how
      the brain functions in a diseased state and how deep brain stimulation changes these
      networks. This study aims to enroll up to 75 subjects over a period of 2.5 years. Those who
      participate in the study will spend up to 40 minutes during their deep brain stimulation
      surgery during which researchers will record signals from deep structures within the brain as
      well as the surface of the brain using electrodes that are temporarily placed for research
      purposes. During the study, researchers will record signals while subjects perform three
      different tasks, in some cases while the brain is stimulated. Study participation is limited
      to the intraoperative environment with no additional study visits required.

        Subjects are patients who are undergoing deep brain stimulation implantation for treatment
        of Parkinson's disease based on clinical indications as determined by a multidisciplinary
        neurology-neurosurgery team at each center.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age &gt; 18

          2. Rigid-akinetic subtype of Parkinson's disease, diagnosed by a movement disorders
             neurologist

          3. Clinical indications, as deemed by a multidisciplinary team of neurologists and
             neurosurgeons, for deep brain stimulation surgery, including motor fluctuations,
             difficult-to-control-dyskinesias, unpredictable off-times, and/or dystonia

          4. Preoperative MRI without cortical or subdural adhesions or vascular abnormalities

          5. Subject is medically fit for surgical intervention, as deemed by a primary care
             physician

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Inability or unwillingness to tolerate 20 minutes and up to 40 minutes of additional
             operative time

          2. Patient with history of secondary Parkinsonism, stroke, or progressive central nervous
             system disease other than Parkinson's disease.

          3. Subject is at high risk for surgical complications such as active systemic infection,
             coagulation disorders (such as the use of anti-thrombotic therapies) or platelet count
             below 100,000.

          4. Subject is taking chronic anticoagulants or antiplatelet agent or subject has an
             abnormally elevated preoperative coagulation profile (either (Partial Thromboplastin
             Time) PTT or prothrombin time/INR).

          5. Patients with recent use (within one week) of anticoagulant or antiplatelet agent use

             uncontrolled systemic hypertension with values above 170/100; cardiac or pulmonary
             disease; uncorrected coagulation abnormalities; diabetes; or any condition that would
