  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether BP-C1 is effective in the short-term
      treatment of metastatic breast cancer patients who have previously undergone at least three
      lines of chemotherapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      BP-C1, solution for injection 0.05%, is currently being developed for treatment of patients
      with metastatic breast cancer with palliative intent.

      Active substance of the product, which is a novel platinum-containing anticancer agent
      developed for intramuscular administration, is Ð° cis-diammineplatinum(II) complexed with a
      polymer containing benzene polycarboxylic acids derived from lignin.

      The amphiphilic characteristics of the polymer have resulted in a product with clear and
      significantly altered and improved properties compared to other platinum analogues, e.g.
      cisplatin, carboplatin and oxaliplatin.

      BP-C1 preserves antitumour activity of its predecessors (e.g. cisplatin and carboplatin),
      additionally offering the following advantages that ensure favourable outcome of treatment of
      metastatic breast cancer patients:

        -  injectable solution (intramuscular) does not cause injection site reactions; can be
           administered at home by a nurse or a patient;

        -  has an improved pharmacokinetic profile;

        -  demonstrates efficacy comparable to cisplatin and much higher than carboplatin
           (in-vitro; in-vivo data);

        -  exerts an additional immunomodulatory activity.

      This study is a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre, phase IIb study in
      Thai patients with metastatic breast cancer. The eligible patients will be allocated (1:1) to
      either BP-C1 arm or Placebo arm and treated once daily for 32 days. The patients allocated to
      Placebo arm will cross over to BP-C1 treatment for 32 days when progression of the cancer
      will be documented and latest after 32-day treatment with Placebo. After 32-day treatment
      with BP-C1 the patients are invited to continue open-label treatment under protocol
      BMC2011-02.

    <measure>Change (%) in the sum of diameters of target lesions</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline to Day 32 of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Diameter of target lesions will be measured by computer tomography (CT) with contrasting using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of target lesions</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline to Day 32 of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Number of target lesions per each patient will be evaluated by CT with contrasting. Number of target lesions at baseline and Day 32 of treatment will be presented in shift tables.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Treatment response</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline to Day 32 of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>In accordance with RECIST v1.1 the treatment response will be classified as 'complete response', 'partial response', 'stable disease' or 'progressive disease':
Complete response (CR): disappearance of all target lesions. Partial response (PR): at least 30% decrease in the sum of longest diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters.
Progressive disease (PD): at least 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum might also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. The appearance of one or more new lesions will also be considered progression.
Stable disease (SD): neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR, nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study.</description>

Three variables will be obtained from the EORTC-BR23: the sum of scores BR1 to BR13 denoted as &quot;Breast cancer problem last week&quot;, the sum of scores BR14 to BR16 denoted as &quot;Sexual interest and activity last four weeks&quot; and the sum of scores BR17 to BR23 denoted as &quot;Breast cancer related pain and discomfort last week&quot;.</description>
