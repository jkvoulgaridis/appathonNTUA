  <brief_summary>

      The purpose of this study is to find out if the investigational drug angiotensin-(1-7)
      improves cardiovascular health in patients with obesity and high blood pressure.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is a major public health concern that greatly increases risk for developing
      cardiovascular disease. Importantly, obesity is associated with endothelial dysfunction and
      elevated sympathetic tone, vascular and autonomic derangements known to elevate blood
      pressure and increase cardiovascular risk. The renin-angiotensin system may explain
      cardiovascular complications in obesity. Angiotensin-(1-7) is a beneficial hormone that is
      reduced in obesity and restoration of this hormone improves endothelial function and reduces
      sympathetic activity in animal models, which may contribute to its blood pressure-lowering
      effects. The investigators will test the hypothesis that angiotensin-(1-7) improves
      cardiovascular function in humans with obesity hypertension. This hypothesis will be tested
      in a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled crossover study. The investigators will
      measure the effects of acute intravenous angiotensin-(1-7) infusion on endothelial-mediated
      vasodilation in the brachial and coronary arteries and on blood pressure and muscle
      sympathetic nerve activity with direct microneurography recordings in obese hypertensive
      humans.

    <description>Participants receive intravenous angiotensin-(1-7) at one study visit for 100 minutes total. Angiotensin-(1-7) will be given in escalating doses of 2ng/kg/min, 4ng/kg/min, and 8ng/kg/min. Each of these doses will be infused for 10 minutes. Following the dose escalation, angiotensin-(1-7) will be given at 8ng/kg/min for an additional 70 minutes. Infusion rates will be calculated for each patient based on body mass.</description>

    <description>Participants receive intravenous saline at one study visit for 100 minutes total. The volume of saline will match the volume of angiotensin-(1-7) infused. Infusion rates will be calculated for each patient based on body mass. Saline will be given in escalating doses for 10 minutes each and then held for 70 minutes at the highest dose.</description>
