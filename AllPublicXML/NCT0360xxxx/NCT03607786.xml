    <textblock>
      This study is designed as a multicenter, randomized, assessor- blinded clinical trial.The
      primary aim of this trial is to assess whether retrograde inferior venal caval perfusion
      combined selective antegrade cerebral perfusion(ACP)under mild hypothermia, compared with
      moderate hypothermia combined with selective ACP alone, improves the outcome for the patients
      undergoing total aortic arch replacement.

    <description>After total cardiopulmonary bypass was initiated, the patient is cooled slowly to induce moderate hypothermia(28-30℃). The combination of selective antegrade cerebral perfusion and retrograde inferior vena caval perfusion is performed. The antegrade perfusion flow rate was is maintained at 6-12 mL/min/kg.Pump pressure of retrograde perfusion was is maintained at 20-30 mmHg, and blood flow was is maintained at 8-12 mL/min/kg.</description>

    <intervention_type>Procedure</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>Retrograde Inferior Vena Caval Perfusion</intervention_name>
    <description>Retrograde Inferior Vena Caval Perfusion is achieved by tethering the inferior vena cava with a band around the cannula and by clamping the distal end of the inferior vena cava drainage tube, which allowed a pump to drive oxygenated blood into the inferior vena cava. Pump pressure is maintained at 20-30 mmHg, and blood flow is maintained at 8-12 mL/min/kg. The aim of RIVP is to maintain the lower body perfusion during circulation arrest, and reduce the ischemia-associated vital organ injury.</description>
