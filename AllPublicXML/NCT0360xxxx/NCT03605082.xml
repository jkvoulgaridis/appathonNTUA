          -  Subject is in good physical and mental health, in particular is not affected by any
             neurological disorder, in the opinion of the Investigator, as determined on the basis
             of medical history and a general clinical examination at Screening

          -  Subject has clinical laboratory test results within the reference ranges of the
             laboratory

          -  Subject has any clinically relevant abnormal findings in physical examination,
             laboratory tests, vital signs, or electrocardiogram, which, in the opinion of the
             Investigator, may place the subject at risk because of participation in the study

             bilirubin to identify possible undiagnosed Gilbert's syndrome (ie, direct bilirubin
             &lt;35%)

          -  Subject has a lifetime history of suicide attempt (including an actual attempt,
             interrupted attempt, or aborted attempt), or has suicidal ideation in the past 2 years

             antibodies, hepatitis C virus antibodies or antibodies to human immunodeficiency virus
             (HIV) type 1 and/or type 2 at Screening

          -  Subject has a known hypersensitivity to any components of the investigational
             medicinal product (IMP), comparative drugs, any biologic or small molecule, or
             concomitant medication as stated in this protocol

          -  Female subject who is breastfeeding, pregnant, or plans to become pregnant during the
