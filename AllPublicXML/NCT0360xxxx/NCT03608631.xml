      This phase I trial studies the best dose and side effects of mesenchymal stromal
      cells-derived exosomes with KrasG12D siRNA (iExosomes) in treating participants with
      pancreatic cancer with KrasG12D mutation that has spread to other places in the body.
      iExosomes may work better at treating pancreatic cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-derived
      exosomes loaded with small interference RNA (siRNA) against KrasG12D (iExosomes) in
      metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) patients with KrasG12D mutation.

      II. To identify the dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) of mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-derived
      exosomes loaded with siRNA against KrasG12D (iExosomes) in metastatic PDAC patients with
      KrasG12D mutation.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the pharmacokinetic profile of iExosomes. II. Assess the overall response rate of
      iExosomes in the chosen patient population.

      III. Assess the disease control rate (partial response + stable disease) with therapy.

      IV. Determine median progression-free survival (PFS) with this treatment. V. Determine the
      median overall survival (OS) with this treatment.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate optional tissue collection and serum-derived exosomes and circulating-free
      deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) (cfDNA) for detection of DNA and ribonucleic acid (RNA) showing
      KrasG12D sequence; evaluate DNA and RNA showing KrasG12D sequence in optional tissue
      collection.

      II. Evaluate the siRNA content in blood and optional tissue collection.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Participants receive mesenchymal stromal cells-derived exosomes with KrasG12D siRNA
      intravenously (IV) over 15-20 minutes on days 1, 4, and 10. Treatment repeats every 14 days
      for up to 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
      Participants who respond may continue 3 additional courses.

      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up at 30 days, then every 3
      months for up to 1 year.

          -  Known CNS (central nervous system) disease, except for treated brain metastasis.
             Treated brain metastases are defined as having no evidence of progression or
             hemorrhage after treatment and no ongoing requirement for dexamethasone, as
             ascertained by clinical examination and brain imaging (magnetic resonance imaging-MRI
             or computerized tomography-CT) during the screening period. Anticonvulsants (stable
             dose) are allowed. Treatment for brain metastases may include whole brain radiotherapy
             (WBRT), radiosurgery (RS; gamma knife, linear accelerator [LINAC], or equivalent) or a
