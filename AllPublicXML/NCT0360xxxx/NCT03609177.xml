  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this research study, the investigators are working to help oncologists better serve
      patients by delivering more patient-centered, goal-concordant care that may improve health
      care delivery.

      - It is expected that about 12,000 people will take part in this research study, 11,550 of
      these patients, the vast majority, will be included only for medical record review.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to improve the quality of care provided to millions of older
      Americans with cancer. The investigators are working to help oncologists better serve
      patients by delivering more patient-centered, goal-concordant care that may dramatically
      improve health care delivery.

      This is pragmatic stepped wedge cluster randomized trial (SW-CRT) of a Comprehensive ACP
      (Advance Care Planning) Program among older oncology patients. The ACP Program will include
      training clinicians in communication skills and using video decision aids for participants.

      - This study will involve medical record review of 11,550 people age 65 or older with
      advanced cancer.

      We will also recruit 450 eligible patients (150 patients from each of our three sites broken
      down into 75 patients during the control phase and 75 patients during the intervention phase)
      to conduct an in-person survey for our secondary patient-centered outcomes (confidence,
      satisfaction with physician communication, patient decisional satisfaction and regret). From
      among this sub-group we will engage 240 participants (80 from each of our three sites broken
      down into 40 patients during the control phase and 40 patients during the intervention phase)
      in an activity to film video declarations of their preferences.

      During the first year, three pilot sites (one at each health care system) will trial the
      intervention. The subjects recruited at these pilot sites will not be included in the final
      analysis. Thus, the main trial will begin during year 2 and continue through year 5 with
      recruitment of 11,550 subjects for the primary outcome at 36 oncology clinics. The first year
      pilot will serve to inform the larger roll-out and the intervention may change during the
      first year based on pilot-clinic experience.
