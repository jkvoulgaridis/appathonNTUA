  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The effect of surgery, in contrary to critical illness, on muscle weakness hasn't been
      thoroughly investigated. Recent data suggest that elective surgery may also induce muscle
      weakness. The neuro-endocrine stress response could be involved in the pathophysiology.
      Whether the mode of anesthesia/analgesia can influence muscle weakness, by influencing the
      neuro-endocrine stress response is unknown. Gaining insight in this matter could affect
      quality of care and benefit patient recovery and satisfaction.

    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators want to demonstrate whether the application of neuraxial
      anesthesia for elective surgery diminishes perioperative muscle weakness. Since spinal and
      epidural anesthesia/analgesia have been shown to influence the neuro-endocrine stress
      response, the possible underlying mediator of perioperative muscle weakness, the
      investigators will perform two different, but complementary, studies. In one study, patients
      scheduled for elective total hip arthroplasty will receive spinal anesthesia, without losing
      consciousness and maintaining a free airway, as compared to receiving general anesthesia. In
      another study, patients scheduled for a laparoscopic hemicolectomy will receive epidural
      anesthesia/analgesia during and after the surgery as compared to receiving no epidural
      anesthesia/analgesia. These studies allow the investigators to identify whether the
      application of neuraxial anesthesia/analgesia could diminish perioperative weakness and allow
      us to identify other possible mediators of perioperative muscle weakness, such as losing
      consciousness or receiving neuromuscular blockade.

      This study has the potential to help to identify a new side-effect of elective surgery,
      namely perioperative muscle weakness, and to identify a possible treatment for this possible
      new complication, namely neuraxial anesthesia and analgesia, which might benefit many
      patients in the future. Furthermore, investigating the possible mediating role of the
      neuro-endocrine stress response might identify new therapeutic targets, such as glucagon
      modulation.
