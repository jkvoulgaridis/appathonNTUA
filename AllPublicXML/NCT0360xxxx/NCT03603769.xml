  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this project is to study the effects of a new-developed food-supplement that
      contains bioactive polar lipids derived from organic farmed Irish salmon for the beneficial
      promotion of cardiovascular health. The health claims that will be formulated for this
      nutraceutical are based on EFSA guidelines &quot;The scientific requirements for health claims
      related to antioxidants, oxidative damage and cardiovascular health&quot; and in particular
      paragraph 5.4, &quot;Claims on reduced platelet aggregation&quot; &quot;Platelet hyperactivity and
      hypercoagulability states are more commonly observed in subjects with cardiovascular (CV)
      risk factors. Healthy subjects at very low risk of CV disease normally have non-activated
      circulating platelets. Decreasing platelet aggregation in subjects with platelet activation
      during sustained exposure to the food/constituent (e.g. four weeks) would be a beneficial
      physiological effect&quot;.

      Within this study, the postprandial effects of this novel food supplement against platelet
      aggregation and inflammation are going to be exploited ex vivo in blood from human subjects
      as described in previously established procedures.

    <intervention_model_description>Each subject will participate in five daily trials on 5 separate days, at least 2 weeks apart.
Within each appointment each participant will come (after fasting overnight, 10-12 h), to our metabolic unit early in the morning (07:30 - 08.30 am) and will initially give a fasting baseline blood sample. Afterwards, in specific time he/she will be provided to consume a standardized breakfast and then he/she will be administered randomly either placebo or several versions of the food supplement containing Salmon Polar Lipids (Low Dose stomach release or High Dose stomach release or Low Dose intestine release or High Dose Intestine Release). Thus, the sequence of the trials will be randomly selected for each subject.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Bio-assays on platelets will be assessed as previously described. Briefly:
Standard PAF dissolved in BSA will have final concentrations 2.6e-8 - 2.6e-5 mol/L when testing into a Chronolog-490 two channel turbidimetric platelet aggregometer. The maximum reversible or the minimum irreversible PAF-induced platelet aggregation is determined as the 100% aggregation, and then various PAF concentrations are added, so as to achieve aggregations between 20% and 80% aggregation, which are of linear response to the added PAF concentration. The EC50 value that accounts for the PAF concentration (mol/L) inducing 50% aggregation of human platelets will be calculated by the equation derived from this linear curve. Results will be expressed as percentage change of EC50 on 1, 2, 3 and 4 hours of the food supplement/placebo administration, compared with baseline (0 hours)</description>

    <description>Bio-assays on platelets will be assessed as previously described. Briefly:
Standard active thrombin dissolved in saline will have final concentrations 0.01 - 1.0 IU/mL when testing into a Chronolog-490 two channel turbidimetric platelet aggregometer. The maximum reversible or the minimum irreversible Thrombin-induced platelet aggregation is determined as the 100% aggregation, and then various Thrombin concentrations are added, so as to achieve aggregations between 20% and 80% aggregation, which are of linear response to the added Thrombin concentration. The EC50 value that accounts for the Thrombin concentration (IU/mL) inducing 50% aggregation of human platelets will be calculated by the equation derived from this linear curve. Results will be expressed as percentage change of EC50 on 1, 2, 3 and 4 hours of the food supplement/placebo administration, compared with baseline (0 hours).</description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Experimental: After fasting overnight, subjects will come to our metabolic unit where in a randomized and double blinded way they will be provided several versions of the food supplement either of stomach resistant (intestine release) or stomach non-resistant (stomach release) each containing either 0.25 (Low Dose) or 0.50 g (High Dose) of Salmon Polar Lipids (SPL)
Assessment &amp; outcome measured: Blood samples will be taken from each subject at baseline (0 hours) and after 1-4 hours of the SPL-food supplement intervention. Aggregation of platelets will be assessed in these samples as previously described (see references 1-4), in order to evaluate the postprandial effects of this supplement on platelet aggregation.
Other blood coagulation parameters will also be evaluated, such as prothrombin time, fibrinogen, Activated partial thromboplastin time Plasma lipid profile (levels of plasma Total Cholesterol, LDL, HDL and Triglycerides) and serum CRP levels will also be assessed.</description>
