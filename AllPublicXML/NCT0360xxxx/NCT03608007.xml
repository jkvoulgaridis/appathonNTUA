  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To assess treatment effectiveness and safety of oral X-396 capsule (Ensartinib) administered
      to Chinese patients with Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) that is confirmed to be
      positive for a c-ROS Oncogene (ROS1) positive gene mutation (translocation or inversion).

    <textblock>
      This is a phase II, multicenter, single-arm study in which the efficacy and safety of X-396
      capsule (Ensartinib) will be assessed in adult Chinese patients with ROS1-positive
      (rearrangement or inversion) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Approximately 69 patients
      (59 for never-treated, and 10 for previously treated with crizotinib) with locally advanced
      or metastatic NSCLC carrying ROS1-rearrangement will be enrolled in the study.
