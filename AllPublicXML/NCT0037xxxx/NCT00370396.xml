  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity of a booster dose of
      GSK Biologicals' pneumococcal conjugate vaccine compared to Prevenar™ given at 12-18 mo of
      age to children primed with either pneumococcal vaccine or Prevenar™ in study 105553.
      Antibody persistence will be evaluated at 8-14 mo after completion of the 3-dose immunization
      course in study 105553 (NCT00307554). The immune response to a booster dose of GSK
      Biologicals' pneumococcal conjugate vaccine will also be evaluated when given at 12-18 mo to
      subjects not primed with GSK Biologicals' vaccine but with Prevenar™.

      The study has 3 groups. 1 group of children primed with GSK Biologicals' pneumococcal
      conjugate vaccine will receive a booster dose of the same vaccine. 2nd group of children
      primed with Prevenar™ will receive a booster dose of Prevenar™ (control group). 3rd group of
      children primed with Prevenar™ will receive a booster dose of GSK Biologicals' pneumococcal
      conjugate vaccine. All children will receive concomitantly a booster dose of DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib
      vaccine.

        <description>A seroprotected subject as regards anti-pneumococcal serotype antibody was defined as a subject with anti-pneumococcal serotype antibody concentration above than or equal to (≥) 0.20 microgram per millilitre (μg/mL). Anti-pneumococcal serotypes antibodies assessed were antibodies against pneumococcal serotypes 1, 4, 5, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F and 23F (Anti-1, -4, -5, -6B, -7F, 9V, -14, -18C, -19F and -23F). Analysis was performed using the 22F-inhibition Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), using ≥ 0.05 μg/mL as seropositivity cut off. For this endpoint, the analysis was performed on the according-to-protocol cohort for immunogenicity, e. a., evaluable subjects for whom assay results were available for antibodies against at least one study vaccine antigen component after booster vaccination.</description>

        <description>Anti-pneumococcal serotypes 1, 4, 5, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F and 23F antibody concentrations (Anti-1, -4, -5, -6B, -7F, -9V, -14, -18C, -19F and -23F) were calculated, expressed as geometric mean concentrations (GMCs), in microgram per millilitre (µg/mL). The seropositivity cut-off for the assay was ≥ 0.05 µg/mL. Antibody concentrations below the cut-off of the assay were given an arbitrary value of half the cut-off for the purpose of GMC calculation. For this endpoint, the analysis was performed on the according-to-protocol cohort for immunogenicity, e. a., evaluable subjects for whom assay results were available for antibodies against at least one study vaccine antigen component after booster vaccination.</description>

        <population>The analysis was performed on the According-To-Protocol (ATP) Cohort for immunogenecity, which included all evaluable subjects whith available immunogenecity data. This included subjects for whom assay results were available for antibodies against at least one study vaccine antigen component after booster vaccination.</population>

As part of the 105553 study, subjects had received a 3-dose primary vaccination of Synflorix™ vaccine at 2, 3 and 4 months of age (injected intramuscularly [IM] in the right thigh) co-administered with Infanrix hexa™ vaccine, except for the second dose in France, which was co-administered with Infanrix™ IPV Hib, injected intramuscularly in the left thigh. As part of this study, at 12-18 months of age, subjects received a booster dose of Synflorix™ vaccine, injected IM in the right thigh or deltoid, co-administered with Infanrix hexa™ vaccine, injected IM in the left thigh or deltoid.</description>

          <description>Anti-pneumococcal serotypes 1, 4, 5, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F and 23F antibody concentrations (Anti-1, -4, -5, -6B, -7F, -9V, -14, -18C, -19F and -23F) were calculated, expressed as geometric mean concentrations (GMCs), in microgram per millilitre (µg/mL). The seropositivity cut-off for the assay was ≥ 0.05 µg/mL. Antibody concentrations below the cut-off of the assay were given an arbitrary value of half the cut-off for the purpose of GMC calculation. For this endpoint, the analysis was performed on the according-to-protocol cohort for immunogenicity, e. a., evaluable subjects for whom assay results were available for antibodies against at least one study vaccine antigen component after booster vaccination.</description>
          <population>The analysis was performed on the According-To-Protocol (ATP) Cohort for immunogenecity, which included all evaluable subjects whith available immunogenecity data. This included subjects for whom assay results were available for antibodies against at least one study vaccine antigen component after booster vaccination.</population>

        <description>OPA titers against pneumococcal serotypes 1, 4, 5, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F and 23F (Opsono-1, -4, -5, -6B, -7F, -9V, -14, -18C, -19F and -23F) were calculated, expressed as geometric mean titers (GMTs) and tabulated. The seropositivity cut-off for the assay was ≥ 8. Antibody titers below the cut-off of the assay were given an arbitrary value of half the cut-off for the purpose of GMT calculation. For this endpoint, the analysis was performed on the according-to-protocol cohort for immunogenicity, e. a., evaluable subjects for whom assay results were available for antibodies against at least one study vaccine antigen component after booster vaccination.</description>

        <title>Antibody Concentrations to Protein D (Anti-PD) - by Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA)</title>
        <description>Anti-protein D (Anti-PD) antibody concentrations by Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) were calculated, expressed as geometric mean concentrations (GMCs) in ELISA unit per milli-liter (EL.U/mL) and tabulated. The seropositivity cut-off for the assay was ≥ 100 EL.U/mL. Antibody concentrations below the cut-off of the assay were given an arbitrary value of half the cut-off for the purpose of GMC calculation. For this endpoint, the analysis was performed on the according-to-protocol cohort for immunogenicity, e. a., evaluable subjects for whom assay results were available for antibodies against at least one study vaccine antigen component after booster vaccination.</description>

As part of the 105553 study, subjects had received a 3-dose primary vaccination of Synflorix™ vaccine at 2, 3 and 4 months of age (injected intramuscularly [IM] in the right thigh) co-administered with Infanrix hexa™ vaccine, except for the second dose in France, which was co-administered with Infanrix™ IPV Hib, injected intramuscularly in the left thigh. As part of this study, at 12-18 months of age, subjects received a booster dose of Synflorix™ vaccine, injected IM in the right thigh or deltoid, co-administered with Infanrix hexa™ vaccine, injected IM in the left thigh or deltoid.</description>

        <title>Anti-polyribosyl Ribitol Phosphate (Anti-PRP) Antibody Concentrations</title>
        <description>Anti-PRP antibody concentrations were calculated, expressed as geometric mean concentrations (GMCs), in microgram per milliliter (µg/mL), and tabulated. The seroprotection cut-off for the assay for the purpose of this endpoint was ≥ 0.15 µg/mL. Antibody concentrations below the cut-off of the assay were given an arbitrary value of half the cut-off for the purpose of GMC calculation. For this endpoint, the analysis was performed on the according-to-protocol cohort for immunogenicity, e. a., evaluable subjects for whom assay results were available for antibodies against at least one study vaccine antigen component after booster vaccination.</description>

        <description>Anti-D and Anti-TT antibody concentrations were calculated, expressed as geometric mean concentrations (GMCs), in International units per milliliter (IU/mL), and tabulated. The seropositivity cut-off for the assay was ≥ 0.1 IU/mL. Antibody concentrations below the cut-off of the assay were given an arbitrary value of half the cut-off for the purpose of GMC calculation. For this endpoint, the analysis was performed on the according-to-protocol cohort for immunogenicity, e. a., evaluable subjects for whom assay results were available for antibodies against at least one study vaccine antigen component after booster vaccination.</description>

        <description>Anti-Polio 1, 2 and 3 antibody titers were calculated, expressed as geometric mean titers (GMTs) and tabulated. The seroprotection cut-off for the assay was ≥ 8. Antibody titers below the cut-off of the assay were given an arbitrary value of half the cut-off for the purpose of GMT calculation. For this endpoint, the analysis was performed on the according-to-protocol cohort for immunogenicity, e. a., evaluable subjects for whom assay results were available for antibodies against at least one study vaccine antigen component after booster vaccination.</description>

A seropositive/seronegative subject as regards Anti-PT/-FHA/ -PRN antibodies was defined as a subject with anti-PT/-FHA/ -PRN antibody concentrations ≥ 5 Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent assay (ELISA) unit per milli-liter (EL.U/mL)</description>
          <population>The analysis was performed on the According-To-Protocol (ATP) Cohort for immunogenecity, which included all evaluable subjects whith available immunogenecity data. This included subjects for whom assay results were available for antibodies against at least one study vaccine antigen component after booster vaccination.</population>
