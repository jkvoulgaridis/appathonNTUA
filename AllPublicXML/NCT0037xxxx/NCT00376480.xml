      RATIONALE: Giving total-body irradiation and chemotherapy, such as thiotepa and fludarabine,
      before a donor stem cell transplant helps stop the growth of cancer or abnormal cells. It
      also helps stop the patient's immune system from rejecting the donor's stem cells. When the
      healthy stem cells from a donor are infused into the patient they may help the patient's bone
      marrow make stem cells, red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. Sometimes the
      transplanted cells from a donor can make an immune response against the body's normal cells.
      Giving methylprednisolone and antithymocyte globulin before transplant and peripheral blood
      cells that have been treated in the laboratory after transplant may stop this from happening.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of laboratory-treated
      peripheral blood cell infusion after donor stem cell transplant in treating patients with
      hematologic cancers or other diseases.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Establish the feasibility of delayed infusion of ex vivo anergized donor peripheral
           blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) after CD34 (cluster designation 34)-selected megadose
           haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in patients with
           hematopoietic cancers or other diseases.

        -  Determine the feasibility of collecting parental allogeneic stimulator cells to induce
           anergy to the nonshared donor-recipient haplotype in these patients.

        -  Determine the feasibility of collecting donor PBMC as a source of T cells for ex vivo
           anergization.

        -  Determine the number of transplanted individuals who meet the criteria for proceeding to
           delayed infusion of ex vivo anergized donor PBMC.

        -  Establish the safety of delayed infusion of ex vivo anergized donor PBMC by establishing
           the maximum number of donor T cells that can be infused without unacceptable
           graft-versus-host disease.

      Secondary

        -  Evaluate, in vitro, the induction and specificity of alloantigen hyporesponsiveness in
           donor PBMC after ex vivo anergization.

        -  Assess, in vitro, the function of immune cells engrafted in these patients.

        -  Assess, in vitro, whether alloantigen hyporesponsive donor T cells are present in these
           patients.

        -  Develop, preliminarily, in vitro data on the extent of pathogen-specific immunity and
           its rate of recovery.

        -  Describe the patterns of opportunistic infections in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of ex vivo anergized allogeneic
      peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Patients who are treated on any dose level except
      dose level 1 are stratified according to age (under 17 [pediatric] vs 17 and over [adult]).

        -  Myeloablative conditioning regimen: Patients undergo total-body irradiation twice daily
           on days -11 to -9. Patients also receive thiotepa IV over 4 hours on days -8 and -7,
           fludarabine phosphate IV over 30 minutes on days -7 to -3, and anti-thymocyte globulin
           IV over 8 hours and methylprednisolone IV over 15-30 minutes on days -6 to -3.

        -  Allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT): Patients undergo
           CD34-selected PBSCT on day 0.

        -  Ex vivo anergized allogeneic PBMC infusion: If cells have engrafted and patients are
           free of active uncontrolled infection and graft-vs-host disease, patients undergo
           allogeneic or autologous PBMC infusion on day 35 or 42.

      Cohorts of 3-8 patients receive escalating doses of ex vivo anergized allogeneic PBMCs until
      the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose at which 2 of
      5 or 3 of 8 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      After completion of study, patients are followed periodically for 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 patients will be accrued for this study.
