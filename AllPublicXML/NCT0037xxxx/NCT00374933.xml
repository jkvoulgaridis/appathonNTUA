  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a new platform in non-myeloablative allogeneic stem cell transplantation to improve
      survival by harnessing the immunologic potential of donor T-cells to induce and maintain
      long-term remissions in patients with hematologic malignancies without undue toxicity. This
      study involves is the first study in humans directed at optimizing the graft vs leukemia
      effect by infusing activated T-cells from healthy donors prophylactically, months after
      recovery from the initial transplant. Investigators are studying whether the activation of
      donor cells prior to infusion will enhance the patient's ability to &quot;seek and destroy&quot;
      residual malignant cells while also helping the immune system to fight infection without
      increasing the immune reaction against the host.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Patient-related Parameters:

          -  Patients must have a healthy histocompatible donor (A, B and DR match); either sibling
             or unrelated volunteer identified through the NMDP

          -  Age between 18 and 70 years old

          -  Life expectancy greater than 3 months.

          -  ECOG performance status 0-1.

          -  Patients must have acceptable organ function:

          -  total bilirubin &lt;2.0

          -  AST and ALT &lt; 3 x normal, unless increases are thought to be either from non-hepatic
             causes (i.e hemolysis) or related to underlying disease (such as liver involvement
             with leukemia);

          -  creatinine &lt;2.0 or creatinine clearance &gt;40 ml/min (calculated or collected);

          -  Cardiac: An ejection fraction &gt;40% on MUGA or echocardiogram;

          -  Pulmonary: corrected DLCO &gt;50%

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Subjects:

          -  Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks prior to entering
             the study. Patients must have recovered from adverse events due to agents administered
             more than 4 weeks earlier.

          -  Patients with uncontrolled or untreated central nervous system involvement

          -  Patients with uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing
             or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris,
             cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit
             compliance with study requirements.

          -  HIV positive patients are excluded

          -  Pregnant women

          -  Patients who are breastfeeding

        Donors:

          -  Sibling donors will be evaluated according to the standard practice of the University
             of Pennsylvania Bone Marrow and Stem Cell Transplant Program

          -  Unrelated donor evaluations and consent will be performed by an NMDP donor center
             according to standard guidelines and procedures.
