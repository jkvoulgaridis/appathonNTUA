  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial is looking to gain information about the safety and tolerability of an
      investigational treatment (SHP623) in healthy adult volunteers. This study will also collect
      pharmacokinetic data (how the body absorbs and breaks down the study drug).

    <description>An adverse event (AE) was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a pharmaceutical product and that did not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE was considered to be a TEAE in a specific treatment period of the study if the date and time of onset were after investigational product administration in that period and if it occurred less than equals to (&lt;=) Day 28 and was both not present at the start of that period and was not a chronic condition that was part of the participant's medical history, or it was present at the start of that period or as part of the participant's medical history but the severity or frequency increased during that period &lt;= Day 28. An SAE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence (whether considered to be related to investigational product or not) that at any dose.</description>
