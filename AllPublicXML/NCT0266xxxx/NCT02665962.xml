  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      80% of endometrial cancer patients are overweight or obese. Preclinical and clinical data
      have shown that caloric restriction (CR) protects against organ injury and decreases
      perioperative morbidity. This is a feasibility trial to evaluate the effect of a 6 week
      perioperative CR on surgical and patient-reported outcomes in 20 obese newly diagnosed
      endometrial cancer patients. The intervention will provide individualized CR program, meal
      replacement products and nutritional counselling sessions.
