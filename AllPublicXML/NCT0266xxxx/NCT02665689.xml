  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the prospective randomized study is to investigate whether a intensified diabetic
      control program leads to better final visual acuity and less frequent diabetic ocular
      complications in patients with diabetic retinopathy when compared with a normal diabetic
      treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with diabetic macular edema (DME) will be treated with intravitreal ranibizumab
      injections and the effect of optimal control of internal factors (eg. glycemia, blood
      pressure etc) on final functional (best corrected visual acuity-CBVA) and morphological
      (central retinal thickness-CRT) will be investigated. Patients will be randomized into two
      groups: Group with intensified diabetic control will be follow and investigated monthly at
      department of diabetology, endocrinology and nutritional medicine (Campus Benjamin Franklin)
      in Berlin with aim to reach the optimal glycemic control defined as HbA1c &lt; 6,5%. Further,
      triglycerides values &lt; 140 mg/dl and blood pressure &lt; 140/90 mmHg will be pursued. Second
      group of patients will be followed by their general practitioner and in the study center only
      blood samples will be taken quarterly without active medical intervention.

      BCVA, CRT and the number of required ranibizumab injections will we evaluated and compared
      between both study groups.

    <measure>Number of Treatments With Ranibizumab up to 6, 12, 18 and 24 Months of Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>For the number of treatments at 6, 12, 18 and 24 months, an ANOVA without any covariates was planned to be applied at each endpoint 6, 12, 18 and 24 months.
As the time point 12 months for the evaluation of this secondary endpoint was reached only for patients of study arm B, a comparison of both study arms was not possible and thus statistical analysis of the endpoint was waived completely. None of the patients reached time points beyond month 12.
Results are only shown descriptively. Ranibizumab injections were summed up per study arm as well as cumulative at each time point.</description>

    <measure>Difference of Best Corrected Visual Acuity Measured in ETDRS Letters Score Between Month 6, 12, 24 and Baseline Visit</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>As the time point 12 months for the evaluation of this secondary endpoint was reached only for patients of study arm B, a comparison of both study arms was not possible and thus analysis of the endpoint was waived completely. Time point 24 months was reached by none of the patients due to trial discontinuation. Results are only shown descriptively.
Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) score is shown as change in ETDRS letters score at the distinct time point compared to baseline. Higher scores mean a better outcome.</description>

    <description>As the time point 12 months for the evaluation of this secondary endpoint was reached only for patients of study arm B, a comparison of both study arms was not possible and thus analysis of the endpoint was waived completely. None of the patients reached time points beyond month 12 due to trial discontinuation. Results are only shown descriptively.
Macular thickness (study eye) is shown as change in thickness [µm] compared to individual baseline value. A reduction in thickness means improvement.</description>

    <description>Need for PRP is up to the investigator's decision. Assessment was done on every visit.
Intended time frame was baseline to 24 months. None of the patients reached time points beyond month 12 due to study discontinuation.
Unit of measure is any separate investigator's decision to perform panretinal laser photocoagulation (PRP) for neovascular complications. Each PRP is counted separately.</description>

Patients randomized into this group will be controlled at the trial site (Department of diabetology, endocrinology and nutritional medicine) during first year monthly, in the second study year every 3 months. The individual HbA1c will be targeted according to the general status reflecting other risk factors for the vasculopathy (e.g. BMI, smoking, blood pressure, lipid status). All effort will be done to reach the target blood pressure ≤ 140/90 mmHg and blood triglyceride level &lt; 140 mg/dl: Further the patients will be educated to improve their eating habits in regard to reduce the carbohydrate intake.</description>
