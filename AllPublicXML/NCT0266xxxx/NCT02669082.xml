    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate exploratorily the effect of ramelteon 8 mg once
      daily for 8 weeks in the treatment of insomnia patients with depression by using actigraphy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called ramelteon. Ramelteon is being tested to treat
      people who have insomnia with depression. This study will look at sleep activity of
      participants who take ramelteon.

      The study will enroll approximately 30 patients. Participants will be administered:

      â€¢ Ramelteon 8 mg

      Participants will be asked to take 1 tablet orally at bedtime. This multi-center study will
      be conducted in Japan. The overall period to participate in this study is 9 weeks (Run-in
      period for 1 week and treatment period for 8 weeks). Participants will make multiple visits
      to clinic including the final visit 8 weeks after the start of treatment.

    <description>Sleep latency was defined as time period measured from &quot;lights out,&quot; or bedtime, to the beginning of sleep. Sleep latency was assessed by actigraphy, a non-intrusive tool that measures an individual's movement during sleep. Mean value from the past 7 days was evaluated. A negative change from Baseline indicates improvement.</description>

    <description>Sleep latency was defined as time period measured from &quot;lights out,&quot; or bedtime, to the beginning of sleep. Sleep latency was recorded by the participant in a diary. Mean value from the past 7 days at each timepoint was evaluated. A negative change from Baseline indicates improvement.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and the end of the Treatment Period (up to Week 8)</time_frame>
    <description>Total nocturnal sleep time was assessed by actigraphy, a non-intrusive tool that measures an individual's movement during sleep. Total nocturnal sleep time by actigraphy was total time in bed from which sleep latency, nocturnal wake time, and the time from waking up to leaving the bed were subtracted. Mean value from the past 7 days at each timepoint was evaluated. A positive change from Baseline indicates improvement.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and the end of the Treatment Period (up to Week 8)</time_frame>
    <description>Nocturnal wake time is the total time that is scored between nocturnal sleep onset and final wake-up. Nocturnal wake time was assessed by actigraphy, a non-intrusive tool that measures an individual's movement during sleep. Mean value from the past 7 days at each timepoint was evaluated. A positive change from Baseline indicates a worsening.</description>

    <description>The number of nocturnal awakenings were assessed by actigraphy which is a non-intrusive tool that measures an individual's movement during sleep. Mean value from the past 7 days at each time point was evaluated. A positive change from Baseline indicates a worsening.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Actigraphy-Measured Sleep Efficiency at the End of the Treatment Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and the end of the Treatment Period (up to Week 8)</time_frame>
    <description>Sleep efficiency was defined as percentage of sleep in the period potentially filled by sleep-ratio of total sleep time to time in bed calculated as [(Total sleep time/total time in bed) * 100]. Sleep efficiency was assessed by actigraphy, a non-intrusive tool that measures an individual's movement during sleep. Mean value from the past 7 days at each timepoint was evaluated. A positive change from Baseline indicates improvement.</description>
