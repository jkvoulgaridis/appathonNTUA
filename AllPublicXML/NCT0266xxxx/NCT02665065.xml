    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate the efficacy of Iomab-B, in conjunction
      with a Reduced Intensity Conditioning (RIC) regimen and protocol-specified allogeneic
      hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HCT), versus Conventional Care in patients with Active,
      Relapsed or Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML).

    <textblock>
      SIERRA is a pivotal Phase 3 randomized controlled study of Iomab-B in Relapsed or Refractory
      AML patients. The SIERRA trial has a primary endpoint of durable Complete Remission (dCR) at
      six months and a secondary endpoint of overall survival at one year. Iomab-B is intended to
      prepare and condition patients for a bone marrow transplant, also referred to as a
      hematopoietic stem cell transplant, in a potentially safer and more efficacious manner than
      intensive chemotherapy conditioning that is the current standard of care in bone marrow
      transplant conditioning.

             refractory AML is defined as any one of the following (1) primary induction failure,
             or (PIF) after 2 or more cycles of therapy, or (2) first early relapse after a
             remission duration of fewer than 6 months, or (3) relapse refractory to salvage
             combination chemotherapy containing high-dose AraC, or (4) second or subsequent
             relapse

          -  Have documented CD45 expression by leukemic cells via flow cytometry (a &quot;blast gate&quot;
             on CD45 vs. side scatter analysis consistent with AML)

          -  Be at least 55 years of age

          -  Have an expected survival of &gt; 60 days

             active with women of childbearing potential must be surgically sterile or using an
             acceptable method of contraception (defined as barrier methods in conjunction with
