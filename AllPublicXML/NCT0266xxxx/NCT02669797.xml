  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study is a 12-month, individual randomized controlled trial (RCT). The main aim
      of the study is to decrease childhood obesity and improve child diet quality in children ages
      5-8 years old by increasing family meal quality (i.e., dietary intake, interpersonal
      atmosphere) and quantity (i.e., frequency of family meals) via innovative technology (i.e.,
      ecological momentary intervention (EMI), video feedback) and partnerships with primary care
      and Community Health Workers (CHWs).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The RCT has the following three arms: (1) Ecological Momentary Intervention (EMI); (2) EMI +
      Home Visiting (HV); (3) EMI + HV + Video feedback. Delivery of the intervention will last 6
      months for each family, with a 6-month post-intervention evaluation visit. All arms will
      receive EMI family meal tips via smartphones for 16 weeks. Arms 2 and 3 will also receive 16
      weeks of in-home training, with 8 weeks (every other week) in-home education visits with a
      CHW focused on family meal quality and quantity and a family meal preparation activity and 8
      weeks &quot;Try it Yourself&quot; activities that reinforce the messages and skills taught by a CHW.
      Additionally, Arm 3 will receive video feedback from family's video-recorded family meals by
      a CHW focusing on family behaviors related to family meal quality and quantity. (EMI, in-home
      training, and video-feedback will occur during the same 16-week period.) After families have
      completed 16 weeks of the intervention, a 8-week maintenance phase will ensue. Having a
      maintenance phase is an evidence-based intervention component and will provide incrementally
      less support to families to build self-efficacy and increase sustainability of new behaviors.
      Over time, participants will receive less study support to evaluate if participants have
      internalized healthful behaviors. During the maintenance phase EMI meal tips will be reduced
      to only the days in which parents report their highest stress levels for all arms. The study
      will last 12 months, with three assessment time points including, baseline, 6 months (i.e.,
      post-intervention) and 12 months.

      Children ages 5-8 and family members (i.e., parent/primary caregiver, siblings) from
      low-income and diverse households (i.e., African American, Hispanic, Native American, White)
      - who are at high risk for obesity - will be recruited for the study. Theory informs the
      intervention study design, research questions and related hypotheses, methods, measurement,
      and analysis. Family Systems Theory drives the decision to direct the intervention at the
      &quot;family unit&quot; to increase the likelihood of individual and family-level weight and
      weight-related behavior change and sustainability. Additionally, partnerships with existing
      community-based healthcare systems and CHWs will be utilized to reach participants in
      community settings where they have existing relationships and resources.

      This study utilizes innovative and research-informed intervention components (i.e., in-home
      visiting, EMI, video-feedback) to increase the likelihood of intervention effectiveness and
      sustainability. The &quot;Family Matters&quot; study will be carried out across two Phases, an R61
      Phase and an R33 Phase. Specific aims for each Phase are described below:

      Specific Aims for the R61 Phase:

        -  Aim 1: Organize and prepare the study team, project materials, study protocols, and
           procedures. Aim 1 success will be measured by meeting established R61 Planning Phase
           transition milestones.

        -  Aim 2: Test recruitment, data collection, intervention protocols, and retention in the
           first 42 participants (4 per study arm and about equal numbers byrace/ethnicity). Aim 2
           success will be measured by meeting transition milestones.

      Specific Aims for the R33 Phase:

      • Aim 1 (Primary Outcomes): Conduct a three-arm RCT comparing EMI, EMI+HV, and EMI+HV+Video
      Feedback in diverse children ages 5-8 and their families to test the hypotheses that:

      Hypothesis 1: BMI percentile will decrease and diet quality will increase in children in the
      EMI+HV+Video Feedback arm compared to children in the EMI or EMI+HV arms.

      • Aim 2 (Secondary Outcomes): Examine intervention effects on familial, parental, and sibling
      factors.

      Hypothesis 1: Family meal quality and quantity will increase in households with children in
      the EMI+HV+ Video Feedback arm compared to children in the EMI or EMI+HV arms.

      Hypothesis 2: Controlling feeding practices (e.g., restriction) will decrease and coping
      skills will increase in parents in the EMI+HV+Video Feedback arm compared to parents in the
      EMI or EMI+HV arms.

      Hypothesis 3: BMI percentile will decrease in siblings in the EMI+HV+Video Feedback arm
      compared to siblings in the EMI or EMI+HV arms.

      • Aim 3: Examine cost effectiveness and feasibility of intervention implementation in primary
      care.

      Hypothesis 1: The BMI z-score reduction resulting from the intervention will be
      cost-effective.

    <masking_description>Like most behavioral interventions, it is not possible to double blind this RCT because interventionists will be delivering the in-home visiting components to participants. However, the proposed study incorporates participant, study staff, physician, and investigator blinding as much as possible. The intervention will be administered by trained staff assigned to the intervention team, who will not be involved with evaluation team responsibilities/meetings. Evaluation team members will carry out all measurement home visits and will be blinded to participant study arm assignment. They will not be involved with intervention team responsibilities/meetings. Specific co-investigators are responsible for training and supervising staff within the intervention team versus the evaluation team in to order to blind as many co-investigators as possible.</masking_description>

    <description>Families will participate in twelve in-home education activities. The visits will focus on family meal quality (dietary, interpersonal) and quantity (meal frequency) factors found in prior studies to be associated with child weight and weight-related behaviors. Eight of the visits (every other week) will be delivered by a CHW and will last 90 minutes. Additionally ,a family meal food preparation activity will occur to help support families in learning skills to increase family meal quality and quantity. On weeks opposite of the in-home education visits with a CHW, families will be given a &quot;Try it Yourself&quot; activity to reinforce the messages (e.g., use family meals as a family connection time) and skills (e.g., recipe that requires families to steam vegetables) taught by the CHW during the in-home education visits.</description>

    <description>Parents will receive daily EMI messages regarding suggestions for increasing meal quality/quantity via a smartphone application, based on the stress level and source of stress they reported earlier in the day. Specifically, parents will receive two push notifications in the morning to report their stress level and type/source of stress (e.g., work, children, finances). Then, based on the reported stress level and source of stress, parents will be texted tips/ideas for carrying out a nutritionally and emotionally healthful family meal the same night, in the face of stress. If parents report no stress on their EMI measure earlier in the day, they will be provided with a menu of options regarding what type of meal tip they would prefer later in the day (e.g., recipe ideas, meal prep tips, mealtime conversation starters. Parents will be able to respond to the EMI messages indicating preferred tips so that EMI tips become more meaningful/relevant to the needs of each family.</description>

    <description>Parents will video-record and upload via an iPad (study provided) one family meal every other week, which will be watched by intervention staff. Using Motivational Interviewing, CHWs will give specific feedback on how to adapt negative mealtime behaviors and provide reinforcement for positive behaviors seen in the videos, based on a validated interpersonal coding tool called the Iowa Family Interaction Rating Scales (IFIRS). Additionally, feedback will be given on the dietary healthfulness of the meal, based on a validated coding tool called the Healthfulness of Meal Index (HOM). After feedback, family members will be taught specific skills to improve their family meal processes and behaviors that vary from food preparation skills, to increasing healthful food options at meals, or role-playing family interactions to improve the emotional atmosphere at the meal. Families will also set SMART goals at each visit regarding family meal quality and quantity.</description>

    <description>After 16 weeks, EMI family meal tips for all arms will be reduced to only the days in which parent's report their highest stress levels. Stress profiles will be created for each parent in order to tailor the EMI family meals tips to days in which they experience their highest levels of stress. For example, during the 16-weeks of EMI, a parent may report their highest stress levels on Tuesdays and Thursdays. The stress profile that would be created for the parent during the maintenance phase would include receiving text messages only on Tuesdays and Thursdays. The parent would then receive these EMI family meal tips only on Tuesdays and Thursdays throughout the 8-week maintenance phase..</description>

        STUDY INCLUSION CRITERIA

        The inclusionary criteria used to select participants for the proposed study includes:

          1. Boys and girls (n=510) ages 5-8 years old who attend a University of Minnesota
             Physicians (n=4) or Fairview (n=8) primary care clinic and their primary caregiver
             (e.g., mother, father, grandparent) and at least one sibling. A second primary
             caregiver and other family members can also participate.

          2. Must eat ≤3 family dinner meals per week. Research shows that youth who have more than
             three family meals per week are less likely to be obese ten years later. Thus,
             families who report three or fewer family meals per week will be recruited to optimize
             the potential for change in family meal frequency. Families will focus on the family
             dinner in the intervention to improve their family meal quality and quantity. This
             decision is based on: (1) Family Systems Theory, which indicates that change in one
             setting (e.g., family dinner) will generalize to other settings (e.g., breakfast,
             lunch, snacks).

          3. Child with age and sex adjusted BMI ≥85th percentile (no upper limit).

          4. One of the following race/ethnicities: African American, Hispanic/Latino, Native
             American, or White. In order to examine racial/ethnic differences in study hypotheses,
             equal numbers of children per racial/ethnic group (total=510) will be recruited.

          5. Parent and family members who speak English or Spanish.

          6. Not expected to move within the next two years.

        STUDY EXCLUSION CRITERIA

        The exclusionary criteria used to exclude participants from the proposed study includes:

          1. Children with medically necessary dietary restrictions (reviewed by MD from primary
             care clinics).

          2. Non-custodial parents, who the child does not live with more than 50% of the time.
