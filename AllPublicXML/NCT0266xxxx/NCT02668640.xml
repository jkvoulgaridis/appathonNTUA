      The objective of this study was to assess the effectiveness of adalimumab on health and
      disability outcomes in participants with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in China.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was a prospective, multicenter, observational study to assess the effectiveness of
      adalimumab on health-related quality of life (QoL) and work productivity in participants with
      rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in routine clinical practice in China. The decision to prescribe
      adalimumab for RA was based on clinical practice criteria without taking participation in
      this study into account. Participants were included in the study after a physician's decision
      of initiating adalimumab treatment. Participants were followed for 24 weeks, with scheduled
      study visits at baseline, Week 12 and Week 24.

    <measure>Median Change From Baseline in Health Assessment Questionnaire- Disability Index (HAQ-DI) Score at Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The Health Assessment Questionnaire - Disability Index (HAQ-DI) is a participant-reported questionnaire specific for rheumatoid arthritis. It consists of 20 questions referring to eight domains: dressing/grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and daily activities. Participants assessed their ability to do each task over the past week using the following response categories: without any difficulty (0); with some difficulty (1); with much difficulty (2); and unable to do (3). Scores on each task were summed and averaged to provide an overall score ranging from 0 to 3, where zero represents no disability and three very severe, high-dependency disability. A negative median indicates improvement from baseline.</description>

    <measure>Median Change From Baseline in Short Form 36-Item Health Survey (SF-36) Physical Component Summary (PCS) Score and Mental Component Summary (MCS) Scores at Weeks 12 and 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12, and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-36v2 is a non-disease specific Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) instrument. The SF-36v2 comprises 36 total items (questions) targeting a subject's functional health and well-being in 8 domains (physical functioning, role physical, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, role emotional and mental health) with a recall period of four weeks. Domain scores are aggregated into a Physical Component Summary (PCS) score and a Mental Component Summary (MCS) score. SF-36v2 PCS and MCS scores range from 1-100: higher scores indicate a better state of health and an increase from baseline represents improvement.</description>

    <measure>Median Change From Baseline in EuroQol 5-dimension, 3-level Quality of Life Questionnaire (EQ-5D-3L) Index</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12, and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D-3L measures the participant's overall health state in a descriptive system of health-related quality of life (QoL) states consisting of five dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression) each of which has three response choices. The responses record three levels of severity ('no problems', 'having some or moderate problems', and 'being unable to do/extreme problems') within a particular EQ-5D-3L dimension. In addition, a 20 cm visual analogue scale (VAS) measures the participant's self-rated current health state on a scale from 0-100, from 0 (worst imaginable health state) to 100 ('best imaginable health state). The EQ-5D-3L results were converted into a weighted health state index with scores ranging from approximately 0 (death) to 1 (full health). A positive change from baseline indicates improvement.</description>

    <measure>Median Change From Baseline in Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire (WPAI) Overall Work Impairment Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12, and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire (WPAI) is a participant-reported questionnaire to measure work and activity impairment during the past seven days. The 'overall work impairment due to health problem' was calculated based on three items: (Q2) the number of hours missed from work due to health problems in the past seven days from visit; (Q4) the number of actual work hours in the past seven days from visit; and (Q5) to what degree did the participant's rheumatoid arthritis impair the productivity while working past seven days from visit). Data were calculated using the formula Q2/(Q2+Q4)+[(1-(Q2/(Q2+Q4))x(Q5/10)] and converted to percent, with higher numbers indicating greater impairment and less productivity. Negative values indicate improvement from baseline.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12, and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire (WPAI) is a participant-reported questionnaire to measure work and activity impairment during the past seven days. Activity impairment was calculated via WPAI question 6, the participant's rating of how much rheumatoid arthritis affected their ability to do regular daily activities, other than working at a job (0 = no effect; 10 = completely impacted productivity) / 10 * 100. Negative values indicate improvement from baseline.</description>

          <title>Mean Baseline DAS28 score</title>
          <description>The Disease Activity Score 28 (DAS28) is a validated index of rheumatoid arthritis disease activity. Twenty-eight tender joint counts, 28 swollen joint counts, the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) or C-reactive protein (CRP) level, and the participant’s assessment of global disease activity (on a visual analog scale [VAS] from 0 to 10 cm) are included in the score. Scores range from 0 to 10; higher scores indicate more disease activity. A DAS28 score &gt;5.1 indicates high disease activity, a score &lt;3.2 indicates low disease activity, and a score &lt;2.6 indicates clinical remission.</description>

        <title>Median Change From Baseline in Health Assessment Questionnaire- Disability Index (HAQ-DI) Score at Week 24</title>
        <description>The Health Assessment Questionnaire - Disability Index (HAQ-DI) is a participant-reported questionnaire specific for rheumatoid arthritis. It consists of 20 questions referring to eight domains: dressing/grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and daily activities. Participants assessed their ability to do each task over the past week using the following response categories: without any difficulty (0); with some difficulty (1); with much difficulty (2); and unable to do (3). Scores on each task were summed and averaged to provide an overall score ranging from 0 to 3, where zero represents no disability and three very severe, high-dependency disability. A negative median indicates improvement from baseline.</description>

        <description>The SF-36v2 is a non-disease specific Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) instrument. The SF-36v2 comprises 36 total items (questions) targeting a subject's functional health and well-being in 8 domains (physical functioning, role physical, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, role emotional and mental health) with a recall period of four weeks. Domain scores are aggregated into a Physical Component Summary (PCS) score and a Mental Component Summary (MCS) score. SF-36v2 PCS and MCS scores range from 1-100: higher scores indicate a better state of health and an increase from baseline represents improvement.</description>

        <title>Median Change From Baseline in EuroQol 5-dimension, 3-level Quality of Life Questionnaire (EQ-5D-3L) Index</title>
        <description>The EQ-5D-3L measures the participant's overall health state in a descriptive system of health-related quality of life (QoL) states consisting of five dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression) each of which has three response choices. The responses record three levels of severity ('no problems', 'having some or moderate problems', and 'being unable to do/extreme problems') within a particular EQ-5D-3L dimension. In addition, a 20 cm visual analogue scale (VAS) measures the participant's self-rated current health state on a scale from 0-100, from 0 (worst imaginable health state) to 100 ('best imaginable health state). The EQ-5D-3L results were converted into a weighted health state index with scores ranging from approximately 0 (death) to 1 (full health). A positive change from baseline indicates improvement.</description>

        <description>The Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire (WPAI) is a participant-reported questionnaire to measure work and activity impairment during the past seven days. The 'overall work impairment due to health problem' was calculated based on three items: (Q2) the number of hours missed from work due to health problems in the past seven days from visit; (Q4) the number of actual work hours in the past seven days from visit; and (Q5) to what degree did the participant's rheumatoid arthritis impair the productivity while working past seven days from visit). Data were calculated using the formula Q2/(Q2+Q4)+[(1-(Q2/(Q2+Q4))x(Q5/10)] and converted to percent, with higher numbers indicating greater impairment and less productivity. Negative values indicate improvement from baseline.</description>

        <description>The Health Assessment Questionnaire - Disability Index (HAQ-DI) is a participant-reported questionnaire specific for rheumatoid arthritis. It consists of 20 questions referring to eight domains: dressing/grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and daily activities. Participants assessed their ability to do each task over the past week using the following response categories: without any difficulty (0); with some difficulty (1); with much difficulty (2); and unable to do (3). Scores on each task were summed and averaged to provide an overall score ranging from 0 to 3, where zero represents no disability and three very severe, high-dependency disability. The minimal clinically important difference (MCID) defined for the HAQ-DI is ≥ 0.22.</description>

Scores on each task were summed and averaged to provide an overall score ranging from 0 to 3, where zero represents no disability and three very severe, high-dependency disability. The minimal clinically important difference (MCID) defined for the HAQ-DI is ≥ 0.22.</description>
