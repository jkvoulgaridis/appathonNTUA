    <textblock>
      This study (Part 2) is designed to build a database including EEG, neurocognitive
      performance, clinical symptoms, history and other relevant data, which will be used to derive
      a multimodal EEG based algorithm for the identification of concussion and tracking of
      recovery. In addition, neuroimaging will be conducted at time of injury and following Return
      to Play (RTP).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Injured/concussed subjects will be studied at time of injury, and at 3 follow-up time points
      following injury. Matched controls will be tested following the same schedule as the injured
      athletes. In addition, the study will include an additional pool of contact and non-contact
      athletes who are not head injured and will be assessed prior to the season and then after the
      season has ended. This data will be used to populate a database for the purpose of deriving a
      multimodal concussion index.

    <arm_group_label>Injured and Matched Control Subject Pool</arm_group_label>
    <description>Injured subjects consist of athletes who are head injured and meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria. Injured subjects will be tested within 72 hours (3 days) of injury and at specified time points post injury. Matched control subjects will be tested at the same time intervals as the injured subject. BrainScope Battery will be performed at each time point and consists of the following components: brain electrical activity (EEG), neurocognitive performance assessment, balance/sway measurement, and clinical symptoms/assessments. In addition, a subset of injured and matched control subjects will receive advanced MRI/DTI neuroimaging at time of injury and following RTP.</description>
  </arm_group>
  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Pre-Season and Post-Season Subject Pool</arm_group_label>
    <description>This subject pool will consist of uninjured (not head injured) contact and non-contact athletes and will be tested at two time points - pre-season and post-season. These subjects will perform the same BrainScope Battery as the injured and matched control subjects at each time points.</description>

    <description>The BrainScope Battery evaluation will consist of 4 tests to aid in the assessment of concussion: History, Physical, signs and symptoms (SAC, SCAT3), Electrophysiological Function; Neurocognitive Performance Assessment and a balance/sway measurement. BrainScope Ahead 200iD device will be used to perform EEG.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Concussion-Injury subjects will be defined as follows: Any player who, based on
             independent clinical impression, is suspected of having suffered a concussion of any
             severity level, and on whom a routine clinical examination for concussion or head
             injury would have been conducted prior to implementation of this research protocol
             according to current standard practice.

               1. If loss of consciousness, total duration less than &lt;20 minutes

               2. No evidence of abnormality visible on Computerized Tomography (CT) of the head
                  related to the traumatic event (Note: neuroimaging is not required for
                  enrollment)

               3. No hospital admission due to either head injury or collateral injuries for &gt;24
                  hours.

               4. GCS between 13-15

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Do not speak or read English

          2. Current CNS active prescription medications, with the exception of medications being
             taken for the treatment of Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD)

          3. Skull abnormalities, e.g. metal plate

          4. History of brain surgery or neurological disease

          5. Pregnant women.
