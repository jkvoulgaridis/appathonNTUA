  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This open-label, two-part study is designed to assess the safety, PK, PD, and therapeutic
      activity of Selicrelumab in combination with vanucizumab or bevacizumab in participants with
      metastatic solid tumors not amenable to standard treatment. Part I (dose escalation) is
      designed to establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of Selicrelumab in this combination.
      Part II (expansion) is intended to characterize the safety and tolerability of Selicrelumab
      in combination with bevacizumab among indication-specific cohorts and to confirm the
      recommended dose.

Selicrelumab will be given SC in ascending dose levels on Day 2 of Cycles 1 to 4 and every third cycle thereafter. Treatment will continue as long as the participant experiences clinical benefit or until unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or the end of Part I of the study (expected 24 months). Due to the discontinuation of Vanucizumab development, Participants ongoing in Part I will switch from Vanucizumab to Bevacizumab. All the dose escalation has been performed using Vanucizumab.</description>
