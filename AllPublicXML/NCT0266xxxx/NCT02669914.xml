  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Brain metastases are the most common intracranial malignancy occurring in 20-40% of all
      cancers, and the presence of CNS metastases is associated with a poor prognosis. As such, the
      median overall survival of patients with symptomatic brain lesions is a dismal 2-3 months
      regardless of tumor type. Because standard chemotherapy largely does not cross the blood
      brain barrier at a meaningful concentration, standard treatment is limited and usually
      involves surgical resection and/or stereotactic radiosurgery for isolated lesions and whole
      brain radiation for multiple lesions. Unfortunately, the median overall survival is only
      improved by about 6 months with this multimodality approach2, and there is a paucity of
      second-line therapies to treat recurrence. Furthermore, re-resection and re-radiation are
      often not feasible options due to concern for increasing complications or neurotoxicity,
      respectively. Thus, there is a dire clinical need for additional treatment options for this
      patient population.

      Checkpoint blockade therapy, in particular PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibition, has recently shown
      clinical efficacy in multiple types of solid tumors. The investigators propose to study the
      efficacy of checkpoint blockade therapy in patients with solid tumors and
      refractory/recurrent brain metastases. The investigators will assess the efficacy of
      MEDI4736, a novel PD-L1 inhibitory monoclonal antibody, in this study.
