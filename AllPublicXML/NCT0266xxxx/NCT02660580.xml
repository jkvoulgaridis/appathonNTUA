    <measure>Percentage of Participants Who Achieved Psoriasis Area and Severity Index 75 (PASI 75) at Week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>PASI correlates to the physician's assessment of psoriasis symptoms including redness of lesions, thickness of lesions, scaliness of lesions and extent of disease. Each parameter is graded from 0-4, 0 refers to no disease and 4 to severe involvement. The body is divided into 4 areas for scoring (head, arms, trunk to groin, legs to top of buttocks), and the final score ranges from 0-72 with higher scores reflecting more disease severity. The PASI-75 response is defined as the percentage of participants who achieved at least a 75% improvement in PASI score from Baseline.</description>

The participant was asked to indicate his/her current health state by selecting the most appropriate level in each of the 5 dimensions. The responses are converted into a single index value, with scores ranging from -0.594 to 1 (a higher score indicates better health state).</description>

        <title>Percent Change From Baseline in PASI at Week 16</title>
        <description>PASI correlates to the physician's assessment of psoriasis symptoms including redness of lesions, thickness of lesions, scaliness of lesions and extent of disease. Each parameter is graded from 0-4, 0 refers to no disease and 4 to severe involvement. The body is divided into 4 areas for scoring (head, arms, trunk to groin, legs to top of buttocks), and the final score ranges from 0-72, with higher scores reflecting more disease severity. Percent change from Baseline in PASI score was reported.</description>

        <description>PASI correlates to the physician's assessment of psoriasis symptoms including redness of lesions, thickness of lesions, scaliness of lesions and extent of disease. Each parameter is graded from 0-4, 0 refers to no disease and 4 to severe involvement. The body is divided into 4 areas for scoring (head, arms, trunk to groin, legs to top of buttocks), and the final score ranges from 0-72 with higher scores reflecting more disease severity. The PASI 50, 90 and 100 response rate at Week 16 is measured as the percentage of participants who achieved at least 50, 90 and 100% improvement from baseline PASI score at Week 16.</description>

          <title>Percent Change From Baseline in PASI at Week 24 and 52</title>
          <description>PASI correlates to the physician's assessment of psoriasis symptoms including redness of lesions, thickness of lesions, scaliness of lesions and extent of disease. Each parameter is graded from 0-4, 0 refers to no disease and 4 to severe involvement. The body is divided into 4 areas for scoring (head, arms, trunk to groin, legs to top of buttocks), and the final score ranges from 0-72, with higher scores reflecting more disease severity.</description>
          <population>The ETP-PP analysis set was used. Here &quot;Number analyzed&quot; Signifies those participants who were evaluable for this outcome measure at specified time points.</population>

        <title>Time to Achieve PASI 50</title>
        <description>PASI correlates to the physician's assessment of psoriasis symptoms including redness of lesions, thickness of lesions, scaliness of lesions and extent of disease. Each parameter is graded from 0-4, 0 refers to no disease and 4 to severe involvement. The body is divided into 4 areas for scoring (head, arms, trunk to groin, legs to top of buttocks), and the final score ranges from 0-72, with higher scores reflecting more disease severity. Time to achieve at least 50% improvement in PASI from baseline was measured.</description>

        <description>Adverse event(AE) was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in participants which does not necessarily have causal relationship with treatment. AE was any unfavorable and unintended sign(including abnormal laboratory finding), symptom/disease temporally associated with use of medicinal product, whether/not considered related to medicinal product. A serious adverse event(SAE) was AE that resulted in any of the following outcomes: death; life threatening; persistent/significant disability/incapacity; initial/prolonged inpatient hospitalization; congenital anomaly/birth defect or was otherwise considered medically important. Term TEAE is defined as AEs starting/worsening after first intake of the study drug. TEAEs included both Serious TEAEs and non-serious TEAEs.</description>

        <description>PASI correlates to the physician's assessment of psoriasis symptoms including redness of lesions, thickness of lesions, scaliness of lesions and extent of disease. Each parameter is graded from 0-4, 0 refers to no disease and 4 to severe involvement. The body is divided into 4 areas for scoring (head, arms, trunk to groin, legs to top of buttocks), and the final score ranges from 0-72 with higher scores reflecting more disease severity. The PASI-75 response is defined as the percentage of participants who achieved at least a 75% improvement in PASI score from Baseline.</description>

        <description>The DLQI is a 10-item validated quality-of-life questionnaire that covers 6 domains: symptoms and feelings, daily activities, leisure, work and school, personal relationships, and treatment. The DLQI measures how much participant's skin problems has affected his life. Responses range from 0=Not at all to 3=Very much. The DLQI total score is the sum of individual 10 items and could range from 0 to 30 (higher score indicated greater negative impact on life).</description>

        <title>European Quality of Life 5-Dimensions and 5-Levels Questionnaire (EQ5D-5L) Descriptive Score at Week 16</title>
        <description>The EQ-5D-5L questionnaire assesses 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 response options (no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems and extreme problems) that reflect increasing levels of difficulty. The participant was asked to indicate his/her current health state by selecting the most appropriate level in each of the 5 dimensions. The responses are converted into a single index value, with scores ranging from -0.594 to 1 (a higher score indicates better health state).</description>

        <description>HAQ-DI: participant-reported assessment of ability to perform tasks in 8 categories of daily living activities: dress/groom; arise; eat; walk; reach; grip; hygiene; and common activities over past week. Each item scored on 4-point scale from 0 to 3: 0=no difficulty; 1=some difficulty; 2=much difficulty; 3=unable to do. Overall score was computed as the sum of domain scores and divided by the number of domains answered. Total possible score range 0-3 where 0 = least difficulty and 3 = extreme difficulty.</description>
