  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine the overall response rate of single agent TRC105 and
      the combination of TRC105 and bevacizumab in patients with refractory GTN (including
      choriocarcinoma, placental site trophoblastic tumor (PSTT), and epithelioid trophoblastic
      tumor (ETT)). Up to 30 patients will be treated.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      TRC105 is a monoclonal antibody that binds to endoglin, an angiogenic target highly expressed
      on the tumor vessels and tumor cells in gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN).
      Bevacizumab is a monoclonal antibody to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) that
      inhibits angiogenesis and extends survival in patients with a wide variety of solid tumor
      types. TRC105 has been well tolerated as a single agent and when combined with bevacizumab.
      These antibodies may be efficacious in refractory GTN, a tumor type that is highly vascular
      and has been shown to densely express endoglin.

    <description>Antitumor Activity of Single Agent TRC105 and the Combination of TRC105 and Bevacizumab will be assessed via RECIST 1.1 and by measuring circulating bHCG. Disease progression is defined as &gt;20% increase (the absolute increase must be ≥10 IU/L) above the nadir on consecutive measurements separated by at least two weeks; Partial response is defined as a hCG decrease of 50% or more from starting value on consecutive measurements; Complete response will be defined as normalization of hCG on consecutive measurements separated by at least two weeks; Stable disease will be defined as the absence of response or progression on 3 consecutive measurements separated by at least two weeks.</description>

    <description>All subjects will begin by receiving single agent TRC105 weekly. In the case of a complete response to single agent TRC105, subjects will continue to receive single agent TRC105 for at least 3 months following complete response. In the case of a partial response (without a complete response) to single agent TRC105, bevacizumab every two weeks will be added. In the absence of a partial or complete response to single agent TRC105, subjects will receive single agent bevacizumab every two weeks. In the absence of a complete response to single agent bevacizumab, or for subjects who have documented disease progression on a prior bevacizumab containing regimen, subjects will receive TRC105 weekly and bevacizumab every two weeks.</description>

Disease progression is defined as &gt;20% increase (the absolute increase must be ≥10 IU/L) above the nadir on consecutive measurements separated by at least two weeks; Partial response is defined as a hCG decrease of 50% or more from starting value on consecutive measurements; Complete response will be defined as normalization of hCG on consecutive measurements separated by at least two weeks; Stable disease will be defined as the absence of response or progression on 3 consecutive measurements separated by at least two weeks.</description>

            <description>All subjects will begin by receiving single agent TRC105 weekly. In the case of a complete response to single agent TRC105, subjects will continue to receive single agent TRC105 for at least 3 months following complete response. In the case of a partial response (without a complete response) to single agent TRC105, bevacizumab every two weeks will be added. In the absence of a partial or complete response to single agent TRC105, subjects will receive single agent bevacizumab every two weeks. In the absence of a complete response to single agent bevacizumab, or for subjects who have documented disease progression on a prior bevacizumab containing regimen, subjects will receive TRC105 weekly and bevacizumab every two weeks.
TRC105: Subjects will begin by receiving TRC105 weekly. Subjects who achieve a complete response on single agent TRC105 may transition to every two week dosing.
Bevacizumab: Bevacizumab will be dosed every two weeks.</description>
