      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of autologous cytomegalovirus
      (CMV)-specific cytotoxic T cells when given together with temozolomide and to see how well
      they work in treating patients with glioblastoma. Autologous CMV-specific cytotoxic T cells
      may stimulate the immune system to attack specific tumor cells and stop them from growing or
      kill them. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as temozolomide, may work in different ways to
      stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing,
      or by stopping them from spreading. Giving autologous CMV-specific cytotoxic T cells with
      temozolomide may be a better treatment for patients with glioblastoma.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximum feasible dose (MFD) or maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and safety of
      cytomegalovirus (CMV)-specific T cells in combination with dose-dense temozolomide in
      patients with recurrent glioblastoma. (Phase I) II. To evaluate the immunological effects in
      resected glioblastoma after intravenous administered cytomegalovirus (CMV)-stimulated
      adoptive T cells in patients with recurrent glioblastoma (GBM). (Phase II: recurrent
      glioblastoma undergoing resection) III. To correlate 6-month progression-free survival rate
      (PFS6) with objective clearance of CMV antigens as measured by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and
      by ex vivo T-cell-specific effector responses using intracellular cytokine profiling. (Phase
      II: recurrent glioblastoma undergoing resection) IV. Overall survival (OS). (Phase II: newly
      diagnosed glioblastoma)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Time to progression, overall survival (OS) as well as immunological reactivity and safety.
      (Phase II: recurrent glioblastoma undergoing resection) II. Safety and tolerability of
      dose-dense temozolomide in combination with intravenous administered CMV-stimulated adoptive
      T cells in patients receiving adjuvant therapy after completing external beam radiotherapy
      with concurrent temozolomide for newly diagnosed glioblastoma. (Phase II: newly diagnosed
      glioblastoma) III. Overall objective response rate (ORR), median duration of response, PFS6.
      (Phase II: newly diagnosed glioblastoma)

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the persistence and expansion of adoptively-infused CMV-specific T cells by
      multiparameter flow cytometry in serially-sampled peripheral blood. (Phase I) II. To identify
      imaging characteristics such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) textural analysis associated
      with immunological changes in tumor following treatment with CMV-stimulated adoptive T cells.
      (Phase II: recurrent glioblastoma undergoing resection) III. To ascertain if adoptive
      transfer of CMV-specific T cells leads to the expansion of T cells with specificity to other
      glioblastoma antigens (i.e. epitope spreading) by performing longitudinally monitoring of
      antigen-specific T cell frequency with enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot assay (ELISPOT).
      (Phase II: recurrent glioblastoma undergoing resection) IV. To determine the persistence and
      expansion of adoptively-infused CMV-specific T cells by multiparameter flow cytometry in
      serially-sampled peripheral blood. (Phase II: newly diagnosed glioblastoma)

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of CMV-specific T cells followed by a phase
      II study. Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive temozolomide orally (PO) once a day (QD) on days 1-21 and
      CMV-specific T cell transfer intravenously (IV) over 1-5 minutes on day 22. Patients undergo
      surgery on day 30 of cycle 1. Treatment repeats every 42 days for up to 4 cycles in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients then receive temozolomide
      PO QD on days 1-21. Treatment repeats every 42 days for up to 12 cycles in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients receive temozolomide PO QD on days 1-21 and CMV-specific T cell transfer
      intravenously IV over 1-5 minutes on day 22. Treatment repeats every 42 days for up to 4
      cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients then receive
      temozolomide PO QD on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 12 cycles in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and every 3 months.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Be willing and able to provide written informed consent for the trial

          -  PHASE II DOSE EXPANSION IN RECURRENT GBM UNDERGOING RESECTION: Have histologically
             confirmed World Health Organization grade IV malignant glioma (glioblastoma or
             gliosarcoma); participants will also be eligible if the original histology was lower
             grade glioma and there is suspected transformation to glioblastoma based on imaging
             findings; if the final pathology report after resection fails to confirm recurrent
             glioblastoma or gliosarcoma, the subject will be followed for adverse events (AEs) and
             survival, but excluded for other primary and secondary objective analysis; the subject
             will be replaced

          -  PHASE II DOSE EXPANSION IN NEWLY DIAGNOSED GBM: Have histologically confirmed World
             Health Organization grade IV glioma (glioblastoma or gliosarcoma)

          -  PHASE II DOSE EXPANSION IN RECURRENT GBM UNDERGOING RESECTION: Be at first relapse;
             Note: relapse is defined as progression following initial therapy (i.e., radiation,
             chemotherapy, or radiation plus (+) chemotherapy); if the participant had a surgical
             resection for relapsed disease and no antitumor therapy instituted for up to 12 weeks,
             this is considered one relapse; for participants who had prior therapy for a lower
             grade glioma, the surgical diagnosis of glioblastoma or gliosarcoma will be considered
             first relapse

          -  PHASE II DOSE EXPANSION IN NEWLY DIAGNOSED GBM: Patients must have completed standard
             radiation therapy with concurrent temozolomide (TMZ) within 5 weeks (wks) of
             enrollment and must not have evidence of progressive disease on post treatment
             imaging; progression can only be defined using diagnostic imaging if there is new
             enhancement outside of the radiation field (beyond the high-dose region or 80% isodose
             line) or if there is unequivocal evidence of viable tumor on histopathologic sampling
             (e.g., solid tumor areas [i.e,&gt; 70% tumor cell nuclei in areas], high or progressive
             increase in mindbomb homolog 1[MIB-1] proliferation index compared with prior biopsy,
             or evidence for histologic progression or increased anaplasia in tumor); Note: given
             the difficulty of differentiating true progression from pseudoprogression, clinical
             decline alone, in the absence of radiographic or histologic confirmation of
             progression, will not be sufficient for definition of progressive disease in the first
             12 weeks after completion of concurrent chemoradiotherapy

          -  PHASE II DOSE EXPANSION IN RECURRENT GBM UNDERGOING RESECTION: Have measurable disease

             a previously administered agent; Note: subjects with =&lt; grade 2 neuropathy are an
             exception to this criterion and may qualify for the study; Note: if subject received
             major surgery, they must have recovered adequately from the toxicity and/or
             complications from the intervention prior to starting therapy

          -  Has a known additional malignancy that is progressing or requires active treatment;
             exceptions include basal cell carcinoma of the skin, squamous cell carcinoma of the
             skin, or in situ cervical cancer that has undergone potentially curative therapy

          -  PHASE II DOSE EXPANSION IN RECURRENT GBM UNDERGOING RESECTION: Has known gliomatous

          -  PHASE II DOSE EXPANSION IN NEWLY DIAGNOSED GBM: Has known gliomatous meningitis,
             extracranial disease, or multifocal disease

          -  Has an active autoimmune disease requiring systemic treatment within the past 3 months
             or a documented history of clinically severe autoimmune disease, or a syndrome that
             requires systemic steroids or immunosuppressive agents; subjects with vitiligo or
             resolved childhood asthma/atopy would be an exception to this rule; subjects that
             require intermittent use of bronchodilators or local steroid injections would not be
             excluded from the study; subjects with hypothyroidism stable on hormone replacement or
             Sjogren's syndrome will not be excluded from the study

          -  Has evidence of interstitial lung disease or active, non-infectious pneumonitis

          -  Has an active infection requiring systemic therapy

          -  Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality
             that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the subject's
             participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of
             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator

          -  Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with
             cooperation with the requirements of the trial

          -  Is pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children within the
             projected duration of the trial, starting with the screening visit

          -  PHASE II DOSE EXPANSION IN RECURRENT GBM UNDERGOING RESECTION AND IN NEWLY DIAGNOSED
             GBM: Has received prior therapy with any antibody or drug specifically targeting
             T-cell co-stimulation or checkpoint pathways

          -  Has received a live vaccine within 30 days prior to the first dose of trial treatment

          -  Contraindication for undergoing MRIs

          -  PHASE II DOSE EXPANSION IN RECURRENT GBM UNDERGOING RESECTION: Evidence of bleeding
             diathesis or use of anticoagulant medication or any medication that may increase the
             risk of bleeding that cannot be stopped prior to surgery
