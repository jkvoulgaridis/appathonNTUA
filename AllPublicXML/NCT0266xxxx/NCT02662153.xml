      Retrospective study to assess incidence and predictors of opioid abuse overdose and death
      associated with opioid overdose among patients prescribed opioid products in long-term use.

      The purpose of this study is to quantify risk, and predictors of risks for opioid overdose
      and for death associated with opioid overdose in persons who are or have been long-term
      recipients of prescriptions for Schedule II opioids. The study uses coded terms in large
      heath databases maintained by healthcare providers and health insurers, supplemented by
      overdose deaths identified from the National Death Index. The terms for overdose are combined
      following validated rules as developed in companion studies. The study is being conducted in
      parallel with a prospective questionnaire-based cohort study of the same risks.

        The source populations will be those members of the selected health plans and insurance
        programs identified for which full demographic, provider, facility and pharmacy data are
        available, and in which protected health information (PHI) can be linked to death
        certificate information.

        The four large healthcare systems that have established electronic databases for studying
        coded terminology outcomes selected for this study are: Kaiser Permanente Northwest;
        HealthCore, Inc. with access to commercial insurance data; Optum with access to commercial
        insurance data; and Vanderbilt University with access to Medicaid data for the State of
        Tennessee.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  In the primary analysis, persons known to have had at least six months of no opioid
             dispensing who subsequently receive at least 70 days of Schedule II opioid dispensed
             within a 90-day period and who have not previously experienced an opioid overdose.

          -  In a secondary analysis, persons who have been long-term users of IR/SA opioids and
             who switch to a different Schedule II IR/SA opioid product or to an ER/LA opioid

          -  In another secondary analysis, persons with at least six months of presence in the
             health insurance data who have not received opioids in the preceding 30 days, and have
             not previously experienced an opioid overdose

        Exclusion Criteria:

        â€¢ Experience of opioid overdose in the six months preceding inclusion
