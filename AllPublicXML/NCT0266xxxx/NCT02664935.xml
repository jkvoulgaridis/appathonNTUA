  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The trial consists of a series of parallel multi-centre single arm phase II trial arms, each
      testing an experimental targeted drug in a population stratified by multiple pre-specified
      actionable target putative biomarkers. The primary objective is to evaluate whether there is
      a signal of activity in each drug-(putative)biomarker cohort separately. A Bayesian adaptive
      design is adopted to achieve this objective and statistical details are given in the
      Protocol.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The trial is primarily an enrichment putative biomarker design, including patients who are
      positive for at least one of the actionable targets included in the trial. Patients who are
      positive for just one putative biomarker will receive the experimental targeted drug specific
      for that putative biomarker. Putative biomarkers within each drug cohort have been chosen
      such that in the majority of cases it is not expected that patients will be positive for two
      or more putative biomarkers within the same drug. In the rare situation that patients are
      positive for two or more putative biomarkers relevant across different drugs, treatment will
      be allocated in accordance with the following strategy:

        -  All amplifications and rearrangements will be treated with targeted agent appropriate to
           them irrespective of concomitant mutations. This will yield crucial predictive biomarker
           information.

        -  For concomitant mutations decisions will be made by the Chief Investigator on a
           case-by-case basis and based on close consideration of pathway preference and likely
           dominance of one signal pathway over another together with any pre-clinical efficacy
           studies that address the activity of the drugs in the presence of concomitant mutations.
           A trumping strategy has been devised for this purpose.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Core inclusion and exclusion criteria are presented below. Additional inclusion/exclusion
        criteria apply to each arm and are presented in the relevant arm supplements of the
        protocol.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior anti-cancer treatment:

               -  Patients who refuse any standard of care first line therapy, are eligible to
                  receive National Lung Matrix Trial treatment as first line therapy, providing
                  they explicitly consent to this effect.

               -  Patients who have previously consented to and received standard of care first
                  line therapy must have completed all standard of care therapy that the treating
                  oncologist thinks is appropriate. As a minimum patients must have failed one or
                  more lines of treatment (either radiological documentation of disease progression
                  or due to toxicity). Patients whose disease has increased in size but is not
                  classed as progressive disease as per RECIST criteria, will be eligible. Patients
                  with no change at all in dimension of disease (i.e. true stability) after first
                  line therapy will not be eligible.

               -  Patients who have progressed after surgical resection and adjuvant therapy will
                  be eligible for entry without the need for the administration of first line
                  metastatic therapy.

               -  Patients will also be eligible without the necessity for first line regimen if
                  they have relapsed within 6 months of completion of definitive chemoradiation.

          -  Consented and provided an adequate specimen to adequately characterise the molecular
             genotype of the tumour in the molecular pre-screening according to the molecular
             exclusion rules (see Section 6.4 for definition of an adequate sample).

          -  Histological or cytologically confirmed NSCLC stage III (not suitable for radical
             radiotherapy or surgery) or stage IV. This includes patients who may have abnormal
             histology, but IHC strongly support either squamous cell carcinoma (p63 positivity) or
             adenocarcinoma (Thyroid transcription factor 1 [TTF1] positivity). If a physician and
             pathologist are convinced after multi-disciplinary review that the patient has stage
             III or IV NSCLC but where all the IHC is negative and the morphology does not
             distinguish a specific sub-type, these patients will be eligible for non-histology
             specific cohorts.

          -  CT or MRI scan of head, chest and abdomen within 28 days of treatment demonstrating
             measurable disease as per RECIST version 1.1 (see Appendix 1: Response Evaluation
             Criteria in Solid Tumours Version 1.1). (The same imaging modality must be used
             throughout treatment).

          -  Adequate haematological function within 7 days of treatment.

               -  Haemoglobin ≥ 90 g/L.

               -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1.5 x 109/L.

               -  Platelets ≥ 100 x 109/L.

          -  Adequate hepatic function within 7 days of treatment in patients with no liver
             metastasis (see arm specific entry criteria for adequate hepatic function in patients
             with liver metastases).

               -  Total serum bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN). (Note that this will
                  not apply to patients with confirmed Gilbert's syndrome (persistent or recurrent
                  hyperbilirubinemia that is predominantly unconjugated in the absence of evidence
                  of haemolysis or hepatic pathology), who may be allowed inclusion at the
                  discretion of the local Investigator).

               -  Alanine transferase (ALT) ≤ 2.5 x ULN.

               -  Aspartate transferase (AST) ≤ 2.5 x ULN.

          -  Adequate renal function within 7 days of treatment.

               -  Creatinine clearance (CLcr) &gt;50 ml/min (measured or calculated by Cockcroft and
                  Gault equation - see Appendix 4: Cockcroft Gault Formula - Creatinine Clearance).
                  If calculated CLcr is &lt;50 ml/min a direct measurement of glomerular filtration
                  rate (GFR) such as EDTA may be performed. If the value is &gt;50 ml/min the patient
                  is eligible.

          -  Age ≥ 18 years.

          -  Females must agree to use adequate contraceptive measures (as defined in Section 6.3),
             should not be breast feeding and must have a negative pregnancy test prior to start of
             dosing if of child-bearing potential or must have evidence of non-child-bearing
             potential by fulfilling one of the following criteria at screening:

               -  Post-menopausal defined as aged more than 50 years and amenorrhoeic for at least
                  12 months following cessation of all exogenous hormonal treatments

               -  Documentation of irreversible surgical sterilisation by hysterectomy, bilateral
                  oophorectomy or bilateral salpingectomy but not tubal ligation.

               -  Women aged under 50 years old would be consider postmenopausal if they have been
                  amenorrhoeic for 12 months or more following cessation of exogenous hormonal
                  treatments and with luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone
                  (FSH) levels in the post-menopausal range for the institution.

          -  Provision of signed and dated, written informed consent prior to any study specific
             procedures, sampling and analyses.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Major surgery (excluding placement of vascular access) within 4 weeks prior to
             treatment.

          -  Nausea, vomiting, chronic gastrointestinal diseases (e.g. inflammatory bowel disease)
             that would preclude adequate absorption.

          -  Any psychological, familial, sociological or geographical condition hampering protocol
             compliance.

          -  Concurrent malignancies or invasive cancers diagnosed within past 3 years except for
             adequately treated basal cell carcinoma of the skin and in situ carcinoma of the
             uterine cervix.

          -  Judgement by the local Investigator that the patient should not participate in the
             study if the patient is unlikely to comply with study procedures, restrictions and
             requirements.

          -  Any unresolved toxicity of grade 2, 3 or 4 from previous treatment (excluding
             alopecia) at Registration (see CTCAE - Appendix 3: Common Toxicity Criteria Gradings).

          -  Patients who have previous symptomatic brain metastases or spinal cord compression are
             excluded unless they have had adequate treatment, no evidence of progression or
             symptoms, and have had no requirement for steroid treatment in the previous 28 days
