      The purpose of this study is to determine whether fidaxomicin and vancomycin followed by
      taper and pulse vancomycin treatment are superior to standard vancomycin treatment for the
      treatment of recurrent Clostridium difficile infection.

      *As a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic, and after consultation with the appropriate
      research oversight, regulatory and monitoring entities, screening and enrollment has been
      placed on temporary administrative hold as of 03/27/2020. When such trial activities resume
      the clinicaltrials.gov record will be updated accordingly. * Clostridium difficile is the
      most common cause of healthcare-associated infectious diarrhea among adults in industrialized
      countries. In addition to diarrhea, C. difficile infection (CDI) may also result in serious
      complications such as shock, toxic megacolon, colectomy, and death. The Centers for Disease
      Control and Prevention (CDC) has estimated C. difficile results in 250,000 hospital
      infections, 14,000 deaths, and $1 billion in excess costs annually. Recurrent CDI is the most
      challenging clinical dilemma facing clinicians who treat this disease. An estimated 30% of
      patients who respond to initial treatment with either vancomycin or metronidazole develop
      recurrent CDI, usually within 1-4 weeks of completing treatment.

      The primary objective of this study is to determine whether 1) standard fidaxomicin treatment
      and 2) standard vancomycin treatment followed by taper and pulse vancomycin treatment are
      superior to standard vancomycin treatment alone for sustained clinical response at day 59 for
      all treatments, for participants with either their first or second recurrence of CDI.
      Veterans presenting with a first or second CDI recurrence will be screened, consented and
      randomly assigned in a double-blind manner to one of three treatment groups: 1) a 10 day
      course of oral vancomycin (VAN-TX), 2) a 10 day course of fidaxomicin (FID-TX) or 3) a 31 day
      course of vancomycin which includes a taper and pulse following daily treatment (VAN-TP/P).
      Symptom resolution is defined as an improvement or resolution of diarrhea (&lt;3 unformed bowel
      movements over 24 hours) for 48 consecutive hours compared to the participant's baseline.
      Recurrence is defined as having diarrhea (&gt;3 loose or semi-formed stools over 24 hours for 48
      consecutive hours). A sample size of 546 randomized study participants is required to obtain
      at least 81% power to detect a 16% absolute difference (expected proportion of 31% in the
      VAN-TX group) in sustained clinical response (D- COM) proportion 1) between the FID-TX group
      and the VAN-TX group and 2) between the VAN-TP/P group and VAN-TX group at the 0.05
      significance level. It was observed throughout the pilot phase that the original goal of 7
      participants per site per year is overestimated. We expect sites will recruit at a more
      realistic rate of 6 participants (on average) per site per year for sites that will primarily
      recruit from the main hospital and nearby CBOCS, and 9 participants (on average) per site per
      year for sites that could partner with independent VAMCs (Independent VAMCs LSI Application
      will be reviewed and approved by Central IRB) that are close in distance to allow a shared
      site coordinator (WOC appointed) at an increased funding level. Some sites may recruit more
      to reach the overall goal. Given revised anticipated recruitment rate and in consideration of
      sites' variability on start-up dates, different level of recruitment across sites, and
      logistics on replacement of underperformed sites with backup sites, the study is expected to
      complete enrollment of 546 participants within 6 years with 90 days of follow-up. This
      includes 2 years of pilot phase plus transitioning period from pilot phase to full study, and
      4 years of full study. There were 6 sites in the pilot phase and will have 24 sites in full
      phase (including 5 pilot sites and 19 additional sites). This assumes that 30% of Veterans
      with CDI have a recurrence and 20% of them will enroll in the study.

    <description>The Primary outcome will be sustained clinical response as measured at study day 59 for all treatment regimens. Sustained clinical response is a composite outcome that includes symptom resolution during treatment without any of the following (as assessed on day 59):
Diarrhea recurrence
Other non-fatal clinical events including severe abdominal pain, toxic megacolon (where diarrhea ceases but is not a beneficial outcome), and colectomy

    <description>CDI Composite Outcome Measure (CDI-COM) is sustained clinical response without recurrent CDI (defined as diarrhea plus confirmation of toxigenic C. difficile or its toxins in stool) as measured at study day 59 for all three treatment regimens. Sustained response will be defined using the same composite endpoint criteria as were used in the D-COM outcome but without recurrent CDI on or before day 59.</description>
