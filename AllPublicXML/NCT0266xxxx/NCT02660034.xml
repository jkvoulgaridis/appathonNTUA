        Key Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Participants have voluntarily agreed to participate by giving written informed consent

          2. Must have received standard of care in the primary treatment of their disease

          3. Participants who have the below specified histologically confirmed malignancies that
             have progressed to the advanced or metastatic stage.

               1. In Part A, the participants must have an advanced malignancy including but not
                  limited to high-grade serous cancer of the ovary, fallopian tube, or peritoneum,
                  triple negative breast cancer, SCLC, primary peritoneal cancer, and any tumor
                  likely to harbor DNA damage repair deficiencies susceptible to treatment with a
                  PARP inhibitor or likely to be responsive to a PD-1 blocker.

               2. In Part B, the participants recruited to one of the eight expansion arms must
                  have advanced solid tumors of the following types:

             Arm 1: Participants with relapsed, platinum-sensitive high grade epithelial,
             non-mucinous, ovarian cancer, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer (EOC) must
             meet the following criteria:

             I. Must have at least 2 prior platinum-containing treatments in any treatment setting.

             • Note: participants may have received additional therapy after the last
             platinum-containing regimen if the other eligibility criteria are met.

             ii. Must have platinum-sensitive recurrent disease and must not have progressed (by
             RECIST v1.1 criteria) within 6 months of the completion of the last platinum
             containing line of treatment • Note: participants may receive additional non-platinum
             based chemotherapy for recurrence after prior last platinum containing regimen if the
             criteria for platinum sensitivity are met.

             iii. Arm 1a: Participants with relapsed, platinum-sensitive high grade epithelial,
             non-mucinous, ovarian cancer, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer (EOC) with
             either known deleterious or suspected deleterious germline or somatic BRCA1/2
             mutations or with HRD • If HRD or BRCA1/2 mutation status from archival tissue is
             unknown or has not been previously evaluated, then the archival tissue must undergo
             tissue screening using a validated diagnostic test to determine eligibility. If the
             diagnostic test result is BRCA1/2 or HRD positive the participant will be eligible for
             enrollment in Arm 1a iv. Arm 1b: Participants with relapsed, platinum-sensitive high
             grade EOC who otherwise meet the above criteria and are without known germline or
             somatic BRCA1/2 mutations and without HRD mutation

             Arm 2: Participants with triple negative breast cancer must meet the following
             criteria:

             i. 0-1 prior platinum-containing treatment in any treatment setting

             • Note: participants could have received additional therapy after the last
             platinum-containing line of treatment if the other eligibility criteria are met.

             ii. Participants who have received at least 1 prior treatment but not more than 3
             prior lines of treatment in the advanced or metastatic setting.

             iii. Known deleterious or suspected deleterious germline or somatic BRCA1/2 mutations
             or with documented HRD

               -  If HRD or BRCA1/2 mutation status from archival tissue is unknown or has not been
                  previously evaluated, then the archival tissue must undergo tissue screening
                  using a validated diagnostic test to determine eligibility. If the diagnostic
                  test result is HRD positive, then the participant will be eligible for enrollment
                  in Arm 2

               -  If archival tissue is not available and the participant submits a fresh tumor
                  biopsy, then the diagnostic test needs to demonstrate somatic BRCA1/2 mutation or
                  HRD positivity.

             Arm 3: Participants with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, including
             but not limited to mutations in homologous recombination (HR) pathways and/or defined
             by HRD algorithms, and must meet the following criteria:

             i. May be either chemotherapy-naïve, but must have received prior abiraterone acetate
             and/or enzalutamide treatment, or have previously had no more than 2 taxane-based
             chemotherapy lines of treatment including docetaxel and carbazitaxel. If docetaxel is
             used more than once, this will be considered as 1 line of treatment.

             ii. At least 2 weeks since the completion of prior flutamide, bicalutamide, and
             nilutimide, or enzalutamide and abiraterone treatment.

             iii. Documented prostate cancer with one of the following:

             • Surgically or medically castrated. The testosterone levels do not need to be checked
             if the participant has undergone surgical castration for &gt; 4 months. Participants
             receiving chemical castration should have testosterone levels checked at baseline and
             confirmed to be in the castrate levels (&lt; 0.5 ng/mL or 1.735 nM). In all cases the
             luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) antagonist/agonist is to be continued in
             these participants

               -  Participants with only non-measurable bone lesions must have disease progression
                  based on PCWG3 with 2 or more new lesions or have prostate-specific antigen (PSA)
                  progression before enrolment iv. Known deleterious or suspected deleterious
                  germline or somatic BRCA1/2 mutations or with documented HRD

               -  If HRD or BRCA1/2 mutation status from archival tissue is unknown or has not been
                  previously evaluated, then the archival tissue must undergo tissue screening
                  using a validated diagnostic test to determine eligibility. If the diagnostic
                  test result is HRD positive, then the participant will be eligible for enrollment
                  in Arm 3

               -  If archival tissue is not available and the participant submits a fresh tumor
                  biopsy, then the diagnostic test needs to demonstrate somatic BRCA1/2 mutation or
                  HRD positivity.

             Arm 4: Participants with extensive-stage disease small cell lung cancer (SCLC) must
             meet the following criterion:

             i. Received at least 1 and not more than 2 prior lines of treatment ii. At least 1
             prior line of treatment must have contained a platinum agent

             metastatic disease setting ii. At least 1 prior line of treatment must have contained
             a platinum agent

             Arm 7: Participants with advanced or metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma must meet
             the following criteria:

             i. Received at least one but not more than 2 lines of treatment in either an advanced
             or metastatic setting; ii. At least 1 prior treatment for advanced or metastatic
             disease must have contained a platinum agent iii. Participants with known deleterious

          9. Prior therapies targeting PD-1, programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), or PARP. The
