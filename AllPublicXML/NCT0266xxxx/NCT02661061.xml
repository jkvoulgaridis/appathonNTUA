      Randomised, controlled, parallel-group, pilot clinical trial of ketamine vs. midazolam for
      depression relapse prevention in persons at high risk. The main purpose of the pilot study is
      to assess trial processes to help inform a future definitive trial.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants will be recruited at admission to St Patrick's University Hospital for treatment
      of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition (DSM-IV)-diagnosed
      recurrent unipolar depression and followed-up weekly to assess recovery according to standard
      criteria. Blood samples for epigenetic studies will be taken at baseline. Treatment-as-usual
      will continue throughout the entire trial. Participants who meet standardised response
      criteria will then be invited to be randomised to course of four two-weekly ketamine or
      midazolam (active comparator) infusions. Block randomisation will be independently performed.
      Physical, psychotomimetic and cognitive outcomes will be monitored before, during and after
      infusions. Blood samples will be taken at four time-points in the first infusion session and
      before the final infusion for neuroplasticity biomarker studies.Trial Interventions:
      participants will receive four two-weekly infusions of either ketamine at 0.05mg/kg or
      midazolam at 0.045mg/kg. All infusions will be administered by a consultant anaesthetist.
      Repeated infusions of ketamine have been shown to be safe and well-tolerated by patients with
      mental illness. Minor haemodynamic changes and psychotomimetic side-effects can occur and
      will be assessed regularly during infusions and for 200 minutes afterwards.

      Participants will be followed up over six months to assess for relapse according to
      standardised criteria. This is the highest-risk period for relapse and investigators
      hypothesize that ketamine will provide additional neurotrophic support (assessed by the
      laboratory biomarker project) which will result in lower relapse rates when compared to
      midazolam.

    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>The outcomes for this pilot trial are process outcomes, primarily rates of recruitment and retention. Thus, the completion rate for the randomised treatment phase is the primary outcome. The study is not designed to assess efficacy.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Depression Relapse Rate During Treatment and Follow-up Phase</measure>
    <time_frame>8 months</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical outcomes are secondary in this pilot trial. The 24-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD-24) was used to assess for the main clinical outcome, the relapse rate over six months. Criteria for relapse are ≥10 point increase in HRSD-24 compared to baseline score plus HRSD ≥16; in addition, increase in the HRSD should be maintained one week later (if indicated, additional follow-ups will be arranged). Hospital admission, and deliberate self-harm/suicide also constitute relapse. Relapse may also occur during the eight-week treatment phase and is captured here.</description>

        <title>Depression Relapse Rate During Treatment and Follow-up Phase</title>
        <description>Clinical outcomes are secondary in this pilot trial. The 24-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD-24) was used to assess for the main clinical outcome, the relapse rate over six months. Criteria for relapse are ≥10 point increase in HRSD-24 compared to baseline score plus HRSD ≥16; in addition, increase in the HRSD should be maintained one week later (if indicated, additional follow-ups will be arranged). Hospital admission, and deliberate self-harm/suicide also constitute relapse. Relapse may also occur during the eight-week treatment phase and is captured here.</description>
