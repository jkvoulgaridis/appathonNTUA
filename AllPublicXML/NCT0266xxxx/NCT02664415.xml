      The study will evaluate the safety and therapeutic efficacy of the human monoclonal antibody
      (mAb) VRC-HIVMAB060-00-AB (VRC01), when administered during analytic treatment interruption
      (ATI), in adults who began antiretroviral therapy (ART) during early acute HIV infection.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) may have the potential to treat HIV infection by
      preventing the spread of the virus. This study will evaluate an experimental mAb known as
      VRC-HIVMAB060-00-AB (VRC01). The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and
      therapeutic efficacy of VRC01, when administered during analytic treatment interruption
      (ATI), in adults who began antiretroviral therapy (ART) during early acute HIV infection.

      The study will enroll participants from the RV 254 study who were diagnosed during early
      acute HIV infection and who have been on ART. At study entry, participants will stop taking
      their antiretroviral (ARV) medications. They will be randomly assigned to receive an
      intravenous (IV) infusion of VRC01 or placebo at Weeks 0 (study entry), 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18,
      21, and 24. For 7 days following each infusion, participants will be asked to record and
      report any symptoms to study researchers.

      In addition to the infusion visits, participants will attend follow-up visits for 48 weeks.
      Study visits may include physical examinations, blood collection, and urine collection.
      Neurocognitive testing will take place at select study visits. Some participants may take
      part in optional study procedures including mucosal secretion collection, MRI brain scan,
      colon biopsy, lymph node biopsy, leukapheresis, and lumbar puncture.

      Study staff will monitor participants' HIV throughout the study, and participants will end
      their participation in the study and restart their ARV medications, if needed.

      <recruitment_details>This study was conducted at the Thai Red Cross AIDS Research Centre in Bangkok, Thailand. Participants were recruited between 9 August 2016 and 9 January 2017, from ongoing Acute HIV Infection (AHI) cohorts and received ART during AHI via a separately-funded protocol (clinicaltrials.gov NCT00796263).</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Twenty-three participants were enrolled, 4 were withdrawn prior to randomization because of the unavailability of study product in-country, and 19 were randomized with 5 assigned to placebo and 14 to VRC01. One VRC01 recipient experienced severe generalized urticaria during the first study infusion and did not complete the study.</pre_assignment_details>

          <title>Feibig stage at ART initiation</title>
          <description>Fiebig stage is a laboratory staging system for primary HIV infection (Fiebig et al).
Stage I: HIV present in blood samples, only RNA assay positive (RNA+); Stage II: RNA+ and HIV-1 p24 antigen positive (p24+), antibody EIA non-reactive (IgM-); Stage III: RNA+, HIV-1 antigen and HIV IgM-sensitive EIA reactive (IgM+), but Western blot without HIV-a-specific band (WB-) .
The higher stage refers to the later stage of infection.</description>
