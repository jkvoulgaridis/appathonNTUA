  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase IV randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study in 1000 individuals
      aged 18 years or older, with community acquired pneumonia (CAP) who meet all eligibility
      criteria in endemic regions. This study is designed to provide data on the effectiveness of
      early antifungal treatment (Fluconazole, 400 mg/day) for coccidioidomycosis pneumonia (also
      referred to as Valley Fever (VF) Pneumonia or acute onset valley fever) vs. placebo in
      subjects with coccidioidomycosis pneumonia. Patients who are prescribed antibacterials by
      their health care provider for acute CAP will be randomized to receive either placebo or 400
      mg/day of fluconazole for 42 days. The primary objective is to assess the clinical response
      of early empiric antifungal therapy with fluconazole at Day 22 in subjects with
      coccidioidomycosis pneumonia and are compliant with the study intervention.

      This is a Phase IV randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study in 1000 individuals,

      early antifungal treatment (Fluconazole, 400 mg/day) for coccidioidomycosis pneumonia (also
      referred to as Valley Fever (VF) Pneumonia or acute onset valley fever) vs. placebo in
      subjects with coccidioidomycosis pneumonia. Patients who are prescribed antibacterials by
      their health care provider for acute CAP will be randomized to receive either placebo or 400
      mg/day of fluconazole for 42 days. Blood work for serologic determination of
      coccidioidomycosis infection will be drawn at the time of randomization (Day 1), and again on
      Days, 22, 29, and 43. On Day 43, subjects will be informed of their treatment assignment and
      results of serologic testing from Days 1, 22 and 29. At Day 43, those subjects who did not
      meet the protocol defined case definition for CAP caused by acute coccidioidomycosis and who
      did not receive fluconazole will be dismissed from the study and referred to a health care
      provider with the results of their serology testing and their treatment assignment. All
      subjects who received fluconazole will be evaluated for safety follow up at Day 49. At Day
      49, those subjects who did not meet the protocol defined case definition for CAP caused by
      acute coccidioidomycosis will be dismissed from the study and referred to a health care
      provider with the results of their serology testing and their treatment assignment. Subjects
      who did meet the protocol defined case definition for CAP caused by acute coccidioidomycosis
      infection will be referred to a healthcare provider with the results of their serology
      testing and their treatment assignment for further treatment as indicated and will be
      contacted by telephone on Days 90 and 180. The study duration will be approximately 72
      months, and the subject participant duration will be from 42 days to approximately 6 months.
      The primary objective is to assess the clinical response of early empiric antifungal therapy
      with fluconazole at Day 22 in subjects with coccidioidomycosis pneumonia who are adherent to
      the study intervention. The secondary objectives are: 1) To assess the clinical response of
      early empiric antifungal therapy with fluconazole at Day 22 in subjects with
      coccidioidomycosis pneumonia regardless of adherence with the study intervention; 2) To
      assess the clinical response of early empiric antifungal therapy with fluconazole at Day 43
      in subjects with coccidioidomycosis pneumonia regardless of adherence with the study
      intervention; 3) To compare the clinical response and its individual components over time, by
      treatment group, in subjects with coccidioidomycosis pneumonia; 4) To assess the impact of
      early empiric antifungal therapy with fluconazole on days lost from work or school and
      responses to the SF-12v2 and PROMIS Item Bank v2.0 - Ability to Participate in Social Roles
      and Activities - Short Form 4a in subjects with coccidioidomycosis pneumonia; 5) To assess
      the effect of early empiric antifungal therapy with fluconazole through Day 43 in subjects
      with coccidioidomycosis pneumonia on all-cause mortality by treatment group; and 6) To assess
      whether early empiric antifungal therapy with fluconazole at Day 22 is non-inferior to
      placebo as defined by clinical response at Day 22 in all randomized subjects, regardless of
      coccidioidomycosis pneumonia status or adherence with study intervention, with baseline and
      follow-up FLEET-CAP scores.

    <description>The Modified Scoring System for Evaluating Treatment Response in Early Coccidioidal Pneumonia (FLEET CAP) score is a clinical scoring system that allows a constellation of clinical symptoms to be quantified and scored over time: cough, fatigue, chest pain, dyspnea, sputum production, night sweats, fever and hypoxia. The recall period for symptom assessments was during the past week, with the exception of fever and hypoxia, which was measured on the day the FLEET CAP was administered. All symptoms are graded on a 0-3 severity scale, except for night sweats and hypoxia which are graded on a 0-2 severity scale, where 0 indicates the symptom is absent or normal. The range of total scores is from 0-22, where higher scores correspond to a worse outcome.</description>

    <description>The Modified Scoring System for Evaluating Treatment Response in Early Coccidioidal Pneumonia (FLEET CAP) score is a clinical scoring system that allows a constellation of clinical symptoms to be quantified and scored over time: cough, fatigue, chest pain, dyspnea, sputum production, night sweats, fever and hypoxia. The recall period for symptom assessments was during the past week, with the exception of fever and hypoxia, which was measured on the day the FLEET CAP was administered. All symptoms are graded on a 0-3 severity scale, except for night sweats and hypoxia which are graded on a 0-2 severity scale, where 0 indicates the symptom is absent or normal. The range of total scores is from 0-22, where higher scores correspond to a worse outcome.</description>

        <title>The Proportion of Participants Who Achieve a Clinical Response, Defined as at Least a 50% Reduction in Composite FLEET CAP Score From Baseline, in the Cocci-positive Per-protocol Population</title>
        <description>The Modified Scoring System for Evaluating Treatment Response in Early Coccidioidal Pneumonia (FLEET CAP) score is a clinical scoring system that allows a constellation of clinical symptoms to be quantified and scored over time: cough, fatigue, chest pain, dyspnea, sputum production, night sweats, fever and hypoxia. The recall period for symptom assessments was during the past week, with the exception of fever and hypoxia, which was measured on the day the FLEET CAP was administered. All symptoms are graded on a 0-3 severity scale, except for night sweats and hypoxia which are graded on a 0-2 severity scale, where 0 indicates the symptom is absent or normal. The range of total scores is from 0-22, where higher scores correspond to a worse outcome.</description>

          <description>The Modified Scoring System for Evaluating Treatment Response in Early Coccidioidal Pneumonia (FLEET CAP) score is a clinical scoring system that allows a constellation of clinical symptoms to be quantified and scored over time: cough, fatigue, chest pain, dyspnea, sputum production, night sweats, fever and hypoxia. The recall period for symptom assessments was during the past week, with the exception of fever and hypoxia, which was measured on the day the FLEET CAP was administered. All symptoms are graded on a 0-3 severity scale, except for night sweats and hypoxia which are graded on a 0-2 severity scale, where 0 indicates the symptom is absent or normal. The range of total scores is from 0-22, where higher scores correspond to a worse outcome. Note that a participant who responds earlier before Day 43 does not need to achieve a clinical response at Day 43, as well.</description>

        <title>The Median and Quartiles of the FLEET CAP Score and Each Component in the ITT Population</title>
        <description>The Modified Scoring System for Evaluating Treatment Response in Early Coccidioidal Pneumonia (FLEET CAP) score is a clinical scoring system that allows a constellation of clinical symptoms to be quantified and scored over time: cough, fatigue, chest pain, dyspnea, sputum production, night sweats, fever and hypoxia. The recall period for symptom assessments was during the past week, with the exception of fever and hypoxia, which was measured on the day the FLEET CAP was administered. All symptoms are graded on a 0-3 severity scale, except for night sweats and hypoxia which are graded on a 0-2 severity scale, where 0 indicates the symptom is absent or normal. The range of total scores is from 0-22, where higher scores correspond to a worse outcome.</description>

The recall period for symptom assessments was during the past week, with the exception of fever and hypoxia, which was measured on the day the FLEET CAP was administered. All symptoms are graded on a 0-3 severity scale, except for night sweats and hypoxia which are graded on a 0-2 severity scale, where 0 indicates the symptom is absent or normal. The range of total scores is from 0-22, where higher scores correspond to a worse outcome.</description>

        <title>The Mean and Quartiles of the FLEET CAP Score and Each Component in the Cocci Positive Modified Intent-to-Treat (mITT) Population</title>
        <description>The Modified Scoring System for Evaluating Treatment Response in Early Coccidioidal Pneumonia (FLEET CAP) score is a clinical scoring system that allows a constellation of clinical symptoms to be quantified and scored over time: cough, fatigue, chest pain, dyspnea, sputum production, night sweats, fever and hypoxia. The recall period for symptom assessments was during the past week, with the exception of fever and hypoxia, which was measured on the day the FLEET CAP was administered. All symptoms are graded on a 0-3 severity scale, except for night sweats and hypoxia which are graded on a 0-2 severity scale, where 0 indicates the symptom is absent or normal. The range of total scores is from 0-22, where higher scores correspond to a worse outcome.</description>

        <title>The Mean and Quartiles of the FLEET CAP Score and Each Component in the Cocci Positive Modified Intent-to-Treat (mITT) Population</title>
        <description>The Modified Scoring System for Evaluating Treatment Response in Early Coccidioidal Pneumonia (FLEET CAP) score is a clinical scoring system that allows a constellation of clinical symptoms to be quantified and scored over time: cough, fatigue, chest pain, dyspnea, sputum production, night sweats, fever and hypoxia. The recall period for symptom assessments was during the past week, with the exception of fever and hypoxia, which was measured on the day the FLEET CAP was administered. All symptoms are graded on a 0-3 severity scale, except for night sweats and hypoxia which are graded on a 0-2 severity scale, where 0 indicates the symptom is absent or normal. The range of total scores is from 0-22, where higher scores correspond to a worse outcome.</description>

        <title>The Mean and Quartiles of the FLEET CAP Score and Each Component in the Cocci Positive Modified Intent-to-Treat (mITT) Population</title>
        <description>The Modified Scoring System for Evaluating Treatment Response in Early Coccidioidal Pneumonia (FLEET CAP) score is a clinical scoring system that allows a constellation of clinical symptoms to be quantified and scored over time: cough, fatigue, chest pain, dyspnea, sputum production, night sweats, fever and hypoxia. The recall period for symptom assessments was during the past week, with the exception of fever and hypoxia, which was measured on the day the FLEET CAP was administered. All symptoms are graded on a 0-3 severity scale, except for night sweats and hypoxia which are graded on a 0-2 severity scale, where 0 indicates the symptom is absent or normal. The range of total scores is from 0-22, where higher scores correspond to a worse outcome.</description>

        <title>The Mean and Quartiles of the FLEET CAP Score and Each Component in the All Randomized Modified Intent-to-Treat (mITT) Population</title>
        <description>The Modified Scoring System for Evaluating Treatment Response in Early Coccidioidal Pneumonia (FLEET CAP) score is a clinical scoring system that allows a constellation of clinical symptoms to be quantified and scored over time: cough, fatigue, chest pain, dyspnea, sputum production, night sweats, fever and hypoxia. The recall period for symptom assessments was during the past week, with the exception of fever and hypoxia, which was measured on the day the FLEET CAP was administered. All symptoms are graded on a 0-3 severity scale, except for night sweats and hypoxia which are graded on a 0-2 severity scale, where 0 indicates the symptom is absent or normal. The range of total scores is from 0-22, where higher scores correspond to a worse outcome.</description>

        <title>The Mean and Quartiles of the FLEET CAP Score and Each Component in the All Randomized Modified Intent-to-Treat (mITT) Population</title>
        <description>The Modified Scoring System for Evaluating Treatment Response in Early Coccidioidal Pneumonia (FLEET CAP) score is a clinical scoring system that allows a constellation of clinical symptoms to be quantified and scored over time: cough, fatigue, chest pain, dyspnea, sputum production, night sweats, fever and hypoxia. The recall period for symptom assessments was during the past week, with the exception of fever and hypoxia, which was measured on the day the FLEET CAP was administered. All symptoms are graded on a 0-3 severity scale, except for night sweats and hypoxia which are graded on a 0-2 severity scale, where 0 indicates the symptom is absent or normal. The range of total scores is from 0-22, where higher scores correspond to a worse outcome.</description>

        <description>The Modified Scoring System for Evaluating Treatment Response in Early Coccidioidal Pneumonia (FLEET CAP) score is a clinical scoring system that allows a constellation of clinical symptoms to be quantified and scored over time: cough, fatigue, chest pain, dyspnea, sputum production, night sweats, fever and hypoxia. The recall period for symptom assessments was during the past week, with the exception of fever and hypoxia, which was measured on the day the FLEET CAP was administered. All symptoms are graded on a 0-3 severity scale, except for night sweats and hypoxia which are graded on a 0-2 severity scale, where 0 indicates the symptom is absent or normal. The range of total scores is from 0-22, where higher scores correspond to a worse outcome.</description>

        <description>The Modified Scoring System for Evaluating Treatment Response in Early Coccidioidal Pneumonia (FLEET CAP) score is a clinical scoring system that allows a constellation of clinical symptoms to be quantified and scored over time: cough, fatigue, chest pain, dyspnea, sputum production, night sweats, fever and hypoxia. The recall period for symptom assessments was during the past week, with the exception of fever and hypoxia, which was measured on the day the FLEET CAP was administered. All symptoms are graded on a 0-3 severity scale, except for night sweats and hypoxia which are graded on a 0-2 severity scale, where 0 indicates the symptom is absent or normal. The range of total scores is from 0-22, where higher scores correspond to a worse outcome.</description>

          <description>The Modified Scoring System for Evaluating Treatment Response in Early Coccidioidal Pneumonia (FLEET CAP) score is a clinical scoring system that allows a constellation of clinical symptoms to be quantified and scored over time: cough, fatigue, chest pain, dyspnea, sputum production, night sweats, fever and hypoxia. The recall period for symptom assessments was during the past week, with the exception of fever and hypoxia, which was measured on the day the FLEET CAP was administered. All symptoms are graded on a 0-3 severity scale, except for night sweats and hypoxia which are graded on a 0-2 severity scale, where 0 indicates the symptom is absent or normal. The range of total scores is from 0-22, where higher scores correspond to a worse outcome.</description>
          <population>The cocci-positive per-protocol population includes randomized participants who met the case definition of cocci pneumonia, were adherent with the intervention and had coccidioidal serology data available at the Day 1 and 22 visits. To be considered adherent at the Day 22 visit, the participant needed to take &gt;=80% of their expected pills.</population>

        <description>The Modified Scoring System for Evaluating Treatment Response in Early Coccidioidal Pneumonia (FLEET CAP) score is a clinical scoring system that allows a constellation of clinical symptoms to be quantified and scored over time: cough, fatigue, chest pain, dyspnea, sputum production, night sweats, fever and hypoxia. The recall period for symptom assessments was during the past week, with the exception of fever and hypoxia, which was measured on the day the FLEET CAP was administered. All symptoms are graded on a 0-3 severity scale, except for night sweats and hypoxia which are graded on a 0-2 severity scale, where 0 indicates the symptom is absent or normal. The range of total scores is from 0-22, where higher scores correspond to a worse outcome.</description>

        <title>The Median and Quartiles of the FLEET CAP Score and Each Component in the Cocci Positive Per-Protocol (PP) Population</title>
        <description>The Modified Scoring System for Evaluating Treatment Response in Early Coccidioidal Pneumonia (FLEET CAP) score is a clinical scoring system that allows a constellation of clinical symptoms to be quantified and scored over time: cough, fatigue, chest pain, dyspnea, sputum production, night sweats, fever and hypoxia. The recall period for symptom assessments was during the past week, with the exception of fever and hypoxia, which was measured on the day the FLEET CAP was administered. All symptoms are graded on a 0-3 severity scale, except for night sweats and hypoxia which are graded on a 0-2 severity scale, where 0 indicates the symptom is absent or normal. The range of total scores is from 0-22, where higher scores correspond to a worse outcome.</description>

        <title>The Median and Quartiles of the FLEET CAP Score and Each Component in the All Randomized Per-Protocol (PP) Population</title>
        <description>The Modified Scoring System for Evaluating Treatment Response in Early Coccidioidal Pneumonia (FLEET CAP) score is a clinical scoring system that allows a constellation of clinical symptoms to be quantified and scored over time: cough, fatigue, chest pain, dyspnea, sputum production, night sweats, fever and hypoxia. The recall period for symptom assessments was during the past week, with the exception of fever and hypoxia, which was measured on the day the FLEET CAP was administered. All symptoms are graded on a 0-3 severity scale, except for night sweats and hypoxia which are graded on a 0-2 severity scale, where 0 indicates the symptom is absent or normal. The range of total scores is from 0-22, where higher scores correspond to a worse outcome.</description>

        <title>The Median and Quartiles of the FLEET CAP Score and Each Component in the All Randomized Per-Protocol (PP) Population</title>
        <description>The Modified Scoring System for Evaluating Treatment Response in Early Coccidioidal Pneumonia (FLEET CAP) score is a clinical scoring system that allows a constellation of clinical symptoms to be quantified and scored over time: cough, fatigue, chest pain, dyspnea, sputum production, night sweats, fever and hypoxia. The recall period for symptom assessments was during the past week, with the exception of fever and hypoxia, which was measured on the day the FLEET CAP was administered. All symptoms are graded on a 0-3 severity scale, except for night sweats and hypoxia which are graded on a 0-2 severity scale, where 0 indicates the symptom is absent or normal. The range of total scores is from 0-22, where higher scores correspond to a worse outcome.</description>

        <title>The Median and Quartiles of the FLEET CAP Score and Each Component in the All Randomized Per-Protocol (PP) Population</title>
        <description>The Modified Scoring System for Evaluating Treatment Response in Early Coccidioidal Pneumonia (FLEET CAP) score is a clinical scoring system that allows a constellation of clinical symptoms to be quantified and scored over time: cough, fatigue, chest pain, dyspnea, sputum production, night sweats, fever and hypoxia. The recall period for symptom assessments was during the past week, with the exception of fever and hypoxia, which was measured on the day the FLEET CAP was administered. All symptoms are graded on a 0-3 severity scale, except for night sweats and hypoxia which are graded on a 0-2 severity scale, where 0 indicates the symptom is absent or normal. The range of total scores is from 0-22, where higher scores correspond to a worse outcome.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants Responding to the Individual Items of the PROMIS Item Bank v2.0 - Ability to Participate in Social Roles and Activities - Short Form 4a in the Cocci Positive Per Protocol Population</title>
        <description>The PROMIS Ability to Participate in Social Roles and Activities - Short Form 4a uses 4 questions to measure the participant's ability to participate in social roles and activities in the context of family, friends, leisure, and work. Four individual items are answered as &quot;Never&quot;, &quot;Rarely&quot;, &quot;Sometimes&quot;, &quot;Usually&quot;, or &quot;Always&quot; with an &quot;Always&quot; response indicating the most trouble participating in social roles and activities.</description>
        <time_frame>Visit 2 (Day 20-23)</time_frame>
        <population>The cocci-positive per-protocol population includes randomized participants who met the case definition of cocci pneumonia, were adherent with the intervention and had coccidioidal serology data available at the Day 1 and 22 visits. To be considered adherent at the Day 22 visit, the participant needed to take &gt;=80% of their expected pills.</population>

            <description>Fluconazole was supplied as 200mg over encapsulated tablets. Each gelatin capsule contained two-100mg fluconazole tablets and microcrystalline cellulose for overfill. Fluconazole 400 mg (administered orally as two 200mg capsules) was to be taken once daily for a minimum of 42 days.</description>

In order to maintain the blind, the gelatin capsules were the same size, weight, and color as the capsules containing fluconazole tablets. Placebo (administered orally as two matching placebo capsules) was to be taken once daily for a minimum of 42 days.</description>

        <description>The PROMIS Ability to Participate in Social Roles and Activities - Short Form 4a uses 4 questions to measure the participant's ability to participate in social roles and activities in the context of family, friends, leisure, and work. Four individual items are answered as &quot;Never&quot;, &quot;Rarely&quot;, &quot;Sometimes&quot;, &quot;Usually&quot;, or &quot;Always&quot; with an &quot;Always&quot; response indicating the most trouble participating in social roles and activities.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants Responding to the Individual Items of the PROMIS Item Bank v2.0 - Ability to Participate in Social Roles and Activities - Short Form 4a in the Cocci Positive Per Protocol Population</title>
        <description>The PROMIS Ability to Participate in Social Roles and Activities - Short Form 4a uses 4 questions to measure the participant's ability to participate in social roles and activities in the context of family, friends, leisure, and work. Four individual items are answered as &quot;Never&quot;, &quot;Rarely&quot;, &quot;Sometimes&quot;, &quot;Usually&quot;, or &quot;Always&quot; with an &quot;Always&quot; response indicating the most trouble participating in social roles and activities.</description>
        <time_frame>Visit 6 (Day 83-97)</time_frame>
        <population>The cocci-positive per-protocol population includes randomized participants who met the case definition of cocci pneumonia, were adherent with the intervention and had coccidioidal serology data available at the Day 1 and 22 visits. To be considered adherent at the Day 22 visit, the participant needed to take &gt;=80% of their expected pills.</population>

            <description>Fluconazole was supplied as 200mg over encapsulated tablets. Each gelatin capsule contained two-100mg fluconazole tablets and microcrystalline cellulose for overfill. Fluconazole 400 mg (administered orally as two 200mg capsules) was to be taken once daily for a minimum of 42 days.</description>

            <description>Placebo was supplied as matching gelatin capsules containing microcrystalline cellulose only. In order to maintain the blind, the gelatin capsules were the same size, weight, and color as the capsules containing fluconazole tablets. Placebo (administered orally as two matching placebo capsules) was to be taken once daily for a minimum of 42 days.</description>

        <description>The PROMIS Ability to Participate in Social Roles and Activities - Short Form 4a uses 4 questions to measure the participant's ability to participate in social roles and activities in the context of family, friends, leisure, and work. Four individual items are answered as &quot;Never&quot;, &quot;Rarely&quot;, &quot;Sometimes&quot;, &quot;Usually&quot;, or &quot;Always&quot; with an &quot;Always&quot; response indicating the most trouble participating in social roles and activities.</description>

        <description>The PROMIS Ability to Participate in Social Roles and Activities - Short Form 4a uses 4 questions to measure the participant's ability to participate in social roles and activities in the context of family, friends, leisure, and work. Four individual items are answered as &quot;Never&quot;, &quot;Rarely&quot;, &quot;Sometimes&quot;, &quot;Usually&quot;, or &quot;Always&quot; with an &quot;Always&quot; response indicating the most trouble participating in social roles and activities.</description>

        <description>The PROMIS Ability to Participate in Social Roles and Activities - Short Form 4a uses 4 questions to measure the participant's ability to participate in social roles and activities in the context of family, friends, leisure, and work. Four individual items are answered as &quot;Never&quot;, &quot;Rarely&quot;, &quot;Sometimes&quot;, &quot;Usually&quot;, or &quot;Always&quot; with an &quot;Always&quot; response indicating the most trouble participating in social roles and activities.</description>

        <title>The Proportion of Participants Who Achieve a Clinical Response, Defined as at Least a 50% Reduction in Composite FLEET CAP Score From Baseline, in All Randomized Participants, Regardless of Coccidioidomycosis Status or Adherence to Study Drug</title>
        <description>The Modified Scoring System for Evaluating Treatment Response in Early Coccidioidal Pneumonia (FLEET CAP) score is a clinical scoring system that allows a constellation of clinical symptoms to be quantified and scored over time: cough, fatigue, chest pain, dyspnea, sputum production, night sweats, fever and hypoxia. The recall period for symptom assessments was during the past week, with the exception of fever and hypoxia, which was measured on the day the FLEET CAP was administered. All symptoms are graded on a 0-3 severity scale, except for night sweats and hypoxia which are graded on a 0-2 severity scale, where 0 indicates the symptom is absent or normal. The range of total scores is from 0-22, where higher scores correspond to a worse outcome.</description>

        <description>The SF-12v2 uses 12 questions to measure functional health and well-being from the study participant's perspective across eight domains: physical functioning, role, bodily pain, general health perceptions, vitality, social functioning, emotional role, and mental health. Mental and physical composite scores (MCS &amp; PCS) are computed using the scores of twelve questions and range from 0 to 100, where a higher score indicates better health.</description>

        <title>The Mean for the Mental Component Summary (MCS) and the Physical Component Summary (PCS) Scores of the SF-12v2 Instrument, Cocci Positive PP Population</title>
        <description>The SF-12v2 uses 12 questions to measure functional health and well-being from the study participant's perspective across eight domains: physical functioning, role, bodily pain, general health perceptions, vitality, social functioning, emotional role, and mental health. Mental and physical composite scores (MCS &amp; PCS) are computed using the scores of twelve questions and range from 0 to 100, where a higher score indicates better health.</description>
        <time_frame>Day 180</time_frame>
        <population>The cocci-positive per-protocol population includes randomized participants who met the case definition of cocci pneumonia, were adherent with the intervention and had coccidioidal serology data available at the Day 1 and 22 visits. To be considered adherent at the Day 22 visit, the subject needed to take &gt;=80% of their expected pills.</population>

        <title>The Median for the Mental Component Summary (MCS) and the Physical Component Summary (PCS) Scores of the SF-12v2 Instrument, ITT Population</title>
        <description>The SF-12v2 uses 12 questions to measure functional health and well-being from the study participant's perspective across eight domains: physical functioning, role, bodily pain, general health perceptions, vitality, social functioning, emotional role, and mental health. Mental and physical composite scores (MCS &amp; PCS) are computed using the scores of twelve questions and range from 0 to 100, where a higher score indicates better health.</description>

        <title>The Median for the Mental Component Summary (MCS) and the Physical Component Summary (PCS) Scores of the SF-12v2 Instrument, ITT Population</title>
        <description>The SF-12v2 uses 12 questions to measure functional health and well-being from the study participant's perspective across eight domains: physical functioning, role, bodily pain, general health perceptions, vitality, social functioning, emotional role, and mental health. Mental and physical composite scores (MCS &amp; PCS) are computed using the scores of twelve questions and range from 0 to 100, where a higher score indicates better health.</description>

        <title>The Median for the Mental Component Summary (MCS) and the Physical Component Summary (PCS) Scores of the SF-12v2 Instrument, Cocci Positive Modified Intent-to-Treat Population</title>
        <description>The SF-12v2 uses 12 questions to measure functional health and well-being from the study participant's perspective across eight domains: physical functioning, role, bodily pain, general health perceptions, vitality, social functioning, emotional role, and mental health. Mental and physical composite scores (MCS &amp; PCS) are computed using the scores of twelve questions and range from 0 to 100, where a higher score indicates better health.</description>

        <title>The Median for the Mental Component Summary (MCS) and the Physical Component Summary (PCS) Scores of the SF-12v2 Instrument, All Randomized mITT Population</title>
        <description>The SF-12v2 uses 12 questions to measure functional health and well-being from the study participant's perspective across eight domains: physical functioning, role, bodily pain, general health perceptions, vitality, social functioning, emotional role, and mental health. Mental and physical composite scores (MCS &amp; PCS) are computed using the scores of twelve questions and range from 0 to 100, where a higher score indicates better health.</description>
