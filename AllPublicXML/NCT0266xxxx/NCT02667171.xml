  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      International and national publications emphasize that COPD rehabilitation is a key
      cornerstone in the standard treatment of COPD, based on more than 15 years of research in
      COPD rehabilitation. COPD rehabilitation improves quality of life, anxiety and depression and
      physical function. COPD rehabilitation including special physical training, patient-directed
      education and smoking cessation is core rehabilitation elements, which today are recommended
      as mandatory content in standard COPD rehabilitation.

      Standard COPD rehabilitation is an established offer in all regions and municipalities in
      Denmark. It is however a well-known challenge, that persons with the most severe COPD
      symptoms and co-morbidities are most likely not to receive COPD rehabilitation. Frequent
      exacerbations, socially isolation, transport distance to rehabilitation are main reasons why
      people with severe COPD disease deliberately chooses not to receive COPD rehabilitation. Why
      there at present are no rehabilitation alternatives for patients with the most severe COPD
      symptoms, supervised COPD Online rehabilitation in groups, delivered by health professionals
      in the COPD patients' own home via a computer screen could likely encourage more people to
      participate. The number of RCT's investigating the effect of supervised Online delivered COPD
      rehabilitation in groups versus established COPD rehabilitation are very limited.

      The purpose of this randomized study is to investigate the short-term and long-term efficacy
      of 10 weeks of online COPD rehabilitation versus conventional supervised COPD rehabilitation
      in people with severe and very severe COPD. The outcome of the intervention is measured on
      walking distance, muscle endurance, activity level, quality of life and COPD symptoms
      respectively. Outcomes are measures before intervention start, end of intervention. This
      study also collects follow-up update after 3, 6 and 12 month. The follow-up data will be in
      separate publication.

      Hypothesis

        1. COPD online rehabilitation provides significant larger improvements than the usual care
           on walking distance, muscle endurance, activity level, and quality of life and COPD
           symptoms in people with severe and very severe COPD.

        2. COPD online rehabilitation and conventional COPD rehabilitation, provides clinically
           relevant improvement on walking distance, muscle endurance, activity level, quality of
           life and COPD symptoms in people with severe and very severe COPD.

    <masking>Double (Investigator, Outcomes Assessor)</masking>
    <masking_description>All assessors are blinded to group allocation and previous test results. Due to the nature of the study the patients cannot be blinded, but prior to the assessments they are reminded not to disclose their group allocation to the assessors. In case of failure keeping the outcome assessor blinded (that is, if a participant reveals his/her allocation) a second assessor will be available to step in and conduct the assessment on another day.
To avoid investigators (subconscious) bias the biostatistician who perform the data analyses and validate the results will be blinded to group allocation.
The research group will interpret the results, and the conclusion will be prepared in two versions before the allocation code is broken (one assuming that arm A is the intervention, and one assuming that arm B is the intervention).</masking_description>
