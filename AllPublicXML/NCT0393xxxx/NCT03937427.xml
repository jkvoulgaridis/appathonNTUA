  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) impacts approximately 5% of Canadians. CRS patients suffer from
      a combination of symptoms that include facial pain, nasal obstruction, hyposmia and
      mucopurulence discharge. Asthma may additionally worsen quality of life and many patients
      suffer from both conditions. The unified airway model illustrates a link between both
      conditions as tissue from the middle ear to the sinus cavity to the lungs function as one
      unit. Despite evidence for the unified airway model in the setting of CRS and asthma, there
      are no studies to our knowledge that have evaluated the microbiome (the resident microbes and
      their genetic expressions that affect disease) of the upper and lower airways in this patient
      population. Determining the microbiome of the upper and lower airways in patients suffering
      from CRS and asthma will further support the unified airway model but more importantly, will
      help contribute to understanding the pathophysiology of this inflammatory process and may
      help guide future management.

        We will analyze and compare the upper and lower airways from 12 CRS with asthma patients
        and 12 CRS without asthma patients matched for age, sex and degree of sinus disease based
        on CT grading using Lund-Mackay staging system.14
