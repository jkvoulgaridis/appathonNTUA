  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This prospective non-interventional comparator study is to collect data on the clinical
      effectiveness and compliance of Ectoin® Mouth Wash solution (EML03) and to proof superiority
      to a well-established medical device on the market in the prevention of radiation-induced
      mucositis. The study doesn´t intervene with routine treatment strategy.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in degree of mucositis (according to WHO classification of mucositis grade) documented by the physician</measure>
    <time_frame>Visit 1 (day 0), Visit 2 (after 14 days), Visit 3 (after 28 days), Visit 4 (after 42 days), Visit 5 (28 days after the last RT)</time_frame>
    <description>The degree of oral mucositis will be assessed as follow: grade 0, no signs or symptoms; grade 1, oral soreness and erythema; grade 2, oral erythema, ulcers and solid diet tolerated; grade 3, oral ulcers and liquid diet only; grade 4, oral alimentation impossible</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in mucositis symptoms dry mucosa, irritation of mucosa, coated tongue, unpleasant breath, decreased saliva release, pain, swelling, ulcer, difficulty to speak and difficulty to eat and dring by using a Numeric Rating Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>day 0, day 14, day 26, day 42, Visit 5 (28 days after the last RT)</time_frame>
    <description>Mucositis symptoms will be measured by using a 4-point scale ranging from 0 (no symptoms) to 3 (severe symptoms).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of patients with treatment-related adverse events will be assessed by using the Suspect Adverse Reaction Report Form (CIOMS Form I)</measure>
    <time_frame>within 28 days after starting radiotherapy</time_frame>
    <description>All occuring adverse events/serious adverse events will be documented during the entire study period.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in Karnofsky status over time by using the Karnofsky Performance Scale (KPS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Visit 1 (day 0), Visit 2 (after 14 days), Visit 3 (after 28 days), Visit 4 (after 42 days), Visit 5 (after 28 days after the last RT)</time_frame>
    <description>The KPS index allows patients to be classified as to their functional impairment and describes a patient's functional status as a comprehensive 11-point scale correlating to percentage values ranging from 100% (no symptoms) to 0% (death).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Tolerability assessment by using a subsequent patient questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>day 28</time_frame>
    <description>The following score system will be used to quantify these evaluation: &quot;very good&quot; = 4; &quot;good&quot; =3; &quot;neither good nor bad&quot; = 2; &quot;bad&quot; = 1 and &quot;very bad&quot; = 0.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>

    <measure>Satisfaction assessed by a subsequent patient questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>day 28</time_frame>
    <description>The following score system will be used to quantify these evaluation: &quot;yes&quot; 2; &quot;maybe&quot; = 1; and &quot;no&quot; = 0.</description>
