  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The standard surgical treatment for glaucoma is trabeculectomy. The PRESERFLO™ (formerly
      InnFocus) Microshunt (IMS) is a new, minimally invasive drainage device which has been
      suggested to result in similar IOP lowering, but with faster visual recovery and less
      complications and postoperative interventions. The objective of this study is to aid in
      deciding on the use of the IMS in glaucoma surgery by assessing its efficacy and
      cost-effectiveness in patients with primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) compared to the
      standard trabeculectomy (TE).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During the last decade, minimally invasive glaucoma surgery (MIGS) procedures have been
      introduced to the market. MIGS procedures or devices, often small stents or tubes that can be
      placed into the eye, are potentially safer than standard trabeculectomy (TE). The surgery is
      faster and easier to perform. Patient recovery is faster with fewer postoperative visits,
      suggesting less impact on vision and quality of life. However, MIGS devices are more
      expensive compared to standard surgery and it is unclear if the higher costs can be
      compensated with their better safety profile and faster patient recovery (reduced
      productivity losses).

      To establish guidelines for the use of MIGS, the Netherlands Glaucoma Group has recognized
      the need for a formal investigation of their cost-effectiveness as compared to TE, prior to
      their implementation on a large scale for regular care. Therefore, a societal
      cost-effectiveness analysis of MIGS procedures will be undertaken to further elucidate their
      position in the glaucoma treatment algorithm in the Netherlands.

      The objective of this study is to aid in deciding on the use of the IMS in glaucoma surgery
      by assessing its efficacy and cost-effectiveness in patients with primary open angle glaucoma
      compared to trabeculectomy.

               -  Iodine allergy

               -  Unwilling to discontinue contact lens after surgery

         10. Contraindication or allergy to mitomycin C.

         11. Any contraindication to tube placement (e.g. shallow anterior chamber, insufficient
             endothelial cell density).

         12. Use of oral hypotensive glaucoma medications for treatment of the fellow eye.

         13. Prior ocular laser treatment within 3 months of the surgery, increasing the risk of
             in-flammation in the eye.

         14. Corneal thickness &lt;450um or &gt;620microns.

         15. Conditions associated with elevated episcleral venous pressure such as active thyroid
             orbitopathy.

         16. Among patients in whom both eyes are eligible only the first eye is undergoing
             surgical treatment is enrolled in the study.
