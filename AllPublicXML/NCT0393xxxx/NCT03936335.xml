    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to describe and compare the incidence of adverse pregnancy
      outcomes (spontaneous abortion/miscarriage, stillbirth) and prevalence of infant outcomes
      (major congenital malformations [MCMs], small for gestational age [SGA]) in women with AD who
      are treated with dupilumab during pregnancy relative to women with AD who are not treated
      with dupilumab during pregnancy.
