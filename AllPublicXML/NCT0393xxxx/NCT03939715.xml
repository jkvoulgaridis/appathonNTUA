      The investigator is comparing FDA-approved DermaPure with patient's own native tissue for the
      repair of pelvic organ prolapse. Please see below for detailed objectives and endpoints for
      our measuring parameters:

      Objectives

      Specific Aim #1:

      To determine the relative safety and efficacy of anterior and multi-compartment vaginal wall
      prolapse repair augmented with decellularized human dermal allograft (DermaPure速) versus
      anterior and multi-compartment repair employing native tissue.

      Specific Aim #2:

      To evaluate bulge symptoms, quality of life, sexual function, and patient satisfaction

      Our hypothesis is that pelvic organ prolapse repair augmented with DermaPure速 will provide
      superior anatomic outcomes as compared to native tissue controls with a non-inferior safety
      profile.

      Endpoints

      Safety Endpoint #1:

      The relative proportion of allograft, native tissue, and procedure-related SAE's at 12
      months.

      Safety Endpoint #2:

      The relative proportion of allograft, native tissue, and procedure-related AE's of interest
      at 12 months, which include:

        -  Vaginal shortening

        -  Vaginal scarring or banding

        -  De novo vaginal bleeding

        -  Atypical vaginal discharge

        -  Fistula formation

        -  De novo dyspareunia

        -  Pelvic pain

        -  Peri-operative infection

        -  Vaginal infection

        -  UTI

        -  Neuromuscular disorder

        -  SUI (worsening or de novo)

        -  UUI (worsening or de novo)

        -  Difficulty emptying bladder (worsening or de novo)

        -  Graft exposure (into vagina)

        -  Graft erosion (into viscus)

      Efficacy Endpoint #1:

      The proportion of patients in each group at 36 months with prolapse of the target compartment
      beyond the hymen.

      Efficacy Endpoint #2:

      The proportion of patients in each group at 36 months with bulge symptoms attributable to the
      target compartment as determined by PFDI-20 question number 3 (&quot;Does the participant usually
      have a bulge or something falling out that the participant can see or feel in the vaginal
      area&quot;) answering &quot;yes&quot; and &gt;= 2 (responses of &quot;somewhat&quot;, &quot;moderately&quot;, or &quot;quite a bit&quot;).
      (Barber)

      Efficacy Endpoint #3:

      The proportion of patients in each group at 36 months requiring re-treatment for recurrent
      prolapse of the target compartment (to include surgery, physical therapy or pessary
      insertion).

      Efficacy Endpoint #4:

      Change in quality of life in each group from baseline to 36 months as measured by the PFDI-20
      and the PFIQ-7. (Barber)

      Efficacy Endpoint #5:

      Change in sexual function in each group from baseline to 36 months as measured by the
      PISQ-IR. (Rogers)

      Efficacy Endpoint #6:

      Patient satisfaction in each group at 36 months as measured by the SSQ-8. (Haff)

      Efficacy Endpoint #7:

      Patient impression in each group at 36 months of postoperative improvement by the PGI-I
      (Srikrishna)
