  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      INNODIA is a global consortium linking 26 academic institutions, 4 industrial partners, a
      small to medium enterprise (SME), and 2 patient organisations, bringing their knowledge and
      experience together with one common goal: &quot;To fight type 1 diabetes&quot;. (www.innodia.eu).

      The project, approved in November 2015 and launched in January 2016, runs under the framework
      of the Innovative Medicines Initiative - Joint Undertaking
      (https://www.imi.europa.eu/projects-results/project-factsheets/innodia) with a dedicated
      governance structure ensuring close interaction, communication and adherence to the
      objectives and deliverables of the consortium.

      The overall aim of INNODIA is to advance in a decisive way how to predict, stage, evaluate
      and prevent the onset and progression of type 1 diabetes (T1D). For this, INNODIA has
      established a comprehensive and interdisciplinary network of clinical and basic scientists,
      who are leading experts in the field of T1D research in Europe, with complementary expertise
      from the areas of immunology, Beta-cell biology, biomarker research and T1D therapy, joining
      forces in a coordinated fashion with industry partners and two foundations, as well as with
      all major stakeholders in the process, including regulatory bodies and patients with T1D and
      their families.

      One of the objectives of INNODIA is to develop a new European clinical research network with
      standardized protocol based on repeated measures of C-peptide (including home measurements)
      and comprehensive collection of appropriate biological samples for 'omics', immune, viral and
      microbiome studies in new onset T1D patients and high-risk auto-antibody positive subjects. A
      protocol for the harmonization of sample collections in newly diagnosed type 1 diabetic
      patients and first degree relatives of patients with type 1 diabetes was developed following
      extensive preliminary work involving partners from across all specialities. Core laboratories
      with experience in their respective field were set up for analysis of auto-antibodies, fresh
      immune cells, handling of frozen immune cells, C-peptide measures. A series of standard
      operating procedures for sample collections and analysis were agreed. Sample tracking between
      clinical centres and central laboratories was included into a purposely designed electronic
      case report form (eCRF) into which all clinical and laboratory data collected are captured.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a longitudinal observational study of the relationship between measures of β-cell
      function, genotype, immunological phenotype and potential environmental factors over time, in
      individuals with new onset T1D or first degree relatives at higher risk for T1D due to the
      presence of auto-antibodies.

      It is a multicentre international study involving clinical centres across Europe which is
      unique in the following ways:

        1. The first such collaboration in Europe

        2. Novel evaluation of C-peptide/β-cell function using both home dried blood spots and
           regular hospital mixed meal tolerance tests or oral glucose tolerance tests

        3. Identical study procedures across all clinical centres

        4. Centralised analysis/storage of clinically relevant samples

        5. The creation of a living 'Biobank' whereby participants can be recalled for study on the
           basis of specific genotype/phenotypes

        6. Linkage to innovative study of novel biomarkers to inform future interventional
           strategies

        7. A potential pipeline for future recruitment and consent to novel innovative
           interventional strategies

      The study is divided into 2 arms:

      In arm A, the investigators plan to recruit 1500 newly diagnosed T1D patients within 6 weeks
      from diagnosis. The last study visit will be planned 2 years from diagnosis or until the end
      of the study. Therefore, the duration of the study will be approximately 2 years consisting
      of 5 visits. At baseline, C-peptide and immunophenotyping are evaluated. Follow up consists
      of regular mixed meal tolerance test (MMTT) and providing blood, urine and stool samples for
      'omics', immune, viral and microbiome studies. Home dried blood spots (DBS) pre and post a
      standardized meal will be collected monthly for the duration of the study.

      These recruited participants will be included for further observational study, confirmation
      of potential biomarkers and will ultimately provide a pipeline for future recruitment to
      interventional studies.

      In arm B, the investigators plan to screen approximately 3000 unaffected first degree family
      members across all centres during the first 3 years. The family members will be screened for
      4 auto-antibodies (GAD65, IA-2A, IAA, ZnT8A).

      Unaffected family members who are auto-antibody positive will be followed up for
      approximately 4 years consisting of visits every 6 months for the first 2 years and then
      every 12 months until the end of the study. Follow up will consist of regular oral glucose
      tolerance test (OGTT) and providing blood, urine and stool samples for 'omics', immune, viral
      and microbiome studies. Home dried blood spots (DBS) will be collected monthly for the
      duration of the study.

      Unaffected participants who are auto-antibody negative will be sent annual questionnaires
      until the end of the study.

      All study participants will be consented to a living 'Biobank' where we will be able to
      request participants to be recalled by genotype/phenotype for further studies involving
      blood, urine and stool samples.
