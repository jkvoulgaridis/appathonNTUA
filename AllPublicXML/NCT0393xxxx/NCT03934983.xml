  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study will evaluate the performance of the Quantra System comprised of the Quantra
      Hemostasis Analyzer with the QStat Cartridge in trauma patients.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Quantra System is a fully integrated and automated in vitro diagnostic device which uses
      SEER Sonorheometry, an ultrasound-based technology, to characterize the viscoelastic
      properties of a whole blood sample during coagulation. The QStat Cartridge was developed to
      monitor hemostasis in patients that may experience a range of coagulopathies of various
      etiologies including fibrinolytic defects. This includes the trauma patient population. The
      cartridge consists of four independent channels each containing different sets of reagents,
      which provide four measurements performed in parallel yielding five parameters that depict
      the functional status of a patient's coagulation system.

      This single-center, prospective, observational pilot study will evaluate the performance of
      the Quantra System with the QStat Cartridge as compared to standard coagulation tests and
      comparable measures using conventional viscoelastic testing methods.
