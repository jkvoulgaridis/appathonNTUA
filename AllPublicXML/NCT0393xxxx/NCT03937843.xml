      The trial investigates a stage-adapted (stage IIA or IIB) de-escalation of the standard
      treatments in the context of a multimodality treatment with chemo- and radiotherapy in
      seminoma patients. The goal is to safely de-escalate treatment while maintaining/enhancing
      efficacy, which is not a standard practice yet.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Therapy de-escalation in stage IIA/B seminoma represents an unmet need in clinical practice;
      efficacy of modern standard of care therapies for these patients is high and only a few
      patients show disease recurrence but short- and long-term toxicities are a major concern. The
      magnitude of long-term toxicities is often associated with the intensity of the prescribed
      treatment modality. A higher cumulative dose of chemotherapy agents and radiation dose has
      been linked to a sharp increase in long-term sequelae. Combining treatment modalities and
      diversifying toxicity may thus provide an opportunity to limit long-term treatment sequelae.

      In this trial carboplatin, cisplatin and etoposide are the Investigational Medicine Products
      (IMPs). They are all medications with a marketing authorization for several solid tumor types
      and are standard practice in the treatment of testicular cancer in Switzerland and in the
      European Union (EU).

      Radiotherapy is also a standard therapy in this indication.

      However, the trial investigates a stage-adapted (stage IIA or IIB) de-escalation of these
      standard treatments in the context of a multimodality treatment with chemo- and radiotherapy.
      The goal is to safely de-escalate treatment while maintaining/enhancing efficacy, which is
      not a standard practice yet.

      The SAKK 01/18 trial is designed with the aim to answer these three questions:

        -  Can the dose of involved-node radiotherapy be safely reduced in the context of
           multimodality treatment with chemo- and radiotherapy?

        -  Can a more potent chemotherapy in the form of cisplatin/etoposide reduce the rate of
           distant failure in comparison to carboplatin?

        -  Can a combination of cisplatin/etoposide and involved-node radiotherapy pose a potent
           treatment regime for patients with recurrence after adjuvant carboplatin or radiotherapy
           for stage I seminoma? Furthermore, as active surveillance is becoming standard of care
           in stage I seminoma, it is projected that the amount of patients in need of treatment
           with stage IIA/B disease will rise, due to more patients developing disease progression
           during active surveillance.

      The trial design, trial treatment and trial specifics are a consensus among the Swiss
      Urogenital Tumors Project Group and the Swiss Radio-oncology Section from the Swiss Group for
      Clinical Cancer Research (SAKK) and the German Testicular Cancer Study Group (GTCSG).

    <description>PFS is defined as the time from registration until one of the following events occurs:
Progressive disease or relapse, defined as progression according to the modified trial-specific version of RECIST 1.1 or a rising level of the tumor marker beta-hCG (beta human chorionic gonadotropin) over the ULN (Upper limit of normal), confirmed by a second measurement. Presence of non-seminoma germ cell tumor has to be excluded in the latter case
Death from any cause.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Response rate (RR)</measure>
    <time_frame>at 3 months and 3 years after registration</time_frame>
    <description>The response is categorized according to the modified trial-specific version of RECIST 1.1 measurability criteria as: complete remission (CR), partial remission (PR), stable disease (SD), progressive disease (PD).
The response rate is defined as proportion of patients with CR or PR on imaging assessment and without rising beta-hCG. Patients with CR, PR and SD on imaging assessment, but with confirmed rising beta-hCG will not be counted as responders, if the presence on non-seminoma germ cell tumor was excluded. Response rate will be evaluated at 3 months and 3 years after registration.</description>

          -  Any other serious underlying medical, psychiatric, psychological, familial or
             geographical condition, which in the judgment of the investigator may interfere with
             the planned staging, treatment and follow-up, affect patient compliance or place the
             patient at high risk from treatment-related complications.

        Additional German specific exclusion criteria - not to be considered for Swiss patients

          -  Patient who is dependent on the sponsor or the investigators according to ICH/GCP
