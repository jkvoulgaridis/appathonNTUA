      This is a double blind randomized control study to evaluate a daily disposable contact lens.
      It is planned to have 30 evaluable subjects at least divided evenly among 3 independent PIs.
      Each PI will enroll 12 subjects at least. The ration of evaluable test subjects to control
      subjects will be 2 to 1. The study lens will be dispensed randomly to subjects who have
      normal ocular health and conform to a set of criteria. It is necessary to wear the lens 8
      hours a day and 5 days a week at least and follow up for one month (30 days). Data will be
      collected at baseline, 1 week, 2 week and 4 week of daily disposable modality including
      Adverse Reactions, Slit-lamp findings and Symptoms, Problems, and Complaints, vision acuity,
      keratometry change and reason for discontinuation.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject should have normal eye and use no ocular medications

          -  VA correctable to 0.1 LogMAR or better, with spherical lenses ranging in power from
             -1.00 to -10.00 D myopia, astigmatism =&lt; 2.00 D

          -  Willing to comply with all study procedures and be available for the duration of the
             study.

          -  Provide signed and dated informed consent form.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects have history of allergies that would contraindicate &quot;normal&quot; contact lens
             wear.

          -  Subjects have other active ocular or systemic disease such as, but not limited to:
             anterior uveitis (past or present), glaucoma, Sj√∂gren's syndrome, lupus erythematosus,
             sclerodermas, keratoconus or type II diabetes, slip lamp findings greater than grade I
             (such as cornea or interstitial edema).

          -  Subjects have medications that would contraindicate contact lens wear.

          -  The presence of clinically significant (grade 3 or 4) anterior segment abnormalities;
             inflammations such as iritis; or any infection of the eye, lids, or associated
             structures.

          -  A known history of corneal hypoesthesia (reduced corneal sensitivity), corneal ulcer,
             corneal infiltrates or fungal infections.

          -  A history of papillary conjunctivitis that has interfered with contact lens wear.

          -  Any active participation in another clinical trial within 30 days prior to this study.

          -  Have had any cornea surgery.

          -  Currently pregnant (to the best of the subject's knowledge), is lactating or is
             planning a pregnancy within the next 1 month.

          -  Monocular or monovision fits

          -  Alcoholic or Drug Abused.
