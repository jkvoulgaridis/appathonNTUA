      receiving a clinical medication review.

      Falls in people aged 65 years and over are a common reason for calling the emergency
      ambulance service. Falls can be serious, with about 1 in 20 people having to be taken to
      hospital because they have been injured. Thankfully, in more than 4 out of 10 cases, people
      are not seriously injured and can be left at home. However, it is important that the reason
      for the fall is found and future falls are prevented where possible.

      Yorkshire Ambulance Service can already make a referral to another local service to get
      specialist practical help for falls prevention when people are left at home after a fall.
      Research has shown that the safe use of medicines can prevent future falls, but that did not
      form. Now a new service has been set up for Yorkshire Ambulance Service to refer patients to
      the Leeds GP Confederation. A pharmacist working in the patients GP surgery will undertake a
      review of the patient's use of their medicines.

      We would like to find out about how patients feel about using their medicines before and
      after the medicines review by a pharmacist. We would also like to know how they feel about
      the medicines review itself, to help decide whether this scheme should continue or be
      expanded to other areas. To do this, we are going to send a questionnaire to patients who
      receive a medicines review. The questionnaire will be sent by post, take about 10 minutes to
      fill out and include a stamped addressed envelope so people who take part will not have to
      pay for postage.

    <description>Patients who are eligible for this study will have been previously identified as part of the PREFACES project. The pharmacist who has conducted the clinical medication review will obtain verbal permission from the patient to be contacted by the research study team. This will be documented on the referral outcome document that is returned to the YAS clinical team. A member of YAS clinical staff from the PREFACES project will forward the name and residential address of patients who have agreed to be contacted to the research paramedic for this study. A covering letter, participant information sheet, questionnaire and consent form, will be posted to potential participants. A stamped addressed envelope will be included to enable return of the completed booklet at no costs to participants.</description>

        This study will be conducted from a single site (Yorkshire Ambulance Service NHS Trust).
        YAS staff make around 70-100 falls referral pathways a month in the Leeds area, and after
        exclusions relating to the PREFACS projects, it is anticipated that around 55 patients per
        month will be eligible to receive a pharmacist-led clinical medication review and will
        therefore be eligible for this study, up to a maximum of 550 patients.
