    <textblock>
      This pilot randomized controlled trial investigates a novel, group-based emotion regulation
      skills training intervention for reducing anxious and depressive symptomatology and improving
      emotion regulation and problem solving in individuals with MS and the individual's support
      partners. Participants will be randomized (1:1) to the intervention (&quot;Partnered Emotion
      Regulation Skills Intervention and Supportive Teaching [PERSIST]&quot;) or to the active control
      (Facilitated Peer Support).
