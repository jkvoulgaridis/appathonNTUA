  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the hospice ward, there are lots of suffered hospital patients with multiple physical
      discomfort related to terminal disease. Investigators want to use an objective measure
      instrument to monitor the effects of complementary and alternative medicine and clinical
      symptoms. First, investigators use the Meridian Energy Analysis Device (MEAD) to measure the
      bilateral 12 Yuan points (primary points) of terminal hospice patients. It provides the
      prediction value between terminal disease and the change of different meridian energy.
      Besides, the meridian energy value maybe predict the survival period. Then, the intervention
      of complementary and alternative medicine can also monitor via MEAD.

      In the hospice ward, there are lots of suffered hospital patients with multiple physical
      discomfort related to terminal disease. It may be caused by cancer or multiple kinds of organ
      failure. The terminal hospital patients have symptoms such as pain, dyspnea, fatigue, nausea,
      vomiting, poor appetite, constipation, ileus or edema…, etc. Investigators want to use an
      objective measure instrument to monitor the effects of complementary and alternative
      medicine.

      First, investigators use the Meridian Energy Analysis Device (MEAD) to measure the bilateral
      12 Yuan points (primary points) of terminal hospice patients (divided to cancer, multiple
      kinds of organ failure). It provides the prediction value between terminal disease and the
      change of different meridian energy. Besides, the meridian energy value maybe predict the
      survival period. Then, investigators use the intervention of complementary and alternative
      medicine (like infrared lamp and acupressure…, etc.) to improve the quality of life in the
      terminal hospice patients. Also, investigators will use the Meridian Energy Analysis Device,
      pain scale, vital signs and quality of life scale (SF-36) to evaluate the effects of
      complementary and alternative medicine.

    <measure>The change of 24 points skin electric conductance over bilateral wrist and foot in terminal patients</measure>
    <time_frame>through hospitalization period, an average of 1 month (after admission baseline evaluation and till discharge)</time_frame>
    <description>Investigators use the meridian energy analysis device to measure the 24 points skin conductance over bilateral wrist and foot. The meridian energy analysis device is an electrophysiology tool to measure the skin micro-electrical currents(range from 0uA to 200uA). The higher skin conductance stands for better condition of patient. Investigators will evaluate the relationship between the skin conductances and clinical symptoms. Then investigators will check the effect via the skin electric conductance before and after the infrared lamp and acupressure intervention.</description>
