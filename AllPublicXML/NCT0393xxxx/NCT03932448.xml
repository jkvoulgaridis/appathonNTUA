  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study is a collaboration between Microbiology, SU/Sahlgrenska and the Infectious
      Diseases clinic at SU/Östra as well as several Infectious Diseases clinics throughout Sweden
      aiming at improving microbiological diagnostic assays regarding the early identification of
      tick-borne microorganisms (including as of yet unidentified pathogens) capable of causing
      human disease using modern diagnostic tools.

      At the initial study visit (day 0) plasma, serum, urine, saliva, and PBMCs (and tick, if
      available) will be collected from patients developing fever within two weeks after a tick
      bite. Additional follow-up samples will be obtained after 9 and 30 days as well as after 6
      months. The initial samples will be analyzed using (a) directed multiplex PCR analysis for
      Tick-Borne Encephalitis (TBE), Borrelia, Anaplasma, Neoerlichia, Rickettsia, Coxiella,
      Tularemia, and Babesiosis in plasma, whole blood and urine, (b) conventional IgM and IgG
      serology for TBE, (c) &quot;Next Generation Sequencing&quot; (NGS) for the detection of bacterial 16s
      rRNA as well as unknown viruses, (d) potential biomarkers, and (e) host genetic factors.
      Among patients where initial sampling indicates the presence of a potential pathogen or in
      patients developing neurological symptoms, a lumbar puncture will be performed and CSF will
      be further analyzed. Samples will also be evaluated regarding potential microbiological
      factors predisposing for severity of infection.

      The primary objective of the study is to improve diagnostic tools in the initial early phase
      of infections caused by tick-borne pathogens, especially TBE prior to the affliction of the
      central nervous system, and to attempt to identify which factors impact the course of
      infection as it is believed that approximately 75% of infected individuals resolve their
      infection in this first phase whereas others develop meningoencephalitis with significant
      subsequent neurological sequelae. Secondary objectives of the study include investigating for
      the presence of and treating other tick-borne pathogens, setting the stage for coming
      clinical trials evaluating novel anti-viral therapies for TBE.
