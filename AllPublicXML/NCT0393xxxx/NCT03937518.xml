      Patients were recruited from Rheumatology and Rehabilitation

      Outpatient Clinic at Mansoura University Hospi Patients were divided into two groups:

      Group 1: included 15 patients who received oral strontium ranelate and physiotherapy program.
      The age of the patients ranged from 50 to 62 years, they were 11 females and 4 males. Group
      2: included 15 patients who received physiotherapy program. The age of the patients ranged
      from 50 to 62 years, they were 12 females and 3 males. Written consent was obtained from each

    <description>VAS pain is a uni-dimensional tool used to measure pain intensity. It is a 10 cm horizontal line marked every 1 cm. Pain intensity ranges from 0 (no pain, the left end of the line) to 10 (worst possible pain, the right end of the line). The following cut points on the pain VAS have been recommended: no pain (0-4 mm), mild pain (5- 44 mm), moderate pain (45-74 mm), and severe pain (75-100 mm)</description>

    <description>Patients were assessed before treatment, at 3rd and 6th month after treatment using Western Ontario and McMaster Universities OA index (WOMAC). WOMAC is a self-administered composite questionnaire with three components to assess pain, knee stiffness and difficulty in the activity of daily living. Its first section contains 5 questions about pain, the second section includes 2 questions which assess knee stiffness and the last section is formed of 17 questions that measure the difficulty in the activity of daily living performance.</description>

    <description>Patients received strontium ranelate 2gm (one sachet daily with 50 ml water at bedtime at least 2 h after food), as the compliance of patient assessed by counting number of sachet that patient returns at every visit and safety is assessed by recording adverse effects as blood pressure and heart rate every visit and patients received physiotherapy program in the form of (US therapeutic acoustic radiation and exercise program) 3 times per week for 6 months.
Ultra sound (US):
Pulsed ultrasonic waves were delivered at a 1 MHz frequency and at an intensity of 1 watt/ cm2 via a transducer with a diameter of 5 cm and effective radiating area of 3.5 to 5cm² for 9.5 min (</description>

    <description>Ultra sound (US):
Pulsed ultrasonic waves were delivered at a 1 MHz frequency and at an intensity of 1 watt/ cm2 via a transducer with a diameter of 5 cm and effective radiating area of 3.5 to 5cm² for 9.5 min (Medserve, England) (Huang et al., 2001). Patients were positioned in a supine position with the affected knee flexed at 90° and the sound head was held stationary over the tibiofemoral joint medial to the patellar tendon to enhance energy penetration into the joint space (White et al., 2007).
Exercise program:
The subjects were treated with a group-exercise program composed of a range of motion of all lower limb and 45 min strengthening exercises with 5 min stretching exercises of lower limb muscles 3 times per week under the supervision of the same physiatrist (Fitzgerald and Oatis</description>
