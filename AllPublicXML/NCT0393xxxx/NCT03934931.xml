      The Options for Delivering Isoniazid-Rifapentine (3HP) for TB Prevention (3HP Options
      Implementation Trial) study will be a three-arm, open-label, parallel, randomized trial. This
      hybrid effectiveness-implementation trial will be conducted among people living with HIV
      infection (PLHIV) enrolled in HIV/AIDS care at the Mulago Immune Suppression Syndrome (i.e.,
      HIV/AIDS) clinic in Kampala, Uganda. The overall objective of this study is to identify a
      patient-centered delivery strategy that will facilitate acceptance and completion of a
      three-month (12-dose) regimen of weekly rifapentine (RPT) and isoniazid (INH) by PLHIV
      enrolled in routine HIV/AIDS care in a high HIV/TB burden country. The primary outcome will
      be acceptance and completion of 3HP. Additional objectives will be to evaluate the
      implementation and cost-effectiveness of each delivery strategy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of this study is to identify a patient-centered strategy that will
      facilitate 3HP uptake by PLHIV in the context of routine HIV/AIDS care in a high HIV/TB
      burden country. The investigators' central hypothesis is that offering PLHIV an informed
      choice between directly observed therapy (DOT) and self-administered therapy (SAT) delivery
      strategies that are optimized to overcome key barriers to treatment adherence will result in
      greater acceptance and completion of 3HP. To test this hypothesis, the investigators will
      conduct a pragmatic randomized trial of three optimized strategies for delivering 3HP.
      Eligible participants will be randomized to one of three arms to receive latent tuberculosis
      infection (LTBI) treatment with once weekly INH and RPT for 12 weeks given by either
      facilitated DOT, facilitated SAT, or an informed choice between facilitated DOT and
      facilitated SAT (with the assistance of a decision aid tool).

      Primary Objective: To compare the uptake of 3HP under three delivery strategies: 1)
      Facilitated DOT; 2) Facilitated SAT; and 3) Informed patient choice (using a decision aid)
      between facilitated DOT and facilitated SAT. The primary outcome will be defined as the
      proportion of eligible participants who accept treatment and take at least 11 of 12 doses of
      RPT/INH within 16 weeks of study enrollment. Study staff will assess medication dosing using
      clinic records for participants taking 3HP by DOT and using a combination of 99DOTS (Everwell
      Health Solutions, India) digital medication adherence technology records and pill counts at
      refill visits for participants taking 3HP by SAT.

      Secondary Objectives:

        1. To estimate the costs and compare the cost-effectiveness of the three strategies for
           delivering 3HP.

        2. To identify processes and contextual factors that influence patient acceptance and
           completion of 3HP under each delivery strategy.

        3. To identify clinic-level barriers to adoption and implementation of 3HP under each
           delivery strategy.

        4. To determine the proportion of patients for whom 3HP treatment is discontinued due to
           adverse events/intolerance.

        5. To determine the cumulative 16-month incidence of active TB in each arm, categorized as
           definite (positive sputum Xpert MTB/RIF or culture) or probable (TB medications started
           at the discretion of a clinician, with evidence of subsequent improvement).

    <description>Facilitated DOT arm participants will attend the Mulago Immune Suppression Syndrome (ISS) clinic on a weekly basis to ingest 3HP medication under direct observation. DOT will be defined as a designated clinic staff member observing ingestion of each dose of 3HP. Additionally, participants randomized to facilitated DOT will receive: 1) DOT cards with instructions to present directly to the pharmacy for a pharmacy-only visit, without the need to wait in the general queue; 2) Automated short message service (SMS) or phone call reminders at no cost to participants the day before each appointment, 3) A fixed level of reimbursement (~$5/visit) for each weekly visit, conditional on either directly observed therapy or evidence of an adverse event that would preclude further treatment.</description>

    <description>Facilitated SAT participants will take their 1st dose of medication under direct observation and be given a 4-week 3HP supply to take weekly via self-administration. Participants will return to the Mulago ISS clinic after completing their 5th dose to review adherence data with the clinic pharmacy technician and receive 5 additional 3HP doses (doses 7-11). At the scheduled refill visit (dose 6) and end-of-treatment visit (dose 12) participants will ingest 3HP via direct observation. Participants will also receive: 1) Free automated SMS reminders or phone call reminders before each scheduled dose; 2) Weekly check-ins inquiring about side effects via two-way SMS with a follow-up phone call depending on participant response, 3) Fixed level of reimbursement (~$5/visit) for the refill/end-of-treatment visit, conditional on either directly observed therapy or evidence of an adverse event that would preclude further treatment.</description>

Participants will have the option to switch between DOT and SAT at any time. The reason for switching and time spent under each strategy will be recorded.</description>
