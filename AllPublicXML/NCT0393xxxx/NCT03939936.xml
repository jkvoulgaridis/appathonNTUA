    <textblock>
      There is a relationship between psoriasis and periodontal disease. This relationship may be
      double-sided.

      The aim of this randomized controlled clinical study was to determine the effect of
      non-surgical mechanical periodontal treatment on psoriasis. The study population consisted of
      92 periodontitis patients with psoriasis who had untreated periodontal disease. Two
      randomized groups were formed from these patients. Immediate periodontal treatment (test
      group, n = 46) and delayed periodontal treatment (control group, n = 46). Clinical
      periodontal measures, saliva interleukin 2, interleukin 6 and secretory immunoglobulin A
      levels and PASI scores were performed at baseline and 8th week in control and test group.

    <description>The changes in gingival index level after periodontal treatment. Gingival index was measured for determining the severity of disease and clinical outcome. Higher values represent a worse outcome. After periodontal treatment, a reduction in gingival index value is expected.</description>
