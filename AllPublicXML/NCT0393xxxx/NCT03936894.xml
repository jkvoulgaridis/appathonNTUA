  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Canakinumab is an anti-interleukin 1 beta (IL1β) antibody approved for use in young children
      with familial Mediterranean fever, systemic onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis and
      TNF-receptor associated periodic fever syndrome. This study is a pilot trial to investigate
      the effects of canakinumab on clinical safety and potential clinical efficacy as demonstrated
      by short-term changes in select serum biomarkers in a sample of young boys with DMD who are
      most likely to have high levels of muscle inflammation. Steroid naive DMD subjects aged
      greater than or equal to 2 years old to less than 6 years old will receive a single
      subcutaneous dose of canakinumab and undergo safety and serum biomarker monitoring for 30
      days. The first 3 subjects will receive 2 mg/kg and if well tolerated, the second 3 subjects
      will receive 4 mg/kg.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is an open-label, single ascending dose study to assess safety and to evaluate
      short-term changes in biomarkers. The first 3 boys will receive canakinumab at a dose of 2
      mg/kg, and the second 3 will receive a dose of 4 mg/kg. The study is comprised of four
      visits: a screening visit with baseline lab assessment, treatment day, a 10-14 day
      post-treatment evaluation with safety labs, and a 30 day post-treatment evaluation with
      safety labs. There will be a phone assessment on day 3-5 after treatment to screen for any
      side effects.

      Clinical evaluation will screen for clinical AEs and SAEs. If dose escalation (4 mg/kg) must
      be terminated due to dose-limiting toxicities, the remaining subjects may be enrolled to
      evaluate the safety of canakinumab at the lower dose level (2 mg/kg).

      One blood draw will occur after consent at least 48 hours prior to treatment day and on days
      10-14 and 30 after the canakinumab injection to screen for laboratory abnormalities and
      collect serum for biomarker analysis. After obtaining consent, prior to treatment, 2 red top
      and 1 purple top 4 cc tubes will be obtained for screening labs and serum biomarker
      collection. Tuberculosis screening (Quantiferon-Gold) will use 4 blood tubes (grey, yellow,
      purple, green) with 1 cc of blood in each. At the following 2 visits with blood draws, two
      red top and one purple top collection tubes of 4 cc will be collected per subject. For red
      top blood collection tubes, one tube will be sent to the clinical lab for safety lab
      processing. The second tube will be processed in the research lab for serum biomarkers.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject's parent or legal guardian has provided written informed consent/HIPAA
             authorization prior to any study-related procedure

          -  Subject has a diagnosis of DMD

             and ALT), in the opinion of the Investigator. TB serology is negative.

          -  Subject and parent/guardian are willing and able to comply with, drug administration
             plan, and follow up visits.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject is &lt;2 years or &gt;6 years of age

          -  Subject has current or history of major renal or hepatic impairment, diabetes mellitus
             or immunosuppression;

          -  Subject has current or history of chronic systemic fungal or viral infections;

          -  Subject has had an acute illness within 4 weeks prior to the first dose of study
             medication;

          -  Subject received live vaccination within the previous month

          -  Subject has evidence of symptomatic cardiomyopathy [Note: Asymptomatic cardiac
             abnormality on investigation would not be exclusionary];

          -  Subject is currently being treated or has received previous treatment with oral
             glucocorticoids or other immunosuppressive agents [Notes: Past transient use of oral
             glucocorticoids or other oral immunosuppressive agents for indication other than DMD
             for no longer than 3 months cumulative, with last use at least 3 months prior to first
             dose of study medication, will be considered for eligibility on a case-by-case basis.
             Inhaled and/or topical glucocorticoids prescribed for an indication other than DMD are
             permitted but must be administered at stable dose for at least 3 months prior to study
             drug administration];

          -  Subject has previous or ongoing medical condition, medical history, physical findings
             or laboratory abnormalities that could affect safety, make it unlikely that treatment
             and follow-up will be correctly completed or impair the assessment of study results,
             in the opinion of the Investigator;

          -  Subject is currently taking any other investigational drug or has taken any other
             investigational drug within 3 months prior to the start of study treatment; Note: Any
             parameter/test may be repeated at the Investigator's discretion during Screening to
             determine reproducibility. In addition, subjects may be rescreened if ineligible due
             to a transient condition which would prevent the subject from participating, such as
             an upper respiratory tract infection or injury.
