  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to compare two different ways to give opioid pain
      medicine to treat sickle cell disease pain that is bad enough to go to the emergency
      department for treatment. One way uses your weight to decide how much pain medicine to give
      you while in the emergency department. This is called weight based treatment. The other way
      uses how much pain medicine you take at home and how much medicine you needed during past
      emergency department visits to decide how much medicine to give you. This is called patient
      specific treatment.

    <description>Patients assigned to this treatment protocol will be given pain medicine(s) based on the pain medicine(s) they take at home for pain and what was needed during their past hospital and emergency department visits to treat pain. Medicines will include opioids, either morphine or hydromorphone. A member of the outpatient SCD provider team will review the patient's medical record to determine: 1) the patient's maximum home opioid dose, and 2) previous ED analgesic medication(s) and doses that have been effective and safe in the past. The patient's regular hematologist/sickle cell team will write the treatment plans. Medications will be given every 20-30 minutes for up to 6 hours.</description>
