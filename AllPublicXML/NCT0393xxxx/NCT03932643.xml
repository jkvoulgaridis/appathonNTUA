    <textblock>
      This is a single-center pilot study of 20 patients with AML/MDS. Eligible patients will be
      enrolled following an informed consent between 6-20 weeks after allogeneic hematopoietic stem
      cell transplant. Patients will receive weekly oral ONC 201 for a total of 52 weeks.

      This is a single-center pilot study of 20 patients with AML/MDS. Eligible patients will be
      enrolled following an informed consent between 6-20 weeks after allogeneic hematopoietic stem
      cell transplant. Patients will receive weekly oral ONC 201 for a total of 52 weeks.

      The objectives of the study are: 1. To determine the safety and preliminary efficacy of ONC
      201 maintenance therapy among patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic
      syndrome (MDS), who undergo allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant. 2. To investigate
      the impact of ONC 201 on reconstitution of NK and other immune cells.

      Patients will be monitored for toxicities (using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse
      Events, CTCAE version 5.0), quality of life (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Bone
      Marrow Transplant, FACT-BMT), and immunologic changes. We will specifically investigate the
      impact of ONC 201 on reconstitution of NK and other immune cells. We will also examine
      changes in functional status (Karnofsky Performance Scale, KPS, instrumental activities of
      daily living and short physical performance battery), rates of disease relapse and mortality.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. A history of AML or MDS with at least one of the following features:

             AML: High-risk AML as defined by the 2017 European LeukemiaNet criteria (e.g. complex
             karyotype with ≥3 changes), AML with high-risk mutations (e.g. TP53, RUNX1, or ASXL1
             mutations), transplant being performed in second remission or beyond, or AML with
             active disease or minimal residual disease positivity before or after transplant.

             MDS: MDS with high or very-high risk cytogenetic changes as used indefined by the
             Revised International Prognostic Scoring System (e.g. complex karyotype with ≥3
             changes),53 the presence of TP53 mutation, high-risk or very high-risk MDS not
             responding to 4 cycles of hypomethylating agents, MDS progressing following initial
             response, persistence of MDS after transplant, or transplant being performed in second
             remission or beyond.

          2. Receipt of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant 6-12 weeks prior to
             enrollment

          3. Disease status: &lt;5% bone marrow blast at the time of enrollment

          6. Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) of ≥70

          7. Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) greater than 1500/µL, and platelet count ³100,000/µL

         10. Male and female patients of reproductive potential must be willing to avoid pregnancy
             or fathering children from enrollment to two months after the end of study treatment.
             This will require either a total abstinence, OR exclusively non-heterosexual activity
             (when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject), OR two
             methods of contraception

         11. Written informed consent to participate in the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. A history of acute graft-versus-host disease grade III/IV or initiation of any new
             immunosuppressive agent for treatment of graft-versus-host disease within 4 weeks
             prior to enrollment. Oral beclomethasone or budesonide, empirically used for possible
             but not biopsy-proven graft-versus-host disease, will not be considered an exclusion
             criterion.

             considered controlled if appropriate therapy has been instituted and, at the time of
             screening, no signs of infection progression are present. Progression of infection is
             defined as hemodynamic instability attributable to sepsis, new symptoms, worsening
             physical signs or radiographic findings attributable to infection. Persisting fever
             without other signs or symptoms will not be interpreted as progressing infection
