  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to assess the contributions of the thermic effect of food intake
      (TEF), which is the amount of energy expended to digest food, to overall energy expenditure
      in Cystic Fibrosis (CF).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Total energy expenditure (TEE) is comprised of the following components: resting energy
      expenditure (REE), thermic effect of food intake (TEF), adaptive thermogenesis (AT). The
      thermic effect of food is the amount of energy expended to digest food, and can be affected
      by factors such as protein / fat / carbohydrate contents of meals or the amount of time over
      which a meal is consumed. The investigators propose to assess the contributions of the
      thermic effect of food intake (TEF), which is the amount of energy expended to digest food,
      to overall energy expenditure in CF. Participants will be assigned to either a high fat
      liquid meal or a high protein liquid meal and assessed for components of energy expenditure
      in the whole room indirect calorimeter (metabolic chamber); participants will then be crossed
      over to the alternate liquid meal type, and differences in resting and total energy
      expenditure and the thermic effect of food will be assessed between the two types of meals.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  confirmed diagnosis of cystic fibrosis by Cystic Fibrosis Foundation-established
             criteria

          -  being followed at the VCU (Virginia Commonwealth University) Adult Cystic Fibrosis
             Center

          -  pulmonary and overall health status at baseline as assessed by pulmonary function
             testing and screening labs (complete blood count, liver enzymes, cholesterol, HgA1c).
             Criteria for baseline status are established for each individual patient as part of
             routine CF pulmonary care.

          -  ability to understand the study procedures and to comply with them for the entire
             length of the study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  experiencing any signs or symptoms consistent with a pulmonary exacerbation (a decline
             in pulmonary function testing from baseline, recorded as part of routine CF care)

          -  undergoing treatment for a pulmonary exacerbation with a change in antibiotics or
             steroids from their baseline medications

          -  tobacco users

          -  pregnancy
