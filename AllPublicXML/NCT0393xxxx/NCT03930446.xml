    <measure>Change in stop reaction time - Stop Signal Task</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1, 3, 5, 7, 9,</time_frame>
    <description>Stop Task measures behavioral inhibition of a prepotent response. Participants are required to respond as quickly as possible when a 'go' target appears and to inhibit that response when a 'stop' signal (an auditory tone) occasionally occurs. The duration of the delay to presentation of the stop signal following the go signal is adjusted until the participant is able to successfully inhibit the response on 50% of trials. The final mean delay of the stop signal, based on this 50% success rate criterion, is subtracted from the mean go reaction time, providing the stop reaction time (stop RT), which is the primary measure of impulsive action.</description>

    <description>The 0.8 g/kg body weight dose of oral alcohol (190-proof ethanol) will be divided into 4 servings of 0.2 g/kg each. The 0.8 g/kg dose is equivalent to 4 standard drinks, where a standard drink is defined as one 12 oz beer, one 5 oz glass of wine, or one 1.5 oz shot of 80 proof alcohol. Women will receive a reduced dose (0.68 g/kg) to account for sex differences in total body water</description>
