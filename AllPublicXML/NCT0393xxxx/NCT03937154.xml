  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the efficacy of romiplostim for the treatment of CIT in patients receiving
      chemotherapy for the treatment of NSCLC, ovarian cancer, or breast cancer measured by the
      ability to administer on-time, full-dose chemotherapy

      This is a phase 3, randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter, international study for the
      treatment of CIT in adult subjects receiving chemotherapy for the treatment of NSCLC, ovarian
      cancer, or breast cancer. Subjects must have a platelet count &lt; 75 x 10^9/L on day 1 of the
      study. The study will consist of a screening period of up to 4 weeks, a treatment period long
      enough to allow for assessment of 3 planned cycles of chemotherapy, a follow-up visit, and
      long-term follow-up (LTFU). Given that subjects are required to have 3 remaining planned
      cycles of chemotherapy, the chemotherapy cycles may be 3 or 4 weeks in duration, and the
      investigational product dose adjustment guidelines allow for up to 12 weeks of dosing before
      a subject is declared a non-responder, the majority of study subjects will receive
      investigational product for a range of 10-22 weeks.

             to screening. To be eligible, subjects must have received at least 14 days of
             anticoagulation for a new thrombotic event and considered to be stable and suitable
             for continued therapeutic anticoagulation during trial participation.

          -  History of arterial thrombotic events (eg, myocardial ischemia, transient ischemic
             attack, or stroke) within 6 months prior to screening.

             in their medical history will require a central. laboratory assessment at screening.

          -  Known active of chronic hepatitis C or hepatitis B infection. Subjects without a
             documented diagnosis in their medical history will require a central laboratory
             assessment at screening. Hepatitis B and C infection is based on the following
             results:

          -  Positive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) (indicative of chronic hepatitis B or
             recent acute hepatitis B).

          -  Negative HBsAg and positive for hepatitis B core antibody: hepatitis B virus DNA by
             polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is necessary. Detectable hepatitis B virus DNA
             suggests occult hepatitis B.

          -  Positive hepatitis C virus antibody: hepatitis C virus RNA by PCR is necessary.
             Detectable hepatitis C virus RNA suggests chronic hepatitis C.

          -  In addition to the conditions listed in exclusion criteria 201 through 206, secondary
             malignancy within the past 5 years except:

             recurrence by the treating physician (excluding malignancies listed in exclusion
             criteria 201 - 206).

          -  Thrombocytopenia due to another etiology other than CIT (eg, chronic liver disease,
             prior history of immune thrombocytopenia purpura).

    <ipd_time_frame>Data sharing requests relating to this study will be considered beginning 18 months after the study has ended and either 1) the product and indication (or other new use) have been granted marketing authorization in both the US and Europe or 2) clinical development for the product and/or indication discontinues and the data will not be submitted to regulatory authorities. There is no end date for eligibility to submit a data sharing request for this study.</ipd_time_frame>
    <ipd_access_criteria>Qualified researchers may submit a request containing the research objectives, the Amgen product(s) and Amgen study/studies in scope, endpoints/outcomes of interest, statistical analysis plan, data requirements, publication plan, and qualifications of the researcher(s). In general, Amgen does not grant external requests for individual patient data for the purpose of re-evaluating safety and efficacy issues already addressed in the product labelling. Requests are reviewed by a committee of internal advisors, and if not approved, may be further arbitrated by a Data Sharing Independent Review Panel. Upon approval, information necessary to address the research question will be provided under the terms of a data sharing agreement. This may include anonymized individual patient data and/or available supporting documents, containing fragments of analysis code where provided in analysis specifications.
