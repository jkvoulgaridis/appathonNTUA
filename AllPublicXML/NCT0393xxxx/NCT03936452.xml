    <textblock>
      This study aims to investigate the treatment of previously untreated stage I-II Extranodal
      NK/T Cell Lymphoma with sintilimab, peg-aspargase and anlotinib, combined with radiotherapy.
      The primary endpoint is response rate (complete response rate and overall response rate), and
      the second endpoints are survival time (OS and PFS) and toxicities.
