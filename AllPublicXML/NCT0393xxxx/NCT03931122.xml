      Laryngeal Mask Airway (LMA) is widely used in pediatric surgical patients. The manufacturer
      recommends the size of LMA to be used in children should be based on actual body weight but
      this method has several limitations. To overcome these concerns, various alternatives have
      been tried by different researchers, one of them is external ear size for LMA size selection.
      Investigators therefore would like to know whether the external ear size based method can be
      used for LMA size selection in pediatric surgical patients in Pakistan.

      OBJECTIVE:

      to determine whether external ear-size is non-inferior to weight for LMA size selection in
      pediatric surgical patients.

      INTRODUCTION:

      The Laryngeal Mask Airway (LMA) is widely used in pediatric population. The manufacturer
      recommends the size of LMA to be used in children should be based on actual body weight.
      However, this method has several limitations, the range of weight for a particular size is
      very wide, it may not be appropriate for overweight or underweight children as it is based on
      actual body weight rather than ideal body weight, in emergency situations where weight of the
      patient is unknown the correlation between weight and size of LMA is impossible, and finally
      weight based recommendation may not be suitable as development of the child's oropharyngeal
      cavity is related to height and age rather than weight. All these factors may lead to
      inappropriate size selection, which may result in larger sized LMA causing trauma/injury to
      the airway and smaller ones causing obstruction or insufficient ventilation. To overcome
      these concerns various alternatives to weight based technique have been tried by different
      researchers in both adult and pediatric patients, one of them is external ear size.
      Literature revealed differences in external ear size dimensions in different ethnic
      population and the investigator's literature search failed to reveal any local data/study in
      Pakistani pediatric patients where external ear size was compared or used for size selection
      of the LMA. The investigators therefore would like to know whether the external ear size
      based method can be used for LMA size selection in pediatric surgical patients in Pakistan.

      HYPOTHESIS:

      External ear-size based technique is not inferior to weight based technique for LMA selection
      in pediatric population.

    <intervention_model_description>All Laryngeal Mask Airways (LMA) devices being used in the study will be Ambu® AuraOnce™ (Ambu® A/S Baltorpbakken 13 DK-2750 Ballerup, Denmark) LMA's.
LMA Size Selection: will be done for each patient according to group allocation:
Group A - Weight based method Group B - Ear Size Based method
Randomization technique:
Patients will be randomized according to computer-generated blocked randomization (https://www.sealedenvelope.com) with blocks size of 6, by independent statistician (Anaesthesia research cell). Allocation concealment will be ensured by enclosing assignments in sealed, opaque, sequentially numbered envelopes which will be opened by one of the investigator only upon arrival of the patient in the operation room.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking>Triple (Participant, Investigator, Outcomes Assessor)</masking>
    <masking_description>One of the investigators will record patients' weight and external ear measurements in the study proforma. Patient's medical record (MR) number will then be send to the Research assistant/ Statistician for randomization into one of the groups (Group A or Group B). On the day of surgery, research assistant will hand over patient's group allocation in a sealed opaque envelop to one of the investigators who will not be the primary anesthetist. This investigator will determine the LMA size according to the group allocation. In case the dimensions fall between the two sizes of LMA in the ear size group, the closest one will be selected. After writing LMA size in the proforma it will be handed over to the primary anesthetist who will be blinded to patient's group allocation. Primary anesthetist (who has an experience of minimum 50 LMA insertions) will use the LMA.</masking_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Adequacy of Ventilation</measure>
    <time_frame>1 minute</time_frame>
    <description>Adequacy of ventilation: will be judged by an oxygen saturation of greater than or equal to 95% at a Fractional Inspired Oxygen concentration (FiO2) less than 0.5 and an end-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO2) of 35-45 mmHg at a tidal volume of 6- 8 ml/kg Actual Body Weight (ABW) at peak airway pressure less than the oropharyngeal leak pressure (OLP), and by adjusting the respiratory rate (RR).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Oropharyngeal Leak Pressure (OLP)</measure>
    <time_frame>30 seconds</time_frame>
    <description>Oropharyngeal Leak Pressure (OLP): will be determined at LMA intra-cuff pressure of 60 cmH2O by closing the Adjustable Pressure Limiting (APL) valve of the circle system at a fixed gas flow of 3 Liters per minute and by noting the circuit pressure at which an equilibrium will be reached and then releasing it completely.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Leak fraction (LF)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 minute</time_frame>
    <description>Leak fraction (LF): will be determined by comparing the difference between inspired and expired tidal volumes and dividing them by the inspired tidal volume at a tidal volume (TV) of 8 ml/kg actual body weight (ABW) with an I:E ratio of 1:2 and respiratory rate (RR) of 20 breaths per minute.</description>

    <description>Incidence of mucosal injury in the two groups will be assessed by trauma or minor injury to the airway seen as blood on the device after removal.
Incidence of laryngospasm will also be noted.</description>

    <description>Ear Size Based method: External ear size will be measured by using a paper ruler and will be recorded in cm as follows:
Vertical length: will be measured from the most dependent portion of the lobule to the furthest portion of the auricle.
Horizontal length (width): from the tragus to the furthest part of the helix horizontally.
Dimension(cm2): Vertical length (L) × Horizontal length (width-W )
Based on these ear measurements, nearest smaller LMA size will be selected.</description>

    <description>The Laryngeal Mask Airway (LMA) is one of the devices used to maintain airway during general anesthesia. Its appropriate size is selected according to patients body weight as recommended by the manufacturer.
However its appropriate size can also be selected via several other methods and one of them is patients external ear size. In this study the investigators will compare external ear size based method for LMA selection with the standard weight based method for LMA size selection.
Vertical Ear length: will be measured from the most dependent portion of the lobule to the furthest portion of the auricle.
Horizontal Ear length (width): from the tragus to the furthest part of the helix horizontally.
Dimension(cm2): Vertical length (L) × Horizontal length (width-W)
LMA Size LMA Cuff Length (cm) corresponding to vertical ear length.
LMA Cuff Width (cm) corresponding to horizontal ear width.</description>
