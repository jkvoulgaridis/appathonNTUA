  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims at assessing additional performance characteristics of the SoundBite™
      Crossing System with regards to the luminal passage of complex Chronic Total Occlusions (CTO)
      by evaluating clinically relevant efficacy, safety, cost benefit and treatment pathway
      endpoints.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This multinational study will be based on observational cases with descriptive statistics to
      collect data on safety and efficacy based on clinical use of the SoundBite™ Crossing System.

      This study will include a cost benefit analysis that will focus on wire and other
      Percutaneous Transluminal Angioplasty (PTA) device usage during the procedure. The cost
      benefit will be compared to the sites data on their average costs for CTO crossing cases.

      The planned treatment pathway elected prior to procedure will be compared to subject's
      treatment pathway plan post -procedure (discharge, surgeries such as bypass, amputation etc.)
      will be collected to determine patient outcomes.

             artery

          -  Has Rutherford Clinical Category of 2-6

          -  is able and willing to provide written informed consent prior to study procedure

        Angiographic Inclusion Criteria

          -  target CTO has moderate to severe calcification

          -  Has at least one of the following: severe calcification, flush occlusion,
             femoropopliteal CTOs with reconstitution below Popliteal 2-3, side directing
             collateral at the proximal cap, long (≥ 5cm) occlusions, below the knee (BTK)
             occlusion.

          -  Has evidence of a clinically significant CTO located in a peripheral vessel below the
             infrainguinal ligament confirmed by angiography at time of the procedure.
