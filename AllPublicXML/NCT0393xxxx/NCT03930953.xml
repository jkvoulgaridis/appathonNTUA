  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      CC-99282-NHL-001 study is a Phase I dose escalation and expansion clinical study of CC-99282
      administered alone and in combination with rituximab in subjects with relapsed or refractory
      non-hodgkin Lymphomas (R/R NHL).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects with R/R NHL who have failed at least 2 lines of therapy (or have received at least
      one prior line of standard therapy and are not eligible for any other therapy).

      The dose escalation will evaluate the safety and tolerability of escalating doses of CC-99282
      in R/R DLBCL and/or R/R FL subjects to determine the MTD of CC-99282 as monotherapy.

      The dose expansion will further evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy of single agent
      CC-99282 administered at or below MTD in subjects with R/R DLBCL and NHL. Part B will also
      evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy of CC-99282 in combination with rituximab in
      subjects with R/R DLBCL and R/R FL.
