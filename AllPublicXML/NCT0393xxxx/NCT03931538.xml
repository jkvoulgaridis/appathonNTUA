  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this protocol, investigators are examining the ability for a novel multiplex PCR assay
      with mixed floral antibiotic resistance profiling is safe and increases effective treatment
      for urinary tract infections in a urology clinic over traditional culture methods alone and
      decreases retreatment rates in this population.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The novel multiplex real-time PCR assay with mixed floral antibiotic resistance profiling
      offers a higher degree of sensitivity and specificity than conventional culture methods in
      the identification of UTI pathogens as determined by the previous prospective comparison
      study. Additionally, conventional methods are often inadequate in the case of polymicrobial
      infections. More accurate and timely pathogen identification allows for prompt and more
      targeted treatment with less reliance on empiric therapy and decreased rates of antibiotic
      therapy changes and retreatment. This leads to more favorable patient outcomes and decreases
      the development of resistant organisms.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Establish Safety: composite adverse event rate</measure>
    <time_frame>7 Days</time_frame>
    <description>Demonstrate safety of Guidance 4.0 multiplex real-time PCR organism identification with mixed floral antibiotic resistance profiling guided treatment. Safety will be measured with a composite adverse event outcome of urosepsis, pyelonephritis, hospitalization, or the need to attend an urgent care center. The composite adverse event rate in the arm tested with Guidance 4.0 will be shown to be non-inferior to that in the arm tested with traditional urine culture. Superiority will also be tested.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Patients with Recurrent and Persistent Infections in Each Arm</measure>
    <time_frame>7 Days</time_frame>
    <description>Demonstrate non-inferiority and possibly superiority of Guidance 4.0 over traditional urine C&amp;S with respect to the percentage of recurrent and persistent infections. Persistent is remaining infection at day 7 and recurrent infection is a person that had a second infection within 30 days that was treated with antibiotics.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Symptom Resolution in Each Arm</measure>
    <time_frame>7 days</time_frame>
    <description>Demonstrate superiority of Guidance 4.0 over traditional urine C&amp;S with respect to the time to symptom resolution as demonstrated by UTISA tool. Symptom resolution will be defined as an overall rating of no symptoms on the UTISA questionnaire.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Physician Choice for Decision Making when Provided Both Results</measure>
    <time_frame>4 Months</time_frame>
    <description>• To determine which test physicians, rely upon when given the results of both traditional urine C&amp;S vs. Guidance 4.0.</description>
