  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to assess the efficacy of micronised resveratrol as a treatment for
      FRDA, in terms of reducing the severity of ataxia symptoms at 24 weeks, through a randomised
      blinded, placebo controlled crossover trial.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Friedreich ataxia (FRDA) is the most common hereditary ataxia, with an estimated prevalence
      in Caucasians of 1 in 30,000. Neurological features of FRDA are progressive gait and limb
      ataxia, absent lower limb reflexes, and loss of position and vibration sense. There are
      currently no treatments proven to alter the natural history of FRDA. Resveratrol is a
      naturally occurring compound found in red wine, berries, and nuts. It is postulated to have
      wide-ranging health benefits, including antioxidant, anticarcinogenic, antidiabetic and
      neuroprotective properties.

      The study will be a double-blinded, placebo-controlled randomised 2-period crossover trial of
      2g/day of micronised resveratrol in FRDA over 24 weeks. The study will enrol 40 patients with
      FRDA from 3 sites. The primary outcome measure is the change in modified Friedreich Ataxia
      Rating Scale (mFARS) score from baseline to 24 weeks.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age ≥16 years.

          2. Diagnosis of FRDA, genetically documented to be due to homozygosity for a GAA repeat
             expansion in intron 1 of FXN.

          3. Functional stage on the Ataxia subscale of the full FARS of 1 or higher (a score of 1
             is assigned if the subject has &quot;Minimal signs detected by the physician during
             screening. Can run or jump without loss of balance. No disability.&quot;), and total mFARS
             score of ≤ 65.

          4. Adequate end organ function defined as follows: (i) total bilirubin &lt;2x upper limit of
             normal unless attributable to Gilbert disease, (ii) ALT and AST &lt;1.5x upper limit of
             normal, (iii) Creatinine &lt;2x upper limit of normal, (iv) neutrophils &gt;1.5x10^9/L, (v)
             platelets &gt;10^6/μL.

          5. Written informed consent provided.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Non-elective hospitalisation within the past 60 days that could be of concern in the
             investigator's judgment. Any hospitalisation in the previous 60 days will be assessed
             and if in the investigator's judgement it could compromise the individual or the
             study, that person will not be recruited. Examples include if the individual is
             hospitalised for management of cardiac morbidity such as uncontrolled arrhythmia or
             angina or for orthopaedic surgery for a lower limb fracture.

          2. Women who are pregnant or lactating or men and women of childbearing potential who are
             unwilling to use contraception for the duration of the study.

          3. FRDA due to compound heterozygosity for an expanded GAA repeat and a point mutation/
             deletion in the FXN gene.

          4. Current or recent (in last 12 months) arrhythmias including: atrial fibrillation,
             atrial flutter, sinus tachycardia &gt;120/min, sinus bradycardia &lt;50/min. Symptomatic
             paroxysmal arrhythmia which is recurring frequently. Cardiac insufficiency (by New
             York Heart Association &gt;2). Reduced LV ejection fraction (&lt;50%) in the last six
             months.

          5. Medical illness that in the judgment of the investigator would jeopardise the safe
             completion of the study. Examples include cancer, chronic inflammatory disease, severe
             diabetes (type I or II, HbA1c &gt;8%), chronic liver insufficiency, epilepsy,
             thrombocytosis.

          6. Evidence of end organ dysfunction through failure to meet one or more parameters in
             inclusion criterion number 4.

          7. Prior invasive cancer (excluding localised basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer).

          8. Known hypersensitivity to resveratrol.

          9. Use of any investigational agent within 30 days of enrolment.

         10. Use of antioxidants such as vitamin E, coenzyme Q10 or idebenone within 30 days prior
             to enrolment.

         11. Concomitant use of medications with potential for clinically relevant drug
             interactions. This includes medications with a narrow therapeutic range that are
             metabolised by the cytochrome P450 3A4, 2D6 or 2C9 systems e.g. warfarin, amiodarone.
