  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children represent 1.2% of the spa population in France. Spa treatments, including climatic
      stays, are mainly prescribed for children in the context of respiratory, otorhinolaryngology
      and dermatological conditions. The benefits after spa treatments are the improvement of the
      symptoms of the pathology, the quality of life and in particular the reduction of drug
      exposures.

      Few authors have recently investigated the impact of spa treatments on the health of children
      and society, while care has changed significantly in recent years. Moreover, no real-life
      study of a large sample of children seems to have been conducted in this area. The present
      study plan to conduct a pharmacoepidemiology study on medico-administrative databases of the
      &quot;observational study&quot; type, in real life.

        This pharmacoepidemiology study of the &quot;observational study&quot; type, in real life, will
        concern children aged 1 to 15 living in France at the time of the study. It will be
        conducted at the departmental level of the Haute-Garonne through the use of the APPLE
        database (PrescriptiOns Medicines Mother Children) and at the national level through the
        use of the database. EGB (General Sample of Beneficiaries).
