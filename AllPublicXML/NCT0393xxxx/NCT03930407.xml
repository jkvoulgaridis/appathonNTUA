  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      From patient charts we will review patients who had undergone cesarean section within the
      last 6 months and identify those who received a The Hayman uterine compression suture for
      uterine atony. We will also select patients who delivered a baby without recieving a Hayman
      suture to create a control group. Patietns will be grouped as Hayman Group if they recevied a
      Hayman suture during C/S and control group if thay had not recevied a Hayman suture. We will
      then check patient charts for post-cesarean outpatient clinic visit and select those who
      received ovarian reserve evaluation via hormones and antral follicle count during the visits.
      Finally, we are planning to investigate any correlation between Hayman suture and ovarian
      dysfunction.

    <textblock>
      Hayman suture is a common technique for uterine compression to stop bleeding due to uterine
      atony. Hayman described placement of two to four vertical compression sutures from the
      anterior to posterior uterine wall without hysterectomy. It is usually employed to overcome
      uterine atoy dÄ±ring cesarean section. However, since the technique is relatively new, data on
      its safety and efficacy arelimited to a few case reports. several complications including
      cavity obliteration, blood entrapment and infections have been described. However, data
      regarding the ovarioan function is lacking.
