    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, open-label study to evaluate the safety of Solosec in adolescent
      girls with bacterial vaginosis. Approximately 40 patients will be enrolled. Patients
      determined to be eligible at the Baseline Visit (Day 1) will receive a single oral dose of
      Solosec™ granules (containing 2 grams of secnidazole) on Day 1. Patients will return to the
      site once between Days 7-14 for a &quot;test of cure&quot; (TOC) Visit. A follow-up telephone call will
      be performed at Days 21-30 to assess the continued clinical response to treatment and adverse
      events.
