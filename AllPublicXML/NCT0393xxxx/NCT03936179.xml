  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To assess the efficacy and feasibility of high-dose intensity-modulated radiotherapy with
      concurrent weekly paclitaxel and cisplatin for patients with locaregionally esophageal cancer
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Standard dose chemoradiotherapy (SCRT) results in poor local control for localregionally
      advanced esopgageal cancer patients. Most local failures occur in the gross tumor
      volume.[F-18]-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET/CT can identify residual metabolic disease (RMD).
      Hyperfractionated radiotherapy allows for delivering a higher dose without increasing late
      toxicity. Our previous phase I radiation dose escalation trial demonstrated that 86 Gy could
      be safely delivered to the RMD with concurrent weekly paclitaxel and cisplatin in advanced
      esophageal cancer.The aim of this phase II study is to examine the efficacy of this regimen.

             medical reasons.

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group （ECOG） performance status 0 to 2 No prior radiation
             to the thorax that would overlap with the current treatment field.

          -  Patients with nodal involvement are eligible

          -  Adequate bone marrow, renal and hepatic functions as assessed by the following:
             Hemoglobin &gt;/= 10.0 g/dl, Platelet count &gt;/= 1 00,000/ mm^3,absolute granulocyte count
             (AGC) ≥2 × 10^9 cells/L,bilirubin and Aspartate transaminase ≤1.5 ×upper limit of
             normal (ULN), Creatinine &lt;/ =1 .5 times ULN.

          -  A signed informed consent must be obtained prior to therapy.

          -  No prior radiation to the thorax that would overlap with the current treatment field.

        Induction chemotherapy is allowed.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The presence of a fistula.

          -  Prior radiotherapy that would overlap the radiation fields.

          -  gastroesophageal junction cancer or the lower third esophageal cancer invading the
             gastric wall.

             pectoris, uncontrolled hypertension,or psychiatric illness/social situations that
             would limit compliance with the study requirements.
