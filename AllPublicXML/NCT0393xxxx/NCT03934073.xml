  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is the second leading cause of death and disability in France: more than half of
      stroke survivors have a disabling motor deficit, affecting mainly the upper limb. A lack of
      hand control makes everyday tasks more difficult and reduces the quality of life. The
      investigators lack approaches to specifically rehabilitate the hand after stroke.

      Recently, a new tool has been developed to measure manual dexterity (the Finger Force
      Manipulandum or FFM). This tool, which records the forces applied by the fingers on pistons,
      allows to measure more finely the key components of manual dexterity during visuomotor tasks.
      The tool measures the ability to control and release the force applied by the fingers, to
      perform sequences, to track and maintain a frequency of tapping (temporality of movement)
      with the fingers, and to use the fingers independently one another.

      The DexTrain proof-of-concept study aims to evaluate the benefit of a training using a tool,
      an improved version of the FFM, named DexTrain, for the rehabilitation and specific training
      of the fingers in subjects suffering from stroke. In this study the investigators will
      compare the effect of conventional therapy with that of the DexTrain method, particularly on
      the function of the hand and its spontaneous use at home (ecological condition). To better
      understand the mechanisms involved, the investigators will also study brain plasticity using
      Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (SMT) and Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI).
