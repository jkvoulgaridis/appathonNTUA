      Background:

      Some groups of people have a high prevalence of asthma and allergic disease. Also, asthma and
      allergic disease are often found in several members of the same family. Researchers want to
      learn more about what factors might cause asthma, both genetic and environmental.

      Objective:

      To build a collection of information to try to find genes that cause conditions and disorders
      such as asthma and allergic disease.

      Eligibility:

      People ages 18 99 of self-identified African, African American, or African Caribbean descent
      who either have no history of asthma or wheeze or have a physician s diagnosis of asthma

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with an interview by phone or in person.

      Participants will fill out a questionnaire about their general health and exposure to
      allergens and smoke.

      Participants will have a physical exam.

      Participants will have blood tests.

      Participants will provide a skin cell sample. Up to two samples will be taken from the inside
      of the nose. A brush will be used to take the samples.

      Participants will have a breathing test. They will be asked to blow forcefully 3 or more
      times into a lung function machine.

      Participants may have their blood and skin samples sent to a lab. DNA will be extracted from
      the samples and tested.

      Participants blood and skin samples will be stored. Samples may be used in future research
      studies.

    <textblock>
      Asthma is a complex disease where the interplay between genetic factors and environmental
      exposures controls susceptibility and disease progression. In the U.S., there remains an
      epidemic of asthma that disproportionately affects underrepresented minorities and creates a
      major public health burden, especially among children. Asthmatics of African ancestry
      continue to have more severe asthma and more severe clinical symptoms than their non-African
      counterparts, but few studies have focused on this vulnerable group. The purpose of this
      study is to expand our previous study, the Consortium on Asthma among African-ancestry
      Populations in the Americas (CAAPA) to integrate multi-omic resources for asthma research in
      African Diaspora populations and by recruiting new participants. The protocol described
      herein refers to the recruitment that will take place at the NIH Clinical Center as part of
      the expansion of CAAPA (CAAPA2).

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Individuals age 18 to 99 of self-identified African, African American, or African Caribbean
        ancestry who either have no history of asthma or wheeze (controls) or have a physician s
        diagnosis of asthma. This study focuses exclusively on African ancestry individuals in
        order to address a lack in the field of asthma research focusing on those of African
        ancestry despite the greater disease burden experienced by these individuals. Enrollment
        for the CAAPA2 study at the NIH CC will include only adults, while children will be
        enrolled at other CAAPA2 sites, consistent with expertise at those sites. Pregnant women
        are included as study procedures remain of minimal risk to these women. However, as the
        size of the growing fetus may cause mechanical difficulties in performing the pulmonary
        function test optimally for women at later stages of pregnancy, women who self-report
        pregnancy at either second or third trimester will be asked to return for testing after
        delivery, if they are still interested in participating.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  First degree relative of enrolled study participant (as determined through responses
             to a screening questionnaire to question on participation of parents, siblings, or
             half-siblings)

          -  Current and active smoker

          -  History of: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic obstructive airway disease,
             emphysema, chronic bronchitis, lung transplant, kyphoscoliosis, sarcoidosis,
             bronchopulmonary dysplasia, cystic fibrosis, bronchiectasis, rheumatoid arthritis,
             Crohn s disease, psoriasis, carcinoma of the lung, ciliary dyskinesia, lupus, or
             active tuberculosis

          -  Having any medical illnesses that would increase the risk that the participant would
             incur by participating in the study, interfere with the outcomes of the study, or
             interfere with the study procedures (evaluated using Spirometry Screener.
