  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cigarette smoking is the leading cause of preventable death in Switzerland and still more
      than a quarter of the Swiss population smokes cigarettes. Recently, electronic nicotine
      delivery systems (ENDS; also called vaporizer, e-cigarette or electronic cigarette) have
      become popular with smokers who want to stop smoking or reduce their exposure to inhaled
      chemicals since ENDS use appears to be safer than tobacco smoking. The inhaled ENDS aerosol
      appears safe in laboratory conditions, its long-term effects on pulmonary function remains
      unknown. This study will therefore investigate the impact of ENDS on lung function in
      smokers, who attempt to quit using ENDS compared with smokers, receiving only smoking
      cessation counseling with nicotine replacement therapy (NRT).

      Multiple breath washout (MBW) is an established technique for assessment of peripheral airway
      function in pediatrics and its use is emerging in adult medicine, as it offers a better
      sensitivity to assess small airway disease before large airway involvement can be detected
      using conventional pulmonary function tests (PFT - spirometry, body plethysmography and
      diffusing capacity test). Preliminary evidence from limited studies suggest MBW parameters
      (LCI, Scond, Sacin) can be impaired in smokers with normal lung function and improve after
      smoking abstinence.

      Primary objective of this substudy is to assess changes in LCI from baseline to 6 months post
      target quit date (TQD) in cigarette smokers randomized to the intervention group compared to
      the control group.

      For this trial, cigarette smokers motivated to quit smoking cigarettes will be included.
      Participants in the intervention group will receive an ENDS and nicotine-containing
      e-liquids, which they will be allowed to use ad libitum. Additionally, they will receive
      standard of care, i.e. smoking cessation counseling and encouragement to use NRT. Smoking
      cessation counseling will be provided in person at the first clinical visit and then over the
      phone at the target quit date and again at week 1, 2, 4 and 8 after the target quit date.
      Participants in the control group will receive only standard of care. All participants will
      be followed over a 6-month period. After 6 months, participants will be asked to come to a
      final clinical visit.
