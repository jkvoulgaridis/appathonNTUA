  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of the trial is to evaluate the effect of point-of-care testing of
      respiratory pathogens at a pediatric emergency room on the antibiotic consumption and
      hospital admissions in acutely ill children.

      The study is a randomized controlled trial including children 0 up to 17 years of age with
      fever or acute respiratory infection at a pediatric emergency department in university
      hospital. In total 1668 subjects will be randomly allocated to undergo point-of-care
      multiplex respiratory pathogen testing with results ready within approximately one hour or to
      a control group with testing according to clinical judgement and results ready within next
      office day. Subjects will be randomized on admission and unequal allocation ratio of 2:1
      (1112 subjects to intervention and 556 subjects to control arm) will be used. Data on rate of
      hospitalization, antibiotic prescriptions, ancillary testing and length of visit will be
      collected using medical record system.
