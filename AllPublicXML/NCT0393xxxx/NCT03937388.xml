  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cochlear implants (CI) are used to help patients with severe to profound hearing loss regain
      auditory perception by electrical stimulation of the auditory nerve. The electrical
      stimulation consists of trains of charge balanced, biphasic current pulses. For each patient,
      individual stimulation parameters (perception threshold, most comfortable level - MCL) are
      determined for each electrode during fitting sessions. However, an important parameter, pulse
      duration, cannot be individualized for each electrode. There are certain circumstances where
      it would be advantageous to have the possibility of introducing variable pulse durations into
      the fitting strategy (e.g., optimization of energy consumption, development of combined
      cochleo-vestibular implants). However, since in current CI systems pulses are transmitted
      sequentially, introducing varying pulse widths would also introduce &quot;gaps&quot; (zero-stimulation
      periods) into the stimulation profile. The influence of such auditory gaps on speech
      recognition and on the quality of hearing has not been explored yet, but can be investigated
      in current CI users. The objective of this study is to investigate the impact of time-fixed
      gaps (zero-stimulation periods) in the cochlear stimulation strategy on speech performance
      and hearing quality.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Auditory gaps can be induced in standard CI users by temporarily deactivating one to three
      electrodes. These gaps can be configured to have different gap durations.

      The different variations of auditory stimulation with gaps will be presented to study
      participants via a standard MED-EL audio processor (Opus 2) bearing conformity marking. The
      programming of the processor will be performed using standard clinical hardware and software
      interfaces. These include the hardware interfaces &quot;MAX interface box&quot; and the &quot;Diagnostic
      Interface Box&quot; (DIB II) as well as the &quot;MAESTRO&quot; fitting software. After programming the
      respective configurations to the audio test-processor, a clinical word recognition test
      (Fournier) and a clinical consonant recognition test will be presented to the participants in
      a sound-shielded chamber using a free-field loudspeaker system.
