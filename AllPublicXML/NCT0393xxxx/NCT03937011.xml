    <textblock>
      This single-arm, prospective, observational multicenter study will collect clinical data in a
      post-market setting across two different specialties in Robotic surgical procedures:
      Bariatric Sleeve gastrectomy (Staple line reinforcement) and Hysterectomy (Vaginal cuff
      closure). Investigators will perform the procedure using SFX Spiral PDS Plus in compliance
      with their standard surgical approach and the IFU.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of subjects with no bleeding or mild bleeding (defined as success) at the completion of the suturing at the organ layer (vaginal cuff closure or gastric staple line reinforcement using STRATAFIX™ Spiral PDS™ Plus).</measure>
    <time_frame>Intra-op assessment (During Surgery; after suturing of the target tissue, Day of surgery)</time_frame>
    <description>The bleeding grade assessment used for the primary endpoint will be made right after the suturing is completed. Any re-bleeding after the initial assessment (just before the removal of the optics and trocars) from the suture line after this assessment will be considered a failure for the primary performance endpoint.</description>

    <description>Incisional site will be assessed for hysterectomy subjects to see if the suture is palpable suture, tender or intact at the target site</description>
  </secondary_outcome>

    <measure>Abnormal vaginal discharge (total hysterectomy subjects)</measure>
    <time_frame>14 days post-perative 90 days post-operative (+/- 30 days), 180 days post-operative (+/- 30 days)</time_frame>

    <measure>C-SATS GEARS score</measure>
    <time_frame>Intra-op (during the surgery, Day of surgery)</time_frame>
    <description>Global Evaluative Assessment of Robotic Skills (GEARS). Its a validated assessment tool for grading overall technical proficiency for robotic surgery. GEARS measures manual dexterity and fluidity of motion and does not define surgical or clinical judgement. The scales are Depth perception, Bimanual dexterity, efficiency, force sensitivity and robotic control.Each scale is scored 1 - 5, which means the total score could range from 5 - 25.</description>
