  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test the effect of race-based social rejection on polysomnography derived
      sleep outcomes and nocturnal cardiovascular psychophysiology in a sample of 80 African
      Americans and 80 Caucasian Americans. The investigators will test group differences on these
      outcomes as well as within subjects by testing impact of rejection compared to a
      non-rejection control night in the sleep laboratory.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      African Americans (AA) are disproportionally burdened by cardiovascular disease compared to
      Caucasian Americans (CA). Poor sleep, which is more common among AA, may serve as an
      important pathway in understanding these disparities. Race-based rejection has been
      cross-sectionally related to poor sleep and negative cardiovascular outcomes. To test the
      links between social experiences and sleep, participants will spend two nights in the sleep
      laboratory. One night will be a control night where participants complete low arousal tasks
      prior to bedtime. On a second night, the investigators will randomize 80 AA and 80 CA to
      either race-based social rejection (i.e., being rejected by an out-group member) or same-race
      social rejection prior to bedtime to test the causal influences of race-based rejection on
      objective sleep parameters, measured using polysomnography, and nocturnal cardiovascular
      functioning. The investigators will test group differences on these outcomes as well as
      within subjects by testing impact of rejection compared to a non-rejection control night in
      the sleep laboratory. The order of the control and rejection task night will be
      counterbalanced.

    <intervention_model_description>All participants will complete two nights in the sleep laboratory. One night will be a non-rejection control night. The other night will be a rejection task night. In this regard, African American and Caucasian American participants will be randomized to one of two conditions. All participants will be exposed to social rejection prior to bedtime; however, they will either be rejected by a person of their own race (in-group member) or a different race (out-group member)</intervention_model_description>
