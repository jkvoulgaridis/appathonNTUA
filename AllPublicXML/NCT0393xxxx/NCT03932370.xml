  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Management of nephrolithiasis is evolving rapidly, and various minimally-invasive urological
      procedures are currently available for treating patients with renal stones, including
      extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy (ESWL), flexible ureteroscopy (f-URS) and miniaturised
      percutaneous nephrolithotomy (mini-PCNL).

      Despite being the only truly-non-invasive, outpatient procedure, stone-free rates (SFRs) of
      ESWL are lower than both mini-PCNL and f-URS. Furthermore, ESWL has several limitations, such
      as pregnancy; uncorrected coagulopathy;aortic aneurism; severe obesity; large stone burdens
      (&gt;2cm); stones with high densities (&gt;970/1000 Hounsfield units); ESWL-resistant stone
      compositions; lower calyceal stones with unfavourable anatomical criteria; and stones in
      calyceal diverticula; Morbidities of the conventional PCNL are significantly minimised by
      using less access diameters in PCNL while providing comparable SFRs. Additionally, Mini and
      Micro PCNL result in shorter hospital stay and higher tubeless rates compared to conventional
      PCNL.

      Flexible ureteroscopy has been increasingly used as a primary modality for treatment of renal
      stones with significantly lower complication rates than PCNL and mini-PCNL in terms of less
      bleeding and transfusion rates, shorter hospital stay and less postoperative pain.
      Additionally, f-URS is the only treatment modality of nephrolithiasis that can be safely and
      effectively used in patients with bleeding tendency, as well as pregnant women; moreover, its
      outcomes are not affected by obesity. Nevertheless, its poor durability and high costs remain
      major limitations for f-URS, especially in developing countries.
