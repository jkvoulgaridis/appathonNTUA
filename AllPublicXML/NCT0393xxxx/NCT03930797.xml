  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the proposed study is to evaluate an Intimacy Enhancement (IE) intervention
      in 120 female early stage breast cancer survivors reporting sexual concerns and their
      intimate partners. Couples will be randomized 1:1 to receive either the IE intervention or to
      an information and support condition (Living Healthy Together). The investigators will
      evaluate intervention effects on patient and partner sexual, relationship, and psychological
      outcomes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Over half of breast cancer survivors experience sexual concerns resulting from physical
      changes due to breast surgery, chemotherapy, and hormonal therapies; emotional changes; and
      relationship difficulties. In contrast with many aspects of quality of life (QOL) that tend
      to improve over time for breast cancer survivors, sexual concerns often persist for years. As
      a result, many breast cancer survivors and their partners may wish to resume a satisfying
      intimate relationship after treatment ends but encounter difficulties in doing so. Sexual
      concerns often go unaddressed, can lead to clinically significant psychological distress, and
      have a negative impact on survivors' relationships and quality of life. Thus, addressing
      sexual concerns and improving sexual function is of critical importance to the long-term
      adjustment of these survivors. Given the central role of the intimate relationship in breast
      cancer survivors' sexual experiences, a couple-based intervention that systematically
      involves the partner may be a highly effective approach for addressing these concerns and
      improving function. Yet randomized controlled trials evaluating the efficacy of a
      couple-based intervention targeting sexual function for breast cancer survivors are lacking.
      In this study, the investigators plan to evaluate a four-session telephone couple-based
      intervention that provides education and training in cognitive and behavioral skills to help
      couples cope with sexual concerns and enhance their intimate relationship, called Intimacy
      Enhancement (IE).

      The specific aims of this study are (1) to evaluate whether the IE intervention will lead to
      a significantly greater increase in patient sexual function from pre-treatment to
      post-treatment and 3- and 6-month follow-ups compared to the LHT condition; (2) to evaluate
      whether the IE intervention will lead to significantly greater improvements in partner sexual
      function, patient sexual distress, patient/partner relationship intimacy/quality, and
      psychological distress from pre-treatment to post-treatment and at 3- and 6-month follow-ups,
      compared to the LHT condition; (3) to evaluate whether increases from pre- to post-treatment
      in patient sexual communication and self-efficacy for coping with sexual concerns mediate the
      beneficial effects of the IE intervention on patient sexual function at 3- and 6-month
      follow-ups.

    <measure>Change in Self-Reported Patient Sexual Function</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to eight months</time_frame>
    <description>Patients' self-reported sexual function will be measured using the 19-item Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI).Total scale scores range from 2 to 36, with higher scores indicating higher functioning. Mean change scores will be reported: positive mean change scores indicate increase in sexual functioning over time while negative mean change scores indicate decrease in sexual functioning over time.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Self-Reported Partner Sexual Function</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to eight months</time_frame>
    <description>Partners' (male) self-reported sexual function will be measured using the 15-item International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF). Total scale scores range from 1 to 75, with higher scores indicating a higher level of sexual functioning. Change in mean male partner IIEF score over time will be reported. Positive mean change scores indicate increase in sexual functioning. If female, partners' self-reported sexual function will be measured using the 19-item Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI).Total scale scores range from 2 to 36, with higher scores indicating higher functioning. Mean change scores will be reported: positive mean change scores indicate increase in sexual functioning over time while negative mean change scores indicate decrease in sexual functioning over time. These data will be analyzed separately from patients because the partners have not been diagnosed with breast cancer.</description>
