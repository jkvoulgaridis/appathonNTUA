    <textblock>
      This is a phase II clinical trial in patients with metastatic castration sensitive prostate
      cancer. The objective of the study is to determine the efficacy and further define the safety
      of the treatment combination. This study will evaluate dose levels of carboplatin AUC 4 with
      cabazitaxel 20 mg/m2. Patients will be treated with the combination of ADT and carboplatin
      and cabazitaxel for 6 cycles. After 6 cycles of chemotherapy, they will start abiraterone
      with ADT. The primary objective is to determine the percent of subjects that have no PSA or
      radiographic progression at 1 year. Secondary objectives will include determining the
      progression‐free survival, time to PSA nadir and time to PSA progression of carboplatin and
      cabazitaxel in combination with ADT.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Willing and able to provide, or have a legally authorized representative provide,
             written informed consent and HIPAA authorization for the release of personal health
             information. A signed informed consent must be obtained before screening procedures
             are performed.

          -  Histologically confirmed prostate cancer.

          -  High volume metastatic disease (defined as the presence of visceral metastases or ≥3
             bone lesions).

          -  ADT for ≤3 months by day 1 of study chemotherapy; Prior episodes of ADT are allowed
             (i.e. ADT used previously in courses of radiation).

          -  Testosterone &lt;50 ng/dL. Patients must continue primary ADT with an LHRH analogue if
             they have not undergone orchiectomy.

          -  ECOG Performance Status 0 or 1 (see Appendix A)

          -  Patient has adequate bone marrow and organ function as defined by the following
             laboratory values:

               -  Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1.5 × 109

                  /L.

               -  Platelets ≥ 100 × 109

                  /L.

               -  Hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dl.

               -  Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5mg/dL or estimated creatinine clearance ≥ 50 ml/min

               -  In the absence of liver metastases, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate
                  aminotransferase (AST) &lt;2.5 x ULN. If the patient has liver metastases, ALT and
                  AST &lt;5 x ULN

               -  Total bilirubin &lt; ULN; or total bilirubin ≤3.0 x ULN or direct bilirubin ≤1.5 x
                  ULN in patients with well‐documented Gilbert's Syndrome.

          -  Sexually active males must use a condom during intercourse while taking study drugs
             and for 30 days after stopping treatment and should not father a child in this period.
             A condom is required to be used also by vasectomized men in order to prevent delivery

             neurosurgery) within 28 days of the date of the first dose.

          -  Other systemic therapies for prostate cancer within 28 days or 5 half‐lives, whichever
             is shorter, prior to day 1 of chemotherapy (with the exception of anti‐androgens like

          -  PSA &lt;2.0 ng/mL at diagnosis.

             trial.

          -  Patients with central nervous system (CNS) involvement unless they meet ALL of the
             following criteria:

               -  At least 4 weeks from prior therapy completion (including radiation and/or
                  surgery) prior to starting the study treatment
