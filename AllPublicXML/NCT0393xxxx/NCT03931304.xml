  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Epithelial ovarian carcinoma (EOC) is one of the main cause of death from cancer in women in
      the Western world. It is often diagnosed at an advanced stage and the disease remains
      confined to the peritoneal cavity for much of its natural history. Despite a high rate of
      response to first-line therapy, about 20% of EOC are naturally resistant to platinum and
      about 2/3 of patients with initial response will recur within 5 years. Most tumour
      recurrences will develop resistance to systemic platinum over time. The prognosis of these
      patients with persistent or recurrence disease remains poor despite salvage therapy including
      alternative systemic chemotherapy and further cytoreductive surgery (CRS). Since twenty
      years, centers have pursued comprehensive CRS combined with Hyperthermic Intraperitoneal
      Chemotherapy (HIPEC) for the management of peritoneal surface malignancies (PSM). This
      combined approach is the standard of care for the management of some rare peritoneal disease
      such as pseudomyxoma peritonei or peritoneal mesothelioma. EOC should be an ideal target for
      this loco-regional treatment, as most of its evolution remains confined to intraperitoneal
      cavity and because of its sensitivity to chemotherapy. Intraperitoneal chemotherapy has been
      shown to have significant efficacy in frontline EOC in 3 large randomized studies. Recently,
      French clinical guidelines have been edited to recommend CRS+HIPEC in patients with ovarian,
      tubal or primitive carcinomatosis FIGOI IIIC, initially not resectable (Grade B). HIPEC adds
      some advantages to this intraperitoneal chemotherapy: the hyperthermia effect with its direct
      cytotoxicity demonstrated in vitro, the synergistic effect with some anticancer agents and,
      the deliverance immediately following CRS, avoiding the problem of &quot;cancer cell entrapment&quot;
      by postoperative or posttherapeutic adhesions that limits distribution of chemotherapy agents
      to all sites. The use of HIPEC for EOC was reported into relatively small case-series from
      single institutions. Results from a single centre cannot be extrapolated to other centres
      because of the heterogeneity of patient's selection and HIPEC techniques.
