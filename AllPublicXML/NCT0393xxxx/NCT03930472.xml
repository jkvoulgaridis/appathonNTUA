  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      University of Wyoming (UW) and Wyoming Food for Thought Project (WFFTP) propose to
      collaboratively develop, pilot, and evaluate a trial on the impact of market vouchers on food
      security and fruit and vegetable (F&amp;V) consumption. We will (a) provide farmers market
      vouchers to families who are enrolled in WIC, SNAP, or free or reduced lunch and/or have
      incomes ≤185% of poverty line; (b) assess impacts of these supports on household food
      security and F&amp;V consumption; and (c) test feasibility and impacts of vouchers valid only for
      F&amp;V vs. for any foods that can be purchased with SNAP.

      To test the feasibility and preliminary impacts of this approach, we will enroll 30
      individuals/households in this study, randomizing 10 to each of the 2 intervention arms and
      10 to waitlist control. Qualifying individuals and families will be able to enroll in the
      study at the WFFTP Tuesday afternoon/evening market on July 30th, 2019. They will be
      randomized upon enrollment to one of three conditions: receiving $20 in vouchers at each of
      up to 4 markets ($80 total) that are good for F&amp;V only, receiving $20 vouchers at each of up
      to 4 markets that are good for any foods that SNAP/EBT benefits can be used for; or delayed
      intervention/waitlist control (who, at the final data gathering, will receive 5 x $20 in
      vouchers good at the WFFTP 2019 and 2020 markets).

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        To be eligible for the intervention, a participant must be an adult aged ≥18 years old
        whose household is enrolled in or eligible for SNAP, free or reduced school lunch program,
        and/or WIC (i.e., incomes of ≤185% of poverty for household size). UW staff wills screen
        for eligibility by verifying a participant has an EBT card. If no card is available,
        participants will be asked to self-report household income and size and UW staff will use
        the Federal Poverty Level chart to determine the individual's eligibility. They must also
        self-identify as living in Casper, Wyoming. They must come in person to the market on July
        30th, 2019, to enroll.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Not meeting the criteria above.
