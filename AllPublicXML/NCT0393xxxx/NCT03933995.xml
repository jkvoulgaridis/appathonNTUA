      This is a 5year (+-30 days) long term follow up study to evaluate the safety of autologous
      bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cell in erectile dysfunction subject who participated in
      and completed the Phase 1 trials (refer to ClinicalTrials.gov.Identifier: NCT02344849).

      This trial is planned to evaluate the safety of autologous bone marrow derived mesenchymal
      stem cell in patients with erectile dysfunction subject. Subjects who signed this follow-up
      observation informed consent form will participate in a safety assessment (tumor marker test,
      Serious Adverse Events, cancer incidence, recurrence of prostate cancer and vital sign).
