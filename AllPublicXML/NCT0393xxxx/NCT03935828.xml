  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, patients who have had previous endoscopic sinus surgery and present with an
      acute exacerbation of chronic rhinosinusitis will be offered endoscopic-guided,
      culture-directed antibiotic therapy. They will then be randomized to receive oral or
      intranasal topical antibiotics. Both of these are considered standard of care, but there is
      some limited data suggesting superiority of topical antibiotics especially if guided by
      culture and in patients who have undergone previous surgery. However, a study that directly
      compares the two has not been published. Modified Lund-Kennedy endoscopic finding scores and
      subjective SNOT-22 questionnaires will be collected before and at 3-4 weeks after treatment.
      Medication-related sided effects will be noted and analyzed. After 6-8 month follow-up, we
      will analyze the rate of recurrence of exacerbations, need for further antibiotics, need for
      revision surgery, and SNOT-22 scores based on oral versus topical antibiotic treatment. Our
      objective is to evaluate both short and long-term response to both oral and topical
      administration of antibiotics in this patient population in order to determine if either
      route of administration is superior to the other.

    <description>For topical antibiotics, the compounding pharmacy will use pre-determined doses using data extrapolated from oral and intravenous doses and data that has detailed the effect of the medication on solubility, pH, and particle properties. Provider choice of topical antibiotics includes Mupirocin 0.4mg/ml, Vancomycin 1mg/ml, Tobramycin 0.7mg/ml, Levofloxacin 0.4mg/ml, and Amphotericin B 20mcg/ml, all to be prescribed for 21 days, applied twice a day. Although the dosing schedule for these topical antibiotics has not been definitively studied, the majority of the data supports a range from two to three times daily for three to four weeks. Patients will be instructed by the pharmacist how to dissolve the cream, powder, or vial of antibiotic in saline, and to irrigate each nostril with 120 ml total. Doses will not be varied during the study period.</description>

    <description>Oral antibiotics will be prescribed for 21 days, as available (albeit limited) evidence recommends antimicrobial therapy in CRS for at least 3 weeks. For oral antibiotics, the choices providers will be given include: Augmentin 500 mg every 12 hours, Cefuroxime 500 mg every 12 hours, Clarithromycin 500 mg every 6 hours, Levofloxacin 500 mg once daily, or Clindamycin 300 mg every 6 hours, as these are standard of care for treatment of Chronic Rhinosinusitis.</description>
