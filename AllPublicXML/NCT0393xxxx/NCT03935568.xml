  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a first in human Phase 1 study in two parts with healthy volunteers receiving a
      single dose of PU AD in three small cohorts and a multiple ascending dose in two small
      cohorts.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, double-blind trial in two parts. A single ascending dose study in
      approximately 3 cohorts receiving a single oral dose of PU-AD or placebo and a multiple
      ascending dose study in 2 cohorts. Each subject in all cohorts will be administered an oral
      solution of PU AD or placebo under fasting conditions. Each cohort will contain subjects
      randomized to active treatment or placebo, evaluating safety and tolerance.
