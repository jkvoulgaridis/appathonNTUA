      This is a single institution study. All patients, one year after sleeve gastrectomy will be
      included. All will have a CT scan looking for clip ascent. For patients with chronic gastric
      symptoms such as retrosternal burning, regurgitations, and epigastric pain, a pH-metry will
      be performed. Those symptoms appeared at least 6 months after the surgery. A second
      consultation is done one year after. The aim of the study is to correlate clip ascent,
      pyrosis proved by ph-metry and epigastric symptoms after sleeve gastrectomy. The demographic
      data collection confirms the definition of clip ascent, define its frequency, and look for
      correlation with the median weight loss.

      There is a strong association between gastric reflux and obesity. A severe reflux is a
      contraindication for a sleeve gastrectomy for some surgeons. However the impact of sleeve
      gastrectomy on reflux is not clear. A de novo reflux is described for 2 to 18% of patients
      and many patients have unclear epigastric symptoms. One of the cause could be clip ascent
      which could justify a second surgery. This is a single institution study. All patients, one
      year after sleeve gastrectomy will be included. All will have a CT scan looking for clip
      ascent. For patients with gastric symptoms such as retrosternal burning, regurgitations, and
      epigastric pain, a pH-metry will be performed. A second consultation is done one year after.
      The aim of the study is to correlate clip ascent, pyrosis proved by ph-metry and epigastric
      symptoms after sleeve gastrectomy. The demographic data collection, confirms the definition
      of clip ascent, define its frequency, and look for correlation with the median weight loss. A
      medical information note is given to every patient at the first consultation.
