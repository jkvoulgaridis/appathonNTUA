  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      n the Sint Jansdal Hospital in Harderwijk, the Netherlands, the TREPP technique is the
      standard operating procedure for patients with inguinal hernia. Starting from 2006, this
      procedure has also been used on patients that presented with an acute strangulated inguinal
      hernia in the emergency department, instead of the more common Lichtenstein technique. The
      goal of this retrospective case series is to assess the feasibility of the TREPP technique in
      case of an acute strangulated inguinal hernia. Patient records from 2006 until 2016 will be
      used to search for patients treated for acute inguinal hernia in that period. After applying
      the in- and exclusion criteria, patients who are eligible for inclusion will be contacted by
      telephone. They will be asked if they are willing to visit the surgical outpatient department
      once and fill out two questionnaires. The data of these questionnaires will be analyzed and
      published.

    <description>Patients will be asked to fill out the VAS on a horizontal line of 10 millimeters long. Patients will be asked to mark the point that indicated the amount of pain they experience. The distance from the left marker will be measured, with increasing distance at greater pain intensity.</description>

    <description>The Trans REctussheath PrePeritoneal mesh repair (TREPP) was developed in 2006 as an open preperitoneal technique to reduce CPIP. In short: a 4-5 centimeters (cm) transverse incision is made about 1 cm above the localization of the deep inguinal ring. The anterior rectus sheath is opened. After retracting the rectus muscle medially, the preperitoneal space (PPS) is bluntly dissected and a complete overview can be achieved. All possible hernia orifices can be visualized such as: a direct, indirect, pantaloon, and/or femoral hernia. A self-expandable mesh is then positioned in the PPS. Due to the &quot;upstream principle&quot; no mesh fixation is necessary.</description>
