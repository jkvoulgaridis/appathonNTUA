             recurrent disease.

         15. Concomitant use of medicinal products known to prolong the QT interval or medicinal
             products able to induce Torsade de pointes such as class IA (e.g. quinidine,
             disopyramide) or class III (e.g. amiodarone, sotalol, dofetilide, ibutilide)
             antiarrhythmic medicinal products, methadone, moxifloxacin, antipsychotics.

         18. The receipt of an investigational product, or participation in a drug research study
             within a period of 30 days prior screening or 5 half-lives within the last dose of
             investigational product, whichever is longer. Current use of any drugs that are known
             to interfere with goserelin metabolism or to cause a drug-drug interaction.

         19. Donation / loss of blood/plasma or blood product (without replenishment) (1 unit or
