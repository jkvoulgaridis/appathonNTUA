  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It concerns an investigation aiming to investigate genetic biological(s) marker(s) which
      allow to identify individuals who have risk of serious adverse events to the yellow fever
      vaccine. This testing is free of hypothesis, because these markers are still unknown. There
      is no intervention, and it is not possible to establish primary and secondary outcomes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The rational for the immunological study by LATIM is the observation made by the group that
      individuals vaccinated with the 17DD yellow fever vaccine show significant alterations on the
      levels of expression of genes such as CLEC5A, IFNG, IL6, RNASEL, IRF7, IRF9, STAT2 e OAS1
      (8). The study which will be conducted by the Rockefeller University will be focused in the
      qualitative analysis of the genome and exome of volunteers. The study in LATIM will be
      focused in the quantitative analysis of mRNA, which, together with the results of sequencing,
      may help in the search for biomarkers. As the expression of mRNA is restricted to the acute
      phase of the adverse event, it will be done only during the first 30 days after the beginning
      of the adverse event.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion criteria:

          -  Evidence of a systemic reaction in two or more organs within one month of vaccination
             with yellow fever vaccine;

          -  Laboratory evidence of yellow fever vaccine virus (at least one):

        Positive culture for more than 7 days after vaccination; RT-PCR â‰¥ 3 log10 PFU/mL at any day
        after vaccination; Positive RT-PCR more than 14 days after vaccination; Presence of vaccine
        virus in tissue by culture, RT-PCR or immunohistochemistry.

          -  Laboratory exclusion of relevant differential diagnosis such as leptospirosis, viral
             hepatitis and arboviruses.

          -  Cases not obeying these strict criteria but that could be plausibly YEL-AVD or YEL-AND
             may be included, if approved by the investigator or co-investigators.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Cases with adverse event after yellow fever vaccine not severe.
