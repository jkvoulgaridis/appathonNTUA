      The researchers hope to explore the etiological distribution and influencing factors of
      KCNQ2-related neonatal convulsions or refractory epileptic encephalopathy, and to improve the
      level of assessment, identification, intervention and shunt of KCNQ2-related convulsions. To
      formulate countermeasures and measures for prevention, management and health education.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Convulsion is the most common clinical manifestation of neonatal central nervous system
      dysfunction. the incidence of convulsion is very high in neonatal period, especially in the
      first week after birth. the incidence of convulsion decreases gradually with the increase of
      age. The incidence of convulsion reported by Bassan et al was 1.5 ‰ ~ 3.5 ‰ in term infants
      and 10% ≤ 130% in premature infants. Most of the neonatal convulsions suggest that there are
      serious primary diseases in the body. in addition to hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy,
      intracranial hemorrhage and infection, a large number of studies have proved that genetic
      factors play a key role in the occurrence of neonatal convulsions and epileptic
      encephalopathy in infants. Nearly 20% to 50% of neonatal convulsions are idiopathic
      convulsions. it has been thought that KCNQ2 gene, a potassium channel subunit located in
      20q11.3, and KCNQ3 gene, another potassium channel subunit located in 8q24, are mutated. Is
      the molecular basis for some benign familial neonatal convulsions, Usually the prognosis is
      good, but with the expansion of the study sample, investigators found that KCNQ2 may be
      associated with refractory epileptic encephalopathy, and there are few international reports
      in this regard. The study of KCNQ2 gene has led to a new understanding of the etiology of
      neonatal convulsion. The researchers hope to explore the etiological distribution and
      influencing factors of KCNQ2-related neonatal convulsions or refractory epileptic
      encephalopathy, and to improve the level of assessment, identification, intervention and
      shunt of KCNQ2-related convulsions. To formulate countermeasures and measures for prevention,
      management and health education.

    <description>Some non-benign KCNQ2 gene-related convulsions require anticonvulsant intervention, and investigators hope to observe and obtain the effective rate of first-line anticonvulsant intervention. To determine whether the convulsion stopped or the frequency of convulsion decreased within 72 hours after taking the drug. If convulsions stop or the frequency of seizures decreases, drug intervention is considered effective.</description>

    <description>Infants who met the inclusion criteria were enrolled in this study. The infants will get their own DNA sequencing results by WES technology. The researchers found that some of them carried mutations in the KCNQ2 gene. so they wanted to compare whether there were differences with or without KCNQ2 gene mutations in the efficacy of anticonvulsants or long-term neurodevelopment in different exposure groups.</description>
