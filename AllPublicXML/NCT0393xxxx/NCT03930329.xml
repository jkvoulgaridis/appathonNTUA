  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Smoking causes a variety of health problems and causes burden to healthcare
      systems. Even when support is provided, local data suggest that around 50% of biochemically
      confirmed quitters resume smoking within 6 months of participating in a smoking cessation
      program. Mindfulness-based intervention is a promising option because accumulating evidence
      from randomized controlled trials support its use among smokers. Our team aims to determine
      if mindfulness-based interventions can prevent relapse in smokers who recently quit smoking.
      A pilot trial is needed to determine the feasibility of recruitment, randomisation and
      acceptability of the intervention in these patients Method: Forty participants, who just
      quitted smoking, will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio to the 8week mindfulness-based relapse
      prevention (MBRP) program and to usual care.

    <description>The mindfulness-based relapse prevention program consists of eight weekly 2-hour sessions. It combines mindfulness with evidence-based cognitive behavioural techniques that help participants to recognize internal and external triggers of their substance abuse, including smoking. Each session consists of mindful practices with cognitive exercises. The standardized treatment manual was published</description>

    <description>All participants in this trial will receive usual care, which consists of 8-12 weeks of counselling and drug treatment to help smokers quit. Data from the centre shows that approximately 50% of smokers are successfully abstinent from smoking at end of the program, as confirmed by the carbon monoxide breath test. This trial will only recruit those who successfully quitted smoking. During this 8-12 week program, written information about relapse prevention is given, including information for maintaining healthy lifestyles (e.g. diet/sleep/exercise/emotional control). Participants will receive follow-up phone interviews by trained smoking cessation counsellors at end of the program (week 8-12)</description>
