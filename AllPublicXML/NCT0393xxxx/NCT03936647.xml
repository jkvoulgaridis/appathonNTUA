  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intracranial bifurcation aneurysms are commonly repaired with surgical and with endovascular
      techniques. Wide-necked bifurcation aneurysms (WNBA) are a difficult subset of aneurysms to
      successfully repair endovascularly, and a number of treatment adjuncts have been designed.
      One particularly promising innovation is the WEB (Woven EndoBridge), which permits placement
      of an intra-saccular flow diverting mesh across the aneurysm neck, but which does not require
      anti-platelet agent therapy. Currently, which treatment option leads to the best outcome for
      patients with WNBA remains unknown. There is a need to offer treatment with the WEB within
      the context of a randomized care trial, to patients currently presenting with aneurysms
      thought to be suitable for the WEB.
