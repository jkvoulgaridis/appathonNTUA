  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Multicenter, observer-blinded, randomized, Active controlled, Phase 3 study in
      healthy 6 months to 45 years aged Nepalese at the time of the first vaccine dose.

      The study objectives are:

      I. Demonstrate non-inferiority of Vi-DT compared to Typbar TCV® as measured by seroconversion
      rates of anti-Vi IgG ELISA antibody titers, 4 weeks after single dose (pooled immunogenicity
      of three lots of Vi-DT)

      II. Demonstrate the equivalence of immunogenicity as measured by anti-Vi IgG GMT of three
      lots of Vi-DT vaccine 4 weeks after single dose.

      Subjects will be stratified according to age. The study procedure is as follows:

      Visit 1 (day-1 to -7): Screen participants by medical/medications history, physical
      examination, Vital signs, Urine pregnancy test (UPT)

      Visit 2 (day 0): Enroll, randomize and administer vaccine to eligible participants and assess
      participant safety by physical examination and Vital signs, Collect blood for immunogenicity
      assessments.

      Visit 3 (day 7): Check solicited adverse reaction 7 days post vaccination and Assess
      participant safety by physical examination and Vital signs

      Visit 4 (day 28): Assess participant safety by physical examination and Vital signs, Collect
      blood for immunogenicity assessments

      Visit 5 (day 84): Assess participant safety by physical examination and Vital signs

      Visit 6 (day 168): Assess participant safety by physical examination and Vital signs, Collect
      blood for immunogenicity assessments, and fill in study completion form in the absence of any
      safety concern.

      This study is observer-blind: vaccine administrator and vaccine safety evaluator will be two
      distinct persons to avoid bias of safety assessment. Trial staff other than the vaccine
      administrator.

      For retention: After vaccination, field health worker/designee will contact participant every
      day till Day 7 by physical visit or by phone call. Follow-up reminder calls will be done very
      frequently as per discretion of study staff until 24 weeks for all participant to assess
      participant safety.
