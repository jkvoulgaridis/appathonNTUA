  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      POWER is uniquely positioned to evaluate characteristics of multi-component PWM programs that
      are associated with &quot;favorable&quot; health outcomes for treatment-seeking youth with obesity. The
      POWER Data Coordinating Center developed ranking reports of the 33 participating sites based
      on weight status change at 6 months. An in-depth review of program design of 4
      &quot;top-performing&quot; sites was conducted. A unique feature identified was offering an individual
      program orientation session to patient-families prior to the start of the multi-component PWM
      program. This orientation helped patient-families better understand the program's
      expectations, and offered an opportunity to evaluate readiness to change, barriers for making
      lifestyle changes, and mental health problems. This information was used to tailor the
      intervention to better meet the needs of participating patient-families. When a survey of
      program characteristics was conducted of the 33 participating sites, this &quot;top-performing
      site&quot; was the only one to offer such a program orientation session prior to patient-families
      starting the PWM program. Therefore this program feature was included as part of the &quot;bundle
      of program enhancements&quot; (BPE) for this proposed pragmatic pilot study.
