      A randomised controlled non-inferiority trial of the Triple ACTs artemether-lumefantrine +
      amodiaquine (AL+AQ) and artesunate-piperaquine + mefloquine (AS-PPQ+MQ) with the ACTs
      artemether-lumefantrine + placebo (AL+PBO) and artesunate-piperaquine + placebo (AS-PPQ+PBO)
      OR artesunate-mefloquine (AS-MQ) for the treatment of uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum
      malaria to assess and compare their efficacy, safety, tolerability.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In each site subjects will be randomized between four arms: artemether-lumefantrine +
      amodiaquine, artemether-lumefantrine + placebo, artesunate-piperaquine + mefloquine and
      artesunate-piperaquine + placebo.

      In Cambodia the comparator will be artesunate-mefloquine due to the current well-documented
      low treatment efficacy of DHA-piperaquine.

      In the control arms, the ACT will be blister-packed with a matched (in appearance) placebo.

      In lower transmission settings (Annual Parasite Incidence &lt;50 per 1000 population per year)
      the treatment will include a single 0.25 mg/kg gametocytocidal dose of primaquine as
      recommended by the WHO for children ≥10 kg. All drug administrations will be observed.

      Subjects will be treated in an in-patient unit for 3 days and followed up weekly up to D63.
      Microscopy to detect and quantify malaria parasitaemia will be performed daily (more
      frequently in patients with parasite density of &gt;5000/µL at inclusion) during
      hospitalization, at all weekly and unscheduled visits. A physical examination and
      measurements of vital signs along with a symptom questionnaire for tolerability will be
      performed and recorded through a standardized method at baseline, daily during admission and
      weekly during follow up through D42 and at all unscheduled visits. Physical exam, vital sign
      measurements and assessments of symptoms will be performed on D49, D56, and D63 only for
      patients who are parasitaemic or those who report fever or other symptoms.
      Electrocardiographs will be performed during admission (H0, H4, H52, or H64) and day 42 of
      follow up to assess and compare the effect of ACTs and TACTs antimalarials on QTc-intervals.

      Safety assessments will be performed by measuring markers of renal and hepatic toxicity,
      haemoglobin, , platelet counts, absolute and differential white blood cell counts and ECGs.
      Pharmacokinetic profiles in a subset of subjects will be linked to measures of efficacy and
      toxicity. To avoid extensive blood sampling, especially in children, a population
      pharmacokinetic approach will be followed, requiring sparse blood sampling reducing the
      burden of sampling for the patient [21].

      Blood samples for parasite genotyping as well as genomic, transcriptomic and immunology
      studies will be collected at baseline and at selected time-points on follow-up and also on
      the day of a recurrent infection.

      In patients with parasite densities &gt;5000 per µL at screening, parasite clearance rates will
      be assessed by repeated assessments of the parasite counts after the start of the
      antimalarial treatments. At each visit a capillary blood sample will be taken for parasite
      count and haematocrit.

      If a patient presents with a new uncomplicated falciparum malaria infection after 3 months or
      longer after the initial enrolment, the patient or relative (in case of a child) will be
      asked to re-enter the patient in the trial.

      In selected study sites, P. falciparum parasites will be cryopreserved for in vitro
      antimalarial drug sensitivity testing. Where possible, ex vivo or in vitro assessments of
      parasite susceptibility to artemisinins and partner drugs will be assessed.

      The in vivo and ex vivo data on artemisinin and partner drug sensitivity will potentially be
      used to identify new genetic or transcriptomic markers/patterns of artemisinin or partner
      drug resistance.

      The pharmacogenetics of antimalarial agents are poorly known despite the fact that
      application of pharmacogenetics might be critical in optimizing treatment of malaria in
      individuals but also populations at large. Blood samples (dried blood blots) for human
      genotyping will be obtained and stored from all subjects recruited with subject's consent.

      Subjects or their guardians will be asked a short set of questions on their place of
      residence, place of work and their history of travel in the last 2 months. In addition, basic
      questions on use of mobile phones will be asked. These questions will help in understanding
      the use of mobile phones in each country in subjects prone to malaria infections which can
      inform future malaria studies or interventions.
