  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label study to assess the efficacy of capecitabine (CAP) and temozolomide
      (TMZ) in recurrent pituitary adenomas. There will be a safety run-in of at least three
      patients to establish any dose limiting toxicities. Enrolled patients will receive treatment
      in 28-day cycles: capecitabine 1500mg/m2 per day (divided into two doses with maximum daily
      dose of 2500mg) on days 1 through 14 and oral temozolomide 150 to 200 mg/m2 on days 10
      through 14. This will be followed by 14 days off treatment. MRI imaging will be completed
      after every two cycles. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 6 cycles in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

    <description>All subjects will receive:
Capecitabine (oral 5-Fluorouracil) 1500mg/m2 orally per day (divided into two doses with maximum daily dose of 2500mg) on days 1 through 14.
Temozolomide (second generation alkylating agent) 150 to 200 mg/m2 orally on days 10 through 14.
After completion of 6 cycles, patients achieving a complete or partial tumor response may continue to receive capecitabine temozolomide at the investigator's discretion in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients will be monitored for six months after they come off the study (either after completing 6 cycles or in setting of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity).</description>
