  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a prototype of chronic, progressive, and fibrotic lung
      disease. It has been considered rare, with an incidence estimated to 11.5 cases per 100 000
      individuals per year. Increasing rates of hospital admissions and deaths due to IPF suggest
      an increasing burden of disease. The median survival time from diagnosis is 2-4 years.

      Recently two disease-modifying therapies, pirfenidone and nintedanib, have been approved
      worldwide. Both drugs reduce the disease progression as measured by progressive decline in
      forced vital capacity (FVC), with a reduction of overall mortality showed by meta-analysis of
      phase III pirfenidone trials.

      However, progression of disease continues to occur despite the currently available drug
      therapy. Many patients die from progressive, chronic hypoxemic respiratory failure, or less
      frequently from acute exacerbation of pulmonary fibrosis. In these patients, no data are
      available to guide management between continuation of the prescribed antifibrotic drug, to
      switch to the other available antifibrotic drug, or to combine the available drugs.

      The combination of nintedanib and pirfenidone is not recommended outside clinical trials.
      However, although both antifibrotic drugs were developed and approved as monotherapy, two
      recent trials have suggested the feasibility and safety of combining them over a 12-24 weeks
      period. These results encourage further studies of combination treatment with pirfenidone and
      nintedanib in patients with IPF. Such study is timely, as there is a risk that clinicians
      facing the continued worsening of disease in patients receiving one of the available drugs
      may prescribe both drugs combined outside clinical trials, potentially exposing patients to a
      currently unknown risk.

      This study will evaluate the efficacy and tolerance of the combination pirfenidone and
      nintedanib as compared to a &quot;switch monotherapy&quot;: i.e. switching from the current to the
      other of the two existing drugs prescribed as monotherapy, in patients who present chronic
      worsening IPF despite receiving either pirfenidone or nintedanib.
