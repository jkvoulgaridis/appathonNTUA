  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The laying of a naso-gastric tube is an extremely common event in intensive medicine;
      although standard naso-gastric tube laying is performed at the patient's bedside, this
      procedure is not without risk. Through the use of methods already used in the clinical field,
      of daily use, we want to identify the threshold value between tracheal and esophageal etCO2
      (group A) and the threshold value between gastric and esophageal pH (group B).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Numerous methodologies have been evaluated to recognize the correct positioning of NGT at the
      gastric level, including different clinical techniques (such as gastric auscultation,
      aspiration of the NGT), ultrasound techniques, etc. Actually, the diagnostic gold standard is
      the thoraco-abdominal anterior-posterior radiography, which is considered the only
      non-invasive method capable to confirm the correct pose of the NGT at intra-diaphragmatic
      level. This method, however, even if it is non-invasive, requires the use of ionizing
      radiation (4 micro-Sievert (uSv) for radiography) which could be repeated multiple time for
      the same patient; NGT may need to be repositioned several times during the same hospital
      stay, increasing patient exposure to ionizing radiation and, potentially, also the health
      workers exposure.

      The aim is to identify into the group A the threshold value between tracheal and esophageal
      etCO2 and into the group B the theshold value between gastric and esophageal pH.

      Phase A: etCO2 measurement will be collected 1. after intubation, when the tube is inserted
      into the endotracheal tube, before proceeding with the aspiration of secretions and 2. once
      the NGT has been inserted, by a probe located at the end of the tube.

      Phase B: pH measurement will be collected at the end of the procedure, once the NGT is
      inserted, at 1.a distance of 25 cm from the mouth (oesophageal site) and at 2. a distance of
      40 cm (gastric site), aspirating the gastric contents and measuring on specific litmus paper.

    <description>At the end of the anaesthesia , as usual, the secretions are aspirated with a suction tube of 18 Fr of caliber (diameter 6 mm). When the tube is inserted into the endotracheal tube, before proceeding with the aspiration of the secretions, a capnometer is attached to its outer end, measuring the etCO2 value for 10-15 seconds. At the end of the measurement, authors proceed with the aspiration of the secretions as usual.
Authors then proceed with the laying of a NGT according to local protocols. Also in this case, once the NGT has been inserted, the etCO2 is measured at the end of the probe for 10-15 seconds. At the end of the measurement, the capnometer can be detached, as a standard procedure, and the NGT can be used as usual.
At the end of the procedure, therefore, for each patient, two values of etCO2 are acquired which will allow to obtain two &quot;populations of values&quot; of the etCO2: the values recorded at the endotracheal level and the one recorded at the oesophageal level.</description>
