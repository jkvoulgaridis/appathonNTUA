  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The extent and duration of tissue hypoxia is a major determinant of outcome following major,
      high-risk surgery and in critical illness. Prompt restoration of tissue oxygenation through
      resuscitation in all likelihood improves outcomes. There are currently no bedside monitors in
      clinical practice that track tissue perfusion per se, instead clinicians rely on crude
      surrogates such as heart rate and blood pressure, urine output, serum lactate of global flow
      (cardiac output) monitoring.

      This is a first-in-man trial of a new device to measure tissue oxygenation in real time in a
      major, high-risk surgical and critical care cohort. The device consists of an oxygen sensing
      probe incorporated into a modified urinary catheter, which relies on photoluminescence
      technology and the quenching properties of oxygen.

      Once inserted, the drained bladder collapses round and envelopes the probe which continuously
      measures tissue oxygenation of the bladder urothelium.

      The investigators hope to (i) Establish that tissue oxygenation can be safely monitored using
      this technology, deployed in this way. (ii) Define a normal range for bladder tissue
      oxygenation in man as measured using this device. (iii) Compare tissue oxygenation against
      other markers of perfusion status in current clinical practice and assess its performance at
      detecting inadequate perfusion against these other modalities. (iv) assess the diagnostic and
      prognostic capabilities of the tissue oxygenation monitoring at detecting hypo-perfusion and
      predicting outcome. (v) Further assess the tissue response to an 'oxygen challenge' in
      identifying occult hypo-perfusion. (vi). Provide pilot work required to inform future,
      interventional studies where similar patients would be resuscitated to tissue oxygenation
      targets alongside routine clinical practice.
