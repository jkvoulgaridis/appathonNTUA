  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Treatment with PF-06741086 is anticipated to demonstrate a clinically relevant advantage
      and/or a major contribution to patient care in comparison to current methods of treatment for
      hemophilia A or B because it works differently than factor replacement products and will work
      in the presence of inhibitors. The potential for once weekly (QW) subcutaneous (SC)
      administration provides for treatment options in the absence of reliable vascular access,
      increased convenience and may enable better compliance. Combined, these qualities should
      result in a reduction of bleeding episodes.

             the time of Screening (eg, participant with a previously documented high-titer
             inhibitor (≥5 BU/mL) and whose condition precludes re-challenge with FVIII or FIX
             replacement) may be considered for eligibility on a case-by-case basis with prior

          -  Abnormal coagulation activity

          -  Other acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory abnormality that
             may increase the risk associated with study participation or investigational product
             administration or may interfere with the interpretation of study results and, in the
             judgment of the investigator,

          -  Current routine prophylaxis with bypassing agent or non-coagulation non-factor-
             replacement therapy

          -  Regular, concomitant therapy with immunomodulatory drugs

          -  Ongoing or planned use of immune tolerance induction or prophylaxis with FVIII or FIX
             replacement during the Active Treatment Phase.

          -  Previous exposure to PF 06741086 during to participation in studies B7841002 and
             B7841003.

          -  Participation in other studies involving investigational drug(s) within 30 days (or as
             determined by local requirements) or 5 half-lives prior to study entry and/or during
             study participation.

          -  CD4 cell count ≤200/uL if human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive

          -  Clinically relevant ECG abnormalities that may affect participant safety or
             interpretation of study results.

          -  Individuals with hypersensitivity or an allergic reaction to hamster protein or other
             components of the study intervention.

          -  Investigator site staff members directly involved in the conduct of the study and
             their family members, site staff members otherwise supervised by the investigator, or

             involved in the conduct of the study.
