    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 3, multi-center, prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, delayed
      treatment, double-blind, study to evaluate the effectiveness, and safety of a single, oral
      dose of Solosec® containing 2 grams of secnidazole in female patients with trichomoniasis.

      The study will consist of a primary study phase (Visit 1 (baseline) to Visit 2 (Day 6-12))
      and a follow-up phase (Visit 2 to Visit 3 (7-12 days post Visit 2)). During the primary phase
      patients will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either Solosec or placebo. Patients will
      return to the clinic for the &quot;test of cure&quot; (TOC) visit to be conducted on Days 6-12 (Visit
      2). After all Visit 2 study procedures have been completed, patients will receive the
      opposite treatment (placebo patients will receive Solosec and vice versa). Patients with V2
      cultures that are subsequently positive for T. vaginalis will return to the clinic for Visit
      3 (V3) assessments and investigator assessment of need for additional therapy (an additional
      Visit 4 may be scheduled at the investigator's discretion if culture at V3 is positive).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  adult female or post-menarche adolescent girl ≥12 years of age in general good health

          -  Have a diagnosis of trichomoniasis at the screening visit as determined by one of the
             following:

               -  positive T. vaginalis NAAT test within 30 days of screening for which treatment
                  has not been initiated.

               -  positive OSOM® rapid test.

               -  positive wet mount assessment.

          -  Agree to abstain from vaginal intercourse until the final study visit

          -  Agree not to have any vaginal penetration or use of any vaginal products for the
             duration of the study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Are pregnant, lactating, or planning to become pregnant during the study.

          -  Are suspected clinically (or confirmed diagnostically) of having alternative causes of
             vaginal symptoms including symptomatic vulvovaginal candidiasis, chlamydia, gonorrhea,
             or an active genital herpes outbreak

          -  Are suspected clinically of having an acute urinary tract infection.

          -  Have active genital lesions, including primary syphilitic chancres and herpes simplex
             virus lesions, or other vaginal or vulvar conditions which could confound the
             interpretation of the clinical response, as determined by the Investigator (patients
             with genital warts may be enrolled).

          -  Have received systemic antibacterial therapy or topical antimicrobial/antifungal/
             immunomodulatory therapies in the genital area (vagina, vulva and surrounding soft
             tissue), within 14 days prior to the Baseline Visit (Day 1).
