  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this study is to investigate the signal intensity and relaxation rate
      characteristics of gadoterate meglumine (Dotarem, Guerbet, USA) enhanced myocardium during
      rest and stress perfusion cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) compared to gadobutrol
      (Gadavist) to prove that Dotarem provides constantly high myocardial relaxation necessary for
      accurate quantitative perfusion evaluation.

      The purpose of this study is to compare two types of contrast that patients receive during
      cardiac MRI scans to visualize the blood flow in the cardiac muscle. Both contrasts are used
      in standard of care procedures, and the one administered for each patient will be randomly
      selected. The length of the MRI study all procedures are the same as the clinically indicated
      scan.

      The overall goal of this study is to investigate the signal intensity and relaxation rate
      characteristics of gadoterate meglumine (Dotarem, Guerbet, USA) enhanced myocardium during
      rest and stress perfusion cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) compared to gadobutrol
      (Gadavist) to prove that Dotarem provides constantly high myocardial relaxation necessary for
      accurate quantitative perfusion evaluation. Within this overall goal, the following specific
      aims will be pursued:

        -  Aim 1: To test the hypothesis that the signal intensity enhancement during Dotarem
           myocardial stress/rest perfusion is relatively constant, providing linear and stable
           enhancement in the myocardium, and is not inferior compared to gadobutrol (Gadavist).

        -  Aim 2: To test the hypothesis that the relaxation rate enhancement during Dotarem
           myocardial rest perfusion is uniform in the myocardium.
