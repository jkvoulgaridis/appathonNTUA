      This study will evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of an HIV-1 gp41 MPER-656 liposome
      vaccine in healthy, HIV-uninfected adults.

      Participants will be randomly assigned to four groups. Participants in Group 1 (Treatment 1)
      will receive 500 mcg of MPER-656 liposome vaccine at Months 0, 2, and 6. Participants in
      Group 1 (Control 1) will receive placebo at Months 0, 2, and 6. Participants in Group 2
      (Treatment 2) will receive 2000 mcg of MPER-656 liposome vaccine at Months 0, 2, and 6.
      Participants in Group 2 (Control 2) will receive placebo at Months 0, 2, and 6. Study staff
      will review safety data from Group 1 before deciding whether to enroll Group 2.

      Participants will attend several study visits through Month 12. Visits may include physical
      examinations, blood and urine collection, HIV testing, risk reduction counseling, and
      questionnaires. Study staff will contact participants at Month 18 for follow-up health
      monitoring.

      As of May 2020, vaccinations were discontinued for all participants.
