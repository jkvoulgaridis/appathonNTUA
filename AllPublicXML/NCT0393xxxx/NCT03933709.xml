  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Most patients with cerebral palsy (CP) are dependent on parents due to the
      spasticity and limitations in their gross motor function. Additionally, many of them do not
      respond to physical therapy due to deterioration in their nutritional status, which is
      secondary to gastrointestinal disorders, parasitosis, dysbiosis and the catabolic state of
      the disease itself. Evidence suggests that greater independence and better clinical response
      can be achieved by correcting the nutritional status. However, basic treatments only
      contemplate the calculation of energy requirements and do not consider important nutrients in
      particular, supplementation with glutamine, arginine, zinc, selenium, colecalciferol,
      nicotinic acid, spirulina, omega 3, ascorbic acid, vegetal protein or even probiotics.

      Objective: To determine the effect of using a nutritional support system (NSS) diet,
      supplements and probiotic on the gross motor function in children with CP with spastic
      diparesic and Gross Motor Function Classification System III (GMFCS III).

      Material and methods: In an exploratory study with controlled clinical trial design, 30
      patients were randomly assigned to receive: 1) dietary surveillance and conventional therapy
      (FG), 2) deworming and WHO diet (CG), or 3) deworming and the NSS (IG). The patients were
      recruited from the Children´s Telethon Rehabilitation Center (CRIT) in Tlalnepantla Estado de
      México. Males and females aged 4-12 years were included with CP and spastic diparesic GMFCS
      III, who had a full-time caregiver and whose parents agreed to participate. They were studied
      for thirteen weeks. Gross motor function was evaluated at baseline and at 7 and 13 weeks
      after therapy using the GMFM scale.

    <masking_description>Throughout the study, the physical therapy given was the same for the three groups and was applied by CRIT therapists. These staff members were not involved in the protocol. The evaluators did not have access to any information about the treatment given to each child, and this ensured the blind part to the study was met.</masking_description>

    <time_frame>The GMFM scale was performed at baseline time and weeks 7 and 13 after intervention.</time_frame>
    <description>This scale assesses five general parameters:
Lying (decubitus) and rolling over (GMFAV),
Sitting (GMFB),
Crawling and kneeling (GMFC),
Standing (GMFD),
Walking (GMFE) and one final total item (GMFF).
The scoring system consists of 88 items and each one is valued based on the following criteria:
0= No,
start,
Partially Complete,
Complete, NE= Not evaluated</description>

    <description>Envelope 1 4.9g of Spirulina, 100mg ascorbic acid, 5mg folic acid and 10mg of glutamine. Was to be added to shake 1 during the first 10 days. Envelope 2 1g PUFAs n-3 and was to be added to shake 2 which was given throughout the intervention. Envelope 3 4.9g of Spirulina Maximum, 100mg ascorbic acid, 5mg folic acid, 5.2g vegetable protein, 125mg nicotinic acid, 50mg zinc, 100 mcg selenium and 800 UI cholecalciferol. Was to be added to shake 1 from day 11 until the end of week 6, after which it was suspended for 10 days and substituted for envelope 5 and then to be retaken until the end of the intervention. Envelope 4. 1g arginine and was to be added to shake 3 from day 8 until the end of the intervention. Envelope 5 contained the same ingredients as envelope 3 with an additional 10mg glutamine and was to be added to shake 1 from the start of week 7 for 10 days, after which envelope 3 was restarted. Probiotic at a dosage of 200 mg every 12 hours for 3 days at the beginning and week 6</description>
