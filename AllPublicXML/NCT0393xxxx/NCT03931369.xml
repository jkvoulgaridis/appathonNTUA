      Tolvaptan is a new drug that specifically antagonizes the V2-receptor of antidiuretic hormone
      (ADH) and leads to water diuresis: During acute administration of tolvaptan, the main fear is
      to induce a too fast increase in plasma sodium concentration and in turn brain damageHowever,
      the tolvaptan-induced increase in plasma sodium concentration is expected to stimulate
      thirst, preventing major negative water balance.

      The investigators hypothesize that tolvaptan-induced increase in plasma osmolality (and
      sodium concentration) is dependent of thirst adaptation that is influenced by physiological
      factors, namely age and sex. To address the effect of a single oral administration of
      tolvaptan at a dosage used during hyponatremia (15 mg) under free water access in healthy
      volunteers. Primary outcome will be the maximal change in serum sodium concentration within
      the 6 hours following tolvaptan administration.

    <textblock>
      Tolvaptan is a new drug that specifically antagonizes the V2-receptor of antidiuretic hormone
      (ADH) and leads to water diuresis: its beneficial effects have been demonstrated for
      hyponatremia due to a syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (SIAD). During acute
      administration of tolvaptan, the main fear is to induce a too fast increase in plasma sodium
      concentration and in turn brain damage. An acute increase in serum sodium concentration has
      been observed in water restricted subjects. However, the tolvaptan-induced increase in plasma
      sodium concentration is expected to stimulate thirst, preventing major negative water
      balance. In non-water restricted subjects, this has never been studied. Moreover, this
      physiological adaptation may change according to age and gender. The investigatorshypothesize
      that healthy volunteers will adapt normally to an acute tolvaptan administration, thirst
      helping to maintain plasma sodium and osmolality within the normal range. The final
      tolvaptan-induced increase in plasma osmolality will depend on thirst adaptation, influenced
      by physiological factors, namely age and sex.

      Sixty subjects (30 male, 30 female) from 18 to 85 years old will be recruited from the
      database of healthy subjects of the Clinical Investigation Center of the European Georges
      Pompidou Hospital, Paris, France. They will have two visits: one inclusion safety visit
      without administration, and 2 to 15 days later, an experimental visit. During the later visit
      water and electrolyte output and water intake will be monitored hourly two hours before and
      six hours after single administration of 15 mg tolvaptan.
