  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study shall mainly help to better evaluate the performance the APDS device and secondly
      it may help to assess the potential of the future alpha version of the device to be a useful
      and effective for the detection of colon Polyps.

      Primary objectives: To evaluate, in objective way, the usability of the future alpha version
      of the APDS device by testing the sensitivity and specificity of its results achieved from
      running it on the collected recorded videos of Colonoscopy screening tests of the general
      population.

      Secondary objectives: When the APDS would be ready for field installation (Beta Version), to
      install it in the Gastroenterology institute of the medical center, in order to evaluate, as
      part of a continuation study, the physicians satisfaction from the APDS performance.

        subject (not less than 200 patients and up to 300 subjects) included will pass one regular
        colonoscopy screening test which will be recorded in the way which is described above.

        Enrolled subjects that did not complete the full course of the study will be replaced
