  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is studying an investigational drug called BMS-986158 as a possible
      treatment for pediatric solid tumors, lymphoma, or brain tumors.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I clinical trial, which tests the safety of an investigational drug and also
      tries to define the appropriate dose of the investigational drug to use for further studies.
      &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the drug is being studied.

      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved BMS-986158 as a treatment
      for any disease.

      BMS-986158 is currently still being studied in adults. This is the first time that BMS-986158
      will be evaluated in younger children, though children 12-17 years of age may also be
      included in parts of adult studies of BMS-986158.

      Research in the laboratory has shown that BMS-986158 may have activity against cancer cells.
      BMS-986158 belongs to a group of drugs called Bromodomain (BRD) and Extra-Terminal Domain
      (BET) inhibitors. These drugs block proteins that are important in reading DNA, which is a
      process important for cancer cells.
