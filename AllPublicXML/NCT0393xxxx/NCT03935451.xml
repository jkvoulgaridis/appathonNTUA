  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a relatively common disease that effects all age groups
      and carries significant morbidity and mortality. The initial treatment typically involves
      both short and long term medication, however when this is not enough to adequately control
      the disease, surgery is often required. The high morbidity and mortality rates are in part
      due to the increased rates of venous thromboembolism (VTE) such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT)
      or pulmonary embolism (PE) which have been shown to develop more frequently in IBD patients
      compared to the general population. Undergoing abdominal surgery has also been shown to
      independently increase rates of DVT and PE and since the majority of patients with IBD will
      undergo surgery at least once in their lifetime, the relative increased risk of developing a
      VTE is very high. The majority of DVT and PE events in the postoperative IBD population will
      occur after discharge from hospital and therefore carries significant morbidity and mortality
      risk in a unmonitored setting. Several studies have demonstrated the benefits and safety of
      twice daily dosing of oral extended VTE prophylaxis agents in orthopedic and cancer
      postoperative patients following discharge from hospital. There have been no randomized
      studies which have evaluated the use of extended postoperative VTE prophylaxis in IBD
      patients. The purpose of this randomized placebo controlled pilot trial will be to evaluate
      the efficacy and safety of postoperative VTE prophylaxis in IBD patients following abdominal
      surgery. If this pilot trial demonstrates efficacy in reducing postoperative DVT and PE
      rates, safety and feasibility, clinicians will be armed with the knowledge to pursue a larger
      multicenter randomized trial with the intent of reducing overall morbidity and mortality in
      this high risk population.
