      This is a single-center phase II study designed to evaluated the efficacy and safety of
      fulvestrant in combination with oral vinorelbine in hormone receptor-positive advanced breast
      cancer

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-group, single-center phase II trial. Patients with
      hormone-receptor-positive, Her2-negative recurrent or metastatic breast cancer who had not
      previously received any systemic antitumor therapy for advanced disease were treated with
      fulvestrant combined with oral vinorelbine as a first-line regimen. Key issues to be
      addressed in this study: to observe and evaluate the efficacy and safety of fulvestrant
      combined with oral vinorelbine in the treatment of hormone-receptor-positive and
      HER2-negative advanced breast cancer. Thirty patients are planned to be enrolled.
