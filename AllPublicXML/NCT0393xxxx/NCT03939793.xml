  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized controlled trial tests how digital health monitoring with financial
      incentives (DFI) and community health worker (CHW) support may affect how a person manages
      their diabetes. Participants will be randomized to one of three arms: 1) DFI intervention, 2)
      hybrid DFI/CHW intervention, or 3) usual care. Investigators hypothesize that compared to
      usual care and DFI alone, the hybrid intervention will lead to more glucose self-monitoring
      and greater improvements in glycosylated hemoglobin.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Low-income Americans struggle to stay healthy in the face of real-life challenges such as
      housing insecurity or trauma. Two interventions show promise for promoting behavior change
      and improving health outcomes: digital health interventions coupled with financial incentives
      (DFI) and community health workers (CHWs). Yet, these interventions have limitations; DFI
      interventions have low uptake and high attrition among vulnerable populations, while CHW
      interventions are relatively resource intensive.

      Investigators propose a 24-week randomized trial of a hybrid DFI/CHW intervention among a
      population of 150 low-income patients with diabetes. Participants will be randomized to one
      of three arms: 1) DFI intervention, 2) hybrid DFI/CHW intervention, 3) usual care.
      Participants assigned to DFI will receive a free wireless glucometer and be eligible for a
      lottery incentive if they use their glucometer. Participants assigned to the hybrid DFI/CHW
      intervention will receive the same glucometer and incentives. If they exhibit low adherence
      to self-monitoring or poor glucose control, they will also receive support from a CHW who
      would help patients to address underlying socioeconomic barriers and cope with setbacks.
      Investigators hypothesize that compared to usual care and DFI alone, the hybrid intervention
      will lead to more glucose self-monitoring and greater improvements in glycosylated
      hemoglobin.

    <description>Participants will receive a free wireless glucometer on the day of enrollment if they don't already have one. To encourage habit formation, for the first 6 weeks of the trial, participants will be eligible for a daily lottery incentive for every day that they use their glucometer. Investigators will use an approach similar to what we have used in prior DFI trials: the lottery will provide infrequent large payoffs (a 1 in 100 chance of a US$50 reward) and more frequent small payoffs (an 18 in 100 chance of a US $5 reward). Participants who draw the winning lottery number, but did not check their glucose the day prior will receive an automated text or e-mail message informing them what earnings they would have won had they used their glucometer. After 6 weeks, investigators will terminate the lottery but continue to monitor patients' adherence to glucose self-monitoring.</description>

    <description>Participants in the hybrid intervention will receive a wireless glucometer if they don't already have one and financial incentives just as in the DFI intervention. However, any individuals who have low adherence (no self-monitoring) or elevated glucose readings (&gt;300 mg/dL) for &gt;30% of days over any 2 week period in the first 12 weeks of the study will be assigned to receive ongoing community health worker (CHW) support for the duration of the 24-week study period.</description>

    <intervention_name>IMPaCT Community Health Worker</intervention_name>
    <description>Once a CHW receives notification of a struggling patient, the CHW will visit the patient at their home within 1-2 days to initiate the IMPaCT intervention.
Elements of the standard IMPaCT intervention: During the first home visit, the CHW will use an in-depth semi-structured interview guide to get to know patients holistically and assess for unmet socioeconomic needs. This allows patients to express goals in line with their own needs and preferences. These individualized goals will become the basis for tailored action plans. The CHW will then provide hands-on, tailored support for the remainder of the 24-week study period to help patients achieve their goals.
Additional elements to help patients cope with failure: In this study, we will test a refined version of IMPaCT that incorporates two behavioral techniques for coping with failure: positive affect induction and attribution retraining.</description>
