  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Phonak Hearing Systems pass through different development and study stages. At an early
      stage, feasibility studies are conducted to investigate new algorithms, features and
      functions in an isolated manner. If the benefit is proven, their performance is then
      investigated regarding interdependency between all available algorithms, features and
      functions running in parallel in a hearing aid (pivotal/pre-validation studies) and, as a
      result, they get optimized. Afterwards, and prior to product launch, the Phonak Hearing
      Systems undergo a final quality control in terms of clinical trials. This is a pre-validation
      study, investigating optimized algorithms, features, functions and wearing comfort. This will
      be a clinical evaluation which will be conducted mono centric at Sonova AG Headquarters based
      in Stäfa (Switzerland).

    <textblock>
      In this study one CE-labeled Phonak Receiver-in-the-canal (RIC) devices is investigated. The
      experimental device will be investigated regarding Sound Quality perception ot the T-Coil
      program. A secondary objective of this study is the investigation of the Overall system
      stability in daily life situations. The experimental device contains direct connectivity
      functionality and a T-Coil. The combination of a wireless chip for Bluetooth streaming and a
      T-Coil in one housing can cause audible artifacts on the T-Coil, which shall be investigated
      within this study. This will be a clinical evaluation which will be conducted mono centric at
      Sonova AG Headquarters based in Stäfa (Switzerland).

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Subjective perception of the T-Coil Sound Quality</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The primary objective of this study is to measure that the overall sound Quality of the T-Coil program [subjective satisfaction rating on a scale from 0%-100% in 1% steps] of the investigational device is rated as at least as 60% or better [60% is the border between 'ok' and 'satisfied'] after a test period with daily life situations.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Program switch-back workflow into T-Coil program</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The number of incorrect switch-back occurences will be measured under laboratory conditions. A switch-back workflow is defined as the correct (re)activation of the T-Coil program, after an automatic program change into a streaming program. Due to an incoming phone call or due a start of audio streaming via Bluetooth, the investigational device will automatically switch into a streaming program. As soon as the Bluetooth stream stops, the investigation device must automatically toggle back into the T-Coil program (switch-back workflow).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Observation of the system stability</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Another objective of this study is the monitoring of the system stability during daily life situations. The investigational device will be worn for 4 weeks in home trial. Each investigational device will track the system stability in the background (unnoticeable for the HI-wearer). A log file of the system stability can be read out by the investigator. The system stability will be calculated by the amount of tracked system artefacts in relation to the overall wearing time. System artefacts are not or only hardly noticeable for the HI wearer, so that these system artefacts can only be tracked by reading out the data logging of the investigational device.</description>

    <measure>Sound Quality rating of T-Coil program under lab conditions</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Another objective is the subjective perception of the Sound Quality of the T-Coil under laboratory condition. Subjects will rate the perceived Sound Quality of an audio file streamed via T-Coil on a scale from 'not at all' to 'excellent'.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Subjective perception of audio artefacts in T-Coil program</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Another objective is to count the number of reports from subjects regarding audible artefacts in the T-Coil program after a home trial phase of 4 weeks. Audible artefacts are defined as any disturbing unnatural sounds which interfere with a streamed signal via T-Coil. Artefacts will be noted on a client questionnaire.</description>
