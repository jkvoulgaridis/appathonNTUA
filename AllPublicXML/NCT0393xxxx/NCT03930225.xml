    <description>Of the 30 items included in the PANSS, 7 constitute a Positive Scale, 7 a Negative Scale, and the remaining 16 a General Psychopathology Scale. The scores for these scales are arrived at by summation of ratings across component items. Therefore, the potential ranges are 7 to 49 for the Positive and Negative Scales, and 16 to 112 for the General Psychopathology Scale. In addition to these measures, a Composite Scale is scored by subtracting the negative score from the positive score. This yields a bipolar index that ranges from -42 to +42, which is essentially a difference score reflecting the degree of predominance of one syndrome in relation to the other.</description>
