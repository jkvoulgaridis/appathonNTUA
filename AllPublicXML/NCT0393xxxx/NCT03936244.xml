      The study is a randomized controlled trial with 3-year follow-up comparing intra, peri and
      postoperative outcomes (efficacy, complications and sequelae) for plasmakinetic transurethral
      resection of prostate (PK-TURP) and monopolar transurethral resection of prostate (M-TURP) in
      the treatment of LUTS due to BPH in a tertiary-care public institution

    <description>The M-TURP procedure requires the use of a resectoscope (Olympus or Storz, 26Ch), camera system and irrigation fluid (Glycine al 1.5%, Baxter). The system consists of a generator unit (ForceTriadTM, Medtronic) and a stainless steel loop with an electrical current running through the loop used to cut (120W) prostate tissue and cauterize (80W). Prostate tissue is cut away in small pieces and removed at the end of the procedure using an Ellik evacuator</description>
