  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess the pharmacokinetics (PK), mass balance, metabolite profiles, and
      rates and routes of elimination of [14C] omaveloxolone and derived metabolites following
      administration as a single 150 mg (containing approximately 90 µCi) dose to healthy male
      subjects.
