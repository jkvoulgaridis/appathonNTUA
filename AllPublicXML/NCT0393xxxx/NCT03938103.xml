  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will compare the effectiveness and cost of Basic and Enhanced delivery models for
      Go NAPSACC on child care centers' use of evidence-based nutrition and physical activity
      practices. Technical assistance (TA) coaches from Child Care Aware of Kentucky will lead
      delivery. Half of the TA coaches will deliver Go NAPSACC using the Basic model and the other
      half will deliver the program using the Enhanced model. It is hypothesized that the Enhanced
      model will result in greater use of evidence-based nutrition and physical activity practices
      and will also be more cost effective.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study will use a type 3 hybrid effectiveness-implementation design with a
      randomized controlled trial to evaluate the impact of Go NAPSACC when using basic vs enhanced
      implementation models (i.e., Basic Go NAPSACC vs. Enhanced Go NAPSACC). To evaluate impact,
      measures collected at baseline and post-intervention will be used to assess change in
      centers' use of evidence-based nutrition and physical activity practices. Cost of delivery
      will also be monitored throughout implementation. Study participants will include 25 TA
      coaches from Child Care Aware of Kentucky and 97 child care centers from 4 regions of central
      Kentucky.

      RECRUITMENT: First, TA coaches will attend an orientation session where they will be
      introduced to the research study and their roles both as study participants and
      implementation partners. If they agree to participate, they will be asked to sign consent. TA
      coaches will then be trained on how to introduce the research study to child care centers
      using provided recruitment materials. They will be instructed to target these efforts toward
      a randomly selected list of centers (drawn from their current caseload) provided by the
      research team. Coaches will be responsible for gauging initial interest of centers, and
      relaying that information to the research team. Research staff will follow up directly with
      all centers who express initial interest to confirm eligibility and interest, review study
      details,and answer questions. Once a center director's eligibility and interest is confirmed,
      the research team will work with the director to recruit a randomly selected 3-4-year-old
      classroom teacher and at least three 3-4-year-old children from that classroom.

      BASELINE MEASURES: Several measures will be collected at baseline on centers, children,
      directors, teachers, and TA coaches using a combination of observation, physical assessments,
      and self-report surveys. Most measures will be collected during a 1-day site visit conducted
      with each center by a trained research team member. Measures will assess centers' use of
      evidence-based nutrition and physical activity practices, children's dietary intakes and
      physical activity while at child care, and children's height and weight. Demographic
      information will be captured through surveys completed by parents, directors, teachers, and
      TA coaches. Implementation context will be captured through surveys completed by directors,
      teachers, and TA coaches.

      RANDOMIZATION: Once all baseline measures with centers are scheduled, TA coaches will be
      randomly assigned to either deliver Basic or Enhanced Go NAPSACC with their enrolled centers.

      INTERVENTION ARMS: Go NAPSACC is a suite of online tools designed to help child care programs
      improve their nutrition and physical activity practices. TA coaches will support centers' use
      of Go NAPSACC using either a Basic or Enhanced implementation model.

      TA coaches assigned to Basic Go NAPSACC will participate in 2 hour-long trainings and a
      homework assignment. Trainings will cover the role of child care programs in shaping
      children's eating and physical activity behaviors, Go NAPSACC's 5-step improvement, and the
      tools available for child care programs and TA coaches to support their work. TA coaches
      assigned to Enhanced Go NAPSACC will participate in 4 hour-long training sessions and a
      homework assignment. In addition to the topics listed above, trainings will also introduce
      elements unique to the enhanced implementation model. During implementation, these TA coaches
      will also participate in monthly conference calls and 2-3 one-on-one coaching sessions with a
      Go NAPSACC specialist .

      For centers receiving Basic Go NAPSACC, center directors will be invited by their TA coach to
      register for Go NAPSACC accounts. The director will receive a 1-hour orientation from their
      TA coach on how to use Go NAPSACC's online tools and resources. Once trained, the director
      will complete 2 cycles of Go NAPSACC's 5-step improvement process focusing on child nutrition
      and physical activity. A cycle of Go NAPSACC includes completing nutrition and physical
      activity self-assessments, choosing at least 6 goals (3 goals per self-assessment), creating
      an action plan for each goal, working to implement the action plans drawing from the tips and
      materials resource library, and logging progress and completion of goals. Each cycle will
      take approximately 6 months to complete. At the end of the 12 months, the director will
      retake the self-assessments on child nutrition and physical activity. Throughout the 12
      months, the director will receive brief monthly check-ins from their TA coach. TA coaches
      will log their implementation activities using the TA Activity Log in Go NAPSACC.

      For centers receiving Enhanced Go NAPSACC, center directors will work with their TA coach to
      identify an implementation team that will contribute to Go NAPSACC efforts. Before starting
      Go NAPSACC, the team will work with their TA coach to conduct an assessment of their center's
      needs, capacity, and resources. A needs assessment survey will be completed by various center
      staff and scored by the TA coach. Summarized results will be presented and discussed with the
      team to identify priority issues the team would like extra support from the TA coach as they
      work through Go NAPSACC. Once this needs assessment is complete, the team will begin using Go
      NAPSACC and with support from their TA coach will create a 12-month plan to guide their Go
      NAPSACC efforts. Similar to those assigned to Basic Go NAPSACC, the team will complete 2
      cycles of the 5-step improvement process focusing on nutrition and physical activity. They
      will follow the same steps described above. Additionally, the team will receive brief
      check-ins with tailored support from their TA coach. Further, their TA coach will host 2-3
      one-hour meetings with different centers from the same region so that teams can reflect on
      their efforts and share lessons learned. TA coaches will be asked to log all of their
      implementation activities using the TA Activity Log in Go NAPSACC.

      POST-INTERVENTION MEASURES: Measures will be repeated following 12 months of Go NAPSACC
      participation. Given the high turn-over in child enrollment over a 1-year period, parent and
      child recruitment will need to be repeated. Data collection procedures will be the same as
      those used above. In addition, trained research staff will complete phone interviews with a
      random selection of TA coaches to gather feedback about their experiences implementing Go
      NAPSACC. Phone interviews will also be completed with randomly selected center directors and
      when relevant, members of the implementation teams.

    <time_frame>Measures collected throughout the 1 year intervention period</time_frame>
    <description>Costs of implementation include TA coaches time and any resources required to train and support centers for 12 months. Cost tracking will use the TA Activity Log to capture TA coaches' time and TA coaches will be asked to fill out a supplemental log of additional costs (e.g., mileage, printing). These data will be combined to calculate the total cost per center for implementing Go NAPSACC. Average cost per center for basic and enhanced implementation models will also be calculated. To explore the cost-effectiveness of basic and enhanced implementation models, these data will be combined with data on the change in nutrition and physical activity environment scores to calculate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (average incremental cost of delivering Enhanced Go NAPSACC relative to Basic Go NAPSACC divided by the average incremental change in effectiveness from delivering Enhanced Go NAPSACC relative to Basic Go NAPSACC).</description>
