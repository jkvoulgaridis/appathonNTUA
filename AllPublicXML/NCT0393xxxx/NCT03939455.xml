  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Because adolescents and young adults face markedly increased HIV risk yet frequently do not
      test, we propose to complete the Mobile Augmented Screening (MAS) tool designed to increase
      HIV testing, and to facilitate linkage to care and ongoing prevention education. This tool
      will help clinicians address undiagnosed youth HIV, and enable young patients to receive much
      needed treatment and avoid unknowingly transmitting infection. Our product is designed to
      help existing program staff reach an increased number of clients; and to improve public
      health by encouraging reluctant young patients to accept important HIV testing and care they
      may otherwise decline.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Our randomized trial will evaluate HIV test rates among participants who complete a
      tablet-based intervention, the Mobile Augmented Screening tool (MAS), compared to
      participants in a treatment as usual (TAU) condition.

      Research staff will approach 350 emergency department (ED) patients aged 13 - 24 years.
      Participants will be randomized into the intervention or TAU condition. Participants will be
      randomized in a 1:1 ratio to the intervention or TAU condition, stratified by patient age
      (13-17 and 18-24). Within each of these age strata, permuted blocks randomization with
      varying block sizes will be employed to ensure balance and concealment of allocations prior
      to randomization.

      Participants who are randomized into the intervention condition will watch a 5-minute video
      on a tablet computer, and the tablet will ask intervention participants if they would like an
      HIV test. Possible responses will be &quot;Yes&quot; or &quot;No&quot;. Participants who are randomized into TAU
      will be offered HIV tests by research staff. All participants in both conditions who agree to
      HIV testing will be tested by hospital staff in the location where they are receiving
      treatment. All participants who test will receive their results in person from ED staff
      before discharge.

      The primary trial outcome will be percentages of patients, by treatment group, who test for
      HIV.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Emergency Department patients aged 13 - 24 years will be eligible for the study if they
        are:

          -  awake

          -  able to provide consent as determined by ED staff

          -  understand written and spoken English

          -  not intoxicated

          -  not known to be HIV positive

          -  not a prisoner

          -  have not already agreed to test for HIV during their current ED visit (this will
             include patients who decline HIV testing offered by hospital staff and patients who
             are not yet offered HIV testing; potential differences in test rates among
             participants who decline vs. those who have not previously been offered an HIV test
             will be explored as a secondary outcome)

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Exclusion criteria include patients who are prisoners, patients who are asleep/unconscious,
        unable to provide consent as determined by ED staff, do not understand written and spoken
        English, are intoxicated, are known to be HIV positive, have already agreed to an HIV test
        during their current ED visit, have been categorized by ED staff as altered mental status
        or are presenting to the ED for a psychiatric problem. Additionally, the proposed research
        will exclude patients if medical records indicate hospital staff have categorized the
        patient as most urgently in need of medical care.
