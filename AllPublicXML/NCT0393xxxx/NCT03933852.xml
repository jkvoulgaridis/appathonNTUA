  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Additional information is needed to characterize the safety profile of ponatinib as it is
      used in routine clinical practice in Europe. This observational cohort study will provide a
      real‐life picture of ponatinib use in clinical practice and additional quantification and
      characterization of adverse events (AEs) and their outcomes in patients with Chronic Myeloid
      Leukemia in any phase treated with ponatinib.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a multicentre, long‐term, prospective and retrospective, observational cohort
      study of patients who are treated with ponatinib. The study is non‐interventional; all
      Treatment decisions are made at the discretion of the patient's healthcare provider (HCP) and
      are not mandated by the study design or protocol.

      A heterogeneous sample of oncology practice sites in Germany (both Hospitals and Field based
      Haematologists) treating adult patients with Chronic Myeloid Leukemia in any phase using
      ponatinib will be selected for participation in the study. Eligible, consenting patients
      initiating treatment with ponatinib will be enrolled into the prospective part of the study.
      Eligible consenting patients with Chronic Myeloid Leukemia in any Phase that have initiated
      ponatinib outside clinical trial after its approval in Germany will be enrolled in the
      retrospective part of the study.

      Approximately 100 patients will be enrolled from approximately 50 sites. The patient
      enrolment period is estimated to be approximately two years. Patients who experience an
      Adverse Event (AE) during treatment or within the 30 days post discontinuation will be
      followed for 12 months to determine the consequences of the Adverse Event. Data on patient's
      history, patient's data at baseline, ponatinib treatment, Adverse Events, all medications
      received, and efficacy measures will be collected during the study in conjunction with
      routine care visits, anticipated to be approximately every 3 months.

      Information on any new therapies, including treatment for Chronic Myeloid Leukemia and other
      medications will be collected during follow‐up.

        The study will include patients with Chronic Myeloid Leukemia in any phase that are
        initiating or have initiated treatment with ponatinib and who meet the enrolment criteria
        and provide informed consent. A group of patients, for whom the decision of starting
        ponatinib has already been made, but in whom ponatinib has not yet been started, will be
        identified prospectively and invited to enrol into the study. The study enrolment date is
        the date the informed consent is signed. An additional group of patients who have received
        or are receiving ponatinib treatment outside clinical trials will be invited to join the
        retrospective part of the study.

             been made prior to enrolment in the study. Patients enrolled in the retrospective part
             of the study may or may not be still on ponatinib treatment at the time informed
             consent is given. These retrospective patients should have started Treatment after
             02.02.2015.].
