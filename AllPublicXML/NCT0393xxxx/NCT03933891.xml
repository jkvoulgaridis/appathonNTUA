      Portal hypertension is the end-stage fatal complications of liver cirrhosis. Decompensated
      cirrhosis patients can pass through transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt to
      effectively prevent bleeding and refractory ascites. However, the occurrence of hepatic
      encephalopathy and liver function failure, infection, bleeding again are main lethality
      postoperative complications after TIPS. The accurate TIPS shunt is necessary to reduce the
      incidence of complications and improve the patients' survival rate and survival quality.

      postoperative hemodynamic change and is also the most important the predictors of
      decompensation and varicose vein bleeding of liver cirrhosis. Whether there is a kind of

      patients.

      Portal hypertension is the end-stage fatal complications of liver cirrhosis. Decompensated
      cirrhosis patients can pass through transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt to
      effectively prevent bleeding and refractory ascites. However, the occurrence of hepatic
      encephalopathy and liver function failure, infection, bleeding again are main lethality
      postoperative complications after TIPS. The accurate TIPS shunt is necessary to reduce the
      incidence of complications and improve the patients' survival rate and survival quality.
      Hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) is standard to evaluate TIPS preoperative and
      postoperative hemodynamic change and is also the most important the predictors of
      decompensation and varicose vein bleeding of liver cirrhosis. Whether there is a kind of
      noninvasive monitoring method can guide TIPS accurate shunt and evaluate the prognosis of
      patients.

      Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has a high soft tissue resolution, time and spatial
      resolution, abdominal MRI can noninvasively, dynamically detect the liver, spleen, portal
      system functions, the changes of portal system hemodynamics, blood supply of liver tissue,
      perfusion and liver cell function, etc. Magnetic resonance 4D-flow imaging, can accurately
      measure the portal vein system blood vessels and shunt channels, blood volume, flow velocity
      parameters of blood flow can be detected. Recent studies have confirmed that the 4D-flow
      technology can accurately, long-term follow-up monitoring TIPS preoperative, postoperative
      portal vein blood flow, which have better sensitivity and more accurate than ultrasound to
      detect blood flow. Magnetic resonance perfusion imaging of the liver can quantitatively
      obtain liver tissue microcirculation status, monitor portal vein and hepatic artery blood
      perfusion, the liver perfusion has a significant correlation with Child-Pugh score and degree
      of liver fibrosis and cirrhosis of the liver. Compared with the traditional magnetic
      resonance imaging contrast agents, liver specific contrast agents have small renal toxicity,
      uptake by liver cell specificity, recent studies have found that magnetic resonance imaging
      with liver cell specificity contrast agents have significantly correlated with the stage of
      fibrosis of the liver and liver function, and has been used in the clinical staging of liver
      fibrosis and early detection of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Magnetic resonance
      elastography (MRE) is a new imaging technology in recent years and a unique image method. As
      a noninvasive and quantitative method to detect elastic properties of the organ. Plenty of
      research results showed that in patients with liver cirrhosis, liver and spleen of elasticity
      have significant correlation with the degree of portal hypertension. So far, a variety of
      functional imaging methods grade and guide prognosis of patients with cirrhosis, which have
      been confirmed to have significant clinical value. MRE has been written for the latest
      diagnosis and treatment of portal hypertension guidelines.

      In order to analyze the liver function and survival of liver cirrhosis patients after
      transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt, advanced magnetic resonance techniques are
      used before and after transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt. Researchers will combine
      a variety of advanced magnetic resonance imaging technology, long-term and dynamic monitor
      TIPS preoperative and postoperative liver function, blood flow, perfusion, the change of
      tissue elasticity, and analysis the incidence of hepatic encephalopathy, hemorrhage, hepatic
      failure and survival rate with MRI changes. Finally, Researchers will develop a new
      predictive index, guide TIPS precision shunts, evaluate a variety of the value of imaging
      technology in the application of patients with TIPS to find the most sensitive technology,
      and discover the correlation between MRI function parameters with patient's survival. In
      order to analyze the liver function and survival of liver cirrhosis patients after
      transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt, advanced magnetic resonance techniques are
      used to evaluate liver function, blood flow, elasticity, perfusion of before and after
      transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt.
