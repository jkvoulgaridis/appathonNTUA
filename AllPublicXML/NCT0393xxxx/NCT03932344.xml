      The purpose of the study is to evaluate and characterize long-term safety of Kineret when
      used in standard clinical practice to treat patients with systemic juvenile idiopathic
      arthritis (SJIA). The study will be based on already available data from the Pharmachild
      juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) registry which holds the European Network of Centers for
      Pharmacoepidemiology and Pharmacovigilance (ENCePP) study seal.

      This is an international, non-interventional, single-armed, pharmacovigilance registry study
      on long-term safety of Kineret utilizing already available data from the ENCePP certified
      Pharmachild JIA registry.

      The Paediatric Rheumatology International Trials Organisation (PRINTO) is a non-profit,
      non-governmental, international research network with the goal to foster, facilitate and
      co-ordinate the development, conduct, analysis, and reporting of multi-centers, international
      clinical trials and/or outcome standardization studies in children with paediatric rheumatic
      diseases.

      The Pharmachild JIA registry, maintained by PRINTO, is a registry collecting data from
      patients with JIA including patients with SJIA. In the Pharmachild JIA registry 40 countries
      are participating of which 15 countries have collected data on Kineret treatment.

      This study includes secondary use of data already available in the Pharmachild JIA registry.
