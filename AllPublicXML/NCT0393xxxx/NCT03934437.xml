  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pragmatic randomized controlled study comparing the Baltimore City Health
      Department's (BCHD) existing linkage to care (LTC) service to an mHealth-enhanced linkage to
      care and retention (mLTCR) protocol.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Baltimore's HIV prevalence rate (586/100,000) is among the top 5 in metropolitan areas in the
      US, and disparities are profound. African Americans have an HIV prevalence that is 5 times
      higher than among whites, and account for 78% of all HIV cases. Latinxs also have a higher
      prevalence of HIV than whites and are at the highest risk for late HIV diagnosis among all
      racial/ethnic groups. In addition, HIV viral load suppression, which is the best predictor of
      long-term survival among HIV-infected patients, is substantially lower among minority
      populations in Baltimore.

      The hypothesis of this study is that a health department-driven mHealth-enhanced Linkage to
      Care and Retention (mLTCR) intervention can improve HIV outcomes among HIV-infected African
      Americans and Latinxs compared to standard Baltimore City Health Department linkage to care
      protocols. The mLTCR intervention consists of two smartphone applications (app), one for
      patients and one for linkage officers (who are members of the community), to help facilitate
      communication. Communication will focus on issues related to HIV care (e.g. appointment
      scheduling, medication reminders, refills, transportation), as well as patient-directed
      requests. Using HIV surveillance data (e.g. unsuppressed HIV viral load), linkage officers
      will be automatically alerted if a patient has a high viral load and prompted to contact the
      patient. In addition to appointment and medication reminders, patients will receive positive
      reinforcement behavioral text messages.

      This is a pragmatic randomized controlled study comparing the Baltimore City Health
      Department's (BCHD) existing linkage to care (LTC) service to an mHealth-enhanced linkage to
      care and retention (mLTCR) protocol.

      According to modelling studies, improvement in linkage and retention in care indicators is
      the single most important component to achieve the 2020 National HIV/AIDS Strategy targets
      and substantially reduce the burden of HIV in the United States. The results of this
      randomized study will contribute to the evidence on the effectiveness of mHealth-enhanced
      LTCR initiatives implemented by the local health department. Evidence supporting the
      feasibility and effectiveness of this intervention will be important for the BCHD and other
      health departments to allocate limited resources to address the HIV epidemic in the
      jurisdictions. The information will also be relevant to Ryan White officials responsible for
      allocating federal dollars to support clinical and ancillary services to improve HIV
      outcomes, particularly among patients who are uninsured or underinsured.
