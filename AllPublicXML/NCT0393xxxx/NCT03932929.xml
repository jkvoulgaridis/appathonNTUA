  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this clinical trial was to evaluate and compare the performance of a universal
      adhesive with different adhesive strategies in the restoration of non-carious cervical
      lesions (NCCLs) over a 36-month period.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One hundred sixty-five NCCLs in 35 patients (13 female, 22 male) with at least 3 lesions were
      included in this study. Three groups were formed according to adhesive strategies used
      (n=55): selective-etch mode; etch-and-rinse mode (ER); or self-etch (SE) mode of a universal
      adhesive, Single Bond Universal. The same nanofilled resin composite, Filtek Ultimate was
      used for all restorations by a single operator. The restorations were evaluated by two
      calibrated examiners at baseline and at 6-, 12-, 18-, 24- and 36- months in accordance with
      the modified USPHS criteria. The Chi-square test was used for intergroup, the Cochran Q test
      was used for intragroup comparison.
