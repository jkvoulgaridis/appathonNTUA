  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Generalized aggressive periodontitis (GAgP) is a multifactorial disease related to several
      aspects that influence its installation and progression. A constant microbial colonization,
      an altered inflammatory response, and a clear genetic factor are cited as possible factors
      associated with this pathology. Thus, aggressive periodontitis subjects could transmit for
      their descendants some genetical alterations, such as inflammatory response pattern
      associated with periodontal destruction and susceptibility to colonization by some pathogens,
      increasing the risk of develops this disease. This way, this project is aimed to evaluate the
      pattern of microbiological colonization and the inflammatory response pattern associated with
      it, comparing parents with generalized aggressive periodontitis and their children and
      periodontally healthy parents and their children. Thirty families will be selected and
      divided into two groups: Test group (n=15 families) families in which the parents (or at
      least one of them) present generalized aggressive periodontitis and one child (age ranging
      from 6-12 years old); Control group (n=15 families) families in which the parents (both of
      them) present periodontal healthy and one child (age ranging from 6-12 years old). The groups
      will be composed using a gender- and age-matched structure. The children will participate in
      a hygiene program and will be monitored for 3 months. All individuals (parents and children)
      will be clinically assessed for plaque and bleeding index, periodontal probing depth,
      clinical attachment level and gingival recession. During this period, samples of gingival
      crevicular fluid (GCF) and subgingival biofilm from periodontal pockets/sites from all
      subject (parents and children) will be collected. The GCF will be analyzed and the detection
      of interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-17, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, and
      interferon (INF)-γ will be done using Luminex/MAGpix technology. In a subgingival biofilm,
      the DNA will be extracted and the microbiome and its functional characteristics will be
      evaluated by metagenomics and bioinformatics analysis. The data will be compared by Student's
      t-test, Mann-Whitney e Wilcoxon tests. The significance level for all analysis will be 5%.
