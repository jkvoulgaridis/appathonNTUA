  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators aim to determine the association of dietary intake on cardiovascular
      disease risk factors among children with overweight and obesity who are being evaluated for
      elevated blood pressure.

      The investigators will also investigate for predictors of vascular function and determine if
      predictors vary by level of sodium intake.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research is being done to determine if the food or salt eaten can cause arteries to be
      stiffer and/or not work as well and if it can impact blood pressure over a 24-hour period of
      time. The investigators also want to determine if there are any risk factors or blood tests
      that can predict how stiff arteries are or how well arteries function. The investigators hope
      that the information from this study will help the investigators prevent blood
      pressure-related cardiovascular disease in children. This knowledge could help shape future
      guidelines on how to best prevent and treat high blood pressure and heart disease in
      children.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Arterial stiffness as assessed by Pulse wave velocity</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>This will be determined from Pulse wave velocity (m/sec) done at the study visit</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Arterial stiffness as assessed by Ambulatory Arterial Stiffness Index (AASI)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>The Ambulatory Arterial Stiffness Index will be determined from data obtained from vascular measures and during 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. Arterial stiffness increases as the regression slope approaches 0 and the AASI approaches 1.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Arterial stiffness as assessed by Augmentation Index</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>The Augmentation Index (measured as a percentage) will be determined from a vascular assessment and data obtained during 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. A greater Augmentation Index represents a stiffer, less compliant vessel.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Endothelial function as assessed by Laser Doppler flow perfusion</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>The percent change in mean blood flow will be determined from Laser Doppler flow perfusion measurements obtained using a heating protocol.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Blood pressure (mmHg)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>Mean daytime systolic blood pressure in millimeters of mercury (mmHg) will be determined from 24-hour blood pressure monitoring.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pediatric Adverse Childhood Events (ACEs) score</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>The Pediatric ACEs questionnaire contains 17 yes or no questions about stressful or traumatic life events. Greater exposure to adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) is associated with poorer physical and mental health. Some researchers have suggested that an ACEs score of greater than or equal to 3 or 4 significantly increases the risk for health problems, however, there is no widely accepted threshold for how many ACEs endorsed is clinically significant or more predictive of these problems.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Children's Emotion Management Scale (CEMS) score</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>The Children's Emotional management scale is a questionnaire that consists of 33 questions (3 point Likert scale) examining youth's ability to regulate appropriately their negative emotions (i.e. anger, sadness, and worry). Generally, poorer emotion regulation capabilities are associated with poorer health outcomes, with most research looking at CV outcomes in adults.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Behavior Assessment for Children (BASC) score</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>The Behavior Assessment for Children is a questionnaire that consists of 189 questions (True/False and 4 point Likert scale). It is a broad behavioral screening measure commonly used in child and adolescent psychology and psychiatric settings.It has three primary scales: internalizing (e.g., depression, anxiety), externalizing (e.g., aggression, hyperactivity), and total problems (combination of internalizing and externalizing plus attention problems and withdrawal subscales). Scores between 60-69 are considered &quot;at risk&quot; for clinical problems and scores of 70+ are considered clinically significant presence of those symptoms. Any scores that are not in this range are considered to be within normal limits and not indicative of difficulties.</description>
