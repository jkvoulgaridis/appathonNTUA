  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this trial is to assess the effect of BI 409306 on the QT/QTc
      interval in healthy male and female volunteers as measured by the QTcF change from baseline
      compared with placebo.

      Secondary objectives are to show the assay sensitivity of the trial, by reproducing the
      typical effect of the positive control moxifloxacin on the QT/QTc interval, and to assess the
      effect of BI 409306 on heart rate.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy male or female subjects according to the assessment of the investigator, based
             on a complete medical history including a physical examination, vital signs (Blood
             Pressure (BP), Pulse Rate (PR)), 12-lead single Electrocardiogram (ECG) and 12-lead
             Holter Electrocardiogram (ECG), and clinical laboratory tests

          -  Age of 18 to 50 years (incl.)

          -  Body mass index (BMI) of 18.5 to 29.9 kg/m2 (incl.)

             accordance with Good clinical practice (GCP) and local legislation

          -  Male subjects, or female subjects who meet any of the following criteria starting from
             at least 30 days before the first administration of trial medication and until 30 days
             after trial completion:

               -  Use of adequate contraception, e.g. non-hormonal intrauterine device plus condom

               -  Sexually abstinent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any finding in the medical examination (including Blood Pressure (BP), Pulse Rate (PR)
             or Electrocardiogram (ECG)) is deviating from normal and judged as clinically relevant
             by the investigator

          -  Repeated measurement of systolic blood pressure outside the range of 100 to 140 mmHg,
             diastolic blood pressure outside the range of 50 to 90 mmHg, or pulse rate outside the

          -  Any laboratory value outside the reference range that the investigator considers to be
             of clinical relevance

          -  Any evidence of a concomitant disease judged as clinically relevant by the
             investigator

          -  Gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal, respiratory, cardiovascular, metabolic,
             immunological or hormonal disorders

          -  Cholecystectomy and/or surgery of the gastrointestinal tract that could interfere with
             the pharmacokinetics of the trial medication (except appendectomy and simple hernia
             repair)

          -  Diseases of the central nervous system (including but not limited to any kind of
             seizures or stroke), and other relevant neurological or psychiatric disorders

          -  History of relevant orthostatic hypotension, fainting spells, or blackouts

          -  Chronic or relevant acute infections
