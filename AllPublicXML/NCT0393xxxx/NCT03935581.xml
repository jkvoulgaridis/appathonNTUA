    <textblock>
      This clinical investigation is a feasibility study designed to evaluate the safety and
      feasibility of the ExAblate Neuro system to perform AF echo imaging in patients diagnosed
      with idiopathic Essential Tremor. during the standard care procedure for ET, patients will be
      injected with Definity microbubbles which will enable the ExAblate Neuro system to perform
      the AF imaging.
