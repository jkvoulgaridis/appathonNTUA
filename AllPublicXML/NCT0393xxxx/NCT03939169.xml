  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Out of the most commonly performed procedures in neonates, naso-gastric tube insertion is
      rated as the fifth most painful. The pain is often under estimated due to the frequency with
      which the procedure is carried out. It has been shown that the environment in which the
      procedure is performed (e.g with skin to skin contact and specific positioning), reduces the
      discomfort felt by the newborn. However, this has not yet been proven with regards to
      naso-gastric tube insertion.

      Our clinical study (carried out in the Neonatology Unit of Mercy Regional Hospital) has shown
      that when positioning and other non drug related analgesic techniques are used, newborns
      undergoing naso-gastric tube insertion feel less pain.

      Several different techniques were used, such as skin-to-skin contact with the mother and/or
      positioning the infant using appropriate equipment, or the &quot;four hands&quot; technique carried out
      by two health care professionals.

      Neonatal unit staff were able to choose the method used depending on whether the mother was
      present at the time of the procedure.

      In cases where the mother was absent, the &quot;four hands technique&quot; was favored, but in the
      presence of the mother skin-to-skin contact was preferable.

    <description>Evaluation of the newborn's pain during insertion of the naso-gastric tube using the Premature Infant Pain Profile (PIPP) scale. The PIPP consists of 3 behavioral (facial actions: brow bulge, eye squeeze, and nasolabial furrow) and 2 physiological (heart rate and oxygen saturation) indicators, and 2 contextual [gestational age (GA) and behavioral state] variables that modify pain. In the same time, the heart rate and oxygen saturation of the newborns were measured using a pulse oximeter.</description>
