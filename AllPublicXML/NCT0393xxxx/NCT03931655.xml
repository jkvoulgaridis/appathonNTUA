  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this spectroscopic photoacoustic imaging study, the investigators will acquire images
      (only) to:

        1. determine if spectroscopic photoacoustic imaging can acquire high fidelity images in a
           clinical setting,

        2. discover if blood oxygen saturation changes are observable in breast cancer patients
           during early stages of metastatic invasion, and

        3. compare the sensitivity and specificity of photoacoustic imaging with ultrasound imaging
           for the detection of lymph node metastases.

      The results from imaging will not be used in any decision making process. This study is
      solely used to test the photoacoustic imaging device and evaluate it against the current
      standard of care. The device is completely noninvasive and uses only safe levels of energy as
      determined by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and the FDA. The device does
      not pose a serious to the health, safety, or welfare of the patient.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is centered on determining whether photoacoustic imaging of blood oxygen saturation
      can detect lymph node metastases.

      Patients who are returning for an ultrasound exam after detection of a suspicious node via
      magnetic resonance imaging will be enrolled in the study.

      Enrolled patients will receive a clinical ultrasound exam, as is the current standard of
      care. Suspicious nodes will be identified and imaged with combined ultrasound and
      spectroscopic photoacoustic imaging. Measurements will be acquired with three to five
      replicates with slightly modified transducer positioning to measure system and intranodal
      variance of the measurements. One to five contralateral axillary lymph nodes will be imaged
      to serve as a control and to determine patient-to-patient variability in lymph node saturated
      oxygen. The distance from the skin to the lymph node will also be measured with ultrasound
      imaging for each node.

      If the ultrasound imaging identifies a suspicious node, patients will undergo ultrasound
      guided biopsy to confirm the true metastatic state of the nodes. Suspicious nodes will be
      clipped to facilitate identification at the time of axillary node dissection. During the
      sentinel node procedure, investigators will use intraoperative photoacoustic imaging to
      measure the blood oxygenation in the sentinel lymph node immediately prior to its removal.
      Histology will be performed on all biopsy samples and excised nodes to determine the true
      metastatic state of the node(s).

    <description>Spectroscopic photoacoustic imaging uses a laser that is pulsed for a nanosecond, applying laser light to the patient's skin. Hemoglobin and melanin absorb the laser's energy and convert it to heat, which rapidly expands local tissue and produces a broadband ultrasound wave and is detected with a clinical ultrasound transducer. Because the signal is proportional to the optical absorption in tissue, high resolution images of the lymph nodes can be acquired from the detected ultrasound waves, and can be used to measure saturated oxygen in the nodes.</description>
