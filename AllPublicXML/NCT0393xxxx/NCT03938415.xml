    <textblock>
      This study compares auricular (ear) acupuncture and body acupuncture (Koffman protocol)
      versus clinic standardized pre-vasectomy medications to determine which has better outcomes
      at improving pre-procedural anxiety and procedural pain relief and medication usage in adult
      male patients following vasectomy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will compare auricular (ear) and body acupuncture (Koffman protocol) versus
      clinic standardized pre-vasectomy medications to determine which has better outcomes at
      improving pre-procedural anxiety and procedural pain relief and medication usage in adult
      male patients following vasectomy. In this efficacy trial, the investigators hypothesize that
      acupuncture will provide therapeutic anxiety and pain relief during and after vasectomy. The
      investigators will measure anxiety immediately before and prior to the procedure and before
      and after the intervention via a standardized anxiety scale (comparative). The investigators
      will also measure pain control immediately after the procedure using Defense and Veterans
      Pain Rating Scale (DVPRS). At the post op check (2-4 days after procedure) subjects will fill
      out a patient satisfaction survey. During the recovery period over 2 weeks, a medication
      usage diary will be kept by the subject including the time when the patient returns to full
      duties.

    <measure>Change in Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) -- Medication Arm</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0 (2x)</time_frame>
    <description>The HADS is a self-rating scale developed to assess psychological distress in non-psychiatric patients. It consists of two subscales, Anxiety and Depression, each having seven items and a score range of 0 to 21. The HADS has been satisfactorily used in the general population and a number of clinical settings. A score less than 8 is considered as being normal, 8 to 10 as suggestive of anxiety or depression, and greater than 11 as being probable of anxiety or depression. The HADS score is ordinal and will be analyzed using nonparametric methods</description>

    <description>The DVPRS consists of an 11-point numerical rating scale with 0 indicating no pain and 10 indicating severe pain. It has been confirmed for reliability and validity in measuring both acute and chronic pain, and is currently the standard for pain measurement throughout DoD and VA health systems. The DVPRS has demonstrated linear scale qualities allowing parametric methods to be used</description>

Subjects who tolerate the auricular needles will be offered replacement with ASP acupuncture needles for continued pain management post-procedure.
