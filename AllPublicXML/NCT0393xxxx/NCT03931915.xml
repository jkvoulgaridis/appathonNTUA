    <textblock>
      The objective is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of TAK-385 40 mg orally administrated
      once daily for 24 weeks compared with Leuprorelin [once/4 weeks, 3.75 or 1.88 mg
      subcutaneously (SC)/time] in patients with endometriosis.

      This study is a phase III, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study to
      investigate the efficacy and safety of TAK-385 40 mg once daily compared with leuprorelin
      (once/4 weeks, 3.75 or 1.88 mg SC/time) in premenopausal subjects â‰¥ 20 years of age with
      endometriosis. 320 women with endometriosis will be enrolled in the study. This study
      consists of screening of approximately 1 to 6 weeks, run-in of approximately 3 to 6 weeks,
      treatment of 24 weeks, and follow-up of 4 weeks. After signing the informed consent form,
      subjects should record their symptoms in the electronic patient diary every day. During
      run-in period, daily data will be collected in the electronic patient diary for calculation
      of the baseline values for the efficacy evaluation.Following run-in period, subjects will
      receive investigational products (TAK-385 + leuprorelin placebo or TAK-385 placebo +
      leuprorelin) under double blind. During this study, subjects will visit the study center to
      undergo the designated examinations and evaluations at each visit. Safety will be assessed
      throughout the study by monitoring adverse events, vital signs, physical examinations,
      clinical laboratory tests, 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECG), and assessments of bone mineral
      density.Subjects will visit the study center to undergo the designated examinations and
      evaluations at 28 days after final administration.
