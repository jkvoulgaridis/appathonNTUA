  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Physioflow® is a new device for measuring cardiac output in a non-invasive way using a
      thoracic bioimpedance technique. This technique has been validated in patients in stress
      tests as well as in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) patients, in obese patients
      and in children. Very little work has been published in intensive care unit (ICU) and no
      studies have been done on hemodynamically unstable patients. The aim of this work is to
      compare the cardiac output measured by Physioflow® to the transthoracic echocardiography
      (TTE) in ventilated, sedated patients hospitalized in ICU receiving catecholamines and for
      whom the attending physician wants to evaluate the fluid responsiveness using the TTE and a
      passive leg raising maneuver (PLR).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients included will be simultaneously monitored with TTE and the Physioflow® thoracic
      electrical bioimpedance device. Cardiac output is measured by the Physioflow® Thoracic
      Bioimpedance Device and TTE before and after PLR. If the attending physician decide to
      administer fluid expansion a new set of cardiac output measurement will be performed before
      and after the volume expansion.
