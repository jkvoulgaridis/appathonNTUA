    <textblock>
      Human herpesvirus(HHV)-8-negative, idiopathic multicentric Castleman disease (iMCD) is a rare
      hematologic illness. Current therapeutic options are limited and provide benefit for only a
      subset of patients. Blockade of IL-6 signaling with siltuximab or tocilizumab abrogates
      symptoms and improves lymphadenopathy in a portion of patients. However, 66% of patients in
      the siltuximab Phase II clinical trial did not meet response criteria, and recent studies
      found that IL-6 is not significantly elevated in many iMCD patients. Recent research has
      suggested a key role for the phosphoinositide 3-kinase(PI3K)/Akt/mechanistic target of
      rapamycin (mTOR) pathway in iMCD pathogenesis and off-label administration of sirolimus, an
      mTOR inhibitor, has shown clinical activity. Based on these experiences, we plan to evaluate
      the efficacy of sirolimus as a therapy for iMCD patients who are either unable to tolerate
      anti-IL-6 blockade therapy (siltuximab or tocilizumab), or who fail, relapse, or are
      refractory to such treatment. This study is a Phase II open label study of daily
      administration of sirolimus in up to 24 evaluable male or female adults. Participants with
      iMCD who have failed previous therapy will take daily oral sirolimus for 12 months.
      Information that is collected as per standard of care will be used to review efficacy, in
      addition to samples collected specifically for research.

    <description>The CHAP scale consists of C-reactive protein (CRP), hemoglobin, albumin, and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance score, each with a subscale range of 0-4. Each criterion in the CHAP scoring system provides a graded measure for a patient's disease activity. The sum of the four scores provides an objective scale for measuring a patient's disease activity and monitoring how it changes over time (scale range 0-16). A higher score indicates greater disease activity.</description>
