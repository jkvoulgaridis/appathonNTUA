  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is widely known that physical activity is important for health and wellbeing, yet most
      Americans do not meet recommended levels of activity. People may commonly believe that only
      the actual amount of physical activity matters for health and wellbeing. However, the
      investigators propose that individuals' mindsets about the adequacy of their level of
      physical activity and its corresponding health consequences (activity adequacy mindsets)
      affect health outcomes, over and above their actual level of physical activity. In recent
      years, health technologies such as wearable fitness trackers have become popular tools to
      promote higher levels of physical activity. This study leverages the tracking and feedback
      capabilities of Apple Watch to study the effects of mindsets about physical activity on
      health and wellbeing, as well as the pathways through which these effects may occur.

      Study Overview: This study examines how individuals' mindsets about the adequacy of their
      level of physical activity and its corresponding health consequences (activity adequacy
      mindsets) affect health outcomes. Participants attend an &quot;onboarding&quot; lab session in which
      they complete physiological, cognitive, and psychological measures and receive an Apple Watch
      to wear for the following 5 weeks. The Watch is equipped with a step count tracking app. No
      step count feedback is provided in week 1 as a baseline; starting in week 2, participants are
      randomized to 4 conditions in which either 1) accurate, 2) inflated, or 3) deflated step
      count is displayed on the watch in order to manipulate participants' perceived physical
      activity, independently of their actual physical activity. In condition 4, participants
      receive a meta-mindset intervention in addition to accurate step count feedback. Throughout
      the 5 weeks, participants complete short daily surveys and longer weekly surveys administered
      online. Finally, participants come in for an &quot;offboarding&quot; lab session in which the same
      measures are collected as in the onboarding session.

      Participants: Participants will be 160 healthy adults recruited from the community, 40 per
      condition.

      Main Hypotheses: This is a largely exploratory study, examining various mechanisms through
      which activity adequacy mindsets may affect health and wellbeing. Tests include (but are not
      limited to) the following key hypotheses:

      H1) Inflated step count feedback (compared to accurate feedback) leads to a more positive
      activity adequacy mindset, and deflated feedback (compared to accurate feedback) leads to a
      more negative activity adequacy mindset (see Primary Outcome Measures).

      H2) Activity adequacy mindset influences health and wellbeing (see Primary Outcome Measures)
      over and above actual physical activity.

      H3) Activity adequacy mindset influences health and wellbeing through various mechanisms (see
      Secondary Outcome Measures):

      H3a) Affective mechanism: A more positive (vs. negative) activity adequacy mindset leads to
      more positive everyday affect (incl. higher satisfaction, lower anxiety, lower stress).
      Positive affect in turn improves health and wellbeing.

      H3b) Motivational/ behavioral mechanism: A more positive (vs. negative) activity adequacy
      mindset leads to higher motivation to exercise and improve one's health, as well as higher
      exercise self-efficacy. Higher motivation and self-efficacy in turn lead to higher levels of
      actual physical activity, which in turn improve health and wellbeing.

      H3c) Placebo mechanism: A more positive (vs. negative) activity adequacy mindset directly
      improves health and wellbeing through placebo/ nocebo effects.

      H4) A meta-mindset intervention teaching people about activity adequacy mindsets leads them
      to adopt more positive mindsets, which in turn predicts improved health and wellbeing through
      the mechanisms described under H3. That is, compared to accurate step count feedback only,
      accurate feedback plus meta-mindset intervention leads to improved health and wellbeing.

    <description>Activity Adequacy Mindset (key mediator) measured via self-report in onboarding/ offboarding surveys (7 items) and weekly surveys (shortened, 5 items). This scale ranges from 1 - 7, with higher values representing better outcomes. The items will be combined in a composite score by averaging.</description>

    <measure>Change in Physical Health Over 5 Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>5 weeks: measured at baseline (onboarding session) and end of study (offboarding session); except average daily heart rate, which is based on Apple Watch HR recordings measured approx. every 20 minutes when participant is wearing watch during the 5 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Physical Health measures are BMI (calculated from self-reported height and weight measured in lab, BMI = kg/m^2); Body fat percentage (measured on lab scale); Resting systolic and diastolic blood pressure (measured in lab); Resting heart rate (HR) (measured in lab); Average daily heart rate (measured by Apple Watch heart rate sensor); VO2max, approximated through the Canadian Home Fitness Test (based on post-exercise HR measured in lab); Perceived general health (measured via 1-item self-report); Perceived fitness (measured via 1-item self-report); Physical function and pain (measured via PROMIS-29 Profile v2.0 questionnaire). All measures will be factor analyzed and combined into a summary score (average of standardized scores weighted by variables' factor loading), provided factor analysis shows that they load onto one factor (i.e., rotated factor loadings of &gt;= |0.4|). Measures will also be analyzed separately for exploratory purposes.</description>

    <description>Anxiety, depressive symptoms, ability to participate in social roles and activities, sleep disturbance, fatigue (measured via PROMIS (Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System)-29 Profile v2.0 questionnaire), and stress (measured via Perceived Stress Scale, PSS). Each PROMIS subscale ranges from 1-5, with higher values representing better outcomes. Items will be averaged into subscale composite scores. The PSS ranges from 1-5, with higher values representing worse outcomes. PSS items will be averaged into a composite score. All measures will be factor analyzed and combined into a summary score (average of standardized scores weighted by variables' factor loading), provided factor analysis shows that they load onto one factor (i.e., rotated factor loadings of &gt;= |0.4|).

    <description>Measured via self-report (Affect Valuation Index, AVI, and 2 items measuring stress/ anxiety). AVI items range from 1-5, with higher scores indicating higher frequency of any given emotion. Items will be averaged into 8 subscale composite scores according to the AVI protocol by averaging. Items measuring stress/ anxiety range from 1-5 with higher scores representing worse outcomes. All measures will be factor analyzed and combined into a summary score (average of standardized scores weighted by variables' factor loading), provided factor analysis shows that they load onto one factor (i.e., rotated factor loadings of &gt;= |0.4|).

All measures will be factor analyzed and combined into a summary score (average of standardized scores weighted by variables' factor loading), provided factor analysis shows that they load onto one factor (i.e., rotated factor loadings of &gt;= |0.4|). Measures will also be analyzed separately for exploratory purposes.</description>

    <time_frame>5 weeks: measured at baseline (onboarding session), in weekly surveys, and at end of study (offboarding session)</time_frame>
    <description>Measured via self-report (9 items). All measures will be factor analyzed and combined into a summary score (average of standardized scores weighted by variables' factor loading), provided factor analysis shows that they load onto one factor (i.e., rotated factor loadings of &gt;= |0.4|).

There are also short booster reflection exercises in all subsequent daily and weekly surveys, reinforcing the message about adaptive mindsets.</description>
