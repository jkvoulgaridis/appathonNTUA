  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to establish safety of biweekly intermittent fasting in the
      setting of type 2 diabetes mellitus or prediabetes under treatment with non-hypoglycemic
      agents (e.g. metformin).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is proposed as a prospective interventional cohort safety study for biweekly
      intermittent fasting.

      In the effort to improve compliance of lifetime dietary change, the version of 5:2
      intermittent fasting to be applied in this study will be somewhat less intensive than
      implemented then what has been proposed in some recent, similar studies.

      On fasting days, instead of limiting the subject to a specific calorie count, the subject
      will be instead instructed to skip either the first or last meal of the day in order to
      complete a 12 to 16 hour fast, during which time they are allowed drink water or any
      non-caloric beverage of their choice, but not consume any calories.

      Furthermore, the patient will be instructed for their remaining 2 meals to consume no more
      than they would on a normal, non-fasting day.

    <description>This study's intent is to investigate the safety of this intervention for use in a broader scope. It is imperative that risks are known for each subpopulation of diabetics. To this point, our literature review indicates that hypoglycemic events did occur at higher rates in fasting populations taking hypoglycemic medications. We intend to look at rates of hypoglycemia on those not on hypoglycemic medications to assess if this trend continues.</description>
