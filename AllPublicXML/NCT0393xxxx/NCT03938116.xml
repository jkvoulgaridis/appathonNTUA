  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the efficacy of the 8-week Healing Hearts Together (HHT)
      program to improve relationship quality, mental health, quality of life (QoL), and
      cardiovascular health. This is a randomized controlled trial in which couples are randomly
      assigned to the HHT group or usual care. Changes in the outcomes of interest will be assessed
      at the end of the intervention (8 weeks) and 6 months later.

    <measure>Relationship quality: DAS</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Relationship quality will be assessed using the DAS. The DAS is a validated 32-item questionnaire that measures couple satisfaction, cohesion, consensus and affectionate expression. Scores ≥108 are indicative of couple satisfaction, while scores ≤107 indicate distress.</description>

    <description>Participants in the HHT group will be assembled in groups and attend 8 weekly 2-hr sessions at UOHI led by 2 facilitators with psychology training. Sessions: 1) focus on understanding love, attachment, and their relationship to heart health; 2) provide an opportunity to share experiences related to cardiovascular disease with partners and peers; and 3) assist in identifying and improving communication patterns that may inhibit positive interactions and healthy behaviours. Participants are introduced to concepts through didactic presentations, videos, group and couple discussion and homework exercises. Participants will receive a folder containing copies of in-session and take-home exercises as well as the Hold Me Tight book to review between sessions.</description>

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. University of Ottawa Heart Institute (UOHI) patients and their partners

          2. Participants in a romantic relationship who are cohabiting (married, common-law or
             committed relationship for ≥1 year). No restrictions will be placed on sexual
             orientation.

          3. Participants are ≥ 18 years of age

          4. Participants are able to read and understand English (HHT materials are only available
             in English; once efficacy has been established, all materials will be translated to
             French).

          5. Patients and partners are available to participate for the next 6 months (intervention
             and follow-up).

          6. Patients and partners are able to provide informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Participants who are very satisfied (DAS score ≥108) or extremely distressed (DAS &lt;
             70). Extremely distressed couples will be referred to resources in the community.

          2. Participants who, in the opinion of the study psychologist, manifest psychiatric
             illness or cognitive impairment that would preclude participation in HHT (i.e. unable
             to benefit from the intervention; to prevent disruption of other participants).

          3. Participants who are engaging in couples therapy or plan to engage in couples therapy
             in the next 6 months.
