      An Open-Label, Randomized, 2-sequence, 2-period, Fasted Condition, Single-dose, Per Oral,
      Cross-over Study to Evaluate the Bioequivalence of &quot;Dong-a Bepotastine Besilate Tab&quot;

      1. Study design: An open-Label, randomized, 2-sequence, 2-period, fasted condition,
           single-dose, per oral, cross-over study

        2. Administration method:

           The subject should maintain a minimum of 10 hours of empty stomach before
           administration, and give an oral dose of 1 tablets (Bepotastine Besilate 10 mg) with 150
           mL of water at around 8 a.m. on the day of the test at room temperature. The test
           subject should not chew the drug or break it, but should swallow in whole with water.
           The difference in administration time between the test subjects is about one minute
           apart, considering the collection time.

        3. Wash out period: 7 days

        4. Blood collection time: Before the administration, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.33, 1.67, 2, 3,
           4, 6, 8, 12 hr after the administration (total 13 times)

        5. Analysis: Measurement of the concentration of an unchangeable substance of Bepotastine
           in plasma
