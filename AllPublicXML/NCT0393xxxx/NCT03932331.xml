    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, two-part study to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics
      and clinical efficacy of acalabrutinib in Chinese adult subjects with R/R MCL, CLL and other
      B-cell malignancies. The study is divided into 2 parts: Phase 1 portion and Phase 2 portion.
