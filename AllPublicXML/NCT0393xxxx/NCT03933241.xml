  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Transsphenoidal pituitary tumor resection is currently recognized as an effective and safe
      surgical method,nowadays it is widely used in clinical practice . However ,Because of the
      endoscopic damage to the nasal mucosa during surgery and the old blood clots in the nasal
      cavity , after surgery the patient had nasal symptoms such as nasal congestion and nasal flow
      for a long time, which disturbed the patient's rest and sleep, affect their quality of life,
      some patients can develop to chronic sinus inflammation that is sphenoid sinusitis. Nasal
      irrigation is now widely used in the treatment of sinusitis and sphenoid sinusitis with good
      result. In this study, nasal irrigation was applied in the nursing process of patients after
      transsphenoidal pituitary tumor resection, and we want to establish the nursing management
      process of nasal irrigation after transsphenoidal pituitary tumor resection and use the
      visual analogue scale (VAS) to evaluate the nasal symptoms of patients after postoperative
      nasal irrigation. Use The Chinese version of the commonly used nasosinusitis scale (SNOT -20)
      to evaluate postoperative quality of life of patients from the four dimensions of
      rhino-related symptoms, vitality, social function and emotional function, and to evaluate the
      incidence of sphenoid sinusitis by combining imaging examination. It is expected to improve
      the comfort of postoperative nasal symptoms and postoperative quality of life, prevent and
      reduce the incidence of postoperative sphenoid sinusitis, and improve the satisfaction of
      patients.

      Eligible patients who were willing to participate in transsphenoidal pituitary tumor
      resection after informed consent were selected as the study subjects,Randomly divided into
      experimental group and control group. The experimental group apply the routine postoperative
      nursing process of transsphenoidal pituitary tumor plus nasal irrigation nursing process, the
      control group apply the routine postoperative nursing process of transsphenoidal pituitary
      tumor .After the removal of nasal gauze,we use visual analogue scale (VAS) to score and
      observe the clinical symptoms of nasal cavity in both groups. The patients were asked to mark
      out the score that could represent the severity of their symptoms for evaluation. The nurses
      filled in the form, and the nasal comfort was re-evaluated through face-to-face talks and
      telephone follow-up at two days ,1 week, 4 weeks and 12 weeks after the removal of the
      gauze.we will apply nasosinusitis scale (SNOT -20) to measure the quality of life of the
      patients in the two groups at the first day, 1 week, 4 weeks and 12 weeks after the removal
      of nasal strips .After 12 weeks of discharge, two groups of patients were hospitalized for
      reexamination with pituitary MRI or CT,to determine the incidence of postoperative sphenoid
      sinusitis.Patients were followed up and interviewed by telephone one week, four weeks and 12
      weeks after discharge, were evaluate the incidence of complications such as nasal bleeding,
      cerebrospinal fluid leakage and intracranial infection.
