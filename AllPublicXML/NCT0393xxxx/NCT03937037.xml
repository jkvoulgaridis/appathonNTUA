    <textblock>
      In this prospective study, the investigators assessed the utility of intermittent saline
      irrigation in reducing the recurrent rate of choledocholithiasis after the endoscopic
      extraction for common bile duct stones, and it does not increase the rate of
      procedure-related complications.

    <textblock>
      In recent years, an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is the golden
      standard procedure to remove the common bile duct stones(CBD). Nevertheless, it is reported
      that the recurrence rate of CBD stones is 4% to 24% after ERCP. The contributing factors were
      periampullar diverticulum, situ gallbladder, and incomplete CBD stone clearance. The main
      reason of stone recurrence is incomplete CBD stone clearance including remnant stone
      fragments themselves and tinny fragments can act as a nidus for further CBD stone growth. It
      is difficult to retrieve these fine fragments completely using conventional devices such as
      retrieval basket and ballon. Therefore, the investigators attempt to remove residual stone
      fragments by means of saline infusion. Saline irrigation has many advantages such as better
      effect and less side effect and no extra cost. It is reported that use intraductal
      ultrasonography (IDUS) to demonstrate residual CBD stones. However, IDUS has limited
      availability in clinical practice. The single-operator cholangioscopy (SOC)-system gains
      widespread acceptance because of its independent washing channels and direct viewing.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether saline solution irrigation would decrease
      the recurrent rate of choledocholithiasis after endoscopy retrieval stones.
