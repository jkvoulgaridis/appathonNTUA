      This study aims to compare the difference in staple usage and post-operative GERD (heartburn)
      between patients that had an endoscope used versus patients that had a suction calibration
      system used on them during &quot;laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy&quot; (LSG).

      There are multiple choices for a surgeon and their patient when it comes to weight loss
      surgery. One of those options is a procedure called a &quot;laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy&quot;
      (LSG). In this procedure the majority of the patient's stomach is removed leaving behind a
      stapled &quot;sleeve&quot; about the same size as the patient's esophagus.

      During this procedure there are three main devices that surgeon inserts through the mouth and
      in to the stomach to calibrate the size of the &quot;sleeve&quot;. They can use a standard weighted
      bougie, an endoscope, or a suction calibration device. This study aims to compare the
      difference in staple usage and post-operative GERD (heartburn) between patients that had an
      endoscope used versus patients that had a suction calibration system used on them during LSG.

    <description>The ViSiGi® 3D is the first calibration system specifically intended for use during sleeve gastrectomy.ViSiGi 3D®is a non-sterile, single patient use device. The device comprises a tube with a closed, rounded tip, and holes at the distal end. The proximal end of ViSiGi 3D® includes an integral suction regulator and vented On/Off valve.
Advantages of ViSiGi® 3D device include simplification of sleeve calibration in addition to suctioning the stomach and performing leak tests all with one device making operative steps simpler for both the anesthesiology team and surgeons. Since it is single patient use it does not require reprocessing.</description>
