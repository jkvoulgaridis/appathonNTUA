    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2 study to evaluate the efficacy of a non-myeloablative lymphodepleting
      preparative regimen followed by infusion of autologous TIL and high-dose aldesleukin in
      patients with locally advanced, recurrent, or metastatic cancer associated with one of the
      following cancer types: 1.) gastric/esophagogastric, 2.) colorectal, 3.) pancreatic, 4.)
      sarcoma, 5.) mesothelioma, 6.) neuroendocrine, 7.) squamous cell cancer, 8.) Merkle cell, 9.)
      mismatch repair deficient and/or microsatellite unstable cancers, and 10.) patients who have
      exhausted conventional systemic therapy options by using the objective response rate (ORR).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This Phase 2 study will be conducted in conjunction with companion protocol (Cell Harvest and
      Preparation to Support Adoptive Cell Therapy Clinical Protocols and Pre-Clinical Studies) as
      described below:

      Cell Preparation:

      Patients with evaluable locally advanced, recurrent, or metastatic gastric/esophagogastric,
      colorectal, pancreatic, sarcoma, mesothelioma, neuroendocrine, cutaneous/anal squamous cell,
      Merkel cell, cancers refractory to systemic therapy, and those with deficient mismatch repair
      and/or microsatellite instability cancers who have lesions that can be resected or biopsied
      with minimum morbidity will undergo resection or biopsy of tumor. TIL will be obtained while
      enrolled on the companion protocol HCC 17-220 (Cell Harvest and Preparation to Support
      Adoptive Cell Therapy Clinical Protocols and Pre-Clinical Studies). Separate tumor
      procurements may be performed under HCC 17-220 protocol to obtain TIL if initial tumor
      procurements could not successfully generate TIL. The TIL will be grown and expanded for this
      trial according to standard operating procedures submitted in the IND. The TIL will be
      assessed for potency by interferon-gamma release.

      Treatment Phase:

      Once cells exceed the potency requirement and are projected to exceed the minimum number
      specified in the COA, the patient will be registered on this study and receive the lymphocyte
      depleting preparative regimen consisting of fludarabine and cyclophosphamide, followed by
      infusion of up to 2x10^11 lymphocytes (minimum of 1x10^9 cells) and administration of
      high-dose intravenous aldesleukin. It is anticipated that TIL that meet the COA will not be
      achievable in approximately 20% of patients who undergo resection. These patients may undergo
      a second resection to grow TIL, if another suitable lesion exists. Approximately 6 weeks (+/-
      2 weeks) after TIL administration, patients will undergo a complete tumor evaluation and
      evaluation of toxicity and immunologic parameters. Patients will receive one course of
      treatment. The start date of the course will be the start date of the chemotherapy; the end
      date will be the day of the first post-treatment evaluation. Patients may undergo a second
      treatment. Patients will receive no other experimental agents while on this protocol.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Measurable locally advanced, recurrent, or metastatic cancer associated with one of the
        following cancer types: 1.) gastric/esophagogastric, 2.) colorectal, 3.) pancreatic, 4.)

        9.) mismatch repair deficient and/or microsatellite unstable cancers, and 10.) patients who
        have exhausted conventional systemic therapy options

        Patients with locally advanced disease should be unresectable by conventional surgical
        approaches.

        Patients with distant metastatic spread must have previously received approved first-line
        systemic therapies if they are eligible to receive these treatments.

        Patients must be co-enrolled on the companion protocol HCC 17-220 (Cell Harvest and
        Preparation to Support Adoptive Cell Therapy Clinical Protocols and Pre-Clinical Studies)
        and have available TIL cultures for therapy.

        Patients with 3 or fewer brain metastases that are less than 1 cm in diameter and
        asymptomatic are eligible. Lesions that have been treated with stereotactic radiosurgery
        must be clinically stable for 1 month after treatment for the patient to be eligible.
        Patients with surgically resected brain metastases are eligible.

        Greater than or equal to 18 years of age and less than or equal to age 75

        Able to understand and sign the Informed Consent Document

        Serology:

          -  Seronegative for HIV antibody. (The experimental treatment being evaluated in this
             protocol depends on an intact immune system. Patients who are HIV seropositive can
             have decreased immune-competence and thus be less responsive to the experimental
             treatment and more susceptible to its toxicities.)

          -  Seronegative for hepatitis B antigen

          -  Seronegative for hepatitis C antibody. If hepatitis C antibody test is positive, then
             patient must be tested for the presence of antigen by RT-PCR and be HCV RNA negative.

        Women of child-bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test because of the
        potentially dangerous effects of the treatment on the fetus.

        Hematology

          -  Absolute neutrophil count greater than 1000/mm3 without the support of filgrastim

          -  WBC ≥ 3000/mm3

        More than four weeks must have elapsed since any prior systemic therapy at the time the
        patient receives the preparative regimen, and patients' toxicities must have recovered to a
        clinically manageable level (except for toxicities such as alopecia or vitiligo). (Note:
        Patients may have undergone minor surgical procedures within the past 3 weeks, as long as
        all toxicities have recovered to grade 1 or less)

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Women of child-bearing potential who are pregnant or breastfeeding because of the
        potentially dangerous effects of the treatment on the fetus or infant.

        Any form of primary immunodeficiency (such as Severe Combined Immunodeficiency Disease).

        Concurrent opportunistic infections (The experimental treatment being evaluated in this
        protocol depends on an intact immune system. Patients who have decreased immune competence
        may be less responsive to the experimental treatment and more susceptible to its
        toxicities).

        Active systemic infections (e.g.: requiring anti-infective treatment),

        Clinically significant coagulation disorder

        Active major medical illnesses deemed clinically significant by the treating physician

        History of clinically significant major organ autoimmune disease

        Patients with a history of hypothyroidism are eligible

        Concurrent systemic steroid therapy.

        History of severe immediate hypersensitivity reaction to any of the agents used in this
        study.

        History of active coronary or ischemic symptoms.

        Documented LVEF of less than or equal to 45%; note: testing is required in patients with:

          -  Age &gt; 65 years' old

          -  Clinically significant atrial and or ventricular arrhythmias including but not limited
             to: atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, second- or third-degree heart block
             or have a history of ischemic heart disease, chest pain.

        Documented FEV1 less than or equal to 60% predicted tested in patients with:

          -  A prolonged history of cigarette smoking (20 pk/year of smoking within the past 2
             years).

          -  Symptoms of respiratory dysfunction
