  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to describe the changes in morphology and Retinal
      vascularization after revascularization of the internal carotid artery. Indeed, the stenosis
      of the internal carotid artery can lead to ophthalmological charts. The underlying hypothesis
      is that revascularization of the internal carotid artery would improve ipsilateral and
      retinal homolateral perfusion in the short term. The OCT-angiography technique accurately
      studies the retinal vasculature and also assesses the risk of retinal and choroidal embolism,
      which is recognized as increased in cases of symptomatic or asymptomatic carotid stenosis.

      The stenosis of the internal carotid artery is a frequent and potentially serious pathology
      (TIA, ischemic stroke, death), which can also be manifested by ophthalmological charts,
      foremost among which are transient monocular blindness.

      The most common etiology of this stenosis remains the atheromatous pathology, whose
      treatment, depending on the symptomatic or non-symptomatic nature of the stenosis, includes,
      among other things, a revascularization procedure that may be surgical (endarterectomy,
      reference treatment) or guided by radiology (angioplasty and carotid stent placement)

      From the anatomical point of view, the internal carotid artery notably has for branching the
      ophthalmological artery, which itself will give birth:

        -  at the central artery of the retina: role in the vascularization of the inner layers of
           the retina

        -  posterior ciliary arteries: role in the choroidal vasculature and outer layers of the
           retina.

      Very little knowledge at the present time relates changes in retinal and choroidal
      vascularization after a revascularization procedure on the internal carotid artery
      OCT-angiography is a non-invasive imaging technique that is now part of investigative
      examinations in retinal imaging. This technique makes it possible to study the macular and
      choroidal retinal vascularization with precision without injection of contrast medium and
      thus allows to deepen the knowledge in medical fields where the exploration was until now
      limited because of the invasiveness of the examinations.

      The hypothesis of this project is that revascularization of the internal carotid artery would
      improve retinal and choroidal ipsilateral perfusion in the short term (1 month
      postoperatively), as assessed by OCT-angiography. OCT-angiography could also be used to
      assess retinal and choroidal embolism risk, usually recognized as increased in cases of
      symptomatic or asymptomatic carotid stenosis.
