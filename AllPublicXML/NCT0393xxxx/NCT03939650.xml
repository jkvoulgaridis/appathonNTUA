      Single-center, unblinded, 2:1 parallel pseudo-randomized efficacy trial.

      In the intervention group only, resident physicians will be assisted by the automated medical
      history-taking device &quot;Diaana&quot; during their consultations in outpatient ambulatory unit of
      the Geneva University Hospital.

      In both groups, the differential diagnosis of the resident physician will be compared to the
      gold-standard diagnosis of the senior physician.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Automated medical history-taking devices (AMHTD) are emerging tools with the potential to
      increase the quality of medical consultations by providing physicians with an exhaustive,
      high-quality, standardized anamnesis and differential diagnosis. In this study, the
      investigators aimed to establish whether an AMHTD of interest, &quot;Diaana&quot;, allowed the
      physician to establish a more precise differential diagnosis.

      A single-center, unblinded, 2:1 parallel pseudo-randomized efficacy trial will be performed.
      A consultation follow-up is organized at 4-6 weeks, were the gold-standard diagnosis is
      established by the senior physician. The study will take place in the emergency outpatient
      unit of La Colline Hospital (Geneva, Switzerland) and include patients suffering from
      symptoms covered by Diaana.

      Patients in the intervention group will fulfill Dianna. Then, the resident physician will
      read Diaana summary, perform his consultation, and fulfill case report form, including his
      differential diagnosis. Then, the senior physician will see the patient and establish the
      gold-standard diagnosis. In the control group, the residents will directly establish a
      differential diagnosis, without the help of Diaana.

    <intervention_model_description>For each of the six resident physicians of the outpatients clinic, the 6 first eligible patients will be attributed to the control group (with access to &quot;Diaana&quot;), then the 12 next eligible patients will be attributed to the interventional group (with access to &quot;Diaana&quot;). There will therefore be 36 patients in the control group and 72 in the interventional group.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The resident physician will select up to 5 diagnose in an exhaustive list, from the most to the least relevant.
The accuracy of the diagnosis established will be measured as following:
100% if the gold-standard diagnosis is in position#1 into the resident diagnosis list
80% if the gond-standard diagnosis is in position#2
60% in position #3
40% in position #4
20% in position #5
0% if the gold-standard diagnosis absent of the resident diagnosis list
A higher percentage is considered as a better outcome.</description>

    <description>Diaana, the AMHTD used, functions as follows: on the basis of an interactive questionnaire completed by the patient before the consultation, it performs an exhaustive anamnesis focused on the problem and proposes a panel of DDs with a high sensitivity. The artificial reasoning system of &quot;Diaana&quot; mimics how a specialist physician would reason to establish a DD. The information transmitted is in an easy-to-use form for the physician that includes a summary of the anamnesis centered on relevant elements from the questionnaire and a list of possible diagnoses with their emergency level, potential contributing factors, and first-line management proposals.</description>
