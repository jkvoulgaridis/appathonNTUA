  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to see the effect of taking Aged Garlic Extract (AGE)
      on the progression of coronary plaque, a condition called atherosclerosis, in people
      diagnosed with Diabetes.

      This clinical trial is to determine on progression rates of low attenuation plaque under
      influence of Aged Garlic Extract as compared to placebo over the 1year period in individuals
      with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.The study also examines the effect of Aged Garlic Extract on
      endothelial function and arterial stiffness which was measured by cardio-ankle vascular index
      (CAVI) over the 3months period.
