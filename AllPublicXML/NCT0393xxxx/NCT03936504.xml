      This study is a prospective, multicenter, randomized controlled clinical study develop an
      innovative Tai Chi cardiac rehabilitation program (TCCRP) for patients with coronary heart
      disease(CHD), and assess the efficacy, safety, and acceptability of the Tai Chi cardiac
      rehabilitation program for patients coronary heart disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will conduct a prospective multicenter randomized‐controlled clinical trial
      of 150 participants with coronary heart disease(CHD). Patients will be randomly assigned in a
      1:1 ratio into either a intervention group and a control group. The intervention group will
      participate in supervised Tai Chi cardiac rehabilitation program (TCCRP) held three times a
      week for 3 months. The control group will receive supervised conventional exercise
      rehabilitation held three times a week for 3 months. After the 3-month intervention period,
      there will be a 3-month follow-up period with no active intervention in either group. The
      primary and secondary outcomes will be assessed at baseline, 1 months, 3 months, and 6months.
      Primary outcome measures will be a score of 36-Item Short Form Survey (SF-36), and Chinese
      Perceived Stress Scale (CPSS). The secondary outcome measures will include the body
      composition, cardiopulmonary exercise test, respiratory muscle function, kinetism ,
      echocardiogram and New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification, heart rate recovery
      time, laboratory examination . Other indicators include Seattle Angina Scale (SAQ),
      Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), Generalized
      Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), Berg Balance Scale (BBS),Morse Fall Seale (MFS), and Kansas city
      cardlomyopathy questionnaire (KCCQ) . Furthermore, adverse events will be recorded and
      analyzed. If any participants withdraw from the trial, intention-to-treat analysis will be
      performed.
