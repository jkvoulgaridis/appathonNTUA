  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are both inflammatory diseases
      caused by a persistent chronic inflammation. A chronic inflammation is caused by the absence
      of the inflammation response resolution. Currently, diagnosis and disease activity
      measurements are based on symptom-based scores or on anatomical imaging devices. Both methods
      are unable to detect both early stages of the disease and early changes in inflammation as a
      reaction to treatment. Objective, early measures of inflammation could improve diagnosis and
      in the future therapeutic outcomes by identifying early therapy responders and
      non-responders. The aim of this feasibility study is to evaluate the safety and feasibility
      of the near infrared (NIR) tracer OTL38 for monitoring disease activity in inflammatory
      diseases rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease. The hypothesis is that OTL38
      will accumulate in inflamed tissue due to the increased presence of activated macrophages
      expressing the folate beta receptor, enabling better visualization and monitoring of the
      inflammation. It is expected that this approach can improve treatment and diagnosis of
      patients with inflammatory disease.

    <measure>The correlation between the fluorescence intensity and the disease activity measured with the DAS28 in patients with RA.</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The DAS28 (Disease Activity Score 28) is developed and validated by the EULAR (European League Against Rheumatism) to measure the progress and improvement of Rheumatoid Arthritis by measuring 28 joints. When looking at these joints, both the number of joints with tenderness upon touching and swelling are counted. Furthermore, the erythrocyte sedimentation rate is measured and a patients assessment of disease activity during the preceding 7 days is measured on a scale between 0 and 100, where 0 is 'no activity' and 100 is 'highest activity possible'.
DAS28 values range from 0.49 to 9.07 while higher values mean a higher disease activity. A DAS28 below the value of 2.6 is interpreted as Remission. Between 2.6 and 3.2 as low disease activity, and between 3.2 and 5.1 as moderate. Above 5.1 is indicated as high disease activity.</description>

    <description>The SCCAI is a diagnostic questionnaire to assess the severity of symptoms in patients with ulcerative colitis.

    <time_frame>Up to 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The endoscopic Mayo Score (Mayo endoscopic subscore) evaluates ulcerative colitis stage, based only on endoscopic exploration. Endoscopic activity is based upon the assessment of a few features, such as the presence of erythema, visibility of the vascular pattern, friability, erosions, spontaneous bleeding and (large) ulcerations. Each score indicates endoscopic activity: 0 = inactive disease tot 3 = severely active disease.
