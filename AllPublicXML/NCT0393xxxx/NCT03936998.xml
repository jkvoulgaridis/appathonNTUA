  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, randomized, double-blind trial with four arms evaluating VE416 as
      pretreatment or concurrent treatment in comparison to low-dose peanut oral immunotherapy
      (PNOIT) alone.

      In this research study the investigators want to learn more about an investigational medicine
      called VE416 in combination with vancomycin (an antibiotic) while undergoing peanut oral
      immunotherapy. VE416 is a combination of dormant (inactive) bacteria given in a capsule. The
      bacteria are reactivated once they reach participants intestines and in combination with
      peanut flour may help to prevent participants from getting sick (upset stomach, breathing
      problems, and skin problems) when participants come into contact with peanuts.

      The investigators are doing this research study to find out if VE416 in combination with
      vancomycin (an antibiotic) while undergoing peanut oral immunotherapy can help people with
      peanut allergy. VE416 is a consortium of commensal, or &quot;friendly&quot;, dormant (inactive)
      bacteria given in a capsule. The bacteria are reactivated once they reach participants
      intestines. The investigators also want to find out if VE416 with peanut oral immunotherapy
      is safe to take without causing too many side effects.
