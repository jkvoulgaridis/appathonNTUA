        The general medical history of the patients was evaluated preoperatively. Comprehensive
        ophthalmological examinations including BCVA measurements and funduscopic examinations were
        performed at each visit. SD-OCT (Cirrus HD-OCT, Carl Zeiss Meditec, Dublin, CA) was used to
        measure the central macular thickness (CMT) and structural changes preoperatively, and at 1
        day, 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months and 1 year postoperatively
