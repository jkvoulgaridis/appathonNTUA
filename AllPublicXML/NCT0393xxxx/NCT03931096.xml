  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Congenital heart diseases (CHD) are the firt cause of congenital malformations (8 for 1000
      births). Since the 90's, great advances in prenatal diagnosis, pediatric cardiac surgery,
      intensive care, and cardiac catheterization have reduced morbidity and early mortality in
      this population. Prevalence of &quot; GUCH &quot;, grown-ups with congenital heart disease has thus
      been significantly increasing. Nowadays, quality of life (QoL) assessment of this population
      is in the foreground. Our team is a reference center in the management of patient with CHD,
      from the fetal period to adulthood. The investigators have been conducting a clinical
      research program on health related QoL in pediatric and congenital heart disease. The
      investigators thus demonstrated the link between cardiopulmonary fitness and QoL in children
      with CHD aged 8 to 18 years, the correlation between functional class and QoL in adults with
      CHD, and the impact of therapeutic education on QoL in children under anticoagulants.
      Currently, no controlled cross-sectional quality of life study assessment has been leaded in
      the youngest children with CHD. This present study therefore extends our work in younger
      children aged 5 to 7 years.

    <textblock>
      248 patients will be enrolled in this study.

      Patient from groups 1 is included during his annual medical check-up. Quality of life
      questionnaire and other examinations are performed during this site visit. Its is a part of
      his usual care. No supplementary visit, directly related to the research, are necessary. 2
      sites will participate to the enrollment, belonging to the French national network for
      complex congenital heart diseases (M3C) .

      Participants (healthy children) from groups 2 are included from schools.The prior agreement
      of the Ministry of National Education was obtained before any procedure related to this
      study. 3 schools will participate to the enrolment

    <description>Comparison of the total score of the self QoL questionnaire (PedsQL 4.0 : Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory Version 4.0 Generic Core Scales) between patients with CHD and control children recruited in schools, aged 5 to 7 years. The self QoL questionnaire PedsQL 4.0 is composed of 23 items comprising 4 dimensions. Items are reversed scored and linearly transformed to a 0-100 scale. In order to get a total score we must sum all the items scores over the number of items answered on all the Scales. If more than 50% of the items in the scale are missing, the scale scores should not be computed.</description>
