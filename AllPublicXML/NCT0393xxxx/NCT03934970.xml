  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a diagnostic accuracy study that aims to evaluate the role of DTI in evaluation
      of DPN in comparison to clinical scores and nerve conduction studies (NCS). The study
      included 30 patients with diabetes mellitus complaining of neuropathy symptoms and 15 healthy
      volunteers. All subjects underwent evaluation using 1.5T DTI of median nerves and NCS.
      Patients underwent clinical evaluation using Neuropathy Deficit Score (NDS), Neuropathy
      Impairment Score in the Lower Limbs (NIS-LL) and Diabetic Neuropathy Examination (DNE) score.
      The values of these tests were compared and correlated and diagnostic accuracy tests were
      performed together with identification of cut-off score for abnormal diffusion tensor imaging
      parameters in diabetic neuropathy

    <description>This is a diagnostic accuracy study comparing the ability of Diffusion Tensor Imaging to diagnose Diabetic neuropathy in comparison to Neuropathy Deficit Score which examines vibration, sensation (0 if present and normal and 1 if absent reduced or uncertain) and ankle reflex (0 if present and normal, and 2 if absent) with a maximum total score of 10. The grades of severity are mild (3-5) moderate (6-8) and severe (9-10).</description>

    <description>This is a diagnostic accuracy study comparing the ability of Diffusion Tensor Imaging to diagnose Diabetic neuropathy in comparison to Neuropathy Impairment Score in the Lower Limbs which evaluates the changes in motor, sensory and reflex activity.

    <description>This is a diagnostic accuracy study comparing the ability of Diffusion Tensor Imaging to diagnose Diabetic neuropathy in comparison to Diabetic Neuropathy Examination score which tests only the limbs of right side with a maximum score of 16 points.

    <measure>Identifying cut-off value for abnormal diffusion tensor fractional anisotropy in diabetic neuropathy.</measure>
    <time_frame>Six months</time_frame>
    <description>This study aims to identify cut-off absolute value of fractional anisotropy that is considered abnormal in diabetic neuropathy. Fractional anisotropy (FA) is a scalar value between zero and one that describes the degree of anisotropy of a diffusion process. A value of zero means that diffusion is isotropic, i.e. it is unrestricted (or equally restricted) in all directions. A value of one means that diffusion occurs only along one axis and is fully restricted along all other directions.</description>

    <measure>Identifying cut-off value for abnormal diffusion tensor apparent diffusion coefficient in diabetic neuropathy.</measure>
    <time_frame>Six months</time_frame>
    <description>This study aims to identify cut-off absolute value of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) that is considered abnormal in diabetic neuropathy. An ADC of a tissue is expressed in units of mm2/s. There is no unanimity regarding the boundaries of the range of normal diffusion, but ADC values less than 1.0 to 1.1 x 10-3 mm2/s (or 1000-1100 x 10-6 mm2/s) are generally acknowledged in adults as indicating restriction.</description>
