  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Head and neck cancer patients are in high risk to suffer from malnourishment, a
      risk that increase in postoperative condition and with the use of enteral nutrition (EN).
      Until now patients who are suffering from indigestion in the ICU received treatment in the
      form of prokinetic drugs, drags that can lead to serious side effects and only can partially
      improve digestion. Acupuncture was used successfully in several clinical trials to improve
      postoperative indigestion in cancer patients without any reported adverse events. This study
      aims is to design a double blind settings in order to investigate acupuncture effect in
      combination of prokinetic drugs in the prevention of indigestion in postoperative oral and
      hypo-pharyngeal cancer patients in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU).

      Methods: Single center, double blind randomize control trial will compare between two equal
      groups. A total of 28 patients that will meet the inclusion criteria: Age 30-80, Post plastic
      surgery for oral cancer or hypo-pharyngeal cancer, Apache score below 20 needed EN. Patients
      will be randomly divided into specific acupuncture (ACU) or non-specific acupuncture (CON)
      for 3 treatments in 3 days by a blind acupuncturist along with prokinetic drugs. The main
      outcome measurement will be the amount of days a patient need to reach Total Energy
      Expenditure (TEE).

      Expected outcome: The results will shed light on the effectiveness and safety of acupuncture
      in a double blind design for posts-surgery ICU cancer patients. In addition, the study
      presents a revolutionary double blind design that if will prove as successful might influence
      the way double blind acupuncture studies are performed today.

      Other information: The study will be conducted in the surgical ICU department, of china
      medical university hospital, Taichung 404, Taiwan. The study in conducted on stable ICU
      patients and is anticipated to have a minimum risk for adverse events. Patients enrollment
      and data collection will start immediately after china medical hospital research ethics
      committee approval. The study expected completion time: June 2021

    <masking_description>Patients will be randomized to one of two groups: Acu/ Con in a 1:1 ratio. The random number and patient name will be written down on an non transparent envelope by a study nurse. The study nurse will provide an envelope containing a sheet depicting the acupoint name, location and picture (Acu / Con) to the acupuncture doctor. Acupuncture doctor (blind) will preform acupuncture on the points. 30 minutes after needle insertion, acupuncture doctor will withdraw the needles. Acupuncturists, ICU nurses, ICU doctors, researchers and statisticians will all be blind to group allocation and to the meaning of the random numbers until all acupuncture treatments have been completed.</masking_description>
