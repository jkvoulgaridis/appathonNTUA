      smartphone application on health-related quality of life for patients with rheumatic disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After obtaining written consent, participants will be asked to download and use the Calm
      meditation smartphone application everyday for a 30-day period. Participant demographics and
      clinical information will be collected at baseline. Participants will additionally be asked
      to complete questionnaires concerning health-related quality of life (HRQoL) as well as
      mental health, stress, and self-efficacy at baseline and at the end of the 30 day study
      period. A brief check-in via telephone will be conducted on day 15.

      Participants using the calm app will be compared to participants receiving usual care who
      will be asked to complete identical sets of questionnaires. The participant may choose
      whether they join the Calm application vs usual care (questionnaires only) group on a
      voluntary basis; there is no pre-assignment. The Calm application is a publicly available
      program that is available to any patient independent of this study.
