  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1, open-label study evaluating the safety, clinical pharmacology and clinical
      activity of TNB-383B, a BCMA x CD3 T-cell engaging bispecific antibody, in subjects with
      relapsed or refractory MM who have received at least 3 prior lines of therapy. The study
      consists of 2 portions, a monotherapy dose escalation (Arm A) and a monotherapy dose
      expansion (Arm B). Arm A will evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK and PD profiles of
      escalating doses of single-agent TNB-383B ranging from 25 micrograms to 40 milligrams per
      dose, administered once every 3 weeks (Q3W), in approximately 24 subjects. Once the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) or recommended phase 2 dose, (RP2D) is identified in Arm A, Arm B will
      be initiated to further characterize the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic (PK) and
      pharmacodynamic (PD) profiles of the MTD/RP2D dose of TNB 383B monotherapy in approximately
      48 subjects.
