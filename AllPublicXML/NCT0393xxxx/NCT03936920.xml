      Introduction-Objective: Balance evaluation is one of the most important components of
      physical examination. Studies on equilibrium assessment in different research groups; It
      includes measurements that assess the seating balance, which does not require complex
      measurements or ambulation.

      In the literature, there is no clear information about balance effect in intensive care
      patients who can not be ambulated due to loss of advanced muscle strength, especially in the
      early period.

      Ottowa Sitting Scale is a scale in which the balance is evaluated in the sitting position and
      it has no validity and reliability in Turkish.

      Therefore, the aim of this study is to examine the reliability and validity of the Ottowa
      Sitting Scale Turkish version between measurements and measurements.

    <textblock>
      In recent years, the mortality rate has decreased in an intensive care unit with the medical
      and technological developments related to intensive care treatments and the rate of discharge
      from intensive care unit (ICU) has increased. However, as the length of hospitalization in
      the intensive care unit prolonged, the functionalities of the patients were restricted due to
      changes in the musculoskeletal and cardiovascular system. Inactivity, inflammation, the use
      of pharmacological agents and the presence of neuromuscular syndromes associated with the
      critical disease lead to decreased muscle dysfunction and exercise tolerance in patients in
      the intensive care unit. These changes cause the health-related quality of life to be worse
      in people with critical illness a few months after discharge. Balance; muscle strength is
      affected by changes in sensory information, postural control and vestibular arrangements from
      the lower extremity. Studies on equilibrium assessment in different research groups; It
      includes measurements that assess the seating balance, which does not require complex
      measurements or ambulation. In the literature, there is no clear information about balance
      effect in intensive care patients who can not be ambulated due to loss of advanced muscle
      strength, especially in the early period. The Ottowa Sitting Scale is a scale in which the
      balance is evaluated in the sitting position and there is no validity and reliability in
      Turkish. For this reason, the aim of this study is to examine the reliability and validity
      between measurements and measurements of the Ottowa Sitting Scale's Turkish version. More
      than one physiotherapist scores patients for validity between the measurements. For the
      validity of the measurements, a physiotherapist scores the patient twice in two weeks
      intervals.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Ottowa Sitting Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>It is a scale that does not require ambulation, is able to maintain static sitting position in the sitting position, can move in short distance, can move long distance, body rotation ability and ability to move on the hip can be fulfilled. The scoring of each unit varies between 0-4 and the maximum score is 40.</description>

    <measure>Functional Independence Scale (FIM)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>FIM shows the degree of independence in the basic physical and cognitive activities of the individual in daily life. FIM consists of 18 questions and mainly measures 2 parameters (1- physical / motor function, 2- cognitive / cognitive function). Each item is scored at 7 levels (1-7), 'level 1 yardım means full help, and Her level 7 lan means full independence. FIM total score is between 18-126 points. The higher the individual's score, the higher the level of independence.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Berg Balance Test</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>It consists of 14 questions in which it is evaluated whether or not the balance related tasks can be fulfilled in the changing spectrum from sitting position to standing up to one foot. 0: cannot do 4: is scored as doing independently. The total score is 56. The risk of a fall from 0 to 20 is high, the risk of a fall from 21 to 40 is considered to be low and the risk of a fall from 41 to 56 is considered low.</description>
