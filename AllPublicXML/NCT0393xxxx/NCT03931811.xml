      Goal: To show the effects of short wave diathermy added on prolotherapy injections in
      osteoarthritis of the knee on pain, physical functioning and quality of life.

      Material and Methods: 63 patients with osteoarthritis of the knee with Kellgren-Lawrence
      (K-L) class 2 or 3 were included in the study. Patients were randomized to two grous, first
      being dextrose prolotherapy+ short wave diathermy(SWD), and second being dextrose
      prolotherapy with sham SWD. Patients were injected with dextrose prolotherapy solutions in
      the beginning, 3rd and 6th week of the study, for a total of 3 times, and took 20 minutes of
      SWD after injection(true or sham). Western Ontorio and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis
      Index (WOMAC), Visual Analogous Scale for pain(VAS) and Short Form Health Survey (SF-36)were
      applied before, after(6th week) and at the 3rd month of treatment.

    <measure>Visual Analogous Scale(for the intensity of pain)(VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>VAS was used to assess the resting pain intensity of the subjects. Patients were asked to show their intensity of pain on a 10 cm long line, with 0 end being no pain, and 10 cm end being highest amount of pain possible. The distance between the mark and the 0 end was measured and the result was recorded as milimeters.</description>

    <measure>Western Ontorio and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>WOMAC is an index for the assessment of osteoarthritis consisting of 24 questions, with subscales being pain(5 questions), stiffness(2 questions) and physical functioning(17 questions). Turkish version of the test is expressed as a likert type scale, ranging from 0 to 4, with greater numbers expressing higher severity. The greater scores are associated with more severe disease</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Short Form-36 (SF-36)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>SF-36 is an index for the evaluation of quality of life in a broad range of patients. It consists of 8 domains: Physical function, bodily pain, role-physical, general health, vitality, social function, role-emotional, and mental health. Each domain is expressed separately, rather than a total score. All of the domains are given from 0 to 100 points, with greater values being associated with a better quality of life.</description>

    <description>Patients were randomized into 2 groups depending on their patient number, with odd numbers being recruited to SWD group, and even numbers to sham SWD group.
Prolotherapy solutions were injected using 25 gauge needle, with solutions being 6 ml 25 % dextrose (3 ml 20% dextrose + 3 ml 30% dextrose) for intraarticular, and 20 ml 15% dextrose (10 ml 0,9% NaCl + 10 ml 30% dextrose) for periarticular.
SWD group took short wave diathermy with specifications of 400 watt power output, 27.12 MHz frequency, 11.06m wave length, using condensators and electrodes of 12 cm diameter parallel to the knee for 20 minutes(Enraf-Nonius, Curapuls 970 Short wave diathermy device). Both groups took injections in the beginning of the therapy, 3rd week and 6th week, a total of 3 times. SWD or sham SWD therapy was given right after the injections, also for a total of 3 times.</description>
