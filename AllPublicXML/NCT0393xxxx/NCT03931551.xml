  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This open-label, multicenter, single arm, two cohorts, Simon's Two-Stage minimax design,
      phase II clinical trial will assess the efficacy of olaparib in combination with trastuzumab
      in patients with HER2-positive ABC with gene alterations in HRR DNA pathway. To be included
      in the cohort A of the study, patients must exhibit germinal deleterious mutations in BRCA1
      or BRCA2 genes. In the second stage of the study, patients must show wild-type germinal
      BRCA1/2 genes with HRD positive status based on HRDetect test, in order to be included in the
      exploratory cohort B.

      Eligible patients will have histologically proven diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the breast
      with evidence of advanced disease, and at least one measurable disease as per RECIST v.1.1.
      Patients will have a documented history of progression on HER2-directed therapy for the
      treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer with not more than three prior regimens of
      chemotherapy and/or trastuzumab-lapatinib in advanced scenario, and at least one regimen of
      chemotherapy including trastuzumab.

      Patients will be accrued in a Simon's Two-Stage minimax design. The accrual goal will be a
      total of 20 patients: 7 patients in the first stage and 13 patients in the second stage.
      Additionally, in the second stage, the investigators will accrual 13 patients on the
      exploratory cohort B.
