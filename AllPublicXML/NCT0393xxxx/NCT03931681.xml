    <description>This is a single arm, dose escalation trial evaluating OKI-179 given orally on a daily basis. Patients will take OKI-179 orally (PO) on Days 1 - 4, 8 - 11 and 15 - 18 in 21-day cycles (± 3 days), under fasted conditions. The design is a modified 3+3 design to determine the maximum tolerated dose. There is no comparative arm.</description>

             days prior to Cycle 1 Day 1:

          -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1.5 × 109/L; excluding measurements obtained within
             7 days after daily administration of filgrastim/sargramostim or within 3 weeks after
             administration of pegfilgrastim.

          -  Platelet count ≥ 100 × 109/L; excluding measurements obtained within 3 days after
             transfusion of platelets.

          -  Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN or Creatinine clearance (CrCl) ≥ 50 mL/min; the CrCl can
             be measured from urine or calculated from serum creatinine (Cockcroft‑Gault Equation).

          -  Female patients of childbearing potential must have a negative serum beta-human
             chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG) test within 14 days prior to Cycle 1 Day 1.

          -  Male patients and female patients of childbearing potential must agree to use an
             effective method of contraception per institutional standard prior to the first dose
             and for 90 days after the last dose of OKI-179.

          -  Willingness and ability to comply with all scheduled visits, treatment plan,
             laboratory tests and other study procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Patients meeting any of the following criteria are ineligible for enrollment in the study:

          -  Any of the following treatment interventions within the specified time frame prior to
             Cycle 1 Day 1:

          -  Major surgery within 28 days (the surgical incision should be fully healed prior to
             study drug administration).

          -  Radiation therapy within 21 days; however, if the radiation portal covered ≤ 5% of the
             bone marrow reserve, the patient is eligible irrespective of the end date of
             radiotherapy. None of the recently irradiated lesions can be included in the
             measurable disease assessment.

          -  Cytotoxic therapy within 21 days (nitrosoureas or mitomycin within 42 days,
             capecitabine within 14 days).

          -  Monoclonal antibodies within 28 days.

          -  Current use of an investigational agent that is not expected to be cleared by Cycle 1
             Day 1.

        Note: Continuation of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists for prostate
        cancer, bisphosphonates or denosumab for bone metastases.

             Stage 1 prostate cancer or others deemed to be cured by surgery alone or surgery plus
             radiotherapy in the judgment of the Investigator may enroll irrespective of the time
             of diagnosis.

          -  Medical, psychiatric, cognitive, or other conditions that compromise the patient's
             ability to understand the patient information, to give informed consent, to comply

             heart failure, uncontrolled hypertension, unstable angina pectoris, or cardiac
             arrhythmia) which, in the judgment of the Investigator, would make the patient
             inappropriate for study participation.

          -  Known symptomatic active central nervous system (CNS) metastases and/or carcinomatous
             meningitis. Stable doses of corticosteroids for at least 2 weeks prior to enrollment
             for brain metastasis is allowed.

          -  Significant gastrointestinal abnormalities, including an inability to take oral
             medication, requirement for IV alimentation, active peptic ulcer, chronic diarrhea or
             vomiting considered to be clinically significant in the judgment of the Investigator,
             or prior surgical procedures affecting absorption.

          -  Known positive serology for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (HIV 1/2
             antibodies) or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-related illness, and/or known
             active hepatitis B (e.g., hepatitis B surface antigen-reactive) or hepatitis C (e.g.,
             hepatitis C virus ribonucleic acid [qualitative]).

          -  Pregnant or lactating females.

          -  12-lead electrocardiography (ECG) demonstrating a QT interval corrected for heart rate
             using Fridericia's formula (QTcF) of ≥ 480 msec for males and ≥ 480 msec for females
             (mean of the triplicate ECG measurements), with the exception for patients with an
             atrioventricular pacemaker or other conditions (e.g., right bundle branch block) that
             render the QT measurement invalid.

          -  History or current evidence of congenital long QT syndrome.

          -  Taking medications that lead to significant QT prolongation.
