  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will measure the oral bioavailability and pharmacokinetics of known bioactive
      compounds from a standardized Centella asiatica water extract product (CAP) in mildly
      demented elders on cholinesterase inhibitor therapy. Compound levels will be measured in
      human plasma and urine over 12 hours after acute oral administration of two doses of the
      botanical extract product. The dose giving maximum plasma levels (Cmax)closest to those
      observed in the investigator's mouse studies, the area under the curve (AUC0-12), as well as
      the rate of clearance (t Â½) of the known compounds and time of maximum concentration (tmax),
      will be identified. These data will be used to inform decisions on the dosage and dosing
      frequency for future clinical trials.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

        1. To assess the bioavailability and rate of clearance of Centella asiatica derived
           compounds in mildly demented elders on cholinesterase inhibitor therapy through a
           pharmacokinetic study.

        2. To determine the acute tolerability of a Centella asiatica product in mildly demented
           elders on cholinesterase inhibitor therapy.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants will orally consume a single administration of a standardized Centella asiatica
      water extract product (CAP). Two doses (2g and 4g CAW) will be administered on separate
      occasions, at least two weeks apart. The levels of known bioactive compounds present in
      Centella asiatica will be measured in human plasma and urine over 12 hours after
      administration of each of the doses.

    <masking_description>Randomization will use an arm equivalence design to promote equal numbers of participants for each order schema. All participants will be blinded to the dose they will be receiving at each visit. The investigators have developed a formulation that tastes and looks very similar at each dose. The investigator administering the intervention and the analyst performing the liquid chromatography analysis of collected plasma will be blinded as to the dose of the product administered. The liquid chromatography analyst will also be blinded as to the time point of collection.</masking_description>
