  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim is to evaluate the electrocardiogram quality signal of the Cardioskin device and
      compare it with a Holter signal. For that, volunteers subjects will wear the Cardioskin and
      Holter, non-simultaneously, for about 24 hours.

      This study is open, and will be carried out according to a cross plan. The trial will include
      approximately 36-40 subjects between 18 and 70 years old.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The wear of the first device will be randomized. Each subject will wear the two devices.

      One group will start with a 24-hour environmental recording with Cardioskin and then will
      perform another recording of about 24 hours with the Holter. Conversely, group B will start
      with the Holter and then will continue with Cardioskin. It is a randomization software that
      will assign a group to each included participant.

      Each participant will come three times at hospital : one for inclusion and equipment of the
      first device, another to be unequipped and equipped of the second device. They will come
      another time to bring back the material. The total time of participation is of two days and
      half.

      The first aim is to evaluate if the signal interpretability is non-inferior to an Holter, for
      a recording of 24h (classic analysis of rhythm).

      The second aim is to evaluate if the 24 hours signal interpretability is non-inferior to an
      Holter in the case of a repolarization analysis.

      The third aim is to compare the comfort and usability between Cardioskin and Holter.
