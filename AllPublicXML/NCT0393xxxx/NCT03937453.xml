  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main goal of this study is to explore the relationship between new-onset diabetes
      mellitus and a subsequent diagnosis of pancreatic cancer. Magnetic Resonance Imaging and
      Magnetic cholangiopancreatography (MRI/MRCP) will be utilized to screen for early stage
      pancreatic cancer or precursor lesions. Participants will be asked to donate a blood sample
      at specific intervals for the creation of a bio-bank necessary for the development of a blood
      based screening test for pancreatic cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Individuals between 50-80 years of age who have developed diabetes mellitus within the
      preceding year will be recruited through the offices of primary care physicians and
      endocrinologists. Those meeting initial criteria will meet with a research nurse and will
      undergo a secondary screen to determine eligibility. Individuals enrolled in the study will
      undergo a five-minute psychological survey and donation of a blood sample for bio-bank
      analysis every 6 months for 3 years. MRI will be performed annually for 2 years (3 in total).
      Any abnormalities on MRI will be reviewed by a multi-disciplinary tumor board and discussed
      with the participant.

          -  Transition from pre-Diabetes to Diabetes Mellitus within the past 12 months
             characterized by a change in the HbA1c of ≥ 0.5% OR

          -  DM With Only One FDR: DM diagnosed within the past 12 months that is of Confirmed or
             Unconfirmed Duration, in an individual with 1 FDR. Requirement for HbA1c ≥ 6.5%.
