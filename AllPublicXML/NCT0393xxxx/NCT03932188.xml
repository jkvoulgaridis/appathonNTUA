    <textblock>
      This study assesses brain connectivity and function of individuals ages 13-25 at a prodromal
      or early stage of a psychotic disorder. Participation involves approximately 3 hours of MRI
      scanning and up to 6 hours of behavioral testing at Washington University School of
      Medicine's campus.

      Schizophrenia is a devastating illness inflicting about 1% of the population worldwide.
      Symptoms of schizophrenia include paranoia, hallucinations, and disorganized behaviors, and
      is associated with lifelong occupational and social disability. It typically develops in
      adolescence or early adulthood, which are particularly formative periods in life when major
      educational, vocational, and social life changes occur, and then the brain undergoes a
      rearrangement of critical neural circuits. The &quot;prodrome&quot; is the period before the onset of a
      psychotic disorder, like schizophrenia. Prodromal youth often have significant emotional
      distress and social withdrawal, and family members may observe a concerning change in
      behavior or school or work performance. Identifying those at clinical high risk for a
      psychotic disorder is important, as early intervention can improve symptoms and functioning,
      and could prevent the eventual development of a psychotic disorder. This study will focus on
      individuals aged 13-25 years who have met criteria for a psychosis-risk syndrome (or
      attenuated psychosis syndrome) or are at a very early stage (first 3 years after diagnosis)
      of a psychotic disorder, such as schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. Involvement will
      be either 2 or 3 partial days at Washington University and will involve approximately 3 hours
      of MRI scanning and up to 6 hours of behavioral testing. Additionally, the investigators will
      study the effect of genetics on the patterns of brain connectivity in various psychiatric
      populations. DNA will be collected non-invasively from saliva and stored and processed in
      Washington University facilities.

    <description>The current project aims to uncover latent, homogenous, connectivity phenotypes using neuroimaging tools, which are free from the limitations of traditional diagnostic boundaries, and which correlate with clinical characteristics. The investigator will use resting state functional connectivity MRI (rs-fcMRI), diffusion MRI (dMRI) and tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) to identify brain signatures that cut across psychotic disorders, including schizophrenia.</description>

          -  Male or female between the ages of 13 and 25

          -  Meet diagnostic criteria for a prodromal syndrome or early psychosis by either
             meeting: 1) criteria for psychosis-risk on the structured assessment of psychosis-risk
             syndrome, or 2) meeting criteria for a psychotic disorder on the SCID diagnostic
             interview only within the last 3 years.

          -  Understand and sign an informed consent (or assent form for minors) document in
             English

          -  IQ of 70 or under

          -  Past or current history of clinically significant central nervous system disorder that
             may contribute to psychotic symptoms or confound their assessment

          -  The diagnostic symptoms are clearly caused by an Axis I disorder, including substance
             use disorders, as judged by the evaluating clinician.
