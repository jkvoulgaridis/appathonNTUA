  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an inherited inborn error of phenylalanine (PHE) metabolism caused
      by decreased activity of phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) enzyme. Therefore, PHE accumulates
      in plasma leading to mental problems. Treatment is a phenylalanine-restricted diet with
      sufficient protein. However, the optimum protein requirements are still unknown and
      compliance with diet is not satisfactory in PKU adults. A Previously established technique
      called indicator amino acid oxidation (IAAO) will be used to determine protein requirements
      from amino acid based formula vs. glycomacropeptide (GMP) in adults with PKU (≥ 19y). This
      study will help treat adults with enough protein ensuring maintenance of health.
