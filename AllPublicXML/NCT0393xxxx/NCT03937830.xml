  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most common cancer in the world. Most people with
      advanced HCC survive an average of 6 to 9 months. Researchers want to see if a combination of
      drugs can stop HCC from getting worse. This could help people with HCC live longer.

      Objective:

      To study the 6-month progression-free survival in people with advanced HCC treated with
      bevacizumab, durvalumab, and TACE.

      Eligibility:

      Adults ages 18 and older with intermediate or advanced HCC

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. They will have a CT
      and/or MRI scan. They will have heart tests. They will give blood, urine, and tumor samples.
      If no tumor sample is available, they will have a biopsy. They may have an endoscopy of their
      esophagus and stomach.

      Participants will get the study drugs in 21-day cycles:

        -  Two drugs will be injected into a vein every 3 weeks.

        -  One drug will be given under sedation. Medicine beads will be infused into artery
           branches. Participants may be kept overnight so they can be observed. This drug may be
           given once during the study, or more than one time.

      Participants will repeat some of the screening tests throughout the study.

      Participants may have to stop taking some of their cancer drugs during the study.

      Participants will stay in the study until their cancer gets worse or they can no longer
      tolerate the side effects of the drugs.

      Background:

        -  Worldwide, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most common malignancy with a
           median survival of 6-9 months.

        -  A class of agents that in the recent years has been at the epicenter of immunotherapy
           approaches in HCC are the monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against the immune checkpoint
           inhibitors CTLA4, PD-1 and PD-L1.

        -  Durvalumab is a human monoclonal antibody of the immunoglobulin G1 kappa (IgG1 )
           subclass. Durvalumab inhibits binding of programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) to
           programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) and CD80. Anti-PD-L1 antibodies directly target tumor
           cells and are expected to have less adverse events in comparison with anti-PD-1
           antibodies that target effector T-cells in the tumor microenvironment.

        -  Angiogenesis is defined as the formation of new blood capillaries, which is a complex
           process that promotes vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and other proangiogenic
           factor expression, thus enhancing metastasis. Inhibition of VEGF function by bevacizumab
           can lead to the inhibition of the new blood vessels formation surrounding a tumor, and
           consequenly arrest the tumor growth by depriving essential nutrients and oxygen.

        -  TACE has been shown to induce anti-tumor immunity.

        -  Early phase study has showed anti-VEGF bevacizumab with TACE diminishes

      neovascular formation.

      -We have previously shown that the locoregional therapies can be safely combined with immune
      checkpoint blockade. There are also preclinical data suggesting that anti-VEGF therapy may
      target myeloid cells with suppressor activity.

      Objective:

      -To evaluate 6-month progression free survival (PFS) in patients with advanced HCC treated
      with bevacizumab, durvalumab and TACE.

      Eligibility:

        -  Histopathological confirmation of HCC OR histopathological confirmation of carcinoma in
           the setting of clinical and radiological characteristics which, together with the
           pathology, are highly suggestive of a diagnosis of HCC

        -  HCC of intermediate (B) or advanced (C) stage per Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC)
           classification.

        -  Patients must have disease that is not amenable to potentially curative resection,
           radiofrequency ablation, or liver transplantation.

      Design:

      -This is an open label Phase II trial conducted to evaluate efficiency of durvalumab,

      bevacizumab and TACE combined treatment in patients with advanced HCC.

        -  Initially 6 patients with BCLC Stage C will be enrolled into safety run-in of Arm 1 to
           determine the safety of combined treatment, including one TACE.

        -  Once safety has been determined, subsequent patients will be enrolled in Arm 1 (patients
           with BCLC Stage C) and Arm 2, including more than one TACE (patients with BCLC Stage B).

        -  Treatment will continue until progression or unbearable toxicity.

               -  The effects of study drugs on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this
                  reason, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate
                  contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to

          -  Active central nervous system metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis. Patients
             with known brain metastases will be excluded from this clinical trial because of their
             poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction that
             would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events

          -  Congestive heart failure, baseline LVEF &lt;50%, transmural myocardial infarction,

             lupus erythematosus, Wegener s granulomatosis, sarcoidosis syndrome etc.) or other
             connective tissue diseases with symptomatic disease within the 3 years of enrollment.
             Note: Active vitiligo or a history of vitiligo will not be a basis for exclusion.

          -  Patients who have undergone prior liver transplantation.

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because durvalumab s and bevacizumab s
             potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects is unknown. Because there is an
             unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to
             treatment of the mother with durvalumab and bevacizumab, breastfeeding should be
             discontinued if the mother is treated with study drugs.
