      It is now well established that infants should be placed on the back only in a SleepSack
      without coverage or plush or pillow on a firm mattress in a bedroom. Despite these old
      recommendations of good practice, deviations are observed and some infants are most always
      lying according to the recommended position. The goal is to assess the impact of an
      information campaign of staffs maternity of the CHU of Reims on the practices of the sleeping
      of infants to motherhood, and then at the home of the parents.
