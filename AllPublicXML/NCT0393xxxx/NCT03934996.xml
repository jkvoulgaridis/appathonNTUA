      Introduction: Women are more likely to suffer injuries in the Pelvic Floor (PF) and Urinary
      Incontinence (UI) because of their anatomical characteristics. Their participation in the
      sports field has been more active recently. There are studies that correlate the race with
      presenting weakness of the SP muscles and Stress Urinary Incontinence (SUI), so the race is
      considers as a risk factor for these affectations. However, there are few studies of
      real-time measurements during running. Some runners may even present SUI during daily
      activities (ADL). The UI is not only a physical problem but also affects the social,
      emotional, psychological, sexual and professional level and may even lower their self-esteem
      or renounce the physical activity.

      Objectives: The purpose of this study is to perform measurements of different variables in
      real time while running and in their ADL. The main objective is to analyze the relationship
      between the PF muscles and the other variables along the different tasks of daily life and
      during the race. The secondary objectives are to differentiate these neuromuscular,
      physiological and biomechanical responses of PF and abdominal girdle (AG) according to the
      type of stroke, duration, intensity and distance. And compare results between both group
      (interventional group and no interventional group).

      Material and method: Randomized clinical trial will be performed with 59 female runners aged
      25-44 years. The sample will be divided into two groups randomly. The study will be carried
      out health center called &quot;Tiro de Pichón&quot; in Málaga.

    <description>Using SF-12 health survey scoring demonstration. It provides a profile of the state of health and is one of the most commonly used generic scales in the evaluation of clinical outcomes. It is a self-administered instrument of 12 items from the 8 dimensions of the SF-36: Physical Function (2), Social Function (1), Physical Role (2), Emotional Role (2), Mental Health (2), Vitality (1) ), Corporal Pain (1), General Health (1). For each of the 8 dimensions, the items are coded, aggregated and transformed into a scale that ranges from 0 (the worst state of health for that dimension) to 100 (the best state of health). Validated by Ware J Jr, Kosinki M, Meller SD. and the Spanish version by Vilagut et al., 2008, who obtained an internal consistency coefficient of about 0.9 for Sf-36 and lower light for SF-12. The Cronbach alpha coefficients of the summary components of the SF-12 exceeded the proposed minimum of 0.7 for group comparisons.</description>

    <description>Intervention will consist of an educational talk to know the anatomy and function of the Pelvic Floor Muscles and 20 minutes of both strength and endurance exercises with biofeedback. An exercise protocol will be carried out. The participants will be instruct to contract and maintain maximum force for a mean period of 6 seconds (endurance training) and rest for twice the length of the endurance training time, followed by three fast contractions in a row as strength training. It will be done twice a week, during 12 weeks.
