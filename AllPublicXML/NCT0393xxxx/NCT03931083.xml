  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cervical cancer in HIV-positive women is largely preventable through regular screening. The
      World Health Organization (WHO) recommends cervical screening for HIV-positive women every
      three years. Currently the least costly method for screening and the most viable option for
      many countries is visual inspection after application of acetic acid (VIA). Alternative
      testing methods are HPV testing and assessment with a portable magnification device. The
      investigators plan to assess and compare the screening test accuracy of these screening tests
      in women living with HIV. All women will receive histopathology reference standard.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The simplest and least costly method for cervical cancer screening is visual inspection after
      application of acetic acid (VIA). However, the ability of this screening method to correctly
      identify precancerous lesions (sensitivity) and women free from these lesions (specificity)
      is limited. The investigators aim to identify alternative screening methods which maximize
      sensitivity and specificity, particularly in HIV-infected women in receiving care in Southern
      Africa. The investigators will evaluate the screening test accuracy of a new portable
      magnification device , the Gynocular™ with Swede score assessment, in women who are
      HIV-positive and eligible for cervical cancer screening. The investigators will assess the
      accuracy of the device when used as a stand alone test, as well as when used subsequent to
      positive VIA or HPV tests. The investigators will make comparisons with current screening
      practices (VIA alone), as well as, recommended screening practices (HPV testing). The
      investigators will enrol 450 HIV-positive women receiving care for HIV/AIDS at the Centre for
      Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, in Lusaka, Zambia. Consenting women will be screened
      with VIA, HPV testing and visual assessment with Gynocular™. All women undergo biopsy
      (reference standard) and receive treatment as indicated and in accordance with national
      guidelines.

Given the health system in this context is not centralized, it is most efficient to ask participants to report these to the clinical team and investigators. Information describing these events will include: time of onset, duration, resolution, action to be taken, assessment of intensity, relationship with study treatment. The clinical team will also complete assessments of seriousness, causality and expectedness. Participants are asked to inform the clinical team immediately if any AE occur in the 9 months following their initial enrolment. At each visit, the Study nurse/assistant will also inquire about any adverse events that have occurred, for verification. For each adverse event found the investigators will calculate crude frequencies.</description>

These steps include: visualization of the vagina, vulva and cervix following insertion of a speculum, magnified assessment after application of normal saline, examination of cervical vessel patterns using the red-free mode (or green filter), application of 5% acetic acid for 1 minute and finally assessment following application with Lugol's iodine. The findings of the live examination will be documented using the parameters of the Swede score. Each parameter is scored between zero and two. Treatment will be based on the results found at histopathology, unless the woman is also VIA positive in which case, after biopsy she will undergo routine treatment as per local guidelines. The results will be used to determine the optimal threshold for treatment in WLHIV.</description>

Using specific single-use cervical cytobrush provided by GeneXpert, a specimen will be collected immediately prior to VIA examination. Cervical cytobrush specimens will be placed into ThinPrep PreservCyt (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA) immediately after collection. The HR-HPV testing of cervical specimens will be conducted by a GeneXpert™ machine (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA), which will be placed at the health facility and will be operated by a trained nurse in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Additionally, as part of the baseline clinical characteristics of the study participant, the study participant will undergo an STI test at the same time.

    <description>VIA, which is standard of care for cervical cancer screening in Zambia, will be carried out using the methodology described by IARC. This is summarized as follows: visualization of the vagina, vulva and cervix following insertion of a speculum; assessment with the naked eye after application of normal saline; and further assessment after application of 5% acetic acid for 1 minute. This will be recorded as normal or abnormal by the assessor.</description>

    <description>All acetowhite lesions will be biopsied. When no lesion is seen, one biopsy is taken from each quadrant at the squamocolumnar junction. Biopsies will be sent and examined in a South African based lab. All histological slides will also be verified independently by an IARC trained pathologist at the end of the study. Histological endpoints are defined by the CIN classification system: CIN 1 affects only the lower third of the epithelium (mild dysplasia), CIN 2 involves two thirds of the epithelium and CIN 3 involves the full thickness (severe dysplasia and carcinoma in situ). These findings can be dichotomized by the Lower Anogenital Squamous Terminology into low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL) and high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL). All patients with CIN grade 2 that stained diffusely positive for p16 are considered as HSIL, all patients with CIN 3 are considered as HSIL. Expression of p16 will be visually assessed by immunohistochemistry.</description>

      For a biopsy, a very small sample (appr. 2X2X1 mm3) of tissue is taken from the cervix. The
      study nurse will take the biopsies after the Gynocular™ exam. Biopsies are taken of all
      acetowhite lesions. If no lesions are seen, a total of 4 biopsies will be taken within the
      transformation zone (12, 3, 6 and 9 o' clock positions). Bleeding is minimal, the biopsy site
      does not require stitches. The length of time it takes for this to heal varies but can be
      approximately 7 days. If the study participant informs the study nurse of any biopsy-related
      adverse event (AE), the study nurse will record this information in the study-specific data
      collection tool for AEs. The clinical team will manage the AE according to national
      guidelines and follow-up with the participant until the event is resolved.

        The study population includes women who are enrolled in the ART program at Kanyama Clinic,
        Lusaka, Zambia. Kanyama Clinic is situated on the western side of the central business
        district, 3km away from the town centre. It has a catchment population of 262,715. It has
        registered 52,658 people living with HIV, of which 40,650 have commenced treatment. In
        addition to ART services, the clinic has also been providing cervical cancer screening
        since October 2006. The clinic is well established in the application of cancer screening
        based on a &quot;screen-and-treat&quot; approach, where women undergo visual screening, followed by
        immediate treatment where possible. Since inception in 2006, the clinic has screened over
        23,900 women for cervical cancer. Clinic nurses are trained to offer cervical cancer
        screening and treatment with cryotherapy or thermal coagulation and to refer suspicious
        cases for LEEP and further treatment.
