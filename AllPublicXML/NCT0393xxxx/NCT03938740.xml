      This is a 24-week, open-label, multiple dose safety, tolerability and efficacy study. There
      is a 12-week run-in phase when all subjects receive Insulin Lispro and Insulin Degludec for
      12 weeks. After completing the run-in period, subjects then are randomized to a treatment
      group of either HDV- Insulin lispro + Insulin Degludec (Degludec dose reduced by 40%) or
      HDV-Insulin lispro+ Insulin Degludec (Degludec dose reduced by 10%) for 12 weeks of
      treatment.

             adequate contraceptive measures, such as, intra-uterine device [IUD], oral or
             injectable contraceptives, or barrier method plus spermicide.

          3. Has at Screening been diagnosed as T1DM for at least 12 months.

          4. Has at Screening C-peptide ≤0.8 ng/mL (single retest allowed).

          5. Has at Screening been on treatment with rapid analog insulin for the previous six (6)
             months.

          6. Has at Screening willingness to use continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) technology
             throughout study.

          7. Is, for the duration of the study, willing to use insulin lispro as the only analog
             bolus insulin and insulin degludec as the only basal insulin.

          8. Has at Screening a BMI ≥18.0 kg/m2 and ≤33.0 kg/m2.

          9. Has at Screening HbA1c ≥6.5% and ≤8.5%.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Has known or suspected allergy to any component of any of the study drugs in this
             trial.

          2. Is, at Screening, pregnant or breast-feeding, or intends to become pregnant at any
             time during the duration of the study.

          8. Has, within one (1) month prior to Screening, received any investigational drug.

          9. Has, within two (2) months prior to Screening, used an insulin pump delivery system.

         10. Has, within three (3) months prior to Screening, smoked tobacco or used any smokeless
             tobacco or nicotine delivery system (inhaled, oral or buccal).

         11. Has at Screening, as judged by the Site Investigator, any condition (intrinsic or
             extrinsic) that could reasonably be expected to interfere with trial participation,
             confound evaluation of the data, or pose additional risk to adhering to the study
             protocol. Examples of such conditions include but are not limited to:

               -  Clinically significant active disease of the gastrointestinal, cardiovascular,
                  hepatic, neurological, renal, genitourinary, or hematological systems;
