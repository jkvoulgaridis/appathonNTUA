        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants are overtly healthy as medical evaluation, including medical history,
             physical examination, laboratory tests, and cardiac monitoring

          -  Participants are stable non-smokers for at least 3 months preceding screening

          -  Male or female participants agree to be consistent with local regulations on
             contraception methods

          -  Female participants are not pregnant or breastfeeding, and at least one of the
             following condition applies:

          -  Not a woman of childbearing potential (WOCBP) or

          -  If a WOCBP, use a highly effective contraceptive method (that is, with a failure rate
             of less than (&lt;) 1 percent per year, preferably with low user dependency for the
             following time period:

          -  Before the first dose of the study intervention, if using hormonal contraception:

          -  Has completed at least one 4-week cycle of an oral contraception pill and either had
             or has begun her menses or

          -  Has used a depot contraceptive or extended-cycle oral contraceptive for least 28 days
             and has a documented negative pregnancy test using a highly sensitive assay and

          -  A barrier method

          -  During the intervention period

          -  After the study intervention period (that is after the last dose of study intervention
             is administered) for at least 90 days, plus 30 days (a menstrual cycle) after the last
             dose of study intervention and agree not to donate eggs (ova, oocytes) for

             hours before the first dose of study intervention If a urine test cannot be confirmed
             as negative (example: an ambiguous result), a serum pregnancy test is required

          -  The Investigator reviews the medical history, menstrual history, and recent sexual
             activity to decrease the risk for inclusion of a female with an early undetected
             pregnancy

          -  When having sexual intercourse with a WOCBP, who is not currently pregnant, and advise
             her to use a highly effective contraceptive method with a failure rate of &lt;1 percent
             per year, since a condom may break or leak

             within 6 months prior to screening

          -  History of any malignancy

          -  History of chronic or recurrent acute infection or any bacterial, viral, parasitic or
             fungal infections within 30 days prior to screening and at any time between screening
             and admission, or hospitalization due to infection within 6 months prior to screening

          -  History of shingles within 12 months prior to screening

          -  History of drug hypersensitivity, ascertained or presumptive allergy/hypersensitivity
             to the active drug substance and/or formulation ingredients

          -  History of alcoholism or drug abuse within 2 years prior to screening, or evidence of
             such abuse as indicated by the laboratory assays conducted during screening

          -  History of residential exposure to tuberculosis, or a positive QuantiFERON® test
             within 4 weeks prior to screening

          -  Administration of live vaccines or live-attenuated virus vaccines within 3 months
             prior to screening

          -  Any condition, including findings in the laboratory tests, medical history, or other
             screening assessments, that in the opinion of the Investigator constitutes an
             inappropriate risk or a contraindication for participation in the study or that could
             interfere with the study's objectives, conduct, or evaluation
