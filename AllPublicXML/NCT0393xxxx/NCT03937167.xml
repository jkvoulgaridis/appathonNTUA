  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity has reached pandemic proportions in recent years, affecting not only the physical
      health, but also the mental health, of obese people. According to Spain's National Health
      Survey 2011-12, the prevalence of obesity in the adult population of Spain was 17%, having
      increased by 2.5% since 2006. Therefore, a constant and worrying increase in the prevalence
      of obesity is being observed, which is having a great impact, both individually, in terms of
      health and quality of life, and socially, inter alia, by raising health expenditure due to
      increased morbidity.

      In this context, the desirability of a comprehensive approach that includes psychological
      intervention in attending obese patients (Rev Cochrane, 2006), has been given greater
      prominence. Paying attention to the emotional and psychopathological aspects related to
      obesity has proven to be an action that could have positive impact on obesity intervention
      models.

      The aim of this project is to measure, through a clinical trial, the efficacy of a
      psychotherapy group program for obesity patients who are attended by the consulting
      endocrinologist at the Infanta Leonor Hospital (Madrid). The impact of body mass index,
      psychological wellbeing, psychopathology and quality of life of two experimental study groups
      will be compared, one a control group of patients that follows the standard treatment, the
      other an experimental group that follows not only the standard treatment, but also the
      psychotherapy group intervention program.
