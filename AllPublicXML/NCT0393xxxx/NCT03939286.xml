  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to gain a better understanding of metabolic early changes in
      neurodegenerative diseases, in order to enable new diagnostic and therapeutic approaches in
      the future. Further, it aims to identify specific movement-induced changes at the cerebral
      level, on cognition, on quality of life and physical fitness, and on serology parameters in
      neurodegenerative diseases.

      In general, valid biomarkers are needed for early diagnosis and prediction of disease
      progression. It has been hypothesized that metabolic changes may precede structural changes
      and may be examined by intervention with exercise therapy. The non-invasive, in vivo
      characterization and diagnosis of such metabolic changes is therefore of paramount
      importance. In this line, this research project is focused on applying magnetic resonance
      imaging (MRI) based metabolic imaging techniques such as sodium MRI and phosphorus magnetic
      resonance spectroscopy (MRS) with standard structural and functional MRI methods, combined
      with exercise training, in order to detect biomarkers early in different stages of
      neurodegenerative diseases. Moreover, this project aims to examine the sensitivity of
      metabolic imaging with sodium and phosphorus sequences over classical MRI imaging with whole
      body fat sequences, in order to detect cerebral alterations.

      At the end, the medical benefit of the planned project lies in the fact that the expected
      findings are groundbreaking for the understanding of the phenomenology and pathobiology of
      neurodegenerative diseases. This is the basis for the development of new methods for early
      diagnosis and individualized medicine with the optimization of future treatment options.
