  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this school-based cycling intervention called &quot;Cycling and Walk to School&quot; (PACO,
      for its Spanish acronym) will be to examine their effects on adolescent's cycling to and from
      school and physical activity (PA). This study will also examine the effects of this
      intervention in several active commuting to and from school (ACS)-related variables belonging
      to Self-Determination Theory (SDT) and Social-Ecological Model (SEM).

  <detailed_description>

      This study will also examine the effects of this intervention in several active commuting to
      and from school (ACS)-related variables belonging to SDT and SEM. In this randomized
      controlled trial will participate 360 adolescents, belonging to six secondary schools (three
      experimental and three control) from three Spanish cities. The intervention will be conducted
      by both the research staff and the physical education (PE) teacher through four cycling
      sessions (one per week). PA levels will be measured by accelerometers, and the other study
      variables by using self-reported scales, before and after the intervention programme. The
      primary outcomes will be: cycling to school, ACS, and PA levels. The secondary outcomes will
      be: SDT (Self-Determination Theory) -related variables in ACS and individual, interpersonal,
      communittal and environmental variables related to ACS belonging to SEM (Social-Ecological
      Model). The findings of this study will provide a comprehensive understanding of the effects
      of this short-term school-based intervention on cycling to school and PA levels of Spanish
      adolescents.
