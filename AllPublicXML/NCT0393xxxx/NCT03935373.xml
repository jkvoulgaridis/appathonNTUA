      Objective: To explore the association among gene, TCM pattern, TCM tongue diagnosis and TCM
      pulse diagnosis with the DNA Exome sequencing tools for Sjögren's syndrome

      Method:

      This study wants to establish the reference value of DNA gene variants of healthy control for
      comparing with the Sjögren's syndrome subjects. And the investigators want to use the DNA
      Exome sequencing tools, proteomics and oral microbiome to explore the association of gene
      expression between at least 30 Sjögren's syndrome subjects and at least 10 healthy control
      subjects. Finally, the investigators also analyze the association among gene expression,
      proteomics and oral microbiome, TCM pattern, TCM tongue diagnosis, TCM pulse diagnosis, and
      heart rate variability (HRV) for this purpose.

      Expected Results:

        1. To evaluate the difference among TCM pattern, TCM tongue diagnosis, TCM pulse diagnosis,
           and HRV for the Sjögren's syndrome and healthy control.

        2. To evaluate the immunity-related gene expression for the Sjögren's syndrome and healthy
           control.

        3. To evaluate the proteomics for the Sjögren's syndrome and healthy control.

        4. To evaluate the oral microbiome for the Sjögren's syndrome and healthy control.

        5. To evaluate the association among the immunity-related gene expression, SSA, SSB and RF.
