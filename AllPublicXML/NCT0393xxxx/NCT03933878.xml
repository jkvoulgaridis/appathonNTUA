  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pneumonias and lower respiratory tract infections can have important long-term consequences,
      particularly in the context of lung transplantation, where pneumonia is a major cause of
      death. Candidate organs and lung transplant recipients undergo bronchoscopic inspection to
      assess for lower respiratory tract infection, but traditional culture methods take time,
      leading to increased risk from inappropriate therapy. The investigators hypothesize that the
      rapid detection of lower respiratory tract infection, using a semi-quantitative multiplex
      molecular assay, can decrease the time to appropriate clinical decision making.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Before and after lung transplantation, clinical decision-making for infection diagnosis can
      be delayed by the time requirements of traditional culture techniques. This study will enroll
      lung transplant donor candidates and recipients undergoing assessment for lower respiratory
      tract infection by bronchoscopic alveolar lavage (or washing). The investigators will record
      bronchoscopy time and time to test result and clinical management decision based on
      traditional culture methods. The investigators will perform a semi-quantitative multiplex
      molecular assay for lower respiratory tract infection using the BioFire Pneumonia Panel and
      these results will be evaluated by clinicians not directly involved in patient care. Timing
      and outcome of clinical decision making will be recorded. The investigators will compare the
      time to result using a paired Student's t-test between traditional and molecular methods.
      Secondary endpoints include time to clinical decision, postulated changes in clinical
      decisions, and agreement between methods.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects will be included if subjects are able and willing to provide informed consent
             for this study as part of an ongoing prospective biorepository and clinical data
             repository cohort study.

          -  Donors can be included as subjects if families provide informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Samples from donor organs will be excluded if the organs are unlikely likely to be
             used based on review of preliminary data.

          -  Post-transplant samples will be excluded if the suspicion for infection is
             sufficiently low that lavage samples are not sent for microbiologic workup or there is
             insufficient sample for research.
