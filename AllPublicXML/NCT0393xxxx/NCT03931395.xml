  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tonsillectomies are the second most common surgery with over half a million procedures in the
      United States for 2006. Tonsillectomies are considered a painful surgical procedure performed
      on children resulting in pain and nausea/vomiting for up to 7 days postoperatively. Up until
      recently, doctors have been prescribing upwards of ten days' worth of opioid pain medication
      for children following tonsillectomies due to the high incidence of pain expected afterwards.
      Effective July 1st, 2018, new laws regarding opioid restrictions came into place that
      restricted doctor's abilities to write for more than three days' worth of opioid pain
      medication without having to fill out sizeable amounts of additional paperwork. This law was
      put in place to combat the ongoing opioid epidemic that plagues this country. What the
      investigators are left with for the treatment of pain following these procedures are simply
      Tylenol and Motrin with a limited amount of opioid. With this being considered a highly
      painful surgery with a difficult recovery, more options are needed to effectively treat pain
      and reduce the incidence of emergency room visits and phone calls to the clinic regarding
      pain control in the postoperative period.

      Studies in Europe have shown that honey is an effective adjunct treatment option in the
      reduction of pain in pediatric postoperative tonsillectomies. These studies are few and far
      between and more research needs to be conducted to validate these claims particularly in the
      United States where research on this subject has been extremely limited. Further, the extent
      to which families and health care providers in the United States would be receptive to using
      honey for children's postoperative pain is unclear since honey is considered a complementary
      and alternative medicine (CAM) intervention.

    <measure>Beliefs and receptiveness of patient families to complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) and use of honey.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Families will be given a CAM questionnaire to complete. The questionnaire asks families to rate on a scale of strongly disagree to strongly agree and asks questions like &quot;The more knowledge a person has about CAM, the more likely they are to use it&quot; and &quot;There are less side effects when taking natural remedies&quot; Families who select strongly disagree = they definitely do not agree with the statement. If they select strongly agree = they very much agree with the statement. Families will get this survey at the beginning of the study and get it again at the end to evaluate if their statement responses have changed.
The beliefs and attitudes toward CAM were measured based on a 7-point Likert scale, with 1 representing strongly agree and 7 representing strongly disagree; mean scores and standard deviation were calculated for each of the 13 items.</description>

    <description>Nursing staff will receive a voluntary survey containing the CAM belief scale. The survey asks nurses to rate on a scale of Strongly disagree to Strongly agree and asks questions such as &quot;I assess my patient for CAM use&quot; or &quot;I believe that CAM has a role in my practice.&quot; Strongly disagree = they definitely do not agree with the statement, strongly agree = They strongly agree with the statement.
