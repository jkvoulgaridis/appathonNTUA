  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Phantom limb pain occurs in the majority of people who lose a limb. It significantly affects
      quality of life and is hard to manage. Recent evidence suggests that mirror therapy and
      similar techniques that create a visual representation of the missing limb under the control
      of the patient may reduce phantom limb pain.

      The investigators previously explored the use of a virtual reality environment for this
      purpose with people with upper limb loss but found that using it within the clinical setting
      limited its potential efficacy. Phantom limb pain is highly variable and assessing the
      effects of the activity during a hospital appointment when the phantom pain may not be
      present, or may not be problematic, made it difficult to judge the effects adequately.

      This study involves training the patient in the clinic to use a portable, self-contained
      virtual reality system which they will then use at home, unsupervised, for 2 months. The aim
      is to discover whether phantom limb pain intensity decreases by performing an activity in a
      virtual reality environment in which a visual representation of the missing limb is
      controlled by the patient. Participants will be directed to use the system every day, and
      whenever their phantom limb pain is present and problematic.
