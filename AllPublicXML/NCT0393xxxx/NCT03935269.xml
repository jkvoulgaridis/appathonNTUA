  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this single arm, open label study, investigators will evaluate the feasibility of using
      the Cereset (formerly known as HIRREM - high-resolution relational, resonance-based
      electroencephalic mirroring) intervention for a stressed population confronting an acute
      burden on their lives - caregivers of newly diagnosed high-grade glioma patients. The Cereset
      intervention is a closed-loop acoustic stimulation intervention that has been studied in
      patients with PTSD, insomnia, postural orthostatic tachycardia, and military veterans.

      Primary Objective:

      â€¢ To determine the feasibility of completing the prescribed Cereset Research Office
      intervention for trial participants in this single arm, open label study.

      Secondary Objectives

        -  To assess the tolerability of the intervention

        -  To assess changes in trial participant wellbeing and quality of life.

        -  To assess changes in physiological response at pre-intervention and post-intervention
           time points.

      Exploratory Objectives

        -  To assess the utilization of Cereset Research Wearable (portable, limited scope wearable
           device) after the CRO intervention.

        -  To assess the participant acceptability of the Cereset Research Intervention.

    <measure>Incidence of Adverse Events During Cereset Research Office Intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>4 months</time_frame>
    <description>Tolerability will be determined with adverse event monitoring and assessment of adverse events at visits 1, 2, 3, and 4 during Cereset Research Office Intervention using the CTCAE 5.0 (Grade 1-5, 1 = mild, 5 = death).

    <measure>Caregiver Interview</measure>
    <time_frame>4 months</time_frame>
    <description>Caregiver interview is a 21-item questionnaire that contains things a person might do when caring for a loved one with cancer. Scores ranges from 1-9 ('1' would state that the participant is not-at-all confident to accomplish the listed behavior; '9' would state that the participant is totally confident to accomplish the listed behavior. Numbers in the middle of the scale indicate that the participant is moderately confident to accomplish the listed behavior).</description>

    <description>The Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 is a validated, short seven item scale. Response scale = (not at all sure = 0; several days = 1; over half the days = 2; to nearly every day = 3). Scores of 5, 10, and 15 are taken as the cut-off points for mild, moderate and severe anxiety, respectively.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Insomnia Severity Index (ISI)</measure>
    <time_frame>4 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Insomnia Severity Index is a validated, 7 item self-report questionnaire assessing the nature, severity, and impact of insomnia in the past month. Rating scale (0 = very satisfied to 4 = very dissatisfied; 0 = not at all noticeable to 4 = very much noticeable; 0 = not at all worried to 4 = very much worried; 0 = not at all interfering to 4 = very much interfering).</description>

    <measure>Perceived Stress Scale Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>4 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) is a 10-item psychological instrument for measuring the perception of stress. It is a measure of the degree to which situations in one's life are appraised as stressful. Scale range is 0 = never, 4 = very often.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Collection of Biometric (BIOPAC) Data - Blood Pressure</measure>
    <time_frame>4 months</time_frame>
    <description>Continuous readings of systolic blood pressures will be acquired from finger arterial pressure measurements for a minimum of 10 minutes for physiologic changes in heart rate variability and baroreflex sensitivity at pre-intervention (B1) and during, and post-intervention time points (B2, B3). The recordings of systolic blood pressures will be analyzed for calculation of multiple standard measures of HRV including the standard deviation of normal to normal intervals (SDNN), and the root mean square of successive beat-to-beat differences in R-R interval duration (rMSSD).</description>
