  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rational: Preoxygenation is a standard procedure before (deep) sedation in the ED. However,
      there is literature suggesting that too much oxygen can be harmful. One potential detrimental
      effect is a decrease in cardiac output due to coronary vasoconstriction. So far, it is
      unknown if this effect is rate dependent and if it also occurs after only a short period of
      hyperoxia, as patients experience during procedural sedation pre-oxygenation.

      Objective: To investigate if hyperoxia has a negative effect on Cardiac index (CI) in
      patients undergoing procedural sedation in the ED.

      Methods: In patients needing sedation for a painful condition, non-invasive measurements of
      CI, stroke volume and total peripheral resistance are performed using the Clearsight
      non-invasive cardiac output monitoring system.. Measurements will be taken at baseline, after
      1,2 and 5 minutes of 15L O2/min, and then after another 2 and 5 minutes of flush rate oxygen
      and during the subsequent sedation.
