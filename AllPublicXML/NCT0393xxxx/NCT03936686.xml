  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was to examine the knowledge level regarding cardiovascular disease risk factors
      among participants of varying ages. Then to see if there was any type of previous education
      that led to greater knowledge levels.

      This study used a survey tool that assessed the participants' method(s) of prior education
      regarding cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors. Then the participant was asked eleven
      questions regarding CVD risk factors which tested their knowledge of those factors. Analysis
      was done to evaluate overall knowledge level of each group and compare the knowledge levels
      across age groups. Then analysis was done to see if any method(s) led to better knowledge
      level within and/or between age groups.

    <measure>Cardiovascular disease risk factor knowledge</measure>
    <time_frame>10-15 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>How well did the participant know the risk factors for cardiovascular disease. This was determined by using a survey tool that was shown to have internal validity using Chronbach alpha score. The survey had 11 questions regarding CVD risk factors and asked the participant if they felt the statement was completely true, somewhat true, neutral, somewhat untrue, or completely untrue. Survey scores were determined out of 55 total points.</description>

    <measure>Method(s) of education</measure>
    <time_frame>10-15 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>What methods of education regarding CVD risk factors did the participant previously have. The participant was asked various methods of previous education. These included school for younger participants, cardiac rehab for that group, TV, media, Internet, community groups, health care provider, family member experience, or family member discussion. The were tabulated individually and then comparisons were made within and between groups for methods of education used. Then these were correlated to survey scores too. These comparisons were made with chi-square with post-hoc tests, MANOVAs, and unpaired t-tests.</description>
