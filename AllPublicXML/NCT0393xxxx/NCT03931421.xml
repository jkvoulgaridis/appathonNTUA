  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It's a single arm, open label prospective study, in which the safety and efficacy of B Cell
      Maturation Antigen（BMCA）-targeted CAR-T thearpy are evaluated in refractory/relapsed multiple
      myeloma patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this trial, T cells are seperated from multiple myeloma patients, and engineered into
      BMCA-targeted CAR-T cells, these cells are then transfused back into the patients to
      elimimnate the myeloma cells. In this process, the safety and efficacy of this CAR-T
      treatment are closely monitored.
