  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This two-site study is a test of Attention Bias Modification Treatment (ABMT) among 260
      youths ages 10 to 14 years with social anxiety disorder. One-half of participants will
      receive 8 sessions of computer administered ABMT and the other half of participants will
      receive 8 sessions of computer administered Neutral Control Task (NCT). The investigators
      hypothesize that a biomarker of attention to social threat measured using
      electroencephalography (EEG) and ratings of social anxiety severity will be lower in
      participants who receive ABMT compared to participants who receive NCT.

    <description>At each of eight sessions, participants complete 160 computer administered trials wherein a pair of threatening stimuli and neutral stimuli is presented simultaneously and then followed immediately by a probe. The probe always replaces the neutral stimulus and never replaces the threatening stimulus. The intervention is based on the idea that attention can be shaped via repetitive computer based training methods, and training attention toward neutral stimuli will lead to a reduction in social anxiety.</description>
