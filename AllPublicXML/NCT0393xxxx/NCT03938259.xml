  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The sole objective in this study is to evaluate if routine amounts of opioids given for
      tonsillectomy in children have greater amounts of respiratory depression in children with
      documented obstructive sleep apnea when compared with patients that do not have obstructive
      sleep apnea

    <textblock>
      Ventilatory suppression in children following opioid administration is of obvious concern,
      especially following routine surgical procedures (i.e. adenotonsillectomy). It is thought
      that patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) have increased sensitivity to opioids, and
      especially in opioid na√Øve patients. Recent evidence in adults suggests that patients with
      moderate to severe OSA may not predispose patients to increased opioid sensitivity in the
      form of respiratory depression when compared with patients that do not have OSA. It is well
      known that OSA in children is significantly different from OSA in adults (e.g. gender
      predilection, central vs. peripheral causation). The manifestation and etiologies are very
      different in pediatric OSA making it a vastly different disease process.
