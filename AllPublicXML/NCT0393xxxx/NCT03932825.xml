  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims at investigating the persistence of antidepressant effect of Nitrous Oxide
      (N2O) for Treatment-Resistant Depression(TRD). The investigators also aim to assess the
      effect of N2O on the electroencephalograph, multimodal magnetic resonance imaging(MRI), blood
      cytokines, feces bacteria flora and neuropsychological performance in patients with TRD. The
      investigators further aim to identify the predictors of N2O's antidepressant effeect using
      the above techniques.

It comprises two sheets with 50 words on each, and each word is the name of a colour. On the first sheet, the Congruent STROOP Sheet, the word and ink colour match; on the Incongruent STROOP Sheet, the word and ink colour do not match. For each sheet, the patient has 4 minutes to name the ink colour of each word.

Item 4 and 5 at the end of the last week was assessed. If the answer to both questions was &quot;no&quot;, the patient was judged to have no suicidal ideation.If either answer is &quot;weak&quot; or &quot;moderate to strong,&quot; it is considered suicidal ideation.The intensity of suicidal ideation was judged according to the mean value of items 1-5 in the scale. The higher the score, the greater the intensity of suicidal ideation.The risk of suicide was assessed according to items 6-19 of the suicide ideation scale.The total score was calculated by [(the sum of item 6-19 scores -9)/33]*100. The higher the score, the greater the risk of suicide.</description>
