  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of US adults with Metabolic Syndrome (MetS) is over 34%, impacting nearly 35%
      of all adults and 50% of those aged 60 years or older. MetS is characterized as a combination
      of underlying risk factors that when, occurring together, increase the risk for chronic
      diseases such as type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), cardiovascular disease, stroke, and certain
      types of cancer, resulting in an 1.6-fold increase in mortality. According the American Heart
      Association, health risks associated with Metabolic Syndrome can be significantly reduced by
      reducing body weight and eating a diet that is rich in whole grains, fruits, and vegetables.
      Potatoes (e.g. skin-on white potatoes) are an excellent source of potassium, vitamin C, and
      vitamin B6 and a good source of magnesium and dietary fiber. In addition, the potato has
      greater dry matter and protein per unit growing area compared with cereals. Despite this,
      consumers tend to believe that potatoes are high in calories and in fat compared with other
      carbohydrate sources such as rice or pasta, an incorrect assumption since a potato has
      negligible fat and a low energy density similar to legumes. Data from short-term nutrition
      intervention trials, suggest that potatoes consumed as part of a low-glycemic load meal can
      play a role in the prevention or treatment of MetS. However, the impact of long-term potato
      consumption on cardiometabolic risk factors associated with MetS is not known. Therefore,
      there is a critical need to determine if regular (&gt; 4 times per week) potato consumption can
      improve cardiometabolic health in individuals with MetS.

    <description>All dietary treatments will be designed to be isoenergetic within individual participants. Energy content of the diets will be individualized to ensure weight maintenance throughout the dietary intervention period using the Harris Benedict equation x 1.35. Glycemic load for the treatment groups will be calculated using the following equation:
Glycemic Load = Glycemic Index x Grams of carbohydrates/100. Potatoes, processed potato products, and control carbohydrate foods will be provided.</description>
