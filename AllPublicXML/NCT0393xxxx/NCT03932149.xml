    <textblock>
      The aim of this trial is to investigate the efficacy of left DLPFC iTBS in a population of
      alcohol use disorder patients, compared with the sham iTBS. Moreover, this trial will conduct
      follow-up assessments to evaluate whether its efficacy can sustain for a long time if it is
      effective.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Alcohol abuse and alcohol use disorder are important major health issues in our modern
      society. However, the treatment of alcohol addiction is currently limited to the treatment of
      acute withdrawal symptoms, but lacks effective interventions to reduce craving and prevent
      relapse. In an attempt to improve the treatment of substance dependence, non-invasive
      neuromodulation has gained attention as a new potential treatment option. The aim of this
      trial is to investigate the efficacy of left DLPFC iTBS in a population of alcohol use
      disorder patients, compared with the sham iTBS. Moreover, this trial will conduct follow-up
      assessments to evaluate whether its efficacy can sustain for a long time if it is effective.
