  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Early mobilization was thought to be effective in patients with acute ischemic stroke. As the
      essential component of stroke unit care, early mobilization has already been part of routine
      clinical practice. However, it is uncertain that which and when medical service focusing on
      functional recovery should be delivered after the emergency interventions for stroke.
      Besides, the optimal time window, for delivering early mobilization after acute ischemic
      stroke, has not been verified with strong evidence.

      Objective: The primary objective of the TwEmAIS trial is to investigate the optimal time
      window for delivering early mobilization in improving the neurologic impairment and
      functional recovery in patients with acute ischemic stroke. Secondary objectives are to
      evaluate the efficacy of early mobilization on disability level after stroke, activity of
      daily living (ADL), cognitive ability, hospital LOS and cost-effectiveness.

      Study design: a pragmatic, investigator-initiated, multi-center, randomized controlled,
      clinical trial.

      Sample size: 1500 cases

      According to the function evaluation of each patient, the corresponding rehabilitation
      treatment was arranged.

      Statistical analysis: Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS 23.0. One-way analysis of
      variance was used to compare statistical differences between the groups (5 time points) and
      between groups (3 intervention groups).

The frequency and intensity of the intervention is titrated according to functional activity baseline and monitored daily and adjusted with recovery. Encourage patients to move out of bed as soon as possible.
Definition of bed movement: Encourage and help patients to perform functional actions, focusing on activities such as sitting, standing, walking out of the bed.</description>
