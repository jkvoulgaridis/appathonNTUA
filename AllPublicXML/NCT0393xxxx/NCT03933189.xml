  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be assessing the effects of physical therapy (PT) for new Americans/refugees
      who are survivors of torture and/or trauma (STT) and have chronic pain. It is estimated that
      78-83% of STT have chronic pain. With over 6000 refugees in Vermont, there are potentially
      high numbers of STT suffering from chronic pain and resultant disability. Physical therapists
      are well versed in treating pain and restoring function after an injury or illness. However,
      choice of PT intervention can vary based on the therapist's years of experience, type of PT
      practice specialization, or lack or specialization. Physical therapy has traditionally
      focused on a bio-medical (BIOM) approach. Some clinicians believe that the BIOM approach is
      ineffective in reducing chronic pain and loss of function, and that treatment requires a
      biopsychosocial (BPS) approach, targeting central and peripheral nervous system changes that
      occur with persistent pain. Pain education and Graded Motor Imagery (GMI) are PT
      interventions thought to address these brain changes, and are used by physical therapists to
      treat patients with phantom limb pain and Complex Regional Pain Syndrome. Most of the studies
      examining the effects of GMI and pain education, however, have methodological issues.
      Exercise is another common PT treatment and is beneficial in promoting improved function and
      decreasing disability in many patient conditions. Although PTs in clinical practice can offer
      all of these modalities, there is little high quality evidence to support the choice among
      them.

      This study will compare two varieties of PT now provided in routine clinical care: BIOM-based
      care versus BPS-based care. STT who are seen and screened at the Vermont Psychological
      Services Connecting Cultures program and who experience chronic pain and disability will be
      referred to PT. Upon referral, STT who meet the inclusion criteria will be invited to
      participate. STT who consent to the study will be randomized to either the BIOM-based group
      or the BPS-based group. All participants will undergo baseline assessment and complete the
      study questionnaires. Participants will complete 6 one-hour PT sessions once a week following
      their randomly assigned group plan. All baseline measures will be repeated by the blinded
      assessor after the 6th visit.

      This study aims to determine if there is a difference in the change in functional outcomes
      between the BIOM- and BPS-based intervention groups after completion of the 6 PT sessions.

      The purpose of this study is to compare two usual PT programs to determine if one is more
      effective than the other in reducing disability and pain in new Americans and refugees who
      are survivors of torture and trauma (STT). Numerous studies have assessed the mental health
      issues of STT and the psychological interventions used to address these issues, but there has
      been little research on interventions that address the somatic pain and disability complaints
      in STT in spite of the fact that 78-83% of survivors report chronic pain.

      There is large variability in physical therapy management of painful conditions, representing
      an opportunity to improve patient care and outcomes. Choice of physical therapy intervention
      can vary based on the individual therapist's years of experience or type of PT practice
      specialization, or lack of specialization. The biomedical model (BIOM) of physical therapy
      (PT) management addresses pain problems by targeting treatment towards the physiologic
      structures or tissues in the region where the patient is reporting the pain sensations. This
      model follows the premise that pain is due to tissue damage and localized inflammation due to
      faulty biomechanics and movement patterns, injury, disease or disuse. The Academy of
      Orthopedic Physical Therapists Low Back Pain Clinical Practice Guidelines recommend manual
      therapy, targeted spine strengthening, endurance and flexibility exercises to treat patients
      with acute, sub-acute, and chronic back pain, and follows this BIOM approach. Additionally,
      there are a variety of exercise methods and manual therapies touted by practitioners leading
      to heterogeneous interventions given for similar patient conditions. A 2014 study compared
      the outcomes of two different types of targeted spine interventions for the treatment of low
      back pain, and found the results to be equivocal, with approximately half the subjects in
      each treatment group demonstrating significant improvement. A biopsychosocial (BPS) PT
      approach of pain neuroscience education, Graded Motor Imagery and general conditioning
      exercises encompassing the health and skill related components of fitness has also been found
      to reduce pain and improve function in patients with chronic low back pain, in patients with
      complex regional pain syndrome and in patients with phantom limb pain. These conditions
      involve central brain changes due to the experience of chronic pain; pain neuroscience
      education and Graded Motor Imagery are purported to address these central changes. These
      studies, however, had methodologic issues, such as lack of a control group or small sample
      sizes. Exercise helps address the fear avoidance component of chronic low back pain, and
      helps to improve strength, endurance and tolerance for daily functional activities.
      Furthermore, pain education was found to decrease pain and improve function in STT in a small
      pilot study. Patient education is a major component of any PT intervention.

      There are a few small studies that have examined the effects of a BPS approach with promising
      results for specific chronic pain conditions, and there are studies that support the BIOM
      approach in treating musculoskeletal pain conditions but BPS- and BIOM-based treatments have
      not previously been compared in a large randomized controlled trial, nor described in the
      treatment of chronic pain in STT.

      Researchers have sought to determine PT methods that are most beneficial in reducing chronic
      pain and disability, but studies to date have been inconclusive. The investigators objective
      is to compare the BIOM and BSP methods of PT to identify best treatment for refugees and new
      Americans who have experienced physical and/or emotional trauma and have resultant disabling
      chronic pain due to this trauma. Findings from this work could help physical therapists
      provide targeted, effective treatment to help ameliorate the effects of chronic pain and
      disability in this population. With 78-83% of STT living with chronic pain, the study
      findings will help therapists choose appropriate interventions to achieve optimal patient
      outcomes.
