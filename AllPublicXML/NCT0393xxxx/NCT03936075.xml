  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an RCT pilot study to explore the potential effects of the Guided Imagery &amp; Music
      method for women with breast or gynecologic cancer, during active treatment. The study
      explores the potential impact in quality of life parameters such as mood, fatigue, and hope.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Guided Imagery and Music is a music-assisted psychotherapy method which has been used as a
      complementary, supportive psychosocial therapy in cancer care. However, its effects have
      never been explored during the period of active chemotherapy or radiotherapy treatment in
      various cancer populations, and especially gynecologic and breast cancer. This pilot study is
      an effort to explore the feasibility of the method to increase quality of life in this
      population by possibly reducing side-effects of treatment such as fatigue, improving mood,
      and building resilience as expressed through levels of hope.
