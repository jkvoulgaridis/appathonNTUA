  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Systemic arterial hypertension is one of major risk factors to development of target organ
      damage that culminate in cardiovascular diseases such as acute myocardial infarction and
      stroke. Sodium intake is related with elevation of arterial blood pressure due to rise of
      cardiac output and of arterial stiffness and it can be estimated by daily sodium excreted in
      urine 24h. Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring can be used to obtain peripheral and central
      hemodynamic parameters [arterial stiffness parameters - central blood pressure, pulse wave
      velocity and augmentation index]. Applanation tonometry also can be used to check same
      central hemodynamic parameters. Both methods provide us important informations about the
      patients clinical conditions and help us to infer their prognosis. Therefore, this protocol
      aims measure the central hemodynamic parameters in hypertensive patients, controlled or
      resistant, and evaluate their sodium urinary excretion. The hypothesis is the resistant
      hypertensive patients have parameters higher than controlled hypertensive patients.

      The urinary sodium (Na+) will be evaluated by flame photometry. Excretion of urinary sodium
      will be calculated by multiplying the urinary sodium concentration in mE /L by 24-hour
      urinary volume. Two to three urinary Na+ samples will be collected within six months.

      3.3.3 ABLOOD PRESSURE MONITORING - 24 HOURS Ambulatorial blood pressure monitoring 24-hour
      will be performed using a Mobil-O-Graph® compact digital device (version 12, ambulatory
      pressure monitor, 2000, UK). Individuals will be instructed to maintain their normal
      activities of daily living. The device will be pre-programmed to measure blood pressure
      within 24 hours at 30-minute intervals every hour during the waking period and at 1-hour
      intervals during sleep. This device will evaluate the following parameters: systolic and
      peripheral diastolic blood pressure, mean arterial pressure, pulse pressure, systolic central
      aortic pressure, central diastolic aortic pressure (cDBP), central pulse pressure (cPP),
      augmentation index corrected for 75 bpm (AI75%) and pulse wave velocity (PWV).

    <description>Evaluation of the individuals has the objective determine if they are resistant hypertensive patients. This is important because the resistant people have worse prognosis than the controlled people and need more attention from the health professionals. Analysis must be done using the ambulatory blood pressure monitoring.</description>
