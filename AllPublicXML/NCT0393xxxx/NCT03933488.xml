    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of TAK-994 following
      single and multiple oral doses in healthy non-Japanese and Japanese adult participants and
      healthy elderly participants.

      The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-994. TAK-994 is being tested to find a safe
      and well-tolerated dose in healthy participants (non-Japanese and Japanese) and healthy
      elderly participants. The study will enroll up to approximately 160 healthy participants. The
      study consists of 6 parts and up to 20 cohorts as mentioned below.

        -  TAK-994: Part A: Single-rising dose (SRD) design to assess the safety, tolerability, and
           PK of TAK-994 and effect of food on the PK of the TAK-994

        -  TAK-994: Part B: MRD design to assess the safety, tolerability, PK and PD of TAK-994

        -  TAK-994: Part C: MRD design to assess the safety, tolerability, PK and PD of TAK-994 and
           also central nervous system penetration relative to plasma concentrations of TAK-994

        -  TAK-994: Part D: MRD design to assess the safety, tolerability, PK and PD of TAK-994 for
           HE participants

        -  TAK-994: Part E: SRD and MRD design to assess the safety, tolerability, PK and PD of
           TAK-994 for Japanese origin participants

        -  TAK-994: Part F (Optional Cohort): Nonrandomized design to assess orexin (OX) levels in
           the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of untreated healthy adult participants.

      Participants in each cohort will be randomized to receive treatment with TAK-994 or matching
      placebo which will remain undisclosed to the participant and study doctor during the study
      (unless there is an urgent medical need). Participants in optional Part F will receive no
      study drug.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in the United States. The overall duration of the
      study is approximately 10 months. Participants will be followed up for 7 days after the last
      dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.
