  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with stroke in the brain, due to central nervous system damage, lack of correct
      action patterns, limited joint movement of upper limbs, affecting the patient's performance.
      The Kinesio taping effect is to facilitate the muscle activity of upper limb. This program is
      intended to provide a treatment for patients with chronic stroke, and to observe their upper
      limb movements before and after using the Kinesio taping.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Motor impairment is the main cause of disability after stroke, leading to major health
      problems. Research has shown that the most common consequence of stroke is the paresis of
      limbs.The ability to live independently after a stroke depends on the recovery of motor
      functions,particularly those of the upper limb.The core concept of the Kinesio taping is to
      influence the brain through the sensory input, stimulate the nervous system, and improve the
      motor performance of the stroke patient.
