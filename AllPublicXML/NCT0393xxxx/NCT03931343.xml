  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Spinal surgery is typically associated with severe postoperative pain. Although the number of
      spinal surgeries has increased day by day, postoperative pain management have been limited.
      The recently described thoracolumbar interfacial plane block (TLIPB) has been reported to
      provide effective postoperative analgesia in spinal surgery. In addition, the recently
      described erector spinae plane block (ESPB) is obtained by applying the local anesthetic drug
      between the fascia of the spina muscles and the transverse process of the vertebrae.
      Anatomical and radiological investigations in fresh cadavers suggest that the potential place
      of influence of ESPB is dorsal and ventral spinal nerve roots. A small number of publications
      showing the analgesic efficacy of ESP in spinal surgery have been reported in the literature.
      In this study, the investigators aimed to compare the analgesic efficacy of TLIPB and ESPB in
      spinal surgeries.
