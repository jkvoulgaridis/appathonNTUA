  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To investigate the efficacy, safety and utility of hybrid closed-loop glucose control during
      a low carbohydrate vs. iso-energetic balanced diet in individuals with type 1 diabetes.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Closed-loop systems combining an insulin pump, a glucose sensor and a dosing algorithm that
      adjusts insulin delivery in a glucose-responsive manner achieve significantly better glucose
      control than conventional therapy in type 1 diabetes. Achieving satisfactory postprandial
      glucose control, however, continues to be challenging. The main limitation is the delayed
      pharmacokinetics and -dynamics of subcutaneously administered insulin with peak actions
      between 1 and 2 hours. Conversely, glucose levels typically rise within 10minutes following
      carbohydrate intake. This mismatch largely explains the inability of current closed-loop
      systems to control postprandial glucose excursions and the increased risk of late
      postprandial hypoglycaemia in response to both user-derived meal bolus administration and
      reactive algorithm-driven insulin infusion.

      Restricting carbohydrate may therefore significantly improve post-prandial glucose control
      whilst reducing hypoglycaemia. The efficacy of hybrid closed-loop operation in individuals
      with type 1 diabetes adhering to a low carbohydrate compared to a iso-caloric balanced diet
      has not been investigated to date.
