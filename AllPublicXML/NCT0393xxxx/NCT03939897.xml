      This phase I/II trial studies the effects (good and bad) of adding copanlisib to the usual
      therapy of fulvestrant and abemaciclib in treating patients with hormone receptor positive
      and HER2 negative stage IV breast cancer. Some breast cancer cells have receptors for the
      hormones estrogen or progesterone. These cells are hormone receptor positive and they need
      estrogen or progesterone to grow. This can affect how the cancer is treated. Hormone therapy
      using fulvestrant may fight breast cancer by blocking the use of estrogen by the tumor cells.
      Abemaciclib and copanlisib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes
      needed for cell growth. Adding copanlisib to the usual therapy of fulvestrant and abemaciclib
      may work better than giving fulvestrant and abemaciclib alone in treating patients with
      breast cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the safety profile of fulvestrant + abemaciclib + copanlisib hydrochloride
      (copanlisib) (FAC) and determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D).

      II. To determine if FAC is superior to fulvestrant + abemaciclib (FA) using progression-free
      survival (PFS) as an endpoint.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the objective response rate (ORR = partial response [PR] + complete response
      [CR]) and clinical benefit rate (CBR = PR + CR + stable disease [SD] &gt;= 6 months) of FAC
      versus (vs.) FA.

      II. To compare the median PFS between FAC and FA arms in the following subgroups:

      IIa. Tumor PIK3CA/PTEN altered (PIK3CA mutation or PTEN mutation/PTEN loss). IIb. Tumor
      PIK3CA/PTEN not altered (wild-type PIK3CA and PTEN and without PTEN loss).

      IIc. Tumor phosphorylated (p)AKT levels (above or below the median). III. To assess whether
      triplet therapy with FAC inhibits AKT phosphorylation, reduces cyclin D1, and is more
      effective than FA in inhibiting Rb phosphorylation.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess whether the combination of abemaciclib and fulvestrant affect the copanlisib
      pharmacokinetics (PK).

      II. To assess the median PFS in the following molecularly defined subgroups treated with
      either FAC or FA:

      IIa. Tumor PIK3CA mutation vs. not. IIb. Tumor PTEN mutation/PTEN loss vs. not. IIc.
      Circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) (ctDNA) PIK3CA mutation vs. not.

      IId. CtDNA PI3K/PTEN mutation vs. not. IIe. CtDNA ESR1 mutation vs. not. III. To assess
      baseline and treatment induced changes in various cancer associated pathways, including but
      not limited to PI3K, MAPK, ER, cyclins, CDKs and CDK inhibitors; and to correlate with
      treatment response and progression.

      IV. To correlate baseline and treatment induced changes in breast cancer intrinsic subtypes
      (PAM50), and PI3K messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) signature and expression of candidate
      genes with treatment response and benefit from adding copanlisib.

      V. To evaluate ctDNA mutations at baseline and over time for response predictors at baseline,
      and clonal evolution associated with treatment.

      VI. To correlate ctDNA mutation profiles with tumor sequencing, and correlate baseline ctDNA
      mutations, particularly in components of the PI3K pathway with treatment response, and
      correlate early changes in ctDNA variant allele frequencies (VAFs) with PFS, assess emergent
      resistant mutations at progression.

      VII. To assess resistance mechanisms to FA and FAC at baseline and at disease progression.

      VIII. To examine the molecular effects of FA and FAC on tumor and circulating markers.

      IX. To analyze tumor infiltrating lymphocytes at baseline, during treatment, and at disease
      progression.

      X. To assess whether copanlisib affects abemaciclib pharmacokinetics (PK).

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of copanlisib hydrochloride and
      abemaciclib, followed by a phase II study.

      PHASE I: Patients receive copanlisib hydrochloride intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on days 1,
      8, and 15 or days 1 and 15 (depending on dose level) and abemaciclib orally (PO) twice daily
      (BID) on days 2-28 of cycle 1 and on days 1-28 of subsequent cycles. Patients also receive
      fulvestrant intramuscularly (IM) on days 2 and 16 of cycle 1, and on day 1 of subsequent
      cycles. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      PHASE II: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I (FAC): Patients receive copanlisib hydrochloride as in phase I. Patients also receive
      abemaciclib PO BID on days 1-28 and fulvestrant IM on days 1 and 15 of cycle 1 and day 1 of
      subsequent cycles. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II (FA): Patients receive abemaciclib PO BID on days 1-28 and fulvestrant IM on days 1
      and 15 of cycle 1 and day 1 of subsequent cycles. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 5 years.

             become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating
             in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately. Men treated or
             enrolled on this protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception prior to the

          -  For patients with evidence of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, the HBV viral
             load must be undetectable on suppressive therapy, if indicated

          -  Patients with a history of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection must have been treated
             and cured. For patients with HCV infection who are currently on treatment, they are
             eligible if they have an undetectable HCV viral load

          -  Patients with a prior or concurrent malignancy whose natural history or treatment does
             not have the potential to interfere with the safety or efficacy assessment of the
             investigational regimen are eligible for this trial

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  For patients enrolling to the randomized phase 2 portion of the study, prior treatment
             with a CDK4/6 inhibitor or fulvestrant, or a PI3K inhibitor in the metastatic setting
             is not allowed

          -  Patients who have had chemotherapy within 3 weeks or radiotherapy within 2 weeks (6
             weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study

          -  Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents

          -  Immunosuppressive therapy is not allowed while on study

          -  Receiving anti-arrhythmic therapy (beta blockers or digoxin are permitted)

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to copanlisib, PI3K inhibitors, or other agents used in study

          -  For the randomized phase 2 portion of the study, patients with brain metastasis or a
             history of brain metastasis are not eligible

               -  For the phase 1 portion of the study, patients with progressive brain metastases
                  should be excluded because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop
                  progressive neurologic dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of
                  neurologic and other adverse events (AEs)

          -  Copanlisib is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4. Therefore, the concomitant use of
             strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin,
             ritonavir, indinavir, nelfinavir and saquinavir), and strong inducers of CYP3A4 (e.g.,
             rifampin, phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, St. John's wort) are not permitted
             from 14 days prior to enrollment until the end of the study

               -  It is important to regularly consult a frequently-updated medical reference for a
                  list of drugs to avoid or minimize use of. As part of the enrollment/informed
                  consent procedures, the patient will be counseled on the risk of interactions
                  with other agents, and what to do if new medications need to be prescribed or if
                  the patient is considering a new over-the-counter medicine or herbal product

          -  Systemic corticosteroid therapy at a daily dose higher than 15 mg prednisone or
             equivalent is not permitted while on study. Previous corticosteroid therapy must be
             stopped or reduced to the allowed dose at least 7 days prior to the computed
             tomography (CT)/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) screening. If a patient is on chronic
             corticosteroid therapy, corticosteroids should be de-escalated to the maximum allowed
             dose before the screening. Patients may be using topical or inhaled corticosteroids.
             Short-term (up to 7 days) systemic corticosteroids above 15 mg prednisolone or
             equivalent will be allowed for the management of acute conditions (e.g., treatment
             non-infectious pneumonitis)

          -  Major surgical procedure or significant traumatic injury (as judged by the
             investigator) within 28 days before start of treatment, or have not recovered from
             major side effects, open biopsy within 7 days before start of treatment

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness, including but not limited to, symptomatic
             congestive heart failure (&gt; New York Heart Association [NYHA] class 2), unstable
             angina pectoris, new-onset angina, uncontrolled hypertension despite optimal medical
             management, seizure disorder requiring medication, or psychiatric illness/social
             situations that would limit compliance with study requirements

          -  Myocardial infarction &lt; 6 months before start of treatment

          -  Arterial or venous thrombotic or embolic events such as cerebrovascular accident
             (including transient ischemic attacks), deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism
             within 3 months before the start of study medication

          -  The patient has a personal history of any of the following conditions: syncope of
             cardiovascular etiology, ventricular arrhythmia of pathological origin (including, but
             not limited to, ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation), or sudden
             cardiac arrest

          -  Proteinuria &gt;= grade 3 as assessed by a 24-hour (h) protein quantification or
             estimated by urine protein: creatinine ratio &gt; 3.5 on a random urine sample

          -  History of bleeding diathesis. Any hemorrhage or bleeding event &gt;= grade 3 within 4
             weeks prior to the start of study medication

          -  History or concurrent condition of interstitial lung disease of any severity and/or
             severely impaired lung function

          -  History of having received an allogeneic bone marrow or organ transplant

          -  Patients with non-healing wound, ulcer, or bone fracture not due to breast cancer

          -  Patients with active, clinically serious infections &gt; grade 2 (Common Terminology
             Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE] version [v] 5.0)

          -  Patients with HbA1c &gt; 8.5% at screening

          -  Concurrent diagnosis of pheochromocytoma

          -  Has undergone blood or platelet transfusion &lt; 7 days prior to start of treatment

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because copanlisib is a PI3K inhibitor
             agent with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an
             unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to
             treatment of the mother with copanlisib, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the
             mother is treated with copanlisib. These potential risks may also apply to other
             agents used in this study

          -  Hepatitis B (HBV) or hepatitis C (HCV). All patients must be screened for HBV and HCV
             up to 28 days prior to study drug start using the routine hepatitis virus lab panel.
             Patients positive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and/or hepatitis B core
             antibody (HBcAb) will be eligible if they are negative for HBV DNA, these patients
             should receive prophylactic antiviral therapy. Patients positive for anti-HCV antibody
             will be eligible if they are negative for HCV RNA

          -  HIV positive patients on combination antiretroviral agents that are strong CYP3A4
             inhibitors or inducers and who are unwilling or unable to change to antiretroviral
             therapies without such interactions are ineligible because of the potential for
             pharmacokinetic interactions with copanlisib, abemaciclib, and fulvestrant.
             Appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients receiving combination
             antiretroviral therapy when indicated

          -  Patients with history of, or current autoimmune disease are not eligible

          -  History of major surgical resection involving the stomach or small bowel, or
             preexisting Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis or a preexisting chronic condition
             resulting in baseline grade 2 or higher diarrhea
