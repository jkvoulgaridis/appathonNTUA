      This study will be the first study investigating the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), and
      efficacy of SBS-101 on oral pre-malignant lesions. As such, no clinical data has yet been
      generated using SBS-101 oral adhesive film.

         14. Patient is in good general health and free of any known disease state or physical
             condition which, in the Investigator's opinion, might impair evaluation of the oral
             premalignant lesions or which exposes the patient to an unacceptable risk by
             participating in the study.

             of the Investigator, might put the patient at undue risk by participating in the study
             or interferes with the study drug application or the study assessments.

         14. Patient has a history of sensitivity to any of the active ingredients in the study
             drug (e.g. isotretinoin, propylene glycol, natural mint), or retinoids, or vitamin A.
