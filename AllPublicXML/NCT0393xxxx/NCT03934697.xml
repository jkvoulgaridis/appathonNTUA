      The purpose of this study is to test if imaginal exposure therapy can decrease symptoms of
      eating disorders and anxiety.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      An initial meeting consisting of a screening, questionnaires, and a brief psychoeducation on
      imaginal exposure therapy, followed by 8-10 sessions with a licensed psychologist (the PI) or
      a clinical psychology graduate student who is supervised and trained by the PI. In Session 1,
      patients will create a script with the therapist on an eating disorder fear. In sessions 2-10
      the therapist and patient will then imagine this eating disorder related fear based on the
      script. Each session will be modified to focus on &quot;hot spots&quot; or the most feared aspect of
      the script. Sessions will be audiotaped and videotaped and participants will be asked to
      listen to the sessions nightly for homework. Sessions will be weekly or twice per week for
      8-10 weeks after the initial screening session.

    <measure>EDEQ (Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire) at 1-10 Weeks and at 1 year</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year and 10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The EDE-Q is a 41-item self-report questionnaire version of the Eating Disorder Examination, which is a semi-structured interview designed to assess eating disorders symptom frequency and severity over the past 28 days. The EDE-Q uses a 7-point forced-choice rating scheme (No days; 1-5 days; 6-12 days; 13-15 days; 16-22 days; 23-27 days; Everyday). The EDE-Q has four subscales with the question stem &quot;How many days out of the past 28 days...&quot;: Restraint (e.g. Have you been consciously trying to restrict the amount of food you eat to influence your shape or weight?), Eating Concern (e.g. Have you had a definite fear that you might not be able to either resist eating or stop eating?), Weight Concern (e.g. Has your weight influenced how you think about (judge) yourself as a person?), and Shape Concern (e.g. How dissatisfied have you felt about your shape?).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>SUDS (Subjective Units of Distress Scale) at 1-10 Weeks and at 1 year</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year and 10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The SUDS scale is a self-report behavioral measure used during exposure treatment and behavioral assessment to measure anxiety. The SUDS scale has been shown to be a valid and reliable measure of state anxiety. SUDS ratings can range from 0 (completely calm) to 100 (highest anxiety). Other reference points used in this study include 25 (noticeable, but not bothersome anxiety), 50 (bothersome anxiety), and 75 (very bothersome anxiety). Subjective anxiety was assessed both in terms of categorical response and overall change. Categorical response was defined as a drop of at least five points in average SUDS across the exposure across visits.</description>

    <measure>Body Mass Index (BMI) at 1-10 Weeks and at 1 year</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year and 10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be weighed at 1-10 Weeks and at 1 year and BMI will be calculated in order to see if the BMI of an individual has changed over time.</description>
