  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Peripheral venous catheterization is a fundamental part of the management of critically-ill
      patients, especially for administration of intravenous emergency treatments. In general, it
      is preferred to central catheterization whenever possible, since it is less invasive,
      achievable immediately by the nurse, and responsible for fewer complications.

      Venous access difficulties are frequent in critically-ill patients. Among tools proposed to
      improve the practice of peripheral catheterization, ultrasound and infrared illumination are
      the most studied, the latter being simpler. Infrared illumination has never been evaluated in
      intensive care. However, the delay or failure of peripheral catheterization is highly
      detrimental in the context of resuscitation as it may delay or impede appropriate management
      of vital emergencies. Our study will focus on the peripheral venous catheterization of the
      upper limbs, as these are the reference site for this technique The objective is to evaluate
      the interest of infrared illumination (AccuVein AV500®) for the primary success (first
      puncture) of peripheral venous catheterization of the upper limbs in patients with
      resuscitation at risk of catheterization venous difficult.

      It is a comparative, superiority, prospective, multicenter, randomized, controlled,
      open-label, phase III trial. Subjects will be divided into two groups with a 1: 1 ratio.
      Nurses at participating centers will be trained for the use of the device prior to the start
      of the study; the use of the device is singularly easy and intuitive.

- Usual technique : Visualization of the vein to be catheterized will be done directly. without infrared illumination.
or
-Use of the Accuvein® device: Visualization of the vein to be catheterized will be done with infrared illumination.
In both groups, catheterization will be carried out according to the usual technique in accordance with the recommendations.</intervention_model_description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age ≥ 18 years; Hospitalization in intensive care;

          -  Need for a peripheral venous catheter;

          -  Risk of difficult peripheral venous catheterization. In practice, this risk will be
             considered present if it is impossible to palpate and / or visualize the upper end of
             the target vein and / or if the estimated vein diameter is smaller than 2mm. This
             definition is derived from the A-DIVA score (Loon FAJ van et al3).
