  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) shows the weakest treatment response among anxiety
      disorders. The present study aimed at examining whether an acceptance-based behavioral
      treatment, combining mindfulness and exposure strategies, would improve clinical outcome
      compared to a standard, non-directive, supportive group therapy (NDST) for clients at a
      Brazilian anxiety disorders program.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ninety-two individuals diagnosed with GAD were randomized to receive 10 sessions of either an
      acceptance-based behavior therapy (ABBT) or a Non-directive support Therapy (NDST).
      Assessments were at pretreatment, mid term, post-treatment, and 3-month follow-up.Data were
      analyzed using the Mixed effect regression models comparing both groups in primary outcome
      measures. Secondary outcome measures and putative process variables were assessed and also
      analyzed. The latter were tested as mediators of efficacy.

    <masking>Single (Participant)</masking>
    <masking_description>After all the participants signed a consent form, each subject was randomized to a single treatment by using the method of randomly permuted blocks (Matts &amp; Lachin, 1988) on http://www.randomization.com. Randomization was stratified in two blocs by use of psychotropic medication in order to have medication use equally distributed between groups. To that end, patients on psychotropic medication were randomized first.</masking_description>

    <measure>Change in the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scales</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-treatment (week 0) one week before the first group session (week 1); intermediate assessment (midterm) in the sixth session (week 6); the post-treatment assessment occurred on the day of the tenth session (week 14); and follow-up (week 26)</time_frame>
    <description>The 21-item version (DASS-21; Lovibond e Lovibond, 1995), which measures the scores of depression, anxiety and stress separately (7-items each). We followed Roemer &amp; Orsillo (2008) in this study by using the anxiety and stress subscales as general signs of anxiety. Higher scores indicate higher severity of symptoms. Scores are between 0 and 42 for each one of the three subscales. The cut-off scores for conventional severity labels (normal, mild, moderate, severe, extremely severe) are as follows: Anxiety (0-7; 8-9; 10-14; 14-19; 20+) and Stress (0-14; 15-18; 19-25; 26-33; 34+).</description>

    <description>The Hamilton Anxiety Scale (Hamilton, 1959, The assessment of anxiety states by rating) was used to measure anxiety symptoms. The HAM-A is a 14-item interview-administered measure of anxiety widely used in clinical trials, being required as an inclusion criterion in meta-analyses of psychological treatments for anxiety disorders (Bandelow, 2015). Higher scores indicate higher levels of anxious symptoms. The internal consistencies for the HAM-A were .84, .81, .80, and .86 across the four time points. The score ranges from 0 to 54.</description>

    <description>it is a 16-item 5-points likert questionnaire with items ranging from 1 (not at all typical of me) to 5 (very typical of me) that measures the trait levels of worry. the scale ranges from 16 to 80.

    <description>The CGI provides an overall clinician-determined summary measure that takes into account all available information, including a knowledge of the patient's history, psychosocial circumstances, symptoms, behavior, and the impact of the symptoms on the patient's ability to function.The CGI actually comprises two companion one-item measures evaluating the following: (a) severity of psychopathology from 1 to 7 and (b) change from the initiation of treatment on a similar seven-point scale (Busner &amp; Targum, 2007). Higher scores indicate higher severity of symptoms or worse evolution.</description>

    <description>The 21-item version (DASS-21; Lovibond e Lovibond, 1995), which measures the scores of depression, anxiety and stress separately. We applied the depression factor as a secondary outcome measure. Higher scores indicate higher severity of symptoms. Scores are between 0 and 42. The cut-off scores for conventional severity labels (normal, mild, moderate, severe, extremely severe) for the depression sub scale is (0-9, 10-13, 14-20, 21-27, 28+)</description>

    <description>The WHOQOL-BREF is a 26-item questionnaire which includes one item from each of the 24 facets contained in the WHOQOL-100 and two additional items on overall quality of life and general health. The 24 items are organized into 4 domains, namely Physical Health, Psychological, Social Relationships and Environment. In this study we analysed only the fis=rst three domains, because environment characteristics was not supposed to change with psychological interventions. The internal consistencies for WHOQOL were .77, .77, and .81 for the psychological subscale, .78, .76, and .82, for the physical subscale, and .72, .64, and .73 for the social subscale across pretreatment, posttreatment, and 3 month follow up. Higher scores indicate higher quality of Life. Scores of physical, psychological and social domains range from 7 to 35; 6 to 30 and 3 to 15.</description>

    <description>The Acceptance and Action Questionnaire (AAQ-II-7: Bond, 2011; Flederus, 2012) is a 7-item uni-dimensional measure that assesses experiential avoidance: the unwillingness to remain in contact with aversive private experience and behaviors aimed at altering these experiences or the events that elicit them. Items are scored on a 7-point likert scale ranging from 1 (never true) to 7 (always true). Higher scores indicate higher levels of experiential avoidance and lower levels of psychological flexibility</description>

    <description>The 39-items Five Facets of Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ; Baer et. al., 2006, adapted for Brazil by Barros, 2014), was used for measuring mindfulness in a multidimensional manner for a factorial analysis of different elements of the construct, divided in five domains (i.e. observing, describing, acting with awareness, non-judging of inner experience, and non-reactivity to inner experience). Items are scored on a 5-point likert scale ranging from 1 (never or very rarely true) to 5 (very often or always true). Higher scores indicate higher levels of mindfulness.</description>

    <measure>Change in the Credibility and Expectancy Questionnaire score</measure>

    <description>The Credibility and Expectancy Questionnaire (CEQ; Borkovec &amp; Nau, 1972; Devilly &amp; Borkovec, 2000) is a 6-item self-report instrument that measures treatment credibility and client expectancy for improvement. The first four items of this scale (set I) are rated based on cognitive appraisal whereas the last two items (set II) are rated based on feelings about the therapy. One item of each set is scored as porcentage (0 to 100) and all of the other items are scored on a 9-point likert scale ranging from 1 (nota t all) to 9 (very). Higher scores indicate higher levels of credibility (first 3 items) and expectancy (last 3 items).</description>

    <description>NDST consists in a form of therapeutic intervention from which all intervention principles pertaining to specific psychotherapeutic protocols are removed while maintaining the so-called common factors from different psychotherapy approaches. In other words, it is an unstructured therapy without specific psychological techniques other than those belonging to the basic interpersonal skills of the therapist, such as reflection, empathic listening, encouragement, and helping people to explore and express their experiences and emotions.</description>
