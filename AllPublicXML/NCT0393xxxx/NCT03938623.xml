    <textblock>
      Context : Colorectal cancer (CRC) mass screening has been implemented in France since 2008.
      Participation rates remain too low. The objective of this study is to test if the
      implementation of a training course focused on communication skills (whether in-person or
      e-learning) among general practitioners (GP) would increase the delivery of gFOBT and CRC
      screening participation among the target population of each participating GP.

      Method : Pragmatic controlled cluster randomized trial with 2 parallel groups: Control versus
      Educational Intervention Intervention ; six hour educational training either in person or
      through e-learning The Main objective: is to evaluate the effectiveness of an educational
      intervention teaching physicians the patient-centered approach, either in-person or through
      e-learning, by evaluating their patients' participation in colorectal cancer (CRC) screening
      for all risk categories.

      Context : Colorectal cancer (CRC) mass screening has been implemented in France since 2008.
      Participation rates remain too low. The objective of this study is to test if the
      implementation of a training course focused on communication skills (whether in-person or
      e-learning) among general practitioners (GP) would increase the delivery of gFOBT and CRC
      screening participation among the target population of each participating GP.

      Method : Pragmatic controlled cluster randomized trial with 2 parallel groups: Control versus
      Educational Intervention .Given that the type of educational intervention modifies the global
      organization and medical practices of the participating centers, the randomization will be
      done at the level of GP's practice as a cluster unit in order to avoid contamination bias.

      Population : All general practitioners practicing in the Île-de-France, Languedoc-Roussillon,
      Loire-Atlantique, Midi-Pyrénées, Poitou-Charentes, or Provence-Alpes-Cote-d'Azur regions will
      be requested Their patients are eligible if they are 50-74 years old and reside in one of the
      above regions.

      212 centers are expected with 318 investigating doctors (an average of 1,5 doctors per
      center) and 42 358 total patients (21 179 patients in each arm) Intervention ; will be an
      educational training either in person or through e-learning GPs from practices in the control
      group were asked to continue their usual care, as if they were not participating in this
      trial. The whole procedure is the same all over the country i.e. all adults aged 50 to 74 of
      each GP's target population receive a letter every two years from the local cancer prevention
      association encouraging them to visit their GP and ask for the test. Patients must then send
      the test and a completed identity form, contained in an envelope to a central laboratory.

      In the intervention group, participating GPs will receive a six-hour training course focusing
      on patient-centered care either in person or through e-learning . Two different scenarios for
      a video aiming to improve communication with patients were developed: one for a compliant
      patient, another for a non-compliant patient based on the four components of the patient
      centered clinical method

      Objectives :

      The Main objective: is to evaluate the effectiveness of an educational intervention teaching
      physicians the patient-centered approach, either in-person or through e-learning, by
      evaluating their patients' participation in colorectal cancer (CRC) screening for all risk
      categories The Secondary objectives are ;

        -  Assess the effectiveness of this training on moderate-risk patient participation in
           organized CRC screening

        -  Assess the effectiveness of this training on high-risk patient participation in targeted
           CRC screening

        -  Compare the effectiveness of in-person training versus e-learning

        -  Assess the effect of the training on whether the sequence of tests completed by patients
           is appropriate for their risk category (carrying out a test that was given to them,
           immediate refusal of the test, carrying out a colonoscopy if the test is positive)
           Assess the effectiveness of this training on reducing social inequalities in CRC
           screening participation Evaluation criteria : the primary endpoint is patient
           participation in the appropriate CRC screening for their level of risk (i.e. completing
           the Fecal Occult Blood Test [FOBT] if at moderate risk or a colonoscopy if at high risk)
           within 12 months of randomization. The secondary endpoints are: completing the FOBT for
           moderate risk patients, completing a colonoscopy for higher risk patients, proportion of
           dispensed tests that were completed , proportion of tests refused among those proposed,
           proportion of colonoscopies performed among those whose FOBT is positive, patient
           screening participation rate according to socio-economic level, proportion of tests that
           could not be interpreted
