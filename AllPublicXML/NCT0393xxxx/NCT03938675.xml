      BACKGROUND:

      Despite the critical importance of breast milk for preterm and sick neonates, there is no
      consensus regarding the use of raw mother's own milk (MOM) in neonatal units.

      OBJECTIVES:

      This study aimed to describe the use of raw MOM in hospitalised neonates before day 7 (early
      use), and to investigate: (i) related factors, (ii) maternal satisfaction, and (iii) the
      association with breastfeeding continuation.

      METHODS:

      This prospective cohort included 516 neonates intended to be breastfed in 2 French neonatal
      units. Neonates receiving raw MOM before day 7 were compared to those who did not. The
      association between early use of MOM and breastfeeding continuation at hospital discharge,
      and up to 6 months later, was measured by logistic regression.

    <description>Breastfeeding was defined as the consumption of any mother's own milk (MOM), provided either directly at the breast or after having been expressed. Information on breastfeeding continuation was extracted from the electronic chart during the last 2 days preceding hospital discharge. It was classed as &quot;exclusive&quot; when all the fed milk was MOM, or &quot;partial&quot; when it was completed by other milk and/or food.</description>

    <description>Without any intervention, investigators observed whether neonates received raw MOM during the first week of life. Accordingly, the neonates were grouped as &quot;exposed&quot; when they received any raw MOM before day 7, versus &quot;unexposed&quot; when they did not receive any raw MOM before day 7.</description>
