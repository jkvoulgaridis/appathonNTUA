  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Manocept Platform prospective, open-label, multicenter, single and repeat-dose
      study designed to evaluate the reliability and sensitivity of TUV assessments in HCs and
      subjects with active RA.

      This study is stratified into 3 arms. The first 2 arms, comprised of [1] disease-free HCs and
      [2] clinically diagnosed RA subjects on stable treatment. The third arm is designed to assess
      the efficacy of TUV global in clinically diagnosed subjects with active RA..

        Inclusion Criteria:

             diagnosis.

          2. The subject has moderate to severe RA as determined by the 2010 American College of
             Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatism (ACR/EULAR) Classification Criteria
             (score of ≥ 6/10).

          3. The subject has a 28-joint disease activity score (DAS28) of ≥ 3.2 (includes the
             Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate [ESR] test and Visual Analog Scale [VAS]).

          4. Subjects receiving traditional DMARDs must have been on therapy for ≥ 90 days and at a
             stable dose for ≥ 30 days prior to the first imaging visit (Day 0).

          5. If the subject is receiving bDMARD or janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor therapy, they have
             been at a stable dose &gt; 180 days prior to the first imaging visit (Day 0).

          6. If the subject is receiving NSAIDs or oral corticosteroids, the dose has been stable
             for &gt; 28 days prior to first imaging visit (Day 0). The corticosteroid dose must be ≤
             10 mg/day of prednisone or an equivalent steroid dose.

          7. ARM 3 (only): The subject is receiving anti-rheumatic treatment and is a candidate for
             initiation of, or change to, a new anti-TNFα bDMARD treatment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. The subject is pregnant or lactating.

          2. The subject size or weight is not compatible with imaging per the investigator.

          3. The subject has had or is currently receiving radiation therapy or chemotherapy.

          4. The subject has renal insufficiency as demonstrated by a glomerular filtration rate of
             &lt; 60 mL/min.

          5. The subject has hepatic insufficiency as demonstrated by ALT (alanine aminotransferase
             [SGPT]) or AST (aspartate aminotransferase [SGOT]) greater than 3 times the upper
             limit of normal.

          6. The subject has any severe, acute, or chronic medical conditions and/or psychiatric
             conditions and/or laboratory abnormalities that would impart, in the judgment of the
             investigator, excess risk associated with study participation or study drug
             administration that would deem the subject inappropriate for study participation.

          7. The subject has a known allergy to or has had an adverse reaction to dextran exposure.

          8. The subject has received an investigational product within 30 days prior to the Tc 99m
             tilmanocept administration (Day 0).

          9. The subject has received intra-articular corticosteroid injections ≤ 8 weeks prior to
             the first imaging visit (Day 0).

         10. The subject has received any radiopharmaceutical within 7 days or 10 half-lives prior
             to the administration of Tc 99m tilmanocept at the first imaging visit (Day 0).
