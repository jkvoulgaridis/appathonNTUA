  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Water is largest single component to the human body and is requisite for numerous essential
      metabolic processes. Dehydration refers to deficient body water content and is prevalent in
      healthcare. It has been repeatedly shown that dehydration is associated with increased
      mortality and morbidity. Despite its prevalence and deleterious sequelae, there is
      substantial deficiency in the knowledge, assessment and management of this pathological
      state: there is no internationally-recognised definition, clinical signs can be subtle and
      unreliable, and there is no objective marker with everyday clinical utility. As a
      consequence, diagnosis of dehydration and prompt rehydration strategies are often poorly
      delivered in healthcare environments.

      Thirst plays an integral part in body water homeostasis. Plasma osmolality will increase with
      uncompensated water loss and is considered the most reliable surrogate objective marker of
      dehydration. Increased osmolality is sensed by hypothalamic osmoreceptors stimulating thirst
      and pituitary secretion of antidiuretic hormone (ADH). Thirst has been shown to be sensitive
      to small changes in plasma osmolality and shows little intra-individual variation. In view of
      this, it is rational to propose tendering control of intravenous rehydration to patients,
      enabling them to use the finely-honed intrinsic thirst mechanism to guide their own fluid
      therapy. A recent pilot study demonstrated that healthy subjects, when allowed to regulate
      their own intravenous fluid therapy in response to thirst intensity, rehydrated themselves
      more efficiently than subjects receiving a guideline-based, clinician-delivered fluid
      regimen. What is unclear is the extent of the reliability of thirst in guiding intravenous
      fluid rehydration therapy.

      The investigators propose a double-blinded, repeated measures study in which healthy
      volunteers are dehydrated using exercise-heat stress in a climatic chamber. Once dehydrated
      by 3-5% of their body weight, subjects will receive intravenous fluid rehydration which they
      can demand in response to their sensation of thirst. In one arm of the study they will
      receive low volume fluid bolus on demand, and in the other arm they will receive a higher
      volume fluid bolus. Thirst scores and surrogate markers of dehydration will be measured
      throughout this process. The investigators can then assess whether the demand for additional
      fluid in response to thirst reduces in frequency in proportion to the degree of correction of
      fluid deficit.

    <description>The 'lower volume' (LV) fluid bolus arm will receive a continuous background infusion of 4% dextrose in 0.18% NaCl at 50ml/hr for the entire 4 hour rehydration period. Subjects will be given a hand-held trigger, which when pressed will deliver an additional volume of fluid from the infusion pump; this will be administered over a 10-minute period (thus allowing a maximum of 6 boluses per hour). In the LV arm, the trigger will deliver 50mls over 10 mins at a rate of 300ml h-1. A green LED will signal to the patient that no additional infusion is running, and that pressing the trigger will activate delivery of another bolus. The volume and lockout periods for the boluses may vary but will remain within the maximum fluid administration of 1200mls per hour.</description>

Subjects will be given a hand-held trigger, which when pressed will deliver an additional volume of fluid from the infusion pump; this will be administered over a 10-minute period (thus allowing a maximum of 6 boluses per hour).
