  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postural orthostatic tachycardia (POTS) is characterized by abnormalities in the autonomic
      nervous system in the body. The autonomic nervous system controls and regulates body
      functions such as heart rate, breathing, digestion, and more.

      The investigator has shown that patients with POTS have higher cardiovascular and adrenergic
      activating autoantibodies (AAb), which likely changes the normal make-up of POTS. There are
      autoantibodies that have been suggested by a few reports of their presence in POTS, but their
      role different aspects of POTS is unknown. The study will look at the body's responses in
      patients with POTS. The crossover study design is to have half of the patients will start
      with sham followed by active stimulation and half will start by active followed by sham
      stimulation. It is anticipated that results will provide a potential therapeutic approach
      based on the understanding of POTS.
