    <textblock>
      Impaired cervical joint position sense is associated with neck pain. This study will
      determine the effects of sensorimotor control training exercises on cervical joint position,
      pain, ROM and function in nonspecific chronic neck pain. There will be two groups ;
      experimental and control. Half of study group will receive cervical sensorimotor control
      training exercises and half of study group will receive conventional physiotherapy protocol.

      The study is Randomized Control Trail , which is being conducted in physical therapy Out
      patient department of Pakistan Railway hospital (April 2019-July 2019) . Sample size of 18
      individual was calculated using Epitool with 95% confidence interval (CI), and power 80%.
      Individual will be screened out according to inclusion criteria. Individuals will be
      allocated randomly into two groups , 9 in cervical Sensori-motor training group and 9 in
      conventional physiotherapy protocol group by sealed envelope method.

      Both groups will receive conventional physiotherapy protocol (hot pack, stretching exercises
      and strengthening exercises) for neck pain in common and the experimental group will receive
      cervical sensorimotor control training in addition to conventional protocol.

      Assessment will be done on baseline and 6th week.

      Data will be analysed on SPSS version 21.

    <description>This test is design to assess how well an older adult is using sensory inputs when one or more sensory systems are compromise. Begin timing each trial using a stopwatch. The trial is over when (a) the participant opens his/her eyes in an eyes closed condition, (b) raises arms from sides, (c) loses balance and requires manual assistance to prevent a fall</description>

    <description>Neck Disability Index (NDI) is a questionnaire designed to assess how neck pain has affected patient's ability to manage in everyday life. It has total 10 sections, For each section the total possible score is 5: if the first statement is marked the section score = 0, if the last statement is marked it = 5. If all ten sections are completed the score is calculated and converted into percentages. The maximum Score of Neck Disability Index (NDI) is 50. It is measured at Baseline before Intervention.</description>

Participants will be ask to nominate 3 to 5 activities that they are unable to do or having difficulty doing because of their neck pain. These activities will be rated on a 0-10 scale, where 0 is unable to perform the activity and 10 is able to perform the activity at same. An average of all activities scores will be use for analysis</description>
