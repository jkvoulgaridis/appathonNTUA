  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gynecological cancers represent more than half of female cancers. It has been clearly
      established that cancer survivors suffer from important health issues such as pain during
      sexual intercourse (dyspareunia) and sexual dysfunctions which sorely impact their quality of
      life. Although it affects more than 63% of cancer survivors, the available treatments remain
      limited and poorly studied. Cancer survivors are thus confronted with these health issues as
      well as relationship difficulties and psychological consequences, with limited treatment
      avenues. Addressing pelvic floor muscle dysfunctions and loss of vaginal elasticity, pelvic
      floor physiotherapy was shown to be effective in reducing or even alleviating dyspareunia and
      improving sexual function. Until now, no study investigated this treatment in gynecological
      cancer survivors with dyspareunia. Therefore, there is a need to examine pelvic floor
      physiotherapy to determine whether or not gynecological cancer survivors with dyspareunia
      could benefit from this treatment. The objectives of this single-arm mixed-method study are
      to evaluate the acceptability and feasibility of a physiotherapy treatment in gynecological
      cancer survivors suffering from dyspareunia and to explore treatment effects. This single-arm
      study using mixed methods will involve three data collections (pre- and post-treatment
      assessments). These assessments will be carried out by physiotherapists. Participants will
      receive physiotherapy treatment weekly in individual 60-minute sessions for 12 weeks.
      Thirty-one gynecological cancer survivors with vulvovaginal pain during sexual intercourse
      for at least 3 months will be recruited. The results of this study will bring new information
      regarding physiotherapy treatment for this population in preparation for a definitive
      randomized controlled trial.
