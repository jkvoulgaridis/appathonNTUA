  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purposes of this study are to obtain preliminary evidence on the efficacy of a cooling
      mattress pad in reducing subjective hot flashes for peri and postmenopausal women
      experiencing menopausal hot flashes, and to obtain preliminary evidence on the efficacy of a
      cooling mattress pad for improving sleep for peri and postmenopausal women experiencing
      menopausal hot flashes.

      Women will be recruited from the community through flyers. They will call into a study phone
      line at which time they will be screened for their initial eligibility using a telephone
      screener. Women who are eligible and willing to participate, will come to the Research Center
      in Winston-Salem to be consented and complete baseline questionnaires. They will be sent home
      with a hot flash diary to complete for two weeks in order to confirm a sufficient number of
      hot flashes for study eligibility. After two weeks, women will mail back their diaries and
      continue to record their daily hot flashes until they are notified by study staff of their
      eligibility, within a week of receiving the diary. If they qualify, a cooling mattress pad
      will be provided by study staff to be used for the duration of the intervention phase for
      approximately 8 weeks. The study staff will determine the efficacy of the cooling mattress
      pad through comparing answers to subject questionnaires at baseline and follow up in addition
      to comparing the baseline diaries to the intervention diaries.
