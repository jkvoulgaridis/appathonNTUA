  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this multicentre, randomized, double-blinded, single dose, two-way cross-over
      study, is to compare the pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) of two different
      doses of the biosimilar eptacog alfa (activated) with Novoseven in 48 patients, adult and
      children (&gt;12 years), not bleeding, with hemophilia A or B with inhibitors. Patients will be
      randomized to receive either a single dose of eptacog alfa biosimilar 90 μg/kg or 270 μg/kg
      and one single dose of NovoSeven 90 μg/kg or 270 μg/kg, or vice versa, with doses separated
      by a washout period. All patients will be followed 12 months and will receive biosimilar
      eptacog alfa, on demand, for every bleeding episode that should occur - or - for prophylaxis,
      with the aim of monitoring of inhibiting antibody formation, lack of efficacy and collection
      of safety data.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Forty-eight patients enrolled, not bleeding, will be randomized to receive two injections
      separated by a washout period of 3 days (t1/2 = 2.3h). Patients are centrally registered and
      randomized to receive in a 2x2 cross-over setting either a single dose of two for the
      following products: A: AryoSeven 90 µg/kg and B: NovoSeven 90 µg/kg - or - C: AryoSeven 270
      µg/kg and D: NovoSeven 270 µg/kg.

      Patients will be hospitalized at the time of study medication administration and plasma
      sampling. Before any treatment, a blood sample will be obtained in all patients for testing
      for immunogenicity.
