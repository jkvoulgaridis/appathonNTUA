  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this cross-sectional, multicenter study is to determine the prevalence of an
      eosinophilic phenotype of blood eosinophil count ≥ 300 cells/mm3 among severe asthma patients
      who attend to sites specialized in the management of severe asthma in several countries in
      the AstraZeneca International Region. The prevalence of an atopic phenotype and asthma
      control, will also be studied.

      To determine the prevalence of an eosinophilic phenotype of blood eosinophil count ≥ 300
      cells/mm3 among severe asthma patients attending their routine clinical visit at sites
      specialized in the management of severe asthma in several countries in the AstraZeneca
      International Region. The prevalence of an atopic phenotype and the status of asthma control,
      will also be studied. It is expected that this study will contribute to the understanding of
      severe asthma, ultimately helping to inform therapeutic decisions and addressing patients'
      needs.

        The study population will include patients from 12 years and older with severe asthma, as
        per the definition of the GINA 2018 Guidelines (GINA, 2018). Patients will be identified
        and invited to participate in the study consecutively, as they attend their routine
        clinical visit at the research centers.

        To be included in the study, each patient should meet all the inclusion criteria and none
        of the exclusion criteria described in the sections below. Patients should provide written,
        informed consent prior to any study-specific procedures.

        The enrolment period will be approximately 8 months or until the required number of
        patients has been included, whichever occurs first
