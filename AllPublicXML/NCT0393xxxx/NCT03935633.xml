        5. Usage:

           Subjects started fasting for solid from 21:00 on the day before the study and for liquid
           within 1 h before and after the administration. Subjects in each dose group received a
           single administration on the first day of the study on an empty stomach. Blood samples
           were collected at different time points before and within 48 hours after the
           administration (before the administration on day 3). No administration was conducted on
           day 2. continuous administration was conducted from day 3 to day 8, twice a day, once in
           the morning on an empty stomach, once in 12 hours (±15min). The valley concentration
           blood samples were collected in the morning on day 6, 7 and 8. In the morning of day 9,
           a single administration was conducted on an empty stomach. Blood samples were taken at
           the different time points before and within 48 hours after the administration on day 9.
           Each dose was taken with 240 mL warm water.Except for the water taken together with the
           tablets, it should be ensured that the water was banned for 1 hour before and after the
           valley concentration blood sample collection from day 6 to day 8 and 1 hour before and
           after the administration in the morning on day 1 and day 9.

        6. Pharmacokinetic assessment of CN128 administration:

           PK parameters of CN128 include AUC 0-t, AUC 0-∞, Cmax, Tmax, t1/2, CL/F, Vd/ F, MRT, λz,
           Css-av, Css-min, Css-max, Accumulation rate, Fluctuation index, etc.

        7. Safety and tolerability assessments:

           Evaluation was based on the incidence rate of adverse events (AE) after the
           administration, study termination information, vital signs (including body temperature,
           pulse, breathing, sitting blood pressure) and physical examination (including height,
           weight, general condition, skin, neck (including thyroid), eyes, ears, nose, throat,
           chest, abdomen, back, lymph nodes, limbs and nervous system examinations, and laboratory
           tests (blood routine, urine routine, blood biochemistry, coagulation function, serum
           iron, thyroid gland and parathyroid gland function), ECG to evaluate the status.

        8. Statistics:

             -  Pharmacokinetic analysis:

      Phoenix WinNonlin software (Pharsight Corporation, version 7.0) was used to estimate and
      analyze the parameters of PK in non-atrioventricular model according to dosage. The
      pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated in real time to fully reflect the characteristics
      of drug absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion in human body. The PK parameters
      of each participant were calculated according to the following methods. PK parameters
      include:

      AUC0-t, AUC0-∞, Cmax, Tmax, t1/2, CL/F, Vd/F, MRT, λz, Css_av, Css_min, Css_max, Accumulation
      rate and Fluctuation index.

      Descriptive statistics were summarized on untransformed datas of drug concentration in plasma
      at each time point: AUC0 t, AUC0-∞, Cmax, Tmax, t1/2, CL/F, Vd/F, MRTλz, Css_av, Css_min,
      Css_max, R and DF. Descriptive statistics was used in the analysis of Number (N), arithmetic
      mean, geometric mean, standard deviation (SD), CV, minimum, median and maximum. Average and
      individual time-concentration curves were drawn according to the study group.

      • Safety analysis All AE, treatment emergent adverse events (TEAE), drug-related TEAE, grade
      3 or above TEAE, serious adverse events (SAE), drug-related SAE, TEAE leading to death, TEAE
      leading to termination of trial, drug-relation TEAE leading to termination of trial and
      drug-related TEAE leading to discontinuation of use of test drug were summarized for case
      number, subject number and incidence rate. P value for the incidence of these AEs with
      different classifications was calculated by Fisher's exact test.

      TEAE, SAE, drug-related TEAE, drug-related SAE, TEAE leading to the termination of the trial,
      and TEAE leading to the discontinuation of drug use were summarized and described according
      to the system organ classification (SOC), preferred terminology (PT) and study group. The
      severity of TEAE and drug-related TEAE was also summarized according to SOC, PT and study
      groups.

      The measured value of parameters and changes from baseline of vital signs, 12-lead ECG,
      physical examination, clinical laboratory examination, etc. were summarized according to the
      planned time point and the study group.

      Determine dose-limited toxicity of multiple dose in human (DLT); Determine the maximum
      tolerable dose of multiple dose in human (MTD).
