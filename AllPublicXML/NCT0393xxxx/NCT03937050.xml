  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial will evaluate a package of three interconnected educational/behavioural
      interventions aimed at: a) improving knowledge and skills of GDM guidelines and skills of
      health providers; b) raising awareness of importance of GDM screening among pregnant women
      and their families; and c) improving confidence and skills in self-management among those
      diagnosed with GDM. The interventions will be delivered through the medium of film as they
      are low-cost and scalable, and are particularly suitable for people who are not very
      literate, making them ideal for low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).

      The research will be carried out in Uganda (Entebbe) and India (Bengaluru). A careful
      contextual analysis will precede the development of a culturally-tailored film-based
      intervention for each setting, which will be iteratively refined using qualitative research
      methods till it is fit for purpose. The effectiveness of the intervention will be evaluated
      in independent cluster randomised trials, involving ~10,000 pregnant women across 30
      maternity units at each site. The films will be made available in the intervention arm
      facilities: for viewing by doctors and nurses at their meetings, for continual screening in
      waiting areas of antenatal clinics, and during group education sessions (and personal mobile
      use) for GDM patients. Where video/projection facilities are unavailable, small low-cost
      projectors will be made available. Control arms will follow usual care practices.

      The principal research question is whether a low-cost educational/behavioural intervention
      delivered through a package of culturally-tailored films can provide scalable improvements in
      timely detection and management of GDM. This will be evaluated through assessing three
      endpoints: a) detection of GDM at 32 weeks of; b) glycaemic control (fasting glucose) in
      women with GDM at ~34 weeks of pregnancy; and c) adverse perinatal outcomes associated with
      GDM. Interviews will be conducted with women and health providers to help understand how and
      why the intervention may be (or may not be) successful. The ultimate aim of the project is to
      contribute to scientific evidence underpinning the use of films in cost-effectively scaling
      up behavioural interventions in low literacy settings.

    <description>Three film-based components:
Professional development of doctors and nurses to improve screening and management of GDM. Modules will cover knowledge and relevant clinical guidelines, skills for glucose monitoring and managing medication, specialist obstetric and neonatal care, and lifestyle counselling. These films will be screened 6-monthly at routine professional development meetings.
Awareness-raising among pregnant women and family members regarding GDM and the importance of healthy lifestyles during pregnancy. The films will be culturally tailored and will be screened in waiting areas of antenatal clinics.
Structured diabetes self-management education programme for women with GDM to empower them with the necessary knowledge, skills, and confidence to manage GDM successfully. The programme will incorporate behavioural counselling and educational reinforcement. Films will be screened at weekly group sessions and optimised for viewing on mobile devices.</description>
