    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the dose response of RPL554 in patients with
      moderate to severe CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE that are still symptomatic despite
      treatment with a stable background of tiotropium over 4 weeks of treatment. This study is
      intended to support optimal dose selection for a Phase III program evaluating RPL554 as an
      add-on treatment to standard of care therapy.

      This is a Phase IIb, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, multiple dose, parallel
      group study to investigate the effects of 4 weeks of treatment with nebulized RPL554 (at
      different dose levels) compared to placebo in patients with moderate to severe CHRONIC
      OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE on a stable background therapy of open-label tiotropium. The
      study comprises seven visits: Pre-screening (Visit 0), Screening (Visit 1) and then a
      Treatment Period consisting of Randomization (Visit 2), and weekly visits for 4 weeks (Visit
      3 to Visit 6).
