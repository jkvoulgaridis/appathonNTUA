    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well autologous tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (LN-145) and
      pembrolizumab work in treating patients with transitional cell cancer that cannot be removed
      by surgery or has spread to other places in the body and have failed cisplatin-based
      chemotherapy. LN-145 is made up of specialized immune cells called lymphocytes or T cells
      that are taken from a patient's tumor, grown in a manufacturing facility and infused back
      into the preconditioned patient to attack the tumor. Immunotherapy with monoclonal
      antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and
      may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving LN-145 may help
      control transitional cell bladder cancer when given together with pembrolizumab

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the efficacy of autologous tumor infiltrating lymphocytes LN-145 (LN-145) in
      combination with pembrolizumab in subjects with advanced transitional cell bladder cancer
      (TCC) using the objective response rate (ORR) and the duration of response (DoR), using the
      Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, version 1.1 (RECIST version [v] 1.1).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the efficacy of LN-145 in combination with pembrolizumab in subjects with TCC
      based on the progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).

      II. To evaluate the safety of LN-145 in combination with pembrolizumab in subjects with TCC
      based on the adverse event (AE) profile per Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events,
      version 5.0 (CTCAE v5.0).

    <description>Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV over 2 hours on days -8 and -7, fludarabine IV over 30 minutes on days -6 to -2, and pembrolizumab IV over 30 minutes on day -1. At least 24 hours later, patients receive autologous tumor infiltrating lymphocytes LN-145 IV on day 0, and receive aldesleukin IV over 30 minutes for up to 6 doses on days 1-4. Patients then continue receiving pembrolizumab IV over 30 minutes beginning on day 21. Cycles of pembrolizumab repeat every 21 days for 12 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.</description>
