      This study is to compare the systemic exposure of budesonide delivered by the combination
      inhaler (budesonide/albuterol sulfate pressurized inhalation suspension [BDA metered dose
      inhaler {BDA MDI}]) with Pulmicort Flexhaler dry-powder inhaler (DPI).

    <textblock>
      This study will be an open-label, randomized, 2-way cross-over study in healthy adult male or
      female participants, performed at a single study center.Participants will receive single
      doses of BDA MDI or Pulmicort Flexhaler on 2 occasions, under fasted conditions. There will
      be a minimum washout period of 3 days between each dose administration. A total of 66
      participants will be randomized in this study to ensure that at least 62 participants are
      evaluable. The study will comprise of screening period of maximum 27 days; Two treatment
      periods during which participants will be resident from the day prior to administration of
      budesonide/albuterol sulfate pressurized inhalation suspension metered dose inhaler (BDA MDI)
      or Pulmicort Flexhaler (Day -1) until at least 24 hours after dosing. Participants will be
      discharged on the morning of Day 2; and a final follow-up visit within 5 to 7 days after the
      last administration of BDA MDI or Pulmicort Flexhaler.
