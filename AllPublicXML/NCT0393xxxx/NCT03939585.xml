  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to reduce the risk of cancer relapse by giving a donor
      lymphocyte infusion (DLI) to boost the immune system early after a stem cell transplant so
      that leukemia cells that escaped chemotherapy can be detected and killed. This DLI will
      contain mostly lymphocytes that have graft versus tumor effect with low risk of graft versus
      host disease. Because the process of giving a DLI in the first four weeks after a transplant
      has not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), this study in
      investigational (experimental).

      The primary objective of this study is to investigate if donor lymphocytes depleted of TCR-αβ
      T cells and B cells can be infused on Day 28 following allogeneic stem cell transplantation
      without inducing Grade III-IV graft versus host disease, Grade II GVHD requiring systemic
      treatment and or new onset, severe neutropenia requiring growth factor support.

      This study also seeks to characterize the lymphocyte subsets obtained following depletion of
      TCR-αβ T cells and B cells from non-mobilized, leukapheresis products.

      Additionally, this study will attempt to describe occurrence of disease relapse and to
      describe the occurrence of post-transplant re- activation and/or infections with viruses such
      as CMV, and EBV.

    <description>This study will treat 10 participants with the donor NK/TCR-γδ T cell product. Of those 10 participants, 5 would have 10/10 HLA matched sibling donors (MSD) while 5 would have partially matched, related (haplo) donors.
27 days post transplant, the participant's donor will undergo a second, non-mobilized leukapheresis to obtain peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs).
Donor PBMCs will be processed next day (Day T+28) to obtain the NK cell/TCRγδ T cell product for same day infusion if the participant remains aGVHD free and clinically stable.
Participants will continue routine post-transplant and GVHD monitoring, as well as disease assessment at 56 days, 100 days, 6 months and 1 year following transplant.
Blood samples will be obtained on T=0, T+7, 14, 21 and 28 days and then weekly until T + 56 days, then on T+100 days, + 6 months and + 12 months. If immune-mediated adverse events occur (GVHD, CRS etc) additional blood samples will be obtained at onset and resolution.</description>
