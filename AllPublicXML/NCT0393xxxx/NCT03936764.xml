  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pulmonary resection surgery is currently the recommended curative treatment for early stages
      of non-small cell lung cancer. The implementation of preoperative respiratory rehabilitation
      programs has shown beneficial results on pulmonary function, functional level,
      cardiorespiratory conditioning and the occurrence and severity of postoperative complications
      in this population of patients. Despite these benefits, the most recent meta-analyzes
      highlight the fact that training modalities (duration, frequencies, intensity) are very
      heterogeneous. It is then difficult to structure a program only on the basis of data from the
      literature.

      In a cohort analysis of 50 patients trained from 2014 to 2017, our team reported a
      significantly greater improvement in physiological parameters in patients who performed 15 or
      more preoperative training sessions. This number of 15 outpatient sessions is therefore
      considered a minimum training goal in our current practice.

      The difficulty of the oncological context is to find the compromise between the necessary
      diligence to initiate the cancer surgical treatment and the necessary time to obtain the
      benefits of the preoperative rehabilitation. Previous study reports the difficulty of setting
      up a four-week training program, perceived as delaying surgery. In order to prevent any risk
      of prolonging the surgical management time, rehabilitation teams routinely offer short
      programs with high training frequencies of up to five to six sessions per week. It seems
      important to note that preoperative rehabilitation is normally considered in patients for
      whom there is a risk of moderate to high postoperative complications according to the
      European and North American recommendations. Thus these patients generally benefit from a
      longer period of assessment than patients whose risk is considered low in terms of their
      cardio-respiratory and muscular function.

      The median duration between the physiological evaluation of patients considered &quot;at risk&quot;
      before pulmonary resection surgery is 44 (Q1-Q3 29-76) days at Rouen University Hospital,
      with no significant differences observed between patients who have benefited or not from
      preoperative rehabilitation. Some teams have even pointed out that there is no difference in
      survival prognosis in the short or long term between patients who have had an operative delay
      of more or less 60 or 90 days respectively, which shows the compatibility with the set up a
      dedicated training course.

      As mentioned earlier, the concept of delay has led to extremely dense training for a
      functionally and cardio-respiratory fragile target population as evidenced by pejorative
      VO2peak. The density of the training, failing to generate significant physiological
      stimulation, may increase fatigue or limit adherence to training, especially if it requires
      movement, and is added to a therapeutic planning including many consultations and further
      examinations. To date, no study has evaluated the density of preoperative supervised training
      on pre-surgical benefits.

      The objective of this work is to compare the effectiveness of a program of 15 training
      sessions on VO2peak according to two different densities, namely five times a week over three
      weeks, or three times a week over five weeks.

    <description>Full name of the scale : &quot;European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Core Quality of Life Questionnaire and modular supplement for Lung Cancer patients&quot; (EORTC QLQ-C30 / LC13) The EORTC QLQ-C30, is a 30 questions questionnaire developed by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer, to assess the QoL of cancer patients. It has been translated and validated into over 100 languages and is used in more than 3,000 studies worldwide.
For patients with Lung Cancer, a 13 questions modular supplement, the LC-13, is validated.
The HRQoL is therefore evaluated by a set of 43 questions gathering all aspects that could be impacted.
A raw score is calculated for each dimension and summary score, then standardized from 0 to 100 points. The additional module for Lung Cancer (LC-13) provides a complementary dimension with specific items related to the tumor site.

    <description>Each prehabilitation session will last approximately 90 minutes and will include:
Endurance training at the ventilatory threshold, determined according to the initial CPET. The first session will last for 15 to 20 minutes then increase by 5 minutes each session to reach 45 minutes in total (including a 5-minute warm-up and 5 minutes of active recovery). The intensity will then increase by 5 or 10 W, as could be tolerated;
Peripheral muscle strengthening at 60% to 70% of the 1-repetition maximum of 3 main components (quadriceps press, whole-leg extension, and upper limb pull down). Three sets of 12 movements will carry out for each exercise and the load will increase weekly as tolerated;
Inspiratory muscle training using a threshold calibrated to at least 30% of the MIP. Patients will be encouraged to carry out 15 minutes of independent training daily and to increase the resistance regularly.
Education to bronchial drainage techniques as well as directed coughing.</description>
