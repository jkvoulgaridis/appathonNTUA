  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 3B multi-center, open-label, single-arm study of the efficacy and safety of
      apremilast, in subjects with plaque psoriasis that is not adequately controlled by topical
      therapy.

      Approximately 150 subjects will be enrolled at approximately 30 sites in Japan. After a 5-day
      titration, subjects will receive apremilast 30 mg tablets orally twice daily (BID) for 32
      weeks in addition to their existing topical therapy. Beginning at Week 16, subjects will be
      permitted to decrease the use of topical therapy at their discretion.

    <ipd_time_frame>Data sharing requests relating to this study will be considered beginning 18 months after the study has ended and either 1) the product and indication have been granted marketing authorization in both the US and Europe or 2) clinical development for the product and/or indication discontinues and the data will not be submitted to regulatory authorities. There is no end date for eligibility to submit a data sharing request for this study.</ipd_time_frame>
    <ipd_access_criteria>Qualified researchers may submit a request containing the research objectives, the Amgen product(s) and Amgen study/studies in scope, endpoints/outcomes of interest, statistical analysis plan, data requirements, publication plan, and qualifications of the researcher(s). In general, Amgen does not grant external requests for individual patient data for the purpose of re-evaluating safety and efficacy issues already addressed in the product labelling. Requests are reviewed by a committee of internal advisors. If not approved, a Data Sharing Independent Review Panel will arbitrate and make the final decision. Upon approval, information necessary to address the research question will be provided under the terms of a data sharing agreement. This may include anonymized individual patient data and/or available supporting documents, containing fragments of analysis code where provided in analysis specifications.
