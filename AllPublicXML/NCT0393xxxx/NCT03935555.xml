  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, Phase 1b study with dose escalation and expansion cohorts designed to
      assess the safety, tolerability, PK, and preliminary efficacy of PU-H71 in subjects with PMF,
      Post-PV MF, Post-ET MF, taking stable doses of ruxolitinib.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will employ a standard 3+3 dose escalation design to determine maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) and recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D), with additional subjects treated in a dose
      expansion cohort. The time period for collecting dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) is 1 cycle
      (21 days).
