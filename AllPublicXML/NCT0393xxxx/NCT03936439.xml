  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is the 4th leading cause of mortality in Hong Kong. It also carries considerable
      socioeconomical consequences due to disability.

      Ischemic stroke can be classified by the TOAST classification, which includes large artery
      atherosclerosis, cardioembolism, small-artery occlusion and other causes (1). Among which,
      intracranial atherosclerosis (ICAS) had been major cause of acute ischemic stroke (AIS) in
      the Asia Pacific. It was estimated as high as 24.1% of AIS or transient ischemic attacks
      (TIAs) were attributed to ICAS in China (2). Management of ICAS related strokes has been
      challenging owing to its high rate of recurrence despite medical therapy. Recent randomized
      clinical trial suggested that aggressive medical therapy may result in reduction in
      recurrence compared with historical cohorts (3).

      Our group has previously observed a 2.5-fold increase in atrial fibrillation related stroke
      over a 15-year period (4). The inverstigator also observed a decline in ICAS related AIS as
      well as its recurrent stroke risk throughout the recent years. Possible mechanisms include
      better management of metabolic risk factors and aggressive secondary prevention. Other
      possible reasons are increased atrial fibrillation (AF), small vessel disease (SVD) or other
      stroke mechanisms.

      This study is aim to find the evolution of different stroke subtypes in relation to the
      characteristics of our stroke population over a 15-year period. This may influence
      territorial prevention strategy.

      Five time points, i.e. 2004, 2006, 2008, 2010, 2012, 2014, 2016, 2018 are selected for
      analysis. All consecutive stroke patients included in the Prince of Wales Hospital stroke
      registry will be recruited.

      Patients will be stratified according to their stroke subtypes with reference to the TOAST
      classification (1), which includes large artery disease, cardioembolism, small vessel
      occlusion, other determined causes, undetermined cause or incomplete investigations.

      Stroke etiology is determined by stroke neurologists with reference to the history, physical
      signs, imaging including carotid duplex, transcranial doppler, computer tomography (CT), CT
      angiogram, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), MR angiogram, electrocardiography (ECG) and
      echocardiography. Interobserver variability for stroke mechanism determination will be
      evaluated.

      Pre-defined demographic data including age, gender, smoking status, vascular risk factors
      including hyperlipidaemia, hypertension, diabetes, prior stroke or TIA, etc. will be
      retrieved from the stroke registry.

      The investigator will also compare the use of antiplatelet agents, anticoagulants,
      lipid-lowering agents, specific antihypertensives in the Shatin territory across the 15-year
      period using the CDARS.
