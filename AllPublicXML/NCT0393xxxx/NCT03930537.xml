  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is well known that the changes in intramedullary canal during orthopedic surgeries can
      cause variuos complication. The change of femoral intramedullary pressure after implantation
      of hip replacement and its possible complications are not well studied and the investigators
      are aiming to give more answer to this issue.
