    <measure>Six Minute Walk Test (6MWT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline in 6MWT distance after using device at 3, 6, and 12 month follow-up.</time_frame>
    <description>The test measures the distance that the patient can walk on a flat, hard surface, indoors, in a period of 6 minutes. The walk test is patient self-paced and assesses the level of functional capacity. Patients are allowed to stop and rest during the test, however, the timer does not stop. If the patient is unable to complete the time, the time stopped is noted and reason for stopping prematurely is recorded. This test will be administered while wearing a mask to measure oxygen consumption.</description>

    <time_frame>Change from baseline in gait speed after using device at 3, 6, and 12 month follow-up.</time_frame>
    <description>This test will examine the patient's gait speed. Patients will be positioned 1 meter before the start line and instructed to walk the entire 10 meter distance and past the end line approximately 1 meter. The distance before and after the course are meant to minimize the effect of acceleration and deceleration. Time will be recorded using a stopwatch and recorded to the one hundred of a second (ex: 2.15 sec). The test will be recorded 6 times: 3 times at the patient's self-selected speed, and 3 times at the patient's quickest, yet safest speed. The average of each of the 3 times will be recorded. Adequate rest in between trials will be given.</description>
