      This will be a prospective single-arm before-and-after clinical trial in which raw corn
      starch (RCS) will be first applied on patients with unoperated insulinoma. Nutritional
      intervention with supplementation of RCS will be initiated in 20 patients with suspected
      insulinoma to improve their hypoglycemia before the surgery. Duration of nutritional
      intervention, fasting blood glucose, lipid profile, weight change, BMI and other metabolic
      indices will be recorded and compared before and after the intervention.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Insulinoma is a rare disease which can cause recurrent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia,
      subsequent hyperphagia as well as weight gain. As only 50% ~ 60% of pharmacological therapy
      (diazoxide, somatostatin, etc) is effective to elevate blood glucose, the nutritional
      interventions play a role as an important supportive treatment to maintain glycemic
      stablization and control weight gain before the curative surgery. As the essential management
      for patients with glycogen storage disease (GSD), the extended release cornstarch has been
      proved superior to prevent hypoglycemia since 1980s. Its application has elevated GSD
      patients' quality of life and prolonged their survival. In view of its charicteristic of
      chronic release in gastrointestinal tract, we will for the first time try to utilize the raw
      corn starch (RCS) on patients with suspected insulinoma and evaluate its efficacy of
      improving hypoglycemia in such patients.

      This will be a prospective single-arm before-and-after clinical trial. Nutritional
      intervention with supplementation of RCS will be initiated in 20 patients with suspected
      insulinoma to improve their hypoglycemia before the surgery. Duration of nutritional
      intervention, fasting blood glucose, lipid profile, weight change, BMI and other metabolic
      indices will be recorded and compared before and after the intervention.
