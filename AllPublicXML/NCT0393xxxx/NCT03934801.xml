  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of this study are to use the Delphi method to assemble an expert panel
      representing innovation in asthma treatment, to collect freely suggested recommendation
      statements concerning OCS tapering (and sub-topics) among severe asthma patients from this
      panel for peer evaluation, and finally to determine the level of consensus for each statement
      from the panel as a whole.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A series of anonymous questionnaires will be administered to a panel of experts. Each
      questionnaire administered results in a body of information that is re-presented to the
      experts before performing the next round. Initial brainstorming questionnaires are open in
      nature, and are used to generate statements that individual experts would like to see
      evaluated by their peers. Subsequent ranking questionnaires require that each expert rank
      each statement according to a pre-defined likert scale. Serial ranking questionnaires are
      administered electronically and continue until stopping rules are met, or the maximum number
      of allowed rounds is achieved (capped at three rounds for the present study).

      Experts are recruited by invitation or response to open call (see eligibility criteria and
      url at the end of this declaration.)
