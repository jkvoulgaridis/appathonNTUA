  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Investigators are building an empirical evidence base for real world data through large-scale
      replication of randomized controlled trials. The investigators' goal is to understand for
      what types of clinical questions real world data analyses can be conducted with confidence
      and how to implement such studies.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-randomized, non-interventional study that is part of the RCT DUPLICATE
      initiative (www.rctduplicate.org) of the Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical
      School. It is intended to replicate, as closely as is possible in healthcare insurance claims
      data, the trial listed below/above. Although many features of the trial cannot be directly
      replicated in healthcare claims, key design features, including outcomes, exposures, and
      inclusion/exclusion criteria, were selected to proxy those features from the trial.
      Randomization is also not replicable in healthcare claims data but was proxied through a
      statistical balancing of measured covariates according to standard practice. Investigators
      assume that the RCT provides the reference standard treatment effect estimate and that
      failure to replicate RCT findings is indicative of the inadequacy of the healthcare claims
      data for replication for a range of possible reasons and does not provide information on the
      validity of the original RCT finding.

        This study will involve a new user, parallel group, cohort study design comparing
        saxagliptin to the 2nd generation sulfonylurea (SU) antidiabetic class as a proxy for
        placebo. SUs are not known to have an impact on the outcome of interest. In addition, SUs
        were the most frequent background treatment in SAVOR-TIMI53 (after metformin), and DPP4i
        and SUs are preferentially prescribed to similarly older patients in real world (Patorno et
        al., 2019). The patients will be required to have continuous enrollment during the baseline
        period of 180 days before initiation of saxagliptin or a comparator drug (cohort entry
        date). Follow-up for the outcome (3P-MACE), begins the day after drug initiation. As in the
        trial, patients are allowed to take other antidiabetic medications during the study.
