  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sleep disorders affect human health tremendously. It has been reported that aromatherapy by
      fragrance inhalation can be used as an adjuvant therapy to modulate parasympathetic nervous
      activity for relieving stress and mood, and promoting sleep quality. Many researches
      confirmed that lavender essential oil can be used as an adjuvant therapy for sleep disorders.
      It can effectively relieve stress and modulate physical and mental status. However, many
      studies about aromatherapy lack sleep detection instruments to objectively confirm their
      effects on sleep physiology. Therefore, this study adopts Easy sleep complex essential oil as
      the experimental group. The lavender essential oil containing orange, petitgrain, rose,
      lavender, rosewood, ho wood, amyris essential oil and lavender oil is chosen as control
      group. The subjects will be randomly assigned to one of the two groups. The efficacy results
      will be evaluated and compared between the two groups. The investigators expect that
      aromatherapy by fragrance inhalation with Easy sleep complex essential oil will improve sleep
      quality more effectively than lavender essential oil.
