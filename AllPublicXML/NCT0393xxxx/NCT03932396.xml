  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to carry out a Micro-elimination program for HCV infection in
      a vulnerable population (people sentenced to non-custodial sentences). This group shares
      certain peculiarities with the prison population (vulnerability, addictions, mental
      disorders, etc.), is three times higher than the imprisoned population, and is regularly
      attended by Social Insertion Centers (CIS) in Spain. An additional objective is to link these
      people with the specific plans of the Government of Cantabria (Chronicity Plan, Care for
      Serious Mental Disorders, Harm Reduction Programs and the Center for Attention to Drug
      Addicts) as well as the Extended Bridge Program for Penitentiary Institutions, implementing
      the figure of a Navigator (a specialized professional in charge of helping subjects overcome
      barriers). It is an observational study based on the screening of disease in accordance with
      the recommendations of the health authorities. Once detected, patients will be referred to
      the corresponding specialized care following the usual clinical practice.
