             actively (&lt; 4 months since last menstrual period [LMP]) or between 4 and 12 months
             after LMP with a premenopausal FSH level; patients younger than 50 years of age who
             became amenorrheic while on adjuvant chemotherapy will be eligible only if the FSH
             level is in the premenopausal range (&lt;22.3 IU/litre). [1]

          2. BMI 18.5 to 30 kg/m2 (both inclusive).

             give written informed consent prior to the participation in the trial.

          5. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status ≤ 2.

          6. Patients with life expectancy of at least 3 months.

          7. Patient should have recovered from any toxic effects of previous chemotherapy as

         10. Patients must not have taken any anti-androgens, estrogen, antiestrogen, selective
             estrogen receptor modulators, aromatase inhibitors or hormonal forms of contraception
             within past one month of screening. Patient may have had recent use of oral
             contraceptive pills but these must be discontinued 30 days prior to dosing.

             situ of the uterine cervix or basal cell carcinoma of the skin

          5. Patients with a clinically significant medical condition other than advanced breast
             cancer including but not limited to renal, hepatic, gastrointestinal, endocrine,
             cardiovascular, neurological or psychiatric disease, alcohol or substance abuse, or
             any other condition that may affect the patient's health or the outcome of the trial
             as judged by the investigator.

          6. Presence of clinically significant physical exam, laboratory, medical history,
             ECG/echocardiogram findings that in the opinion of the Investigator may interfere with
             trial conduct, patient safety, or interpretation of results.

          7. Patients with a known hypersensitivity to GnRH, GnRH-agonist analogues or any of the

         15. Concomitant use of medicinal products known to prolong the QT interval or medicinal
             products able to induce Torsade de pointes such as class IA (e.g. quinidine,

             medical history, ECG that in the opinion of the Investigator may interfere with trial
