    <textblock>
      This RCT aims at investigating the effectiveness of the &quot;Tecaretherapy&quot; in patients with
      lateral elbow tendinopathy.

      60 patients will be randomized into one of the following 3 groups:

        -  &quot;Conventional physiotherapy treatment (CPT)&quot; (massage, eccentric exercises, stretching);

        -  &quot;CPT + Tecare&quot; (idem CPT group + tecaretherapy during the eccentric exercises)

        -  &quot;CPT + Placebo Tecare&quot; (idem &quot;CPT + Tecare&quot; group but with an inactive Tecare device)
           The treatment will include 18 30-minute sessions

      This RCT aims at investigating the effectiveness of the &quot;Tecaretherapy&quot; in patients with
      lateral elbow tendinopathy.

      60 patients will be randomized into one of the following 3 groups:

        -  &quot;Conventional physiotherapy treatment (CPT)&quot; (massage, eccentric exercises by means of
           an isokinetic dynamometer, stretching);

        -  &quot;CPT + Tecare&quot; (idem CPT group + Tecaretherapy during the eccentric exercises)

        -  &quot;CPT + Placebo Tecare&quot; (idem &quot;CPT + Tecare&quot; group but with an inactive &quot;Tecare&quot; device)
           The treatment will include 18 30-minute sessions.

      The &quot;Tecaretherapy&quot; consists in using a specific device providing high frequencies (between
      300 kHz and 1 MHz) supposed to accelerate the tissues healing process.

      Outcome sessions will be organized at baseline, after the first 9 sessions, at the end of the
      treatment as well as 3 and 6 months after the initial treatment session.

    <measure>change in the &quot;Patient-Rated Tennis Elbow Evaluation&quot; score</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>This questionnaire, developped for patients with elbow tendinopathy, consists of one part dealing with pain and a second part dealing with function. Each of the 5 items in part 1 is scored using a NRS, ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst pain imaginable). Part 2 is subdivided into Specific Activities (6 items) and Usual Activities (4 items). The 10 items of part 2 use a scale of 0 (no difficulty) to 10 (unable to perform an activity) to rate function. The total score is the combined score that rates pain and disability of equal importance. The pain score total (out of 50 points) and the functional subscale (60 points for specific activities, plus 40 points for usual activities to give a function subscale out of 100 points /2 to provide the remaining 50%) provide a total score, ranging from 0 (no pain and no functional impairment) to 100 (worst pain imaginable with a very significant functional deficit).</description>
