  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this clinical investigation is to evaluate the clinical benefits of an
      MultiSite pacing (MSP) with patient specific left ventricular vector optimization in patients
      receiving cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) after 6 months of therapy.

      This clinical investigation is a single-center, prospective, two-arm, randomized 1:1,
      crossover study designed to evaluate the effectiveness of Optimized MSP CRT compared to
      conventional bi-ventricular pacing.

      Data will be collected at enrolment, CRT implant procedure, hospital pre-discharge, one,
      three and six months post implant. Enrolment data collection will include demographics,
      cardiovascular history, medication, echocardiography measurements, heart failure quality of
      life questionnaire and six minute walk test distance.

      CRT implant procedure data collection will include implanted system information, lead
      location and conduction times. The electrical conduction recording procedure will include
      surface ECG and device electrogram (EGM) recordings during various MSP vector pacing
      configurations at the time of CRT device implant.

      Patients will also undergo simultaneous invasive pressure measurements using a left
      ventricular pressure wire to allow haemodynamic measurements (dP/dtmax) during various MSP
      vector pacing configurations.

      Optimal MSP programming settings will be determined by the narrowest QRS duration recorded by
      12 lead ECG and the greatest change in dP/dtmax by pressure wires study.

      In a subgroup of patients (approximately 25 patients), non-invasive electrical activation
      data will be collected with electrocardiographic imaging (ECGi) within 45 days of the implant
      procedure.

      Patients will then be randomized 1:1 to receive either standard biventricular pacing or
      Optimized MSP at their one-month follow-up (± 15 days) visit.

      At the 3 months (± 15 days) post randomization follow up visit, data collection will include
      surface ECG, EGMs, echocardiographic parameters and quality of life questionnaire. The
      patients will then undergo cross-over to the alternate randomization group with programming
      adjusted accordingly.

      At the final, 6 months (± 15 days) post randomization follow-up visit, data collection will
      include surface ECG, EGMs, echocardiographic parameters and quality of life questionnaire.
      This will mark the completion of the study for each patient.

      The expected duration of enrolment is 18 months. The total duration of the clinical
      investigation is expected to be 25 months.
