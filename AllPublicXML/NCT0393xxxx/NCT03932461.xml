    <textblock>
      Multicenter randomized controlled trial including patients with fecal or diffuse peritonitis
      to either vacuum assisted closure or relaparotomy &quot;on-demand&quot;. The aim with our study is to
      compare the postoperative complications between vacuum assisted closure and relaparotomy
      &quot;on-demand&quot;. All patients over 18 with suspected diffuse peritonitis from intestinal
      perforation will be included. Patients with primary peritonitis, abdominal trauma and lack of
      consent will be excluded. Primary outcome is postoperative complications after 30, 90 days
      and 1 year. Secondary outcome parameters are quality of life after 3 and 12 months (SF-36
      questionnaire), ventral hernia after 3 and 12 months. (assessed by CT) and cost-effective
      analysis. A power calculation was made which concluded that 320 patients should be included.

    <description>Complications requiring acute surgical intervention:
Incisional hernia +/- obstruction
Postoperative ileus due to intra-abdominal adherences or abscess
Fascial dehiscence
Failure of closuring the patient's own fascia
Abdominal compartment syndrome
Fistula between hollow organs and cutis or between two hollow organs
Intra Abdominal bleeding or hematoma
Perforation of intra-abdominal organ confirmed by surgery
Anastomotic leakage (confirmed by CT and relaparotomy)
Ischemia or necrosis of intra-abdominal organ
Enterostomy dysfunction due to prolapse, stenosis or failure
VAC treatment longer than 8 days
VAC change sooner than scheduled at 48-hour intervals
On-demand relaparotomy
30-day mortality
Intraperitoneal abscess
Complication requiring non-acute surgical intervention:
Enteroatmospheric fistula
Entero-enteric fistula
Fistula between hollow organ and other and other
Incisional hernia without obstruction</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of life after treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>3 and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of life is measured after 3 and 12 months by the short form health survey (SF-36) questionnaire.
The scale measures overall health status.
SF-36 consists of eight scaled scores, which are the weighted sums of the questions in their section. Each scale is directly transformed into a 0-100 scale on the assumption that each question carries equal weight. The lower the score the more disability. The higher the score the less disability i.e., a score of zero is equivalent to maximum disability and a score of 100 is equivalent to no disability.
Following eight sections are included: vitality, physical functioning, bodily pain, general health perceptions, physical role functioning, emotional role functioning, social role functioning, mental health.</description>

    <description>At the index operation after the source of fecal or diffuse peritonitis has been treated there will be placed a Vacuum assisted closure system VAC® (San Antonio, TX) to temporarily close the abdomen. After 48-hours the system will be changed and potential complications will be treated. The process will be repeated until the peritonitis condition is under control, whereafter the abdomen can be closed according to Isrealsson's principles. The process will be repeated 8 days after the index operation with extension if needed. If needed the system can be changed earlier than 48-hours. All patients are routinely observed by clinical examination and SOFA-score.</description>

    <description>At the index operation after the source of fecal or diffuse peritonitis has been treated the abdomen will be closed according to Isrealsson's principles. Patients will be reevaluated for potential relaparatomy every 48-hours based on clinical and paraclinical parameters by a surgeon. The process will be repeated continue 8 days after the index operation with extension if needed. If needed relaparotomy can be done earlier than 48-hours. All patients are routinely observed by clinical examination and SOFA-score.</description>
