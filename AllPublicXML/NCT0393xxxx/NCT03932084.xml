  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present randomized control trial sought to establish glucose fluctuation as an important
      target for management on metabolic index, neurologic function, and quality of life in Type 2
      diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients and cerebral infarction (CI).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is a significant association between glycemic ﬂuctuation and the incidence of diabetes
      macrovascular complications. Therefore, understanding the impact of glycemic fluctuations on
      diabetic macroangiopathy could be helpful for discovering a strategy of prevention and
      treatment of macroangiopathy in diabetes. However, previous studies on the glycemic
      fluctuation in T2DM patients with CI were cross-sectional studies, there has been no
      prospective intervention study confirming the effects of glucose fluctuation targeted
      management on the prognosis of T2DM patients following CI. Based on previous fingdings,
      investigators will assess the effects of glucose fluctuation targeted intervention on
      metabolic index, neurologic function, and quality of life in T2DM patients and CI.

    <description>The National Institute of Health Stroke Scale includes the following domains: level of consciousness, sensory, neglect, visual field, gaze, facial palsy, motor arm, motor leg, limb ataxia, language, and dysarthria. Each domain is scored on an ordinal scale ranging from 0 to 2, 0 to 3, or 0 to 4. Item scores are summed to a total score ranging from 0 to 42 (the higher the score, the more severe the stroke).</description>

    <description>The Stroke Impact Scale (SIS) is a specific scale that evaluates disability and health-related quality of life after stroke. This scale includes the following eight domains: strength, memory, thinking, emotion, communication and ADLs, mobility, hand function and participation. A total of 8 domains with 59 items, are scored on a 5-point scale, of which the sixth, eighth, and ninth questions of the emotional dimension are reversed, and the other items are positive. Each domain scores range from 0 to 100 and are calculated using the following equation: Calculated score=[(actual score- the lowest possible score in this domain) / (the difference between the highest possible score and the lowest score in this domain)]×100. The total score of the scale is the sum of all domains. A higher score indicates better quality of life and the less functional damage.</description>

    <description>The Modified Rankin Scale can discriminate clinically relevant levels of disability and recovery in clinical trials. The 0-6 Likert scale is as follows: 0-no symptoms; 1-no significant disability; 2-slight disability; 3-moderate disability; 4-moderately severe disability; 5-severe disability; and 6-dead. The higher the score, the worse the patient's prognosis. When evaluating prognosis, a score≦2 was classified as a &quot;good&quot;.</description>

    <description>During hospitalization:
Monitor subjects' blood glucose;
One-on-one education: Education includes skills related to diabetes self-management, basic knowledge of diabetes, diet, exercise, medication, blood glucose monitoring, risks of glucose fluctuations;
Teaching patients and their families to use blood glucose meters and correctly record results. The diabetes specialist nurses demonstrate correct methods for self-monitoring blood glucose.
During discharge: Patients were given standard hospital discharge instructions and were asked to monitor their blood glucose 5 times daily after discharge.
Follow-up: If a patient FPG was less than 7 mmol/L, 2hPG was less than 10 mmol/L, or A1c was less than 7%, no intervention would be implemented. If one of these items was above the numbers, a referral would be made to an endocrinologist for medication adjustment. Participants received telephone follow-up one week after discharge, thereafter, follow-up were conducted once a month.</description>

    <description>We set achieving goals for this intervention group (both A1c&lt;7% and LAGE&lt;80mg/dl). Participants received the same usual care as the control group; though additional attention was paid to glucose fluctuation on the basis of glucose control. Even the patient's FPG, 2hPG, and A1c were all well controlled, If his or her LAGE≥80mg/dl, we would carefully assess the patient's diet and exercise and daily activities first. If it was caused by lifestyle or events, the researchers worked with patients to find a self-care behavioral solution for the glucose fluctuation, and set behavioral goals, otherwise, the researchers would refer the patient to an endocrinologist for medication adjustment. During next follow-up, we evaluated the glucose fluctuation and target completion.</description>
