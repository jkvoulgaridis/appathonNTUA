  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine how a 28 Day Challenge influences mental health and
      well-being. This is a blinded study. Participants both with and without depression and
      anxiety, will be included. A moderation analysis will be performed to see whether changes in
      depression after the intervention are a function of baseline depression and anxiety levels.

    <intervention_model_description>Participants will be randomly assigned to Group 1, Group 2, or Group 3. Group 1 begins the 28 day challenge in October (while group 2 acts as a passive control) and Group 2 begins the 28 day challenge 1 months late (while Group 1 receives no further intervention). Group 3 will begin the 28 day challenge concurrent with Group 1, but will listen to different audio clips than Group 1 (blinded).</intervention_model_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Patient Heath Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1 months</time_frame>
    <description>The PHQ-9 is a self-administered survey used for diagnosing depression and assessing depression severity. It measures each of the 9 DSM-IV/V diagnostic criteria for depression on a 0-3 scale. Depression Severity is measured as follows: 0 none, 1-4 minimal, 5-9 mild, 10-14 moderate, 15-19 moderately severe, 20-27 severe. Validity has been assessed against structured clinical interviews. PHQ-9 scores ≥10 exhibited a sensitivity of 88% and a specificity of 88% for major depression.

    <measure>Change in Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1 months</time_frame>
    <description>The GAD-7 is a self report-based survey that assesses generalized anxiety disorder and severity on a 7-item scale. Scores of 5, 10, and 15 are taken as the cut-off points for mild, moderate and severe anxiety, respectively. The GAD-7 was compared to diagnoses by mental health professionals. Using scores &gt;/= 10, It has sensitivity of 89% and specificity of 82%.</description>

    <measure>Change in Perceived Stress Scale-10 (PSS-10)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Perceived Stress Scale-10 (PSS-10) measures global perceived stress via self-report on a ten item scale. Scores on the PSS can range from 0 to 40 with higher scores indicating higher perceived stress. Total scores ranging from 0-13 would be considered low stress. Total scores ranging from 14-26 would be considered moderate stress. Total scores ranging from 27-40 would be considered high perceived stress.</description>
