  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study compares low-dose prednisolone therapy against standard regimens of hydrocortisone
      therapy for the treatment of adrenal insufficiency (AI). AI is a condition in which,
      individuals are unable to sufficiently produce the natural stress hormone, cortisol.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Steroid replacement therapy is vital for the health of patients with adrenal insufficiency
      (AI), who are unable to produce the natural stress hormone, cortisol. The objectives of
      steroid replacement therapy are to replace the body's physiological requirements for cortisol
      without over-replacement and consequent Cushing's syndrome. Equally, under-replacement
      presents the risk of patients experiencing potentially fatal Addisonian crises.

      Appropriately replacing a patient's steroid requirement is a significant challenge.
      Hydrocortisone (HC) is used in the majority of patients with AI in the UK. However, HC has a
      short duration of action, necessitating dosing 3 times a day. Low-dose prednisolone (PR) is
      an alternative to HC which needs only once-daily. There have been no studies directly
      comparing low-dose PR to HC treatment.

      This is a two-arm, two-period, double-blind, randomised, cross-over study comparing the low
      dose PR and standard regimens of HC in the treatment of AI.

    <masking_description>Participants will be randomised to one of two arms: A) prednisolone in the first treatment period and hydrocortisone in the second period; or B) hydrocortisone in the first treatment period and prednisolone in the second period.
Blinding will be achieved by providing participants with a tablet three times a day regardless of the treatment they are currently on. If on a hydrocortisone treatment period, the participant will receive tablets of hydrocortisone at their personally tailored dose three times a day (morning, noon and afternoon). When on prednisolone, the participant will receive a prednisolone tablet in the morning (at their personal dose), followed by a matched placebo at noon and in the afternoon. The tablets used in the study have been specifically made for the study to maintain blinding.</masking_description>
