  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Autoimmune thyroid disease (AITD) is the main cause of hypothyroidism in reproduction women,
      iodine and bisphenol A are the environmental factors for AITD. The research was mainly
      designed to investigate the effect of iodine and BPA on AITD in reproduction women to provide
      new evidence for hypothyroidism in reproduction women.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      71 patients with thyroid autoantibody positive were treated as AITD group, another 71 healthy
      reproduction women were selected as normal group. Women age, BMI, thyroid disease history,
      family history, marital and reproductive history, whether the application of iodized salt,
      thyroid function and thyroid autoantibodies detection were recorded. Meanwhile urine iodine,
      urinary iodine/urinary creatinine, urine BPA and urinary BPA/creatinine were tested. The
      urine iodine and BPA levels of the two groups were compared. Taking AITD as the dependent
      variable, logistic regression was conducted to analyze whether urinary iodine and BPA were
      risk factors of AITD.
