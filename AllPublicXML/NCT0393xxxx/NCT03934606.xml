  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate an alternative clinical genetics cancer care delivery model, using non-genetic
      providers to introduce and order genetic testing. 250 prostate and 250 pancreatic patients
      will be recruiting. They will undergo genetic testing and complete study questionnaires.
      Results from this pilot study will be used to inform the strategies used by the Clinical Risk
      Evaluation Program (CREP) Genetic Counelors (CGS) and GI/GU physicians to deliver genetic
      testing and return genetic risk information to patients with prostate or pancreatic cancer.
