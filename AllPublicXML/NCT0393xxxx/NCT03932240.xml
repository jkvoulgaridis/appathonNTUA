  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This primary aim of this study is to compare the in vivo effects of fibrinogen concentrate
      and cryoprecipitate on the neonatal fibrin network after surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass
      to develop effective and safe strategies for managing coagulopathies in neonates.

      This study is a prospective, randomized control trial comparing two different sources of
      fibrinogen on clot kinetics (degradation time, structure, strength and polymerization) in
      post-CPB coagulopathy in neonates undergoing cardiac surgery. The two sources of fibrinogen
      include the blood product, cryoprecipitate, and a blood product alternative, fibrinogen
      concentrate. Cryoprecipitate is an allogenic blood product that requires cross-matching and
      thawing prior to administration and is associated with immunologic reactions and possible
      pathogen transmission. Fibrinogen concentrate, a blood product alternative, is a purified
      form of fibrinogen, which undergoes a pasteurization process to minimize the risk of
      immunologic and allergic reactions. The primary aim of this study is compare the in vivo
      effect of post-CPB administration of FC, a blood product alternative, to cryoprecipitate on
      neonatal clot properties and clinical outcomes.
