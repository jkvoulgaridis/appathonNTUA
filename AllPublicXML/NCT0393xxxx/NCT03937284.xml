  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) present an impaired intestinal permeability with
      consequent lipopolysaccharide (LPS) translocation in the systemic circulation. Plasmatic
      lipoproteins play a key role in the detoxification of LPS.

      The investigators aim to study the relationships between lipoprotein chemical composition and
      plasma LPS circulation in PD.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bacterial lipopolysaccharides are able to produce neuroinflammation and dopaminergic
      receptors degeneration. In addition, they may produce an accumulation of α-synuclein in the
      area of the substantia Nigra. Recent studies have shown that α-synuclein aggregates may be
      present also in gastrointestinal neurons of patients with PD. This last finding led to the
      hypothesis that the intestine might be an early site of PD disease in response to an
      environmental toxin or pathogen. Forsyth et al. have discovered an impaired intestinal
      permeability in subjects with recently diagnosed PD, and they found positive correlations
      between this factor, exposure to LPS and alpha-synuclein accumulation in gastrointestinal
      neurons. Plasma lipoproteins play a key role in the detoxification of bacterial endotoxins.
      Lipoprotein chemical composition is related to their detoxing properties. To the best of
      investigator knowledge, the relationships between lipoprotein chemical composition and LPS in
      PD have not yet been investigated. Therefore, the aims of this study are: I) to evaluate the
      chemical composition of VLDL, LDL and HDL in subjects with PD compared to a control group; 2)
      to analyze the activity of plasma lipid transfer proteins and LPS plasma levels in the same
      groups of subjects; III) finally, to investigate the correlations between the analyzed
      parameters.

      Subjects and method Twenty patients with PD and twenty healthy controls were recruited for
      the study. Fasting blood samples were taken for routine laboratory analysis and for the
      separation of EDTA plasma. Plasma samples stored at -80°C until were used for lipoprotein
      isolation and analysis and for the measurement of lipid transfer protein and LPS levels.
