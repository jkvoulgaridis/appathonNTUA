      1. To identify the difference in the lipidomic profiles between ADHD and controls;

        2. To examine the effects of methylphenidate and atomoxetine on the lipidomic profiles in
           ADHD, and the relationship between medication-related changes in the lipidomic profiles
           and medication-related improvements in the behavioral symptoms and neuropsychological
           functions;

        3. To map medication-related lipidomic biomolecules to their respective metabolic pathways
           to identify the underlying mechanisms of neuroprotective effects of methylphenidate and
           atomoxetine.

      Background: Although the efficacy of methylphenidate and atomoxetine in ADHD is well
      documented in clinical trials, more studies are needed to clarify the neuroprotective effects
      of these two medications. Lipids exert important neuroprotective effects for optimal brain
      development and functioning. Previous studies have demonstrated the significant connection
      between lipid dysregulation and the occurrence of ADHD. In addition, lipid dysregulation is
      closely related to the abnormal neural activity in individuals with ADHD. In this 3-year
      prospective project, we will perform a lipidomic analysis of blood before and after treatment
      with methylphenidate or atomoxetine, in order to identify the biological connections between
      the neuroprotective effects of medications and pathways of lipid metabolism in children with
      ADHD.

      Subjects and Methods: 70 drug-naïve patients with ADHD, aged 6-18, and 35 matched typically
      developing controls will be recruited in this project. We will randomly assign the 70 ADHD
      patients to two groups, 35 in the methylphenidate group and 35 in the atomoxetine group.
      Within the 12-week treatment period, we will use ADHDRS-IV, SNAP-IV, CBCL, YSR, CGI-ADHD-S,
      CGI-ADHD-I, SAICA, and Family APGAR-C to assess the improvement in the behavioral symptoms,
      and CPT and CANTAB to assess the improvement in the neuropsychological functioning. The blood
      sample will be collected, and we will use mass spectrometry to assess the medication-related
      change in lipidomic profiles.

      Anticipated Results: Using a prospective design, we anticipate that this study will delineate
      the effects of methylphenidate and atomoxetine on the lipidomic profiles in patients with
      ADHD. Furthermore, we will conduct pathway analysis to obtain crucial insight to the
      lipidomic regulation in neurophysiology of children with ADHD. We expect that the findings
      will increase our understanding of the neuroprotective effects of methylphenidate and
      atomoxetine in patients with ADHD, and identify the psychopharmacological mechanism of
      medication effects in ADHD via the pathways of lipid metabolism and regulation.

    <measure>ADHD Rating Scale-IV-Parent version: Investigator-Administered and Scored (ADHDRS-IV)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The first efficacy measure is the ADHDRS-IV, which is a scale composed of 18 items. The investigator will conduct a semi-structured interview with the parent to evaluate the severity of ADHD symptoms in the past week. ADHDRS-IV is a valid and reliable tool to assess the severity of ADHD symptoms, which has been widely used in pharmacological studies of ADHD in Taiwanese populations. ADHDRS-IV will be administered from visit 1 through visit 5 (baseline-week 12).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Swanson, Nolan, and Pelham IV scale (SNAP-IV), Parent Form and Teacher Form</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The SNAP-IV is composed of the ADHD symptoms for the inattention (Items 1 to 9), the hyperactivity/impulsivity (Items 10 to 18), and the oppositional symptoms (Items 19 to 26). SNAP-IV has been proved to be a valid and reliable tool to evaluate the severity of ADHD symptoms. The Chinese SNAP-IV has been used widely in the pharmacological studies on ADHD in Taiwanese populations. SNAP-IV will be administered from visit 1 through visit 5 (baseline-week 12).</description>
