  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Key goals are to establish the natural history of limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2I
      (LGMD 2I) and identify feasible and sensitive tools and biomarkers to measure disease
      affection and progression, determine the Norwegian LGMD 2I prevalence, carrier frequency and
      genotypes, and to assess health-related quality of life in the Norwegian LGMD 2I population.

      Main aims are to facilitate future clinical trials and contribute to good clinical practice
      with suitable methodology and to complete health and social care in order to optimize the
      function and quality of daily living of the patient group.

      A single-center study with Norwegian nationwide enrollment. Data is based on questionnaires,
      patient journals, clinical examination, a set of functional tests and biomarkers, and patient
      reported outcomes. Clinical/ paraclinical tests are repeated after 2-years in order to
      measure disease progression. Both skeletal muscle, heart and respiratory function will be
      examined. At baseline there will also be performed a sleep study in order to find if they are
      prone to sleep-disordered breathing.

    <measure>Echo intensity of muscles</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Change in echo intensity at a defined cross-sectional level in muscles in limbs, musculus rectus abdominis and paraspinal muscles from baseline at 2 years. Echo intensity is measured as grayscale pixels ranging from 0 (black) to 255 (white) through histogram analysis by an ultrasound software program. It calculates the mean value from the superficial 1/3 of a manually selected region of interest in three consecutive images from same location. Increase in echo intensity indicates increase in pathology.</description>

    <measure>Motor task performance</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Using the standardised scoring instrument &quot;Motor Function Measure for neuromuscular diseases&quot; (MFM) to measure the ability to perform 32 different motor tasks. The individual item score ranges from 0 (cannot initiate the task) to 3 (performs fully and normally). The items are divided into 3 domains: 1) Standing and transfers (13 tasks), 2) Axial and proximal motor function (12 tasks), 3) Distal motor function (7 tasks). The 3 domains give rise to 3 subscores. Both subscores and total score (0-96 points) will be measured. Baseline and changes from baseline at two years.</description>

    <measure>Disease-specific health-related quality of life (HRQOL)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, at 6 months, 1 year, 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Using the &quot;Individualized Neuromuscular Quality of Life&quot; (INQOL)-questionnaire to measure the burden of disease. It consists of 45 items. Each item is graded by a 7-point Likert scale (0-6/1-7).The 45 items make up 3 dimensions/domains: muscular symptoms, effects on life-domains (activities, independence, emotions, body image, social relationships) and effects of treatment. The 3 domains are together subdivided into 11 subdimensions, each with its own subscale. In addition there is a QOL-score which is a composite score from the &quot;Life-domain&quot;. The scores range from 0-100 and are determined by the item responses and a weighting algorithm. The higher the scores, the more negative impact. Both subscales and QOL-score will be determined - at baseline and changes from baseline at 6 months, 1 year and 2 years.</description>
