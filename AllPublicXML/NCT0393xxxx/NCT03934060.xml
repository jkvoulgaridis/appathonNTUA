  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Reduced activity levels and reduced muscular strength could severely impair the activities of
      daily living (ADLs) in pediatric leukemia and Non-Hodgkin lymphoma patients. Increased muscle
      strength is associated with improved accomplishment of ADLs and consequently greatest
      possible normality, autonomy and mobility. Primary outcome of this RCT (n=20/20) is the
      analysis of effects of a treatment-associated and close to every day life strength training
      (2-3 times/week) compared to a general exercise program (standard care).

    <measure>Change of score of the Activities Scale for Kids - performance version</measure>
    <time_frame>Change of the ASK score from baseline to 3 months, change from 3 months to 6 months, change from 6 months to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The ASK - Activities Scale for Kids performance version by NL Young assesses an overall summary score (0-100) of self-reported activities of daily living in children and adolescents. The scale monitors changes associated with therapeutic interventions. Higher values represent a better outcome. The ASK contains 30 items in 7 sub-domains (personal care, dressing, other skills, locomotion, play, standing skills and transfer).</description>

    <measure>Change of motor performance analyzed with the Motor performance test in Pediatiric Oncology (MOON)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change of motor performance from baseline to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Motor performance is assessed by the MOON-test, a tool to examine motor performance abilities in children and adolescents during and after cancer treatment. There's no summary score; reference values of healthy children enable comparison of the tested children.</description>

    <measure>Change of level of physical activity</measure>
    <time_frame>Change of physical activity level from baseline to 3 months, from 3 to 6 months, from 6 to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Physical activity is assessed using an accelerometer (movisens) for the period of 7 days.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in performance in a parkour in activities of daily living</measure>
    <time_frame>Change of score in the parkour from baseline to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>A standardized parkour with tasks imitating activities of daily living is used to objectively verify the ASK score. Points from 0-4 are counted for each task depending on quality of movement (0 = task can not be completed, 1 = task can be completed with help, 2 = task can be completed with several attempts, 3 = task can be completed with only little effort, 4 = task can be completed without any problems or effort). There are no reference values for the parkour, but intra-individual changes are analyzed.</description>
