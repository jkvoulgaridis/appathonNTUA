  <brief_summary>

      Background:

      Blood disorders like sickle cell disease and malaria affect many people around the world.
      Researchers want to learn more about blood disorders. To do this, they need to collect
      biological samples from people with blood disorders. They also need to collect samples from
      healthy people.

      Objective:

      To collect samples to use for research on blood disorders.

      Eligibility:

      People ages 18-70 who have blood disorders. Healthy volunteers without blood disorders are
      also needed.

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with a medical history, physical exam, and blood and urine
      tests.

      Participants will give one or more samples. They will give them over 5 years. They can choose
      not to give any of the samples:

      Saliva: Participants will spit into a tube. They may also have the inside of their mouth
      swabbed.

      Urine: Participants will urinate into a cup.

      Blood: Blood will be taken through a needle in the participant s arm.

      Fat samples: An area on the participant s belly or buttock will be numbed. A small cut will
      be made into the skin and a small piece of fat removed.

      Mucus and cells from the lungs: The participant will be sedated. A flexible tube will be
      inserted through the nose or mouth into the lung airways. These participants will also have a
      physical exam, chest x-ray, and heart tests after the procedure.

      Our goal is to understand the function of alpha globin in both erythroid and non-erythroid
      tissues. We hope to better understand the mechanism(s) through which alpha globin deletions
      protect against malaria, sickle cell disease or other diseases involving inflammation or
      endothelial dysfunction.

      The Physiology Unit of the Laboratory of Malaria and Vector Research studies the role of
      alpha globin in erythroid and non-erythroid tissues. The collection of human specimens from
      healthy volunteers and patients with malaria, sickle cell disease, or other diseases
      involving inflammation or endothelial dysfunction is necessary for the development of
      laboratory and physiological assays to further basic and clinical research studies. This
      protocol defines the purposes for which specimens will be collected and establishes general
      conditions under which sample collection will be performed. Development of assays and our
      research into the roles of alpha globin in normal human physiology, as well as in the
      pathogenesis of malaria and sickle cell disease, requires laboratory analysis of
      saliva/buccal swab, urine, blood, adipose tissue, bronchial brushing, and/or bronchoalveolar
      lavage specimens from human volunteers.

        -  PARTICIPANT INCLUSION CRITERIA:

               1. Aged 18-70 years.

               2. Able to provide informed consent.

               3. Willing to allow biological samples to be stored for future research.

               4. Willing to provide one or more of the following tissues: saliva, urine, blood,
                  adipose tissue, bronchial brushing, and/or BAL samples.

               5. Willing to allow genetic testing on collected biological samples.

                  PARTICIPANT EXCLUSION CRITERIA:
