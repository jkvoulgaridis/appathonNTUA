  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this research is to analyze data from smartphone-based and wearable sensors,
      using advanced machine-learning and data-mining techniques, and to combine this information
      with performance-based measures, participant-reported measures, and structured interviews to
      create a clinical toolbox to (i) identify individuals who exhibit reduced prosthesis use
      (compared to expected usage levels based on K-level designation and/or participant goals of
      community mobility and social interaction), (ii) identify prosthetic/physical and
      psychological factors that limit prosthesis use, and (iii) determine the effect of targeted
      interventions to increase prosthesis use and facilitate achievement of participant goals.
      Objective sensor-based measurement of home and community activities will allow for the
      correlation of real-world function to in-clinic assessments and to monitor changes resulting
      from rehabilitation interventions in real time. Machine-learning and data mining techniques
      will be used to identify a subset of measures from this toolbox that sensitively and
      accurately reflect real-world function, enabling clinicians to predict and assess activity
      and provide effective interventions to optimize prosthesis use. The goal of this project, to
      improve overall performance with respect to activities of daily living and other real-world
      activities, thus addresses the FY17 OPORP Focus Area of Orthotic or Prosthetic Device
      Function.

      The overall goal of this research is to create a clinical toolkit to predict prosthesis use
      and function in the community. With this toolkit, clinicians will be able best determine an
      individual's K-Level designation, resulting in increased prosthesis use.

      Aim 1: Determine whether a participant's prosthesis use matches the assigned K-level and/or
      self-reported goals and, if not, determine the reason(s) using an expert panel to evaluate
      data from performance-related measures, participant-reported measures, and smartphone and
      prosthesis sensors (clinical toolbox).

      Aim 2: Quantify the effects of targeted physical intervention (prosthesis repair/refit,
      physical rehabilitation) or psychological intervention (motivational interviewing) or both on
      activity levels and patient goals.

      Aim 3: Identify measure(s) that sensitively predict prosthesis use to create a clinically
      deployable toolkit to evaluate and optimize prosthesis use in the community.

    <intervention_model_description>Upon enrollment, participants will be provided two sensors to track mobility and prosthesis use. Participants will wear the sensors continuously for 3 months and then will return to complete a set of assessments. The result of these assessments and analysis of sensor data will determine if the participant is meeting mobility goals and expected prosthesis use. Participants not meeting goals or prosthesis use will receive an intervention for 3 months. The intervention may include prosthetic care and physical therapy, or motivational interviewing, or both. During these 3 months, sensors will continue to monitor activity. After completion of intervention, participants will repeat the set of assessments and those who have improved in mobility goals and/or prosthesis use will continue to be monitored with sensors for an additional 3 months, after which the set of assessments will be completed a final time, assessing the maintenance of mobility goals and prosthesis use.</intervention_model_description>

    <measure>Pre-intervention: 6 Minute Walk Test (6MWT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12-13</time_frame>
    <description>The 6 minute walk test is performed as an objective evaluation of functional exercise capacity. The test measures the distance that the patient can walk on a flat, hard surface, indoors, in a period of 6 minutes. The walk test is patient self-paced and assesses the level of functional capacity. Patients are allowed to stop and rest during the test, however, the timer does not stop. If the patient is unable to complete the time, the time stopped is noted and reason for stopping prematurely is recorded. This test will be administered while wearing a mask to measure oxygen consumption.</description>

    <time_frame>Week 12-13</time_frame>
    <description>This test is a standardized 14-item objective measure of postural stability and static balance; it is an established fall predictor in adults. Balance is measured during various tasks on a 5 point scale, ranging from 0-4. &quot;0&quot; indicates the lowest level of function and &quot;4&quot; the highest level of function, with a total possible score of 56. A score of 20 or less indicates a high fall risk.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>After the first three months of sensor monitoring, participants not meeting goals will receive an intervention (others will be removed from the study). The intervention assigned is not pre-determined, but will be assigned by an expert panel based on the individual needs determined from the assessment results and monitoring data. The intervention may include prosthetic care, physical therapy, motivational interviewing or other related psychological interventions, or a combination thereof. After three months of intervention, assessments are performed again and if improvement in prosthesis use is determined, participants are monitored for another three months to assess maintenance of prosthesis use (participants showing no improvement are removed from the study before these final three months of monitoring).</description>

    <intervention_name>Needs-based intervention (physical, psychological, or both)</intervention_name>
    <description>Individuals identified as having physical issues (poor prosthesis fit, function, comfort or physical conditioning) will receive prosthetic care and physical therapy. This includes adjusting socket fit, component fit and repair, and in some instances replacement. Rehabilitation strategies include gait and prosthesis use retraining, balance fall-prevention, and range-of-motion training, strengthening, pain management, and activities of daily living training, based on participant-reported mobility goals. Individuals whose prosthesis use is reduced due to psychological issues will be provided with motivational interviewing and other related psychological interventions. During these interventions participant will be asked to set personal goals using a semi-structured interview that explores facilitators and barriers to wearing their prosthesis. If both physical and psychological issues are present, participant may receive both types of interventions simultaneously.</description>
