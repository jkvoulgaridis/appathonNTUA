  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Advance care planning (ACP) enables individuals to define goals and preferences for future
      medical treatment and care, to discuss these goals and preferences with family and
      health-care providers, and to record and review these preferences if appropriate. Research
      has shown that most Western patients express the need about what ACP entails.

      Ethnicity creates an important cultural impact on how people look at life and death, so that
      there is an influence on making decisions about end-of-life care. The Turkish ethnic group is
      one of the largest visible non-Western minority groups in Western countries. Studies on how
      ACP is perceived among patients from Turkish origin are lacking.

      The objective of this study is exploring the knowledge, experiences, point of views,
      preferences, attitudes, facilitators and barriers concerning advance care planning of older
      people from Turkish origin in Belgium. Semi-structured interviews (in the native Turkish
      language) will be used.
