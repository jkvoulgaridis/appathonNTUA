  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The research proposed here will translate findings from preclinical research and provide the
      initial clinical evidence that orexin antagonism reduces motivation for cocaine, as well as
      other cocaine-associated maladaptive behaviors in active cocaine users. This study will also
      provide basic science information about the orexinergic mechanisms underlying the
      pharmacodynamic effects of cocaine in humans. As such the outcomes will contribute to our
      understanding of the clinical neurobiology of cocaine use disorder. Overall, the proposed
      work seeks to expand the scope of current clinical neuroscience research on cocaine addiction
      by focusing on orexin, which has strong preclinical evidence supporting its critical role in
      addiction but remains unstudied in humans.
