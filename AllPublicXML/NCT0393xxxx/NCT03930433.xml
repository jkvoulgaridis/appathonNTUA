  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The correlation between endothelial dysfunction and the risk of coronary heart disease is
      well known through previous studies. The degradation of the function of nitric oxide acting
      on the endothelium of blood vessels is mainly explained by reduction of synthesis, loss due
      to oxidative stress, and decreased sensitivity to vascular dilatation action. In particular,
      patients with high blood pressure have been known to have impaired vascular endothelial
      function through animal experiments and several clinical studies, mainly due to increased
      biomechanical friction in the blood vessels and decreased biological availability of nitric
      oxide, which in turn causes incongruity in the production of nitric monoxide and changes in
      normal vascular dilatation. There have also been reports recently that early diagnosis and
      treatment may improve endothelial dysfunction and prevent the progression of coronary artery
      disease. However, the reality is that the drugs available in vasospastic angina patients with
      endothelial dysfunction are very limited. Until recently, beta-blockers were reported to
      inhibit vascular dilatation of adrenaline stimuli, a drug corresponding to relative
      contraindications in vasospastic angina patients, with one study reporting that propranolol
      cannot, but rather exacerbates, vasospastic angina. However, a series of reports on the
      vascular dilatation of the recently developed third-generation beta-blockers have reinvented
      the role of beta-blockers in vasospastic angina, especially nebivolol (selective, continuous
      beta-blockers) is known to act on β-1 adrenaline receptor blockings and endothelium to create
      vascular dilatation, and also to stimulate β-3 adrenaline receptors to cause nitric oxide
      generation and antioxidant effects in the endothelium of blood vessels. Therefore, this
      clinical trial seeks to find whether nebivolol will inhibit vascular contraction in
      hypertensive patients and will work in angiospastic angina patients.
