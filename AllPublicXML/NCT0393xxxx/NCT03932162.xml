  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study does not involve any particular diagnosis. The goal of this research study is to
      explore the effects of artificial sunlight (ultraviolet B radiation; UVB) on the skin of
      young adults versus geriatric adults. Sunlight exerts many effects on the body. There is
      evidence that in response to ultraviolet B radiation (UVB), which are the burning rays of
      sunlight, young adult skin responds differently than geriatric skin. In fact, researchers
      feel that this difference in how the skin reacts to UVB is why skin cancers are found in
      older skin. Researchers believe that a major difference between young adult and geriatric
      skin is that young skin has a lot of a protein called insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1),
      whereas geriatric skin has very little. The current study will test how young adult versus
      geriatric skin responds to UVB, and if geriatric skin treated with an injection of small
      amount of IGF-1 drug will then act like young skin.
