  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Type 2 diabetes is amongst the foremost challenges facing policy makers in Thailand,
      accounting for considerable death, disability and healthcare expenditure. Under Thailand's
      strong primary health system, medical management of diabetes is widely available. However,
      control of blood glucose and other cardiovascular disease risk factors, and regular screening
      for early detection of complications remain low due to a lack of services for education and
      counselling to support behavioural changes necessary for good self-management of the
      condition. A substantial literature documents the effectiveness of Diabetes Self-Management
      Education (DSME) programs for improving diabetes outcomes, although little high-quality data
      are available in Thailand, and traditional delivery models (health-professional led
      one-to-one or small-group sessions) are unlikely to be scalable in Thailand given current
      human resource and budgetary constraints. Thus, a low-cost DSME program will be developed
      with a scalable delivery model for roll-out within the Thai primary care system. The
      intervention will be based on behaviour-change and social support theories, delivered in
      monthly group meetings by lay health workers or nurses, and aided by a suite of short films
      to introduce key topics and stimulate discussion. 21 primary care units will be randomised to
      offer to those with diabetes diagnosed within the first three years. DSME will be delivered
      by lay health workers, nurses (for comparative effectiveness), or usual care. After 12
      months, glycaemic control and cardiovascular risk scores will be compared between the three
      arms. Cost-effectiveness will be assessed, also process and policy evaluations to produce
      best-buy recommendations for the Thai Ministry of Public Health.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The health and economic consequences of Type 2 diabetes mellitus are largely attributable to
      its complications, which can be prevented or delayed by good disease control, achieved
      through medical care and self-management. Diabetes Self- Management Education (DSME) programs
      are effective and cost-effective, and part of standard care in high-income countries, but are
      unavailable in Thai healthcare system, despite universal coverage of medical aspects of
      diabetes care. Negative perceptions of educational programs, sustained by a lack of
      high-quality local data, and concerns about burden on existing staff time and costs are
      thought to be responsible.

      Given the focus on community-based education for chronic diseases in recent primary
      healthcare reforms, it is timely to scale-up DSME in Thailand, if an affordable model of
      delivery for a locally-tailored intervention can be found. The aim is to work in close
      collaboration with the Thai Ministry of Public Health to develop, pilot and evaluate a
      peer-based DSME program and delivery model. A final list of policy recommendations for
      optimal integration into the Thai healthcare system will be produced.

      The aim is to identify a scalable model for delivery of DSME across Thailand.

      Specific project objectives are:

        1. To design a prototype of the DSME intervention

        2. To refine the intervention prototype and trial design

        3. To evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the intervention under two
           alternative modes of delivery (nurse-led and peer-led)

        4. To identify the 'best buy' model for scale-up of DSME delivery in the Thai health
           system.

      The primary hypothesis is that either model of DSME delivery will be effective and
      cost-effective, but the peer-led model will be a more scalable option for the Thai health
      system.

      The two key research gaps in scientific literature that will be addressed are:

        1. Clinical and cost-effectiveness of DSME programs in low- and middle-income countries,
           specifically Thailand

        2. Role of peer programs in supporting complex behaviour change generally, and its
           implementation in low- and middle-income settings specifically.

      The main expected outcomes are:

        1. Development of a fully worked-up rapidly scalable model for DSME delivery in Thailand;

        2. Capacity building of emerging Thai researchers and practitioners (nurses, village health
           volunteers) in the science and delivery of complex behavioural interventions, which
           could be expanded to other chronic conditions;

        3. Long-term collaborative research links between UK and Thai researchers.

    <description>Quality of Life measure that will also assess cost-effectiveness. Includes five quality of life question on mobility, self-care, usual activity, pain, anxiety / depression and a scale of 0 to 100 on how the person is feeling on that day.
Each dimension has 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, and extreme problems. The respondent is asked to indicate his/her health state by ticking in the box against the most appropriate statement in each of the 5 dimensions. This decision results in a 1-digit number expressing the level selected for that dimension. The digits for 5 dimensions can be combined in a 5-digit number describing the respondent's health state.</description>

    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The assessment of physical activity comprises a set of 4 questionnaires. Long (5 activity domains asked independently) and short (4 generic items) versions.There are two forms of output from scoring the IPAQ. Results can be reported in categories (low activity levels, moderate activity levels or high activity levels) or as a continuous variable (MET minutes a week). MET minutes represent the amount of energy expended carrying out physical activity.
Expressed as MET-min per week:
MET level x minutes of activity x events per week
Sample Calculation:
MET levels MET-min/week for 30 min episodes, 5 times/week Walking = 3.3 METs 3.3*30*5 = 495 MET-min/week Moderate Intensity = 4.0 METs 4.0*30*5 = 600 MET-min/week Vigorous Intensity = 8.0 METs 8.0*30*5 = 1,200 MET-min/week
