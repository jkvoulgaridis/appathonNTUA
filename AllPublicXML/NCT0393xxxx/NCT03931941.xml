    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multicenter, open-label Phase 3 study of a microbiota suspension of
      intestinal microbes. Patients who have had at least one recurrence of CDI after a primary
      episode and have completed at least one round of standard-of-care oral antibiotic therapy or
      have had at least two episodes of severe CDI resulting in hospitalization may be eligible for
      the study. Subjects may receive a second RBX2660 enema if they are deemed treatment failures
      following the initial enema per the protocol-specified treatment failure definition.

      This is a prospective, multicenter, open-label Phase 3 study of a microbiota suspension of
      intestinal microbes. The primary assessments for this study are (i) safety via assessment of
      treatment-emergent adverse events and (ii) efficacy of RBX2660 preventing recurrent episodes
      of CDI measured at 8 weeks after treatment. Follow-up office visits occur at 1 week and 8
      weeks after completing the initial study treatment. Telephone assessments occur at 4 weeks,
      and 4 and 6 months after the study. Patients who have had at least one recurrence of CDI
      after a primary episode and have completed at least one round of standard-of-care oral
      antibiotic therapy or have had at least two episodes of severe CDI resulting in
      hospitalization may be eligible for the study. Subjects may receive a second RBX2660 enema if
      they are deemed treatment failures following the initial enema per the protocol-specified
      treatment failure definition.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. ≥ 18 years old.

          2. Medical record documentation of either: a) recurrent CDI per the study definition,
             that includes at least one recurrence after a primary episode and has completed at
             least one round of standard-of-care oral antibiotic therapy, b) or has had at least
             two episodes of severe CDI resulting in hospitalization.

          3. A positive stool test for the presence of toxigenic C. difficile or C. difficile toxin
             within 30 days prior to or on the date of enrollment.

          4. Is currently taking or was just prescribed antibiotics to control CDI related diarrhea
             at the time of enrollment.

        [Note: Subject's CDI diarrhea must be controlled (&lt;3 unformed/loose stools/day) while
        taking antibiotics during screening.]

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Has continued CDI diarrhea despite being on a course of antibiotics prescribed for CDI
             treatment.

          2. Requires systemic antibiotic therapy for a condition other than CDI.

          3. Fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) within the past 6 months.

          4. FMT with an associated serious adverse event related to the FMT product or procedure.

          5. Bezlotoxumab (CDI monoclonal antibodies) if received within the last year.

          6. CD4 count &lt;200/mm3 during Screening.

          7. An absolute neutrophil count of &lt;1000 cells/µL during Screening.

          8. Pregnant, breastfeeding, or intends to become pregnant during study participation.
