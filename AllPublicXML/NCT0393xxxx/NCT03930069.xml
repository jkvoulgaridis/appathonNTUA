    <textblock>
      A prospective randomized study designed to compare the efficacy of transcervical vasopressin
      injection versus vaginal misoprostol in reducing intra -operative blood loss during
      hysteroscopic mymectomy .

    <textblock>
      This was a prospective, randomized, study on forty women with symptomatic submucous myoma
      presented mostly with bleeding and/or infertility scheduled for hysteroscopic myomectomy were
      randomized to groups (group A) 20 patients transcervical intramyoma vasopressin injection and
      (group B) 20patients with vaginal misoprostol is used .

    <description>one ampoule of vasopressin was diluted to 50 ml of normal saline, and 10 ml (4 units of vasopressin) was withdrawn in a syringe. Needle was inserted through the working channel of the hysteroscope until its tip was seen. The needle tip was pointed to the site of injection under hysteroscopic guidance during the whole injection technique. Aspiration was done first to avoid intravascular injection of vasopressin. The diluted solution was injected into the surface, especially to parts with dilated vasculature till they blanch.</description>
