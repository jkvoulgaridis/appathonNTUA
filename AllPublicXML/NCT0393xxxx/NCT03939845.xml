  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The 1-year and 2-year overall survival rate (OS), local control rate (FFLP), disease-free
      progression time (PFS), and side effects were compared in patients with hepatocellular
      carcinoma limited to intrahepatic unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma with portal venous
      thrombosis combined with or without external radiotherapy, providing a basis for the
      development of relevant guidelines.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. confirmed by pathology or met the clinical diagnostic criteria of hepatocellular
             carcinoma.

          2. after the joint consultation between the interventional department and the
             radiotherapy department, the patients who were considered to be interventional were
             considered. Meeting the following criteria: the tumor was confined to the liver
             (meeting the liver tolerance dose), and was diagnosed as type II or type III portal
             vein tumor thrombi according to chang's classification criteria, without extrahepatic
             metastasis. Number of tumors in liver parenchyma: less than or equal to 3. The main
             portal vein is not completely blocked or the compensatory collateral vessels of the
             portal vein are abundant although it is completely blocked.

          3. patients who meet all the following criteria: Child-Pugh score ≤7, PLT&gt;30×109/L,
             WBC&gt;3×10^9/L/ANC&gt;1.5×10^9/L,Hb&gt;90g/L, Cr&lt;2.0mg/dL.

          4. ECOG score 0-2 points.

          5. estimated survival time &gt; 3 months.

          6. age &gt; 18.

          7. sign the informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. patients with the following condition: the number of intrahepatic tumors &gt;3 or total
             tumor diameter＞15cm.

          2. patients with signs of extrahepatic metastasis, including but not limited to inferior
             vena cava carcinoma thrombus, bone metastasis, brain metastasis or regional lymph node
             metastasis.

          3. patients with West Haven standard grade III/IV hepatic encephalopathy or ascites.

          4. patients with a history of malignancy other than primary HCC, except for cutaneous
             squamous cell carcinoma or basal cell carcinoma.

          5. patients with a history of upper abdominal radiotherapy.

          6. in the radiotherapy plan, patients who failed to follow the radiation dose limit of
             important organs, including those whose normal liver tissue was less than 700 ml in
             the radiotherapy plan.

          7. screening patients who have received other study drugs within 4 weeks prior to the
             start of the visit.

          8. screening: patients who had received treatment for other local or systemic
             hepatocellular carcinoma within 4 weeks before the visit.

          9. patients with significant concurrent diseases.

         10. lactating or pregnant female patients.
