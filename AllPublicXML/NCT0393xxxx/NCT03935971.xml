      The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of dupilumab on allergic contact
      dermatitis.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will recruit 20 patients with allergic contact dermatitis who have not
      improved with allergen avoidance up to 6 months after patch testing, but where allergic
      contact dermatitis is still suspected. Subjects will receive 10 weeks of dupilumab, and both
      clinical data and tissue samples will be assessed.

    <measure>Change in Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) score</measure>
    <time_frame>week 0, week 6, week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The investigator's global assessment is a physician-reported global assessment of disease activity (range 0-4) with 0 being clear and 4 being severe</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Body Surface Area (BSA)</measure>
    <time_frame>week 0, week 6, week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The body surface area is a physician-reported measure of the amount of disease involvement. The patient's palm size approximates 1% of body surface area involvement.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) score</measure>
    <time_frame>week 0, week 6, week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The eczema-area-and-severity-index score is a composite score of disease severity and extent of disease distribution. It was initially developed for evaluation of eczema. Disease severity (range 0-3; 0 being no disease and 3 being severe disease) is a measure of redness, thickness/induration, scratching, and lichenification. Each characterization is measured separately for body regions (head and neck, trunk, upper extremities, and lower extremities) to calculate a regional score. The total score is a sum of the four body regions (range 0-72).</description>

    <measure>Change in Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) itch</measure>
    <time_frame>week 0, week 6, week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The numerical rating scale for itch is a patient-reported measure of itch (range 0-10) with 0 being no itch and 10 being the worst imaginable itch.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in SLEEPY-Q (Sleep Questionnaire) score</measure>
    <time_frame>week 0, week 6, week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The Sleepy-Q is a patient-derived, patient-reported sleep questionnaire for patients with chronic inflammatory dermatoses that consists of 28 individual questions. It assesses four dimensions of sleep in patients with inflammatory skin conditions: sleep disturbance (overall score 0-40, 0 being &quot;no sleep disturbance&quot; and 40 being &quot;severe sleep disturbance&quot;), causes of sleep disturbance related to dermatitis (binary, yes/no), causes of sleep disturbance unrelated to dermatitis (binary, yes/no), and impairment related to sleep disturbance (two subscales including Life Impairment Score = overall 0-40, being 0 &quot;no life impairment&quot; and 40 &quot;severe life impairment&quot; and Dermatitis Impairment Score = overall 0-30, being 0 &quot;no impairment&quot; and 30 &quot;severe impairment.&quot; The total impairment related to sleep disturbance is scored overall 0-70 after summing of the two subscales).</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. At least 18 years of age

          2. At least one contact allergen with a 2+ (strong) or 3+ (extreme reaction) confirmed by
             patch testing within 6 months of the baseline visit that can be duplicated at the
             initiation of the study (placement at Week 0 and patch test reaction read at Week 0
             +72-120 hours).

          3. Allergic contact dermatitis diagnosed clinically by the principle investigators who
             have expertise in allergic contact dermatitis

          4. Investigator's global assessment score of at least 3 (range 0-4) at the screening and
             baseline visits

          5. Documented recent history (within 6 months of patch testing) of inadequate response to
             treatment with topical medications and allergen avoidance

             anti-IL 12/23 agents, or anti-IL 23 agents, within 4 months of baseline visit or the
             patient's prior patch testing, whichever is longer.

          4. Use of rituximab within at 6 months (or until lymphocyte counts have normalized if
             longer than 6 months) of the baseline visit or the patient's prior patch testing,

             infection requiring treatment within 4 weeks of the baseline visit, immunosuppressed
             status (ie recurrent or resistant opportunistic infections)

          8. Malignancy within 5 years of the screening visit excluding local cutaneous squamous
             cell carcinoma, basal cell carcinoma or cervical carcinoma in situ that has been fully
             treated.

          9. Women who are or plan to become pregnant or breastfeed during study participation or
             are unable or not willing to use birth control during the study and for 4 months after

             barrier (ie male condom and female diaphragm), vasectomy, intrauterine device, and
             hormonal contraception. Females who have not had menses within 1 year of the baseline,
             bilateral tubal ligation, hysterectomy, and/or bilateral oophorectomy visit do not
             require additional methods contraception during study participation.

         10. Unstable condition or status, as per study investigator's judgment, that may lead to
             more likely discontinuation from the study including but not limited to major,
             recurrent medical illnesses that may require hospital admission and/or discontinuation
             of dupilumab, surgery that would require discontinuation of dupilumab and/or major
             rehabilitation, inability to participate in all study visits and administer dupilumab
