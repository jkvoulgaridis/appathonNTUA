  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Numerous scientific publications in France and internationally have described the healing,
      anti-bacterial, anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory and immuno-modulating properties of honey.

      Honey is effective in the management of many infected or uninfected post-surgical wounds.

      This study focuses on post surgical wounds after toe amputation in diabetic patients.

      The main objective of this study is to compare the rate of epidermisation at six months for
      these wounds, between honey dressing and other dressing devices used according to the french
      Haute Autorité de Santé (HAS) recommendations

    <description>The protocol includes rinsing the wound with the saline, gently drying the edge of the wound, applying a thin Mélectis®G film to the entire wound surface and covering with a secondary dressing.
Dressings will be rehabilitated based on the evolution of the wound and clinical judgement of the investigator or nurse at home as recommended.</description>
