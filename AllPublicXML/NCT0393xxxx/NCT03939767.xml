  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this observational study researchers want to learn more about changes in visual acuity
      (clarity of vision) with proactive flexible treatments over time in patients suffering from
      wet age-related macular degeneration (wAMD) after decision to treat with Aflibercept (Eylea)
      was made. Wet AMD is an eye disease that progressively destroys the macula, the central
      portion of the retina, impairing central vision.

             proactive regimen was made as routine clinical practice.

          -  Treatment-naïve in the study eye (no prior therapy for wAMD).

          -  Patient age ≥50 years of age.

          -  Written informed patient consent before the start of data collection (according to the

             clinical practice.

          -  Patients with contraindications to IVT aflibercept listed in the local marketing

          -  Planned treatment regimen outside of the local marketing authorization.

          -  Patients with eye diseases, e.g. advanced glaucoma or visually significant cataracts,
             likely to require surgery during the observation period in the study eye.

          -  Concomitant ocular or systemic administration of drugs up to 3 months before IVT
             aflibercept treatment that could interfere with or potentiate the mechanism of action
             of IVT aflibercept, including other anti-VEGF agents in the fellow eye.

          -  Any other retinal disease which may interfere with the treatment of wAMD.
