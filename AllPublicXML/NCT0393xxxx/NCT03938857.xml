      Multicenter, double blind randomized controlled trial of fentanyl vs. fentanyl +
      dexmedetomidine as the initial regimen for maintenance of sedation in
      mechanically-ventilated, critically ill children.

      This trial will evaluate the opioid-sparing effect of dexmedetomidine when administered with
      fentanyl to mechanically ventilated, critically ill children. Study drug or placebo will be
      administered with fentanyl, which will be titrated to achieve sedation scores consistent with
      response to light touch. Plasma samples and bedside assessments for pain, sedation, and
      delirium will be collected.

    <textblock>
      Phase 1b randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled dose escalation trial of sedation
      regimens in critically ill children. Testing the hypothesis of mean daily fentanyl dose
      through day 7 of mechanical ventilation will be reduced by â‰¥25% by the addition of
      dexmedetomidine to fentanyl therapy. This trial will involve multiple clinical sites.
      Randomization will occur by individual and investigators will be blinded to study/treatment
      arm. The statistical analysis will account for center effects, participant characteristics
      (including post-surgical state), and changes over time to minimize bias. In addition, PIs and
      study coordinators will undergo training to standardize assessment procedures. The study will
      randomize participants to receive placebo (fentanyl standard of care) titrated to
      sedation+saline placebo (bolus+infusion) or one of the following 3 Dexmedetomidine treatment
      arms in a sequential cohort fashion: Cohort 1: Fentanyl SOC titrated to sedation +
      Dexmedetomidine (0.5mcg/kg bolus load + 0.2 mcg/kg/hr infusion); Cohort 2: Fentanyl SOC
      titrated to sedation + Dexmedetomidine (0.5mcg/kg bolus load + 0.5mcg/kg/hr infusion); and,
      Cohort 3: Fentanyl SOC titrated to sedation + Dexmedetomidine (0.5mcg/kg bolus load +
      0.7mcg/kg/hr infusion).

      An interim analysis is planned for this trial.

    <description>Characterize the exposure response relationships of fentanyl and dexmedetomidine when administered alone or in combination in children receiving mechanical ventilation. PK is known to be altered in children compared to adults, and in those with critical illness. Characterization of pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relationships can improve dose optimization when dose may not be equivalent to plasma exposure and related effect. The SBS is a 6-point scale that ranges from +2 to -3 with -3. Scores that are more negative reflect a more sedated state (-3). Scores that are more positive reflect a more agitated state (+2).
