  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the benefits of combining repetitive Transcranial
      Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) coupled with Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT) in treating
      combat-related Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) symptoms. The study will also examine
      change in depression, psychosocial functioning, and neurophysiological (i.e.,
      electroencephalography and magnetic resonance images) measures.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Using three treatment arms, the study will examine Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)
      symptom reduction when (1) 1 Hz (hertz) repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS)
      to the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (rDLPFC) is administered prior to each of 12
      Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT) sessions compared to when (2) sham rTMS is administered to
      the rDLPFC is administered prior to each of 12 CPT sessions and to when (3) 1 Hz rTMS is
      delivered to rDLPFC alone over 12 sessions.

      Veterans with combat-related PTSD will be randomly assigned to one of the three treatment
      arms. Primary outcome PTSD symptom severity measures, secondary neuropsychological,
      electroencephalography (EEG), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) outcome measures, and
      prescreening assessments for study contraindicators will be collected prior to being assigned
      to a treatment arm (i.e., baseline).

      Primary outcome PTSD symptom severity measures and secondary neuropsychological outcome
      measures will be collected twice within the span of the treatment sessions (i.e., sessions 5
      and 9) and at three times following treatment competition (i.e., 1-month, 6-months, and
      12-months). EEG also will be collected at the 1-month, 6-month, and 12-month assessments, and
      MRI will be collected at the 6-month and 12-month assessments.

    <masking_description>Cognitive Processing Therapists will be blind to the treatment arm to which the participants are assigned.
Baseline and outcome measure neuropsychological assessments will be conducted by an independent, blinded evaluator who is not part of the treatment team.
Electroencephalography and magnetic resonance imaging data will be collected by technicians who are blinded to the arm to which the participants are assigned.
Technicians administering repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) will be blind to whether they are using an active or sham coil and to the treatment arm to which the participants are assigned. The coils are identical and will be setup by a different technician.
Participants assigned to the 1 Hz rTMS coupled with Cognitive Processing Therapy or sham rTMS coupled with CPT will be blind as to whether they are receiving active or sham rTMS.
Participants receiving rTMS only will not be blind to their group assignment.</masking_description>

    <description>A Magstim Rapid2 Stimulator repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) device will be used to deliver 1 hertz (Hz) stimulation to right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (rDLPFC) at 110% of a participant's rTMS motor threshold. The device passes electric current through a coil generating an alternating magnetic field. When positioned over the skull, the changing magnetic field causes electromagnetic inducted current flow in brain regions subjacent to the coil. Magnetic pulses (1.5-2.0 Tesla) lasting 100-300 microseconds at 1 Hz will be used.
Motor threshold will be defined by the TMS intensity to right motor region required to induce visually perceptible movement of the contralateral abductor pollicus brevis 50 percent of the time.</description>

    <description>A Magstim Rapid2 Stimulator repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) device will be paired with sham coil. The sham coil will induce electrical current flow in the tissue above the skull but will not induce current flow in brain tissue. The sham coil will be placed over the right prefrontal scalp region to target current flow in rDLPFC. Magnetic pulses lasting for 100-300 microseconds at 1 Hz will be used.
For consistency across the rTMS conditions, motor threshold in the sham condition also will be determined by positioning the active rTMS coil over the right motor region and identifying the stimulation intensity required to induce visually perceptible movement of the contralateral abductor pollicus brevis 50 percent of the time.</description>
