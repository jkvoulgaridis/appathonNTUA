  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to find out the significance of gut-microbiota in acute stroke patients,
      including their neurological, radiological outcomes as well as their stroke mechanisms.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients who suffered from acute stroke and in hospitalization in Prince of Wales Hospital
      will be recruited in the study.

      After the informed consent, their first bowel opening will be collected for storage. They
      will also receive assessment by the stroke team at 3 and 6 months to determine their outcomes
      (NIHSS and mRS). Clinically and radiologically parameters including their degree of
      disability, imaging findings will also be collected to determine whether there are any
      correlations with the stool microbiota composition against matched individuals.

    <time_frame>31 Dec, 2020</time_frame>
    <description>Gene sequencing of the 16S rRNA on the stool samples are performed to identify the microbes down to genus level, as well as the microbrobiota diversity and relative abundance. And stroke etiology classified by TOAST Classification and disability indices (NIHSS &amp; mRS at baseline, 3 month &amp; 6 month) will be recorded.</description>

    <time_frame>31 Dec, 2020</time_frame>
    <description>Gene sequencing of the 16S rRNA on the stool samples are performed to identify the microbes down to genus level, as well as the microbrobiota diversity and relative abundance. All patients who received a plain CT brain &amp; MRI for the diagnosis of stroke will be reviewed. Infarct volume in DWI, MR angiography abnormalities, presence of microbleed and/or haemorrhagic transformation will be documented.</description>

    <description>Consecutive patients diagnosed with acute ischaemic stroke during hospitalization in Prince of Wales Hospital will be recruited.
After an informed consent, stool will be collected from enrolled patients in their first bowel opening after hospitalization and stored in a freezer (-80 degree Celsius) within 24 hours for analysis. If a subject develops constipation, stool sampling will be facilitated by stool softener or laxatives. Stools samples will be stored at -80 degrees Celsius within 24 hours once it is collected.
Subjects will be followed up at 3 and 6 months after trial entry. NIHSS and mRS will be performed at each visit. Stool sample collection will be repeated in 6 months visit only.</description>

    <description>Age and disease matched subjects will be invited to join the study as the control. Stool will also be collected for the comparison of gut microbiota with acute stroke patients to look for evidence of gut dysbiosis in acute stroke. We shall match the control cohort with the stroke cohort in terms of age, gender, smoking status, medical co-morbidities including hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, diabetes, (atrial fibrillation), use of medications in particular metformin, proton pump inhibitors and aspirin.</description>

      Stools samples will be stored at -80 degrees Celsius within 24 hours after collection. 16S
      rRNA gene amplicons will be obtained through DNA extraction, PCR amplification and
      purification using available kits. After pyrosequencing, sequences will be analysed using
      mother pipeline and grouped into operational taxonomic units and classified using GreenGenes.
      OTU based microbial diversity was estimated by calculating the nonparametric Shannon
      diversity index. Alpha diversity and abundance profiles will be used for downstream
      statistical and modeling analysis.
