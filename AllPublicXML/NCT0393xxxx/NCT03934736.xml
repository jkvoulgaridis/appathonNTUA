    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single arm study design to evaluate HEPLISAV-B® in adults with ESRD
      who are initiating or undergoing hemodialysis.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eligible participants will receive single doses of HEPLISAV-B® at Weeks 0, 4, 8, and 16 and
      will be followed through Week 68 or end of study (EOS). The study is designed to evaluate the
      immunogenicity over a 20-week period and safety over a 68-week period.
