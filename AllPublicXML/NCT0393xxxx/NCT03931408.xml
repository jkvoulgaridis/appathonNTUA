  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Participants will undergo daily gentamicin bladder instillations to determine if its use will
      reduce the rate of symptomatic urinary tract infections (UTIs) as well as the use of oral and
      intravenous antibiotics in adults with chronic spinal cord injury (SCI) who have recurrent
      UTIs. Participants are randomized into one of three groups: 1) Gentamicin and saline
      instillation 2) Saline only instillation 3) Standard of care, no instillation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if twice daily bladder flushing with an antibiotic
      solution will decrease the rate of UTIs and the use of oral medications used to treat UTIs.
      The occurrence of UTIs in the SCI population is high, with a rate of about 2.5 episodes per
      year. The inability to effectively empty the bladder increases the risk of UTIs, which are
      the most common medical complication after SCI. This study will help us understand the
      effectiveness of a local bladder therapy on preventing UTIs and improving bladder function in
      individuals with SCI.

    <description>Participants will be randomized into one of three groups. In this arm, participants will perform bladder instillations using a 60ml solution of gentamicin mixed with saline, 2 times per day. A formulation derived from 480 mg gentamicin sulfate diluted in 1 L normal saline will be used for instillation. Participants will be blinded during the study and will not know if they are receiving gentamicin or placebo (saline alone).</description>

    <description>Gentamicin will be compounded for immediate use in single-dose, disposable BD 60ml Luer-Lok tip syringes. The container closure system for the diluted gentamicin sulfate solution and saline solution will be sterile and processed with depyrogenation. The solution will be slowly infused into the bladder after drainage of urine is complete. While monitoring blood pressure, the solution will remain in the participant's bladder for a least 30 minutes (unless the participant is experiencing autonomic dysreflexia, and in that case, immediately drained) with the goal of attaining 2 hours.</description>
