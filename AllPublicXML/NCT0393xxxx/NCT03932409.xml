      The purpose of this single arm, open label study is to evaluate the feasibility of
      pembrolizumab combined with radiation administered to the upper part of the vagina (vaginal
      cuff brachytherapy) followed by three cycles of pembrolizumab and chemotherapy in patients
      with endometrial cancer.

      Before the patient begins the study:

      Endometrial cancer is commonly treated with surgery. The patient must have already had
      surgery including hysterectomy (removal of the uterus) prior to being considered eligible for
      this study. The surgery may also include removal of the ovaries, and removal of pelvic and
      para-aortic lymph nodes. Following the surgery, the doctor will identify if the patient has
      factors related to the cancer which places the patient at a greater risk for the cancer
      returning.

      Prior to participating in this study there are exams, tests or procedures to find out if the
      patient can be treated in the study. Most are part of regular cancer care. Tumor tissue will
      need to be collected for study tests to see if the patient is eligible for to take part on
      the study.

      TREATMENT If the patient is eligible, pembrolizumab will be given 7 days before radiation
      therapy. After radiation therapy, three cycles of pembrolizumab and chemotherapy will be
      given.

      Study participation will be up to two years.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. All patients must have undergone hysterectomy. Bilateral salpingooophorectomy is
             strongly encouraged but not mandatory.

          2. Pelvic and para-aortic lymphadenectomy are optional, but strongly encouraged.

          3. If either a bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy or nodal dissection was not performed,
             post-operative pre-treatment CT/MRI is required and must not demonstrate evidence
             suggestive of metastatic disease (adnexa, nodes, intraperitoneal disease).
             Post-operative, pre-treatment CT/MRI must be performed if a pelvic and para-aortic
             nodal dissection was not performed.

          4. Tissue from an archival sample or newly obtained core or excisional biopsy of a tumor
             lesion within 10 weeks confirming diagnosis.

          5. All patients will be staged according to the FIGO 2009 staging system and with
             endometrial carcinoma (endometrioid types) confined to the corpus uteri or with
             endocervical glandular involvement fitting one of the following high-intermediate risk
             factor categories:

               -  age ≥18 years with 3 risk factors

               -  Risk factors:

                    1. Grade 2 or 3 tumor, (+) lymphovascular space invasion, outer ½ myometrial
                       invasion. Patients with these risk criteria may be enrolled with either
                       positive or negative cytology.

                    2. Patients with Stage II endometrial carcinoma (any histology) with cervical
                       stromal invasion (occult or gross involvement), with or without
                       high-intermediate risk factors.

                    3. Patients with serous or clear cell histology (with or without other
                       high-intermediate risk factors) are eligible provided the disease is Stage I
                       or II (with or without cervical stromal invasion or endocervical glandular
                       involvement). Eligibility for clear cell and serous histology is not based
                       on presence of lymphovascular space invasion or depth of invasion.

          6. Patients must have ECOG performance status 0 or 1.

          7. The participant (or legally acceptable representative if applicable) provides written

          6. Has received prior systemic anti-cancer therapy including investigational agents
             within 4 weeks [could consider shorter interval for kinase inhibitors or other short
             half-life drugs] prior to allocation.

          7. Has received prior radiotherapy within 2 weeks of start of study treatment.
             Participants must have recovered from all radiation-related toxicities, not require
             corticosteroids, and not have had radiation pneumonitis. A 1-week washout is permitted

         20. Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality
             that might confound the results of the study, interfere with the subject's
             participation for the full duration of the study, or is not in the best interest of
             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.

         21. Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with
