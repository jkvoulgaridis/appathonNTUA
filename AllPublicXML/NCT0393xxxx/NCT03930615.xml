  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of letermovir (LET) versus
      placebo when extended from 100 days to 200 days post-transplant in cytomegalovirus (CMV)
      seropositive participants who received an allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplant
      (HSCT). It is hypothesized that LET is superior to placebo in the prevention of
      clinically-significant CMV infection when LET prophylaxis is extended from 100 to 200 days.
