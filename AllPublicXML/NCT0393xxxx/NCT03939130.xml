  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiometabolic diseases have been associated with high consumption of sweetened beverages.
      These products are responsible for the largest portion of the total consumption of fructose
      in the diet and it is suggested that excessive intake of this monosaccharide may contribute
      to the development of risk factors for these diseases due to differences in metabolism
      relative to glucose. However, there is a lack of data in the literature demonstrating the
      deleterious effects of excessive fructose consumption on vasodilation and whether aerobic
      training may be able to prevent or mitigate these damages in humans. Therefore, the aim of
      the study will be to verify the effect of 4 weeks of high fructose diet associated with
      aerobic training on uric acid levels and its influence on markers related to oxidative stress
      and vasodilatation. Twenty-one sedentary men and women, aged between 19 and 35 years, will be
      submitted to 4 weeks of intervention. In a randomized way, subjects will be divided into 3
      groups: high fructose diet, high glucose diet and high fructose diet and exercise. Blood
      samples will be taken before, in the middle and after the intervention to verify the
      concentrations of uric acid, superoxide dismutase enzyme, thiobarbituric acid, nitrite /
      nitrate, lipid profile, glucose, insulin, C-reactive protein and endothelin-1. In addition,
      flow-mediated dilatation, insulin resistance index, pancreatic beta cell functional capacity
      index, oral glucose tolerance test, 24-hour blood pressure, heart rate variability and body
      composition will be analyzed. The comparisons will be performed through the Generalized
      Estimates of Equations, adopting the factors group and time. The Bonferroni post-hoc will be
      used to identify differences. The accepted level of significance will be 5%.
