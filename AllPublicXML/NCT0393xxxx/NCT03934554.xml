  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In 2014, the &quot;States General of Kidney&quot; have allowed to assess the situation concerning the
      management of chronic kidney disease on the national territory. Ex-Languedoc-Roussillon has
      emerged as one of the French regions with a high dialysis / transplant ratio compared to
      other regions. Disparities in accessibility to the kidney transplant list were also very
      important. In the ex-Languedoc-Roussillon Region, the number of patients on the renal
      transplant list was lower than the national average (18.9 vs. 24.1%, respectively, according
      to the REIN 2015 report).

      In 2015, the Regional Health Agency (ARS) ex-Languedoc-Roussillon, has published proposals to
      improve the healthcare of the patient in chronic end stage renal failure, and accessibility
      to the national waiting list for renal transplantation (CRISTAL).

      To increase accessibility to the national waiting list for renal transplantation by improving
      the patient's healthcare, our project is based on the creation of a reinforced exchanges
      connexion between the hospital's nephrology services professionals, dialysis units and
      liberal nephrologists. This will include having regular meetings between dialysis
      nephrologists and CHU nephrologists. The proposals for this project were:

        1. to organize multidisciplinary consultation meetings between transplant and dialysis
           professionals

        2. to set up an exchange platform and communication tools built on the model of
           telemedicine (COVOTEM), common to the nephrology departments of the University Hospital
           Center, dialysis units.

      This new device for the management of chronic end stage renal failure should increase the
      number of patients on the national renal transplantation waiting list. It should also make it
      possible to reduce the time between: firstly, the sending of the pre-registration file to the
      transplantation at Montpellier University Hospital and registration, and secondly between
      dialysis and registration.on waiting list.

      The investigators hope that this experiment will increase the number of registrations on the
      National Kidney Transplantation Waitlist (CRISTAL). The implementation of this innovative
      tool should facilitate communication between nephrologists dialysis centers and nephrologists
      of CHU Montpellier, and accelerate the process of registration on the National Kidney
      Transplantation Waitlist.

      If this platform proves to be easy to use and if the project's evaluation criteria show
      significant results, the platform could then be used to monitor patients in
      post-transplantation. Indeed, the data of patients who perform an alternating follow-up would
      be available for the referring nephrologists and for the transplant center. The further
      development of the platform would allow to create a mode of communication via this platform.

      Main Objective: Evolution of the number of patients, dialysed or not dialysed in the
      ex-Languedoc-Roussillon Region, acceding during the year, to a pre-transplant assessment for
      a registration on the national renal transplantation waiting list ( CRISTAL).

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  Evolution of patient waiting times for registration on the national renal
           transplantation waiting list (CRISTAL)

        -  For incident cases: Evolution of the time between dialysis, and the date of registration
           on the transplant waiting list or the date of decision of temporary or definitive
           contraindication by nephrologists CHU Montpellier .

        -  Evolution of the delays between the date of reception of the pre-registration file by
           the nephrology department of the University Hospital and the closing date of the file
           (either a definitive inscription, a definitive contraindication or a temporary
           contraindication &gt; 4 months)

        -  Evolution of the number of multidisciplinary consultation meetings performed without
           videoconferencing and videoconferencing between the dialysis center and Montpellier
           University Hospital

        -  Evaluation of exchanges between professionals involved in the course of care of the
           patient in chronic end stage renal failure
