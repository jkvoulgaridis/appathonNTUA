  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A confirmatory dual-clinic, non-randomized study of the Inliant device to aid in dental
      implant placement in humans. The hypothesis is that using the Inliant Surgical Navigation
      System (&quot;Inliant&quot;) will provide a high degree of accuracy in multiple dimensions relative to
      the ideal implant position as determined in the planning stage, and will not result in any
      adverse outcomes related to use of the device. Five clinicians (Investigators) of various
      clinical backgrounds and experience will use the Inliant device, a licensed, medical device
      in Canada, to place a dental implant in a total of twenty (20) subjects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The long term success of dental implant therapy is largely dependent on proper implant
      positioning in bone, and the facilitation of a well-functioning prosthesis. Surgical
      complications from implant placement in an incorrect location can include damage to adjacent
      teeth, sinus perforations, hemorrhage, buccal plate dehiscence, and nerve damage. In implant
      therapy, dynamic surgical guidance is a new technology used to facilitate accurate and
      efficient implant placement, and to aid in communication between the restorative dentist and
      surgeon.

      The Inliant device is a dynamic surgical navigation system that is based on passive optical
      tracking technology. Passive optical tracking is accomplished by having the patient wear a
      reference body that is identified by an optical tracking system. This information allows the
      clinician to visualize the surgical drill projected onto a screen, showing its position in 3
      dimensions on a CBCT scan of the patient. Dynamic surgical guidance has additional advantages
      over traditional methods in that it allows for intra-operative changes in implant planning,
      and allows the clinician to visualize the position of the surgical drill during the
      procedure.

      The purpose of the present study is to analyze the accuracy of the Inliant device as a method
      of placing dental implants in an actual clinical setting and to confirm its safety.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Provide signed and dated informed consent form (ICF)

          -  Willing to comply with all study procedures and be available for the study

          -  Male or female, 22 years of age and older

          -  In good general health as evidenced by medical history

          -  To provide attachment of the stent for each implant, there must be at least two
             adjacent zero mobility teeth anywhere in the same arch on which the surgery is to be
             performed

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  A medical condition, psychological condition or dental condition that would exclude a
             patient from having dental implant surgery. Example: inability to tolerate local
             anesthesia or other dental disease conditions that would preclude dental implant
             surgery.

          -  Use of disallowed concomitant medications (only if a contraindication to dental
             implant surgery. Examples include long term bisphosphonates, high dose blood thinners,
             etc.).

          -  Pregnancy

          -  Treatment with another investigational drug or other intervention

          -  Inability to obtain a suitable pre-operative CBCT scan

          -  In surgery, if there are clinical conditions that unexpectedly do not allow for the
             placement of an implant, e.g. lack of primary stability during immediate placement.
