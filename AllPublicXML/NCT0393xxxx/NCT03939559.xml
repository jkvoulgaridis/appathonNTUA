      The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of dual task home based exercise program
      on balance, gait and cognitive functions. The study is planned to include 60 patients with
      Parkinson's disease, whose levels are 1-3 according to the Hoehn-Yahr scale and will be
      admitted to Istanbul University Capa Medical Faculty Neurology Department Movement and
      Behavior Disorders Unit between June 2019 and February 2020. The aim of the study, duration,
      possible side effects of treatment will be given to the volunteers to participate in the
      study. The &quot;Informed Consent Form am prepared in accordance with the standards determined by
      the Clinical Research Ethics Committee of Istanbul Faculty of Medicine will be approved and
      the study will be conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.

      Patients who meet the inclusion criteria of the study will be included in the study and will
      be randomized into two groups. Both groups will be given information with brochures
      containing the importance of exercise in Parkinson's disease and will be given DVD copies
      with weekly recordings. The time and activity schedule created at the end of the brochures
      will be required to record daily home exercises of the patients. In the balance exercises
      group; static, dynamic and functional balance exercise packages will be taught in Parkinson
      's disease. In the dual task based balance exercises group; motor or cognitive dual task
      training will be combined these static dynamic and functional balance exercises. In both
      groups, exercises will be performed 3 days a week for 8 weeks.

      the study will be conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.

      Patients who meet the inclusion criteria of the study will be included in the study and will
      be randomized into two groups. Both groups will be given information with brochures
      containing the importance of exercise in Parkinson's disease and DVD copies where the
      exercises are recorded weekly. The time and activity schedule created at the end of the
      brochures, daily recording of home exercises of the patients will be requested. Home exercise
      training and assessments will be provided by different physiotherapists. The evaluator
      physiotherapist will be blind to the treatment group to which the patient belongs. In the
      balance exercises group; 4 exercise packages which include static, dynamic and functional
      balance exercises will be taught in the first part of exercise period for 4 weeks. After the
      four weeks, the exercises should be progressed in the last 4 weeks in the second training
      session. In the dual task based balance exercises group; 4 exercise packages which include
      static, dynamic and functional balance exercises with cognitive or motor dual task will be
      taught in the first part of exercise period for 4 weeks. After the four weeks, the exercises
      should be progressed in the last 4 weeks in the second training session.

      The number of subjects to be taken for each group in the 95% confidence interval was
      considered to be 26, considering the minimal clinical significant change (Minimal Clinically
      Important Difference, MCID) 3.5 for the Timed Up and Go Test. Considering that the patients
      did not continue treatment, it was decided to take 30 patients to each group and to carry out
      the study with a total of 60 patients. The primary outcomes are Mini Best Test,Timed Get Up
      and Go Test. Also objective datas will be obtained from Biodex Balance System, Wii Balance
      Board and G Walk Sensory Walking System.The secondary outcome measures include activity
      balance confidence scale, Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire-39 and cognitive tests such as
      number range test, verbal memory processes test, mental flexibility and word fluency test.

    <measure>Activity Balance Confidence Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Activity-Specific Balance Confidence Scale will be used to measure patient's balance confidence. The ABC questionnaire, which is answered by an individual's self-perception of 16 items, measures the perceived ability of an individual on a 0-100 scale to achieve equilibrium under different conditions. This item is used to lead into each activity considered: &quot;how confident are you that you will not lose your balance or become unsteady when you...&quot;. Each item is rated on a rating scale that ranges from 0-100. The highest score shows full confidence in the balance abilities. Overall score is calculated by adding item scores and then dividing by the total number of items.</description>

    <measure>Parkinson Disease Questionnaire- 39</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>PDQ-39 is a self-report survey using the 5-point Likert scale to assess quality of life in Parkinson Disease. 39 multiple choice items covering 8 dimensions such as: mobility, activity of daily living (ADL), Emotional well-being, Stigma, Social Support, Cognition,Communication, Bodily Discomfort. All items are accepted to impact quality of life and must be answered to compute scores for each dimension. The responded items based on the experiences from the preceding month and 5 point ordinal scoring system (0:never, 1:occasionally, 2:sometimes, 3:often,4:always). Dimension scores are computed by the sum of scores of each item in the related dimension divided by the maximum possible score of all the items in the dimension, multiplied by 100. Each dimension total score range from 0(never difficulty) to 100(always difficulty) and. Highest scores reflect worse quality of life. Overall score is the sum of dimension total scores divided by 8.</description>

    <measure>Number Range Test</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Number Range Test consists of two parts. The first part is the forward number range, the second part is the reverse number range. The two parts are applied separately. In both sections, the numbers are one by one. First, the advanced number range is applied. Then, the countdown range is applied. The numbers are read to the subject so that a number is read per second. In both the forward and backward range, the subject is passed to the next attempt at any successful attempt. If both attempts fail, the test is not continued. Creates a range of digits of the last repeatable sequence</description>
