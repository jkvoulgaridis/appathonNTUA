      Caretaker vs. Blood Pressure Monitoring With Invasive Arterial Pressure Monitoring in
      Patients With Septic Shock

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to compare blood pressure obtained using routine blood pressure
      sphygmomanometer, in patients with invasive arterial pressure monitoring that have septic
      shock, to a non-invasive device that continuously monitors central blood pressure
      (CareTaker).

    <measure>Comparing blood pressure measurements by the Caretaker device to blood pressure measurements made with an intra-arterial pressure catheter.</measure>
    <time_frame>20 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome measure will be the average difference in systolic and diastolic blood pressure measurements between the investigational device (Caretaker) and the reference (intra-arterial catheter pressure) in subjects that have septic shock. In line with blood pressure validation guidelines, we will obtain multiple investigational-reference measurement pairs in each subject (20 minutes total) and will average the difference over all pairs from all subjects.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Comparing blood pressure measurements by the Caretaker device to blood pressure measurements made with an upper arm cuff.</measure>
    <time_frame>20 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Secondary outcome measure will be the average difference in systolic and diastolic blood pressure measurements between the investigational device (Caretaker) and a brachial cuff in subjects that have septic shock. In line with blood pressure validation guidelines, we will obtain multiple investigational-reference measurement pairs in each subject (4 pairs over 20 minutes) and will average the difference over all pairs from all subjects.</description>
