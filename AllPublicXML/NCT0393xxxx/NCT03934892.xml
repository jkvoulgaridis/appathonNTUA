  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tissue hypoperfusion during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) affects cardiac surgical outcomes.
      Lactate, an end product of anaerobic glycolysis from oxygen deficit, is an obtainable marker
      of tissue hypoxia. The investigators aimed to determine the value of blood lactate level
      during CPB in adult cardiac surgeries in predicting outcomes.

      The investigators retrospectively reviewed the patients underwent cardiac surgeries with CPB
      from January 2015 to December 2015. The patient's characteristics, pre-operative status,
      surgical type, and intra-operative lactate levels were collected. The outcomes were
      in-hospital mortality and complications. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves were
      used to assess the ability of peak lactate level during CPB to predict in-hospital mortality.

      The baseline characteristics, including age, gender, body mass index (BMI), comorbidities,
      left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF, %), European system for cardiac operative risk
      evaluation II (EuroSCORE II), pre-operative hematocrit, and serum creatinine levels were
      recorded. The surgical type was classified as coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), valve
      surgery, combined surgery including CABG and valve surgery, great vessel surgery including
      aortic dissection, and other surgeries. The priority of surgery was classified as elective,
      urgent, and emergent. The intra-operative variables included CPB time, aortic cross-clamp
      time, initial lactate level at the beginning of the operation, and the peak lactate level
      during CPB.
