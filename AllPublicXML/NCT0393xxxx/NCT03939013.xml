      Implementation-effectiveness hybrid trial assessing acceptability, feasibility and
      cost-effectiveness of community-based point-of-care testing and treatment for hepatitis C.
      Utilises Cepheid GeneXpert HCV VL device as diagnostic tool (diagnosis of chronic infection
      and assessment of treatment outcome) and sofosbuvir/daclatasvir for HCV therapy (local
      standard of care).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Historically, testing and treatment for hepatitis C has been confined to centralised
      laboratories and tertiary hospitals respectively. Recent advancements in point-of-care
      testing for hepatitis C (anti-HCV antibody and HCV RNA/VL) and treatment options with the
      introduction of direct acting antivirals allows for testing and treatment to occur in
      de-centralised primary care settings.

      This study is an effectiveness-implementation hybrid study to assess the feasibility,
      acceptability, effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a de-centralised approach to hepatitis
      C testing and treatment at community-based clinics in Yangon, Myanmar. Generalist doctors
      trained in hepatitis C treatment will prescribe direct acting antiviral therapy to eligible
      participants.

      The study will utilise SD Bioline HCV RDT and Cepheid GeneXpert HCV VL test; and
      sofosbuvir/daclatasvir to treat hepatitis C. Test of cure will be performed at 12 weeks
      post-treatment completion to assess sustained virological response (SVR).

      Study inclusion criteria prior to recruitment into study:

        -  Aged ≥18 years

        -  Attendance at study site

        -  Willing and able to provide written informed consent

      Study exclusion criteria prior to recruitment into study:

        -  Confirmed HCV RNA positive result (chronic HCV infection) prior to study recruitment

        -  Treatment experienced (either DAA or pegylated interferon)

        -  Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infected

        -  Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infected

        -  estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) &lt;30

        -  Active tuberculosis (if known active tuberculosis or as per symptom screening
           assessment)

        -  Pregnant women

        -  Serious drug-drug interaction with sofosbuvir/daclatasvir of a drug that the patient is
           unwilling or unable to stop taking
