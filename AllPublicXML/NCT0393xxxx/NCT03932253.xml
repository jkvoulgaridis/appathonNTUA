  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Melanoma is one of the most common cutaneous cancers worldwide. Activating mutations in RAS
      oncogenes are found in a third of all human cancers and NRAS mutations are found in 15%-20%
      of melanomas. Acquisition of a functional mutation in NRAS results in activation of the Ras /
      Raf / MEK / ERK signaling pathway leading to unconstrained cell growth and cell
      transformation. NRAS mutation status was identified as an independent poor prognostic factor
      in stage IV melanoma. No drug was approved to treat melanoma patients with NRAS mutation or
      amplification until now. FCN-159, an oral and potent MEK1/2 inhibitor, has more than 10 folds
      higher selectivity against activated MEK1 and MEK2 compared with trametinib, and has
      demonstrated significant antitumor growth inhibition in two patient-derived xenograft (PDX)
      models with NRAS mutation.This is the first in human study to evaluate the safety and
      anti-tumor activity in patients.

      This is a phase Ia/Ib, open label, dose-escalation and dose-expansion study that will
      evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), and preliminary anti-tumor activity of FCN-159 in
      up to 37 patients with NRAS-aberrant including both NRAS amplification and mutation (Ia) and
      NRAS-mutation only (Ib) in local advanced or metastatic melanoma. In this study, the dose
      escalation phase utilizes 3+3, accelerated titration design with starting dose of 0.2 mg, QD,
      orally, and the dose will be escalated up to Maximum-Tolerated Dose (MTD) or until the
      Recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) is identified. The dose level will be considered to expand up
      to 6 patients if the objective response is observed, intends to collect more clinical data to
      support the RP2D determination. Once the MTD or RP2D dose is identified, an expansion cohort
      will be followed to further evaluate the safety and efficacy of FCN-159 in patients with
      NRAS-mutation melanoma.
