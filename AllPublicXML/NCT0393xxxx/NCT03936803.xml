    <textblock>
      fifty patients suffering from Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) will be recruited in
      this study with age ranged from 30-55 years old from both sexes, chosen from internal
      medicine department at Kasr El Aini hospital and from the outpatient clinic of nutrition and
      cardiovascular disorders at the faculty of Physical Therapy Cairo University, they were
      divided in to two groups:Group (1):

      Twenty-five patients suffering from Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and taking
      their standard medications In addition to electroacupuncture at points of LR3 (Taichong),
      LR14 (Qimen), GB 34(Yanglingquan) and ST36 (Zu San Li). Group (2):

      Twenty-five patients suffering from Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease(NAFLD) and taking their
      standard medications in addition to aerobic interval training exercise.Lab investigations of:

      Aspartate aminotransferase (AST), Alanine aminotransferase (ALT), Triglycerides (TG) and
      C-reactive protein (CRP).to judge liver functions

Aerobic interval training consisted of ( 8 )minutes warm-up, followed by 4 times of 4-minute intervals with heart rate (HR) at 85% of sub maximum HR, with active pauses of 3 minutes of walking at 60% of sub maximum heart rate HR. The exercise session was terminated by 5 minutes cool-down</description>
