  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the performance of the Quantra System comprised of the Quantra
      Hemostasis Analyzer with the QPlus Cartridge in patients taking anitplatelet medication that
      are scheduled to undergo cardiac surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Quantra System is a fully integrated and automated in vitro diagnostic device which uses
      SEER Sonorheometry, an ultrasound-based technology, to characterize the viscoelastic
      properties of a whole blood sample during coagulation. The Quantra QPlus Cartridge was
      developed to monitor hemostasis during major surgical procedures in adult patients. The
      cartridge consists of four independent channels each containing different sets of reagents,
      which provide four measurements performed in parallel yielding six parameters that depict the
      functional status of a patient's coagulation system.

      This single-site, prospective, observational study will evaluate the performance of the
      Quantra System as compared to standard coagulation tests and comparable measures determined
      using TEG in patients taking antiplatelet medication that are scheduled to undergo cardiac
      surgery.
