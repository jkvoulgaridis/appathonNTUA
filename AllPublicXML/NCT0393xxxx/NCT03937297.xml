    <textblock>
      This is a mixed-methods research that includes a single-blind three-arms randomized control
      trials and a focus group study. The quantitative study aims to investigate the additional
      clinical benefits of the Six Arts intervention over an evidence-based non-pharmacological
      intervention translated from western culture, cognitive stimulation therapy (CST). The
      qualitative part aims to explore the acceptance and understanding of family caregiver of the
      Six Arts intervention and CST.

      It is hypothesized that 1) the group who have received Six Arts intervention would show
      superior quality of life; 2) both Six Arts and CST groups would show superior cognitive
      improvement compared with usual care; 3) the Six Arts group would show greater improvement in
      behavioral and neuropsychological symptoms and functioning compared with the groups receiving
      CST or usual care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dementia is a disabling chronic condition affecting over 47 million people worldwide. Chinese
      population will be one of the main driver in the increasing trend in dementia prevalence.
      Accumulating evidence suggests effectiveness of certain non-drug interventions in maintaining
      cognition and quality of life in people with mild-to-moderate dementia, such as cognitive
      stimulation therapy (CST). These interventions are designed and tested in western populations
      with issues of cultural adaptation when applied in Chinese. Culturally appropriate and
      effective interventions for Chinese people with mild-to-moderate dementia are lacking.

      The Six Arts stem from ancient Confucian philosophy, which promotes behaviours that can
      impact on multiple mind-body functional domains. These domains correspond to social,
      physical, and cognitive activities with theoretical basis and empirical evidence of benefits
      in cognition, functioning, and quality of life. Using the Six Arts as a cultural framework, a
      group-based multimodal intervention has been developed in Hong Kong for Chinese people with
      mild-to-moderate dementia.

      The study will recruit 240 people with mild-to-moderate dementia in a randomized single-blind
      controlled trial consisting of three groups: (1) Six Arts intervention; (2) CST; and (3)
      usual care. Neuropsychological and clinical assessments will be conducted at randomization
      (T0/baseline) and upon completion of the 24-session, twice-weekly intervention (T1/3 months),
      by an assessor unaware of group membership. Focus groups will be conducted after completion
      of the intervention in 60 family caregivers who have observed at least one session of the Six
      Arts intervention or CST.

      This study will provide evidence on the effectiveness of two intervention protocols with
      potentials for large-scale implementation in the growing Chinese population with dementia.

    <description>The Six Arts intervention is a 24 session, twice a week intervention protocol. There will be four sessions per &quot;Art&quot;, with specific sequence designed to enhance group dynamic and create harmony. Each session starts with a 15 minutes warm-up exercise, followed by the Six Art theme activity. The program design emphasizes on integrated cognitive, physical, and social activities covering all domains of Six Arts.</description>
