  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be selected after studying clinical records.Patients who had general anesthesia
      due to an injury related to severe trauma within 6 to 12 months prior to inclusion will be
      included.

      Three self-survey will be completed by the patient: PDEQ, PCL-5 and a demographic
      questionnaire. According to the PDEQ and PCL-5 scores, an association between a
      peri-traumatic dissociation state and a post-traumatic stress disorder can be established.

    <measure>Studying association between the presence of peri-traumatic dissociation state and the achievement of post-traumatic stress disorder between 6 and 12 months in traumatized patients</measure>
    <time_frame>study baseline (6 to 12 months after initial hospitalisation)</time_frame>
    <description>Association will be measured using PDEQ scale and PCL-5 scale. The peri-traumatic dissociation will be evaluated by the Peri-traumatique Dissociation Experience Questionnary (PDEQ scale). This questionnaire contains ten items to study the presence or not of a peri-traumatic dissociation state. The items are scored on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (not at all true) to 5 (extremely true). The total score is the sum of all the items. A score from 15 indicates a significant dissociation.
The presence or not of a Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) will be evaluated by the Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist Scale-Version DSM 5 (PCL-5). This questionnaire contains twenty items to study the presence or not of a PTSD. A total score for symptom severity (0-80) can be obtained by summing the scores for each of the 20 items. A score over 31 indicates a PTSD.</description>
