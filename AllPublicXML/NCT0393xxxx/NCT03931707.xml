      The project will carry out the genetic testing of 100000 neonates in the next 5 years. The
      aim of the project is to construct the Chinese neonatal genome database, establish the
      genetic testing standard of neonatal genetic diseases, and promote the industrialization of
      neonatal genetic disease gene testing, improve the training system for genetic counseling.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are about 900,000 new cases of birth defects in China every year. There are a large
      number of hereditary diseases, such as primary immune deficiency diseases, genetic metabolic
      diseases and multiple malformation syndrome, etc. It is important to identify and diagnose
      these diseases early in life, which can optimize the treatment strategy, improve the quality
      of life, and achieve the purpose of accurate treatment. To improve the level of diagnosis and
      prevention of genetic diseases in children is conducive to the birth and education of newborn
      in our country. The China Neonatal Genome Project is an important part of the China Human
      single Target Genome Project. The investigators plan to complete genetic testing of 100,000
      newborns within 5 years, establish genetic testing standards for genetic diseases of
      newborns, and promote precise intervention for birth defects. The Genetic Counseling Branch
      of China Genetics Society, the Pediatrics Hospital affiliated to Fudan University and
      hundreds of hospitals in China jointly launched the Chinese newborn Genome Project in
      Shanghai, China. The project will carry out the genetic testing of 100000 neonates in the
      next 5 years. The study physician and genetic counselor will provide the consultation to
      families utilizing all available medical information. In the sequencing analysis of the
      study, this will include the medical history, physical exam, family history, standard newborn
      screening report. The aim of the project is to construct the Chinese neonatal genome
      database, establish the genetic testing standard of neonatal genetic diseases, and promote
      the industrialization of neonatal genetic disease gene testing, improve the training system
      for genetic counseling.
