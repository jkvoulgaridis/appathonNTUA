  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the role of genetic testing to look for possible
      infection as a cause for failure of non-healing fractures. The study aims to compare the
      results of genetic testing known as NGS to standardized clinical laboratory tests for
      diagnosing infections to see if NGS may be a better diagnostic tool.

        Investigational group:

        Inclusion:

          1. Patients undergoing open biopsy / surgical intervention for nonunion following a
             traumatic (open or closed) long bone fracture (femur shaft, tibia, humerus) which was
             initially treated operatively.Inclusion Criteria:

          2. Nonunions will be defined as a failure to progress towards expected union within an
             anticipated timeframe, and this judgment will be made by the attending caring for each
             patient. No specific timeframe or arbitrary cut points will be defined to allow for
             the considerable variation in fracture healing and different anatomical sites.

          3. Presumed Septic and Aseptic nonunions

          4. &gt;18 years old and able to provide informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Exclusion:

          1. Pathological fractures at index injury

          2. Patients on antibiotic therapy &lt;2 weeks prior to surgery

        INCLUSION/ EXCLUSION CRITERIA FOR CONTROL GROUP:

        Inclusion:

          1. Patients undergoing surgical intervention for nonunion following a traumatic closed
             long bone fractures (femur shaft, tibia, humerus)

          2. &gt;18 years old and able to provide informed consent

        Exclusion:
