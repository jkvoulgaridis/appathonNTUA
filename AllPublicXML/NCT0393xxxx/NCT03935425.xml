  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will investigate the efficacy of a newly developed functional exercise
      device (FitMi Plus) for people in the chronic stage after a stroke compared to the FitMi
      Basic (i.e. without functional exercises). FitMi Plus combines objects commonly used during
      activities of daily living with sensors that can track and record the patient's direction and
      degree of movement as they perform specific functional tasks described on a computer.

    <measure>Change in Motor Activity Log</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Immediately Post-Treatment, One-Month Post-Treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>A self-reported measure of the quality of movement and amount of use of the impaired upper extremity across a set of activities of daily living.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Upper Extremity Fugl-Meyer</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Immediately Post-Treatment, One-Month Post-Treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>A standardized assessment of arm impairment based on scores of 0-2 on 33 different tasks.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Action Research Arm Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Immediately Post-Treatment, One-Month Post-Treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>A 19 item measure divided into 4 sub-tests (grasp, grip, pinch, and gross arm movement).
Performance on each item is rated on a 4-point ordinal scale ranging from:
3) Performs test normally 2) Completes test, but takes abnormally long or has great difficulty
1) Performs test partially 0) Can perform no part of test</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Modified Ashworth Spasticity Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Immediately Post-Treatment, One-Month Post-Treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Tests resistance to passive movement about a joint with varying degrees of velocity. Scores range from 0-4, with 6 choices.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Visual Analog Pain Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Immediately Post-Treatment, One-Month Post-Treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>The Visual Analog Pain Scale is a unidimensional measure of pain intensity, which has been widely used in diverse adult populations. The scale ranges from 0) &quot;no pain&quot; to 10) &quot;worst possible, unbearable pain&quot;</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Wearable Activity Tracking</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, One-Month Post-Treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>Participants wear a custom-designed wrist-mounted actigrapher (the Manumeter, which uses wrist-worn magnetometers and a magnet worn on the finger to monitor functional use of the upper extremity activity) for a 24 hour period to assess changes in functional activity levels.</description>
