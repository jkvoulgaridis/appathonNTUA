  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Hamburg City Health Study (HCHS) is a large, prospective, long-term, population-based
      cohort study and a unique research platform and network to obtain substantial knowledge about
      several risk and prognostic factors in major chronic diseases.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A random sample of 45.000 participants between 45 and 74 years of age from the general
      population of Hamburg, Germany, will take part in an extensive baseline assessment at a
      dedicated study center. Participants undergo 13 validated and 5 novel examinations primarily
      targeting cardiac, arterio-venous and cerebral function and structure including extensive
      imaging examinations. The protocol includes self-ratings of life style and environmental
      conditions, , dietary habits, physical activity, professional life, psychosocial context, ,
      digital media use, medical and family history as well as health care utilization patterns.
      The assessment is completed by genomic and proteomic characterization. Beyond the
      identification of classical risk factors for major chronic diseases and survivorship, the
      core intention is to develop complex models predicting health outcomes based on a multitude
      of examination data, imaging data and behavioral assessments. Participants at risk for
      coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, heart failure, stroke and dementia will be
      invited for a visit to conduct additional MRI examination either of heart or brain. Endpoint
      assessment of the overall sample will be completed through repeated follow-up examinations
      and data from involved health and pension insurances.
