      Objective: Defective placentation and inadequate trophoblastic invasion have an important
      place in the aetiology of preeclampsia (PrE). Trophoblasts invade the maternal decidua and
      remodel spiral arteries with matrix metalloproteinase-14 (MMP-14). To the best of our
      knowledge, studies of MMP-14 protein levels of PrE patients' sera remain unpublished. This
      study aims to investigate the value of serum MMP-14 and soluble endoglin (s-ENG) in PrE
      patients and healthy controls.

      Methods: The study was conducted with 30 late-onset preeclampsia patients (L-PrE) as group1
      (gestational age≥34 weeks), 33 patients with normal pregnancies as group2 (gestational age≥34
      weeks), 31 early-onset preeclampsia patients (E-PrE) as group3 (gestational age&lt;34 weeks),
      and 31 patients with normal pregnancies as group 4 (gestational age&lt;34 weeks). Serum MMP-14
      and s-ENG levels measured by ELISA were compared.

      The study was conducted at Cengiz Gokcek Women's and Children's Hospital, Gaziantep, Turkey
      at department of obstetrics and gynecology between date of January 2018 and December 2018.
      The study protocol was designed according to the Declaration of Helsinki, and the
      institutional ethical review board of Gaziantep University approved the study (Reference
      number: 2018/91). One hundred twenty-five women enrolled in the study in four groups. The
      investigators consecutively recruited 61 pregnancies complicated with preeclampsia, and 64
      healthy pregnancies will select for the control group. All participiants gave their oral and
      written informed consent before their inclusion in the study.

        The investigators consecutively will recruite 61 subjects with preeclampsia, and 64 healthy
        preganancies will selecte for the control group.

        Preeclampsia is a pregnancy complication characterized by high blood pressure and signs of
        damage to another organ system, most often the liver and kidneys. Preeclampsia usually
        begins after 20 weeks of pregnancy in women whose blood pressure had been normal.
        Early-onset preeclampsia is usually defined as preeclampsia that develops before 34 weeks
        of gestation, whereas late-onset preeclampsia develops at or after 34 weeks of gestation.
