    <textblock>
      This study is a phase II, multi-centre, open label study in patients with advanced ovarian
      cancer. The treatment being tested is Pamiparib, with daily dosing.

      All patients enrolled to the study will receive treatment with pamiparib. Patients will be
      selected for entry into the study based on the molecular signature of their cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ovarian cancer is the deadliest gynaecologic cancer in Western women. Although initially
      responsive to therapy, drug resistance commonly evolves.

      Novel mechanisms of drug resistance in ovarian cancer have been identified and include
      genetic mutations that result in the activation of a drug efflux pump and secondary mutations
      in BRCA1/2 genes that restore the cancer cell's ability to repair treatment related DNA
      damage. It is hypothesized that patients with BRCA1/2 mutant high grade serous ovarian cancer
      or carcinosarcoma who have progressed on recent therapy and have an activated efflux pump
      without a secondary BRCA1/1 mutation will be selectively sensitive to a new drug, Pamiparib,
      which does not get effluxed out of cancer cells.

      The primary objective of this trial is to assess the clinical benefit rate at &gt; 4 months in 2
      cohorts of patients (cohort 1: post substrate-PARP inhibitor and cohort 2: post chemotherapy)
      defined as response or absence of progression. Secondary objectives are to determine the
      median progression free and overall survival of patients treated with Pamiparib and the
      impact on symptom burden and benefit.

    <description>Using the Measure of Ovarian Cancer Symptoms and Treatment Concerns (MOST) v2 patient reported outcome measure (PROM)
The scale measures disease or therapy related symptoms and symptom burden and well-being
Scale ranges: Subscales are reported in five different categories with the subscale score ranges below
Abdominal symptoms, higher values reflecting worst possible symptoms
Disease or treatment-related symptoms, higher values reflecting worst possible symptoms
Chemotherapy-related symptoms, higher values reflecting worst possible symptoms
Psychological symptoms, higher values reflecting worst possible symptoms
Well-being, higher values reflecting best possible symptoms
Each of the 5 subscales can be scored and analysed separately (item by item) or by taking the average of the component items.</description>

    <measure>Patient reported results of the 40 item State-trait anxiety inventory for adults (STAI-ADTM)</measure>
    <time_frame>This will be assessed 3 times - at the time of pre-screening consent, immediately prior to clinician consult with notification of pre-screening results, and immediately following notification of pre-screening results.</time_frame>
    <description>The scale measures state level anxiety (S-Anxiety or current levels) and trait anxiety levels (T-anxiety or how someone generally feels)
Scale ranges: STA Form Y-1 includes 20 items/questions, with a total score range of 20-80, and STA Form Y-2 includes 20 items/questions, with a total score range of 20-80. Each scored item/question is then given a weighted score of 1 to 4 with a rating of 4 indicative of a high level of anxiety for 10 x S-Anxiety items and 11 x T-Anxiety items. A high rating indicates the absences of anxiety for the remaining 10 S-Anxiety items and 9 T-Anxiety items. The scoring weights for the anxiety-present items are the same as the chosen numbers on the form and the scoring weight for the anxiety-absent items are reversed.
For each form separately, weighted scores are then totalled and averaged. Groups of respondents will be identified (including most anxious, least anxious, and middle) based on top, bottom, and middle percentiles.</description>
