  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      African American (AA) women are more vulnerable to HIV infection than other women. Truvada,
      when used as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), is one of the most effective approaches for HIV
      prevention; however, PrEP use among AA women remains low and has not responded to traditional
      interventions. This study proposes for the first time an innovative computer-based
      motivational intervention, increasing PrEP uptake (iPrEP), which couples motivational
      messages woven into a traditional survey to raise awareness of risky sex and substance use
      behaviors.

    <description>iPrEP Intervention:
Women will receive the iPrEP intervention on an iPAD Air tablet device
iPrEP serves a dual role as a data collection instrument and an intervention--the survey incorporates brief, informational messages into a traditional survey instrument
iPrEP uses qualitative themes
iPrEP is divided into sections addressing factors with historical success at predicting pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) adherence
Scales chosen to measure themes and sections were retained from the original HIV Prevention Trials Network (HPTN) 073 instrument
Scales were modified (in some cases) for cultural competency and tailoring to women</description>
