  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bladder cancer is the most common urinary tract cancer, affecting men and women, and is the
      5th most common cancer in the US (1). Yet bladder cancer research is underfunded relative to
      other common cancers. As a result, bladder cancer care is prone to evidence gaps that produce
      decision uncertainty for both patients and clinicians. The Comparison of Intravesical Therapy
      and Surgery as Treatment Options (CISTO) for Bladder Cancer Study has the potential to fill
      these critical evidence gaps, change care pathways for the management of NMIBC
      (non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer), and provide for personalized, patient-centered care.
      The purpose of CISTO is to conduct a large prospective study that directly compares the
      impact of medical management versus bladder removal in recurrent high-grade NMIBC patients
      with BCG (Bacillus Calmette-Guerin) failure on clinical outcomes and patient and caregiver
      experience using standardized patient-reported outcomes (PROs).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Most bladder cancer patients (74%) present with NMIBC where the cancer is limited to the
      lining or support layer of the bladder. High-grade NMIBC is treated initially with endoscopic
      resection and intravesical immunotherapy, followed by bladder instillations of BCG. Most
      patients with high-risk, high-grade NMIBC are able to retain their bladders and avoid more
      invasive treatments. However, 24-61% of patients will have their cancers recur within 12
      months of treatment with BCG (BCG failures), and they have limited treatment options.
      National guidelines recommend consideration between two alternatives: additional medical
      management and radical cystectomy (removal of the bladder). Selecting between these options
      involves weighing the risk of progression of bladder cancer and loss of a window of potential
      cure versus the risk of morbidity and loss of quality of life (QOL) with bladder removal.
      This complex decision-making engages patients and their caregivers, who may be impacted by
      the urinary, sexual, and bowel dysfunctions that can occur with NMIBC treatment.

      The investigators will evaluate this research question on a large scale in real world
      practice settings including academic and community-based practices and examine
      patient-centered outcomes. The investigators have engaged stakeholders with diverse
      perspectives relevant to this research question, including patients, caregivers, national
      patient advocacy organizations, national medical specialty organizations, guideline
      developers, health care payers, and industry. By engaging broad expertise relevant to this
      research question, the investigators will ensure that the study results will help NMIBC
      patients whose cancer recurs after BCG treatment make more informed decisions that improve
      the health outcomes that are important to them.

      CISTO is an observational study that will not affect the treatment that patients chose.
      Patient surveys will occur at study entry and at follow-up assessments for up to four years.
      Caregiver surveys will occur at study entry and at the 12-month follow-up assessment. There
      will also be a qualitative sub-study that will include interviews of approximately 50
      patients and 25 caregivers recruited from the observational cohort study.

    <measure>Patient-reported quality of life as measured by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality-of-Life-Questionnaire-Core-30 (EORTC QLQ-C30)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months after completion of the patient baseline assessment</time_frame>
    <description>The primary evaluation of patient-reported quality of life, as measured by the EORTC QLQ-C30 at 12 months, will be conducted using targeted maximum likelihood estimation (TMLE) analysis. All of the subscales and single-item measures range in score from 0 to 100 and a high scale score represents a higher response level (ranging from 0 = low to 100 = high/healthy level of function; from 0 = low to 100 = high quality-of-life; from 0 = low to 100 = high level of symptomatology/problems). Subscale and global health status scores are each calculated by transforming individual item scores into a 0 to 1 scale, taking the mean, and multiplying by 100. Each subscale requires responses for at least 50% of the items in that subscale in order to be calculated.</description>

    <measure>Patient self-reported urinary function as measured by the Bladder Cancer Index</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months after completion of the patient baseline assessment and up to 48 months</time_frame>
    <description>The evaluation of the effect of treatment choice on patient-reported urinary function, as measured by the Bladder Cancer Index (BCI) at 12 months, will be conducted using TMLE analysis. The evaluation of the effect of treatment choice on the trajectory of urinary function at up to 48 months as measured by the BCI will be conducted using both mixed effects and GEE longitudinal models. The BCI consists of 36 items, with 4- or 5-point Likert response scales, covering 3 primary domains: urinary, bowel, and sexual. For each domain a summary score and two subscale scores (function and bother) are constructed. Scores are calculated by transforming item responses into a 0 to 100 scale and calculating the mean of the standardized items. Higher scores indicate better health status. To calculate a score, a minimum of 80% completed items is required.</description>

    <time_frame>12 months after completion of the patient baseline assessment and up to 48 months</time_frame>
    <description>Patient-reported decisional regret will be measured using three items with 5-point Likert response scales which have been validated in a previous study of prostate cancer patients. These three items will be summed to yield a score from 0 to 12, with higher scores indicating greater regret. The evaluation of the effect of treatment choice on patient-reported decisional regret at 12 months will be conducted using TMLE analysis. The evaluation of the effect of treatment choice on patient-reported decisional regret at up to 48 months will be conducted using both mixed effects and GEE longitudinal models.</description>

    <measure>Patient self-reported financial distress as measured by the Comprehensive Score for Financial Toxicity (COST)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months after completion of the patient baseline assessment and up to 48 months</time_frame>
    <description>The evaluation of the effect of treatment choice on patient-reported financial distress, as measured by COST at 12-months, will be conducted using TMLE analysis. The evaluation of the effect of treatment choice on the trajectory of patient financial distress at up to 48 months will be conducted using both mixed effects and GEE longitudinal models. The COST questionnaire consists of 11 items, each scored on a 5-point Likert scale from zero to four. After reversing some items as indicated in the scoring manual (by reversing the sign on the original zero to four score and adding four), all item response scores are summed into a single financial toxicity score ranging from 0 to 44, with higher scores indicating greater financial toxicity. Each subscale requires responses for at least 50% of the items in that subscale in order to be calculated. Item nonresponse is accounted for by substituting the mean of the completed items in the subscale.</description>

        Patients with a diagnosis of recurrent high-grade NMIBC that failed first-line BCG and who
        are considering second-line treatment will be approached for participation in this
        observational study in addition to their caregivers. Enrollment at each site will aim for a
        2:1 ratio of participants selecting medical management to radical cystectomy in order to
        ensure adequate enrollment of radical cystectomy patients. The goal is to have 300
        recurrent high-grade NMIBC patients enrolled in the radical cystectomy arm. There will also
        be a qualitative sub-study that will include interviews of 50 patients and 25 caregivers
        recruited from the observational cohort study.
