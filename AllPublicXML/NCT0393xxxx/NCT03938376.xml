  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Micro-ultrasound is a novel real-time imaging modality which maintains the clinical workflow
      of conventional ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy, while potentially maintaining a similar
      ability to detect clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa) to MRI. This prospective
      trial aims to compare micro-ultrasound to mpMRI in detection of csPCa in the biopsy naïve.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Evidence from a large randomized clinical trial (clinical trials.gov ID NCT02079025),
      suggests that micro-ultrasound system is more sensitive than conventional
      transrectal-ultrasound (TRUS) to detect prostate cancer (PCa). the PRI-MUS (prostate risk
      identification using micro-ultrasound) scoring system was developed and validated to assess
      the risk of prostate cancer for targeted biopsy with the micro-ultrasound platform, similar
      to the PIRADS scoring system for suspicious areas on mpMRI. This project will compare
      micro-ultrasound imaging modality to the current gold-standard imaging for prostate cancer,
      mpMRI. By applying both modalities to the same patients, the investigators will provide a
      direct comparison of their screening abilities in terms of sensitivity, specificity, negative
      predictive value and positive predictive value. It will build evidence to demonstrate that
      micro-ultrasound may replace MRI/Fusion biopsy in these patients.This project aims to
      demonstrate that the micro-ultrasound 1) provides more sensitive initial biopsy, reducing the
      need for repeated procedures, thus lowering the rate of severe sepsis and the number of
      cancers found after local or regional progression, and 2) reduces the need for mpMRI
      following initial biopsy.

        Patients who are referred to confirm negative or positive for diagnosis of prostate cancer
        based on SOC biopsy, with superior resolution imaging devices. Referral may be indicated in
        the setting of increased PSA, abnormal DRE and/or abnormality of other serum or urinary
        tests specific for prostate cancer, for example PHI (Prostate Health Index) and PCA3. The
        current golden standard imaging for prostate cancer is mpMRI.
