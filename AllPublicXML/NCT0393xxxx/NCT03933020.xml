  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to to determine how implementing a home-based virtual reality
      video (VR) game exercise program in young people with Multiple Sclerosis(MS) can improve
      disability outcomes by measuring its impact on cognitive assessments (BICAMS), subjective
      measures of cognitive, physical and psychosocial disability, and motor assessments (6MWT).
