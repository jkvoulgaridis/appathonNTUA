    <textblock>
      This work aimed to examine the effects of drinking an &quot;energy drink&quot; upon (i) short-term
      maximal performance, (ii) reaction times and (iii) psychological factors (i.e., mood state,
      ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) and affective load) and on physiological parameters such
      as blood pressure, blood glucose, hematological parameters and other biochemical parameters.

      A total of 22 healthy and regularly active physical-education male students from various
      sports disciplines volunteered to participate in this study. Potential participants were
      initially screened through telephone interviews based on the inclusion criteria: 18-40 years
      of age, BMI less than 25 kg/m2, and low (&lt;1.5g/month ) and not regular caffeine users.
      Exclusion criteria included diagnosis of any chronic metabolic disease such as type 2
      diabetes or cardiovascular disease, an auto-immune disease such as rheumatoid arthritis,
      lupus or type 1 diabetes, liver disease and the intake of any medications/ or dietary
      supplements known to influence blood glucose concentrations and/or blood pressures.

      The study was conducted according to the declaration of Helsinki and the protocol was fully
      approved (identification code: 8/16) by the review board &quot;Local committee of the Laboratory
      of Biochemistry, CHU Habib Bourguiba, Sfax, Tunisia.&quot; After a throughout explanation of the
      protocol and responses to all questions, participants signed a written informed consent.

      Subjects were instructed to avoid nicotine, alcohol, dietary supplements, medications and all
      other stimulants and to maintain their normal dietary, sleep and physical activity patterns
      before test sessions. Caffeine and other caffeinated products (e.g., chocolate, caffeinated
      gums, caffeine containing beverages) were avoided for 48 hours and food for at least 4 hours
      before testing.

      A double blind, placebo-controlled, counterbalanced, crossover design was adopted for this
      study. The randomized order of testing was determined using free online software
      (www.randomization.com). Neither staff nor participants were informed about the names of the
      two drinks, and blinding was strictly maintained by emphasizing to both staff and
      participants that both drinks adhered to healthy principles, and that each was advocated by
      certain sports medicine experts. Two familiarization sessions were completed before
      definitive test sessions in order to eliminate any learning effects on physical performance
      and reaction time measurements. During the second familiarization session, body mass and
      height were recorded. Each participant visited the laboratory for two formal test sessions,
      drinking a caffeine-containing ED (RB) and a caffeine and taurine free beverage drink (PL).
      All sessions were arranged in the early evening hours to avoid any time of day effects. The
      two definitive test sessions were separated by an interval of seven days to allow sufficient
      recovery between tests and to ensure caffeine washout. To avoid identification, two opaque
      and unmarked cans of RB or PL were ingested by each participant (i.e., 500 mL) in the
      presence of a researcher. The two drinks were similar in volume, texture, and appearance. One
      can of RB drink (i.e., 250ml) contained 80 mg of caffeine, 1 g of taurine, 27 g of
      carbohydrates, 0.6 g of protein, 5 mg vitamin B6 and 487 kJ of energy. The PL drink was
      prepared by an agri-food engineer; it did not contain any caffeine or taurine, but comprised
      carbonated water, carbohydrates, citric acid lemon juice reconstituted from concentrate (1
      %), supplemented by flavorings, of sodium citrate, acesulfame K, sucralose, potassium sorbate
      and RB (a flavoring that contains propylene glycol E1520 (0.23 mL).

      Beverages were prepared, shaken and chilled in a refrigerator at 14h00 by an investigator who
      took no part in the test sessions or data analysis, but prepared the alphanumeric code
      identifying the tested drink. At 17h00, the cooled beverages were served in sealed plastic
      opaque water bottles and consumed using an opaque straw. Participants were instructed to
      drink the fluid quickly (within 1±0.5 min) 60 minutes before their test session and not to
      discuss or compare tastes or to make any assumptions about what they had ingested. The
      interval of 60 minutes was chosen as optimal for a complete caffeine absorption and thus a
      peaking of a caffeine concentration .

      Subjects were supervised by staff to ensure that they drank the entire quantity of fluid, and
      no exchange of bottles was allowed. The last standardized meal (i.e., lunch) before the
      beginning of the test session was taken at 13h00. Temperature and relative humidity of the
      laboratory were similar over the test sessions, with a temperature of around 22°C and a
      relative humidity between 45 and 55 %. During each test session (from 18h00), resting blood
      glucose and blood pressures were measured and the participants completed the POMS
      questionnaire.

      A 5-min treadmill warm-up was performed. After that, the reaction time, and handgrip force
      were determined, and the 30-s Wingate test was performed. RPE scores, blood glucose and blood
      pressures were then measured, and the affective load was calculated. To investigate the
      effects of RB on the acute physiological and psychological responses to exercise, blood
      measures and psychological test measures were collected immediately pre- and post-exercise.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Wingate-test physical performance from PL to RB condition</measure>
    <time_frame>The performance in Wingate test was measured 1 hour following the consumption of supplementations in the first and second test sessions (RB session and PLA session) to assess possible beneficial effect of RB supplementation in physical performance</time_frame>
    <description>A calibrated mechanically-braked cycle ergometer (Monark 894; Stockholm, Sweden) interfaced with a microcomputer was utilized for the 30-s Wingate test. Subjects pedaled as fast as possible for 30-s against a constant load calculated according to the participant's body-mass (i.e., 8.7%). After maintaining a constant ~60rpm speed for 4-6-s against minimal resistance, the selected load was applied. The participant sat on the cycle throughout and was strongly encouraged to maximize pedaling rates and to maintain a high speed. Peak and mean power (i.e., average of power output the 30-s) were recorded. The fatigue index was calculated as follows:
Fatigue index (%) = [(peak power-minimal power)/ peak power×100]. The ICC and SEM showed excellent reliability for peak power (ICC&gt;0.98, absolute SEM &lt;0.21), mean power (ICC&gt;0.98, absolute SEM &lt;0.23) and fatigue index (ICC&gt;0.76, absolute SEM &lt;1.99).</description>

    <measure>Change in Reaction Time Performance from PL to RB condition</measure>
    <time_frame>The reaction time performance was measured 1 hour following the consumption of supplementations in the first and second test sessions (RB session and PLA session) to assess possible beneficial effect of RB in reaction time performance</time_frame>
    <description>A simple visual reaction time test assessed alertness and motor reaction-speed. Subjects responded as quickly as possible to presentation of a stimulus (the image of a black box) on a computer screen (15&quot; LCD). When this appears, the participant should press the index finger on a computer key. The signal appeared in random order within 1-10-s time intervals. Each participant was allowed ten attempts and the mean reaction time was calculated, using React! V0.9 software.The ICC and SEM showed excellent reliability for reaction time (ICC&gt;0.89, absolute SEM &lt;0.14) measurement.</description>

    <measure>Change in Strength Physical Performance (i.e., Handgrip) from PL to RB condition</measure>
    <time_frame>Handgrip performance was measured 1 hour following the consumption of supplementations in the first and second test sessions (RB session and PLA session) to assess possible beneficial effect of RB supplementation in strength (i.e., Handgrip) performance</time_frame>
    <description>Handgrip strength was recorded by dynamometer (T.K.K. 5401; Takei, Tokyo, Japan). The maximal handgrip force was determined for the dominant hand. Participants exerted their maximal strength for 4-5-s. With the hand hanging downwards, the dynamometer was</description>

    <measure>Change in Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPE) and Affective Load from PL to RB condition</measure>
    <time_frame>RPE and Affective Load were measured immediately following the first and second training sessions (RB and PL sessions) to assess any beneficial effect of the consumed RB (1 hour before session) on fatigue and load perception</time_frame>
    <description>The original Borg RPE scale rates exertion subjectively during or after physical exercise on a 15-point scale ranging from six (very very light) to twenty (very very hard). It was used to calculate the affective load; the affective load was obtained as the difference between the perceived exertion (negative affective response) and pleasure scores (positive affective response). For example, with an RPE score of six, the negative affective response is zero and the positive affective response is -14. However, if the RPE score rises to 20, the negative affective response is +14 and the positive affective response is zero. The potential affective load thus ranges from -14 to +14. A negative affective load score indicates the dominance of pleasant affective responses and a positive affective load represents the dominance of unpleasant affective responses.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Mood States (POMS) from PL to RB condition</measure>
    <time_frame>POMS was measured immediately following the first and second training sessions (RB and PL sessions) to assess any beneficial effect of the consumed RB (1hour before session) on perception of tension, depression, anger, vigor, fatigue, and confusion</time_frame>
    <description>The evaluation of mood states used the French language version of the POMS questionnaire. Responses to 65 adjectives (ranging from &quot;Zero&quot; (i.e., not at all) to &quot;Four&quot; (i.e., extremely) assessed immediate mood states in seven dimensions: tension, depression, anger, vigor, fatigue, confusion and interpersonal relationships.</description>
