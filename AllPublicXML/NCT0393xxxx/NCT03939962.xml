      The aim of this study is to observe the efficacy, safety, postoperative pathological response
      rate and survival benefit of immume checkpoint inhibitor PD-1 SHR1210 combined with
      chemotherapy in neoadjuvant therapy of locally advanced resectable gastric and
      gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma. In addition ，the investigators will explore the
      relationship between the immunophenotype of gastric cancer and the efficacy and drug
      resistance of immunotherapy combined with chemotherapy, and screen out biomarkers that can
      predict the efficacy of immunotherapy.

    <textblock>
      Neoadjuvant chemotherapy and neoadjuvant radiotherapy and chemotherapy can not only improve
      the surgical resection rate and postoperative pathological remission rate, but also prolong
      the postoperative recurrence-free survival and benefit patients.Recent studies have confirmed
      that immume point inhibitors PD-1 and CTLA-4 monoclonal antibody have a certain effect in
      advanced gastric and gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma which had experienced
      multi-line treatment. Furthermore，the FOLFOX protocol is recommended as a new adjuvant
      treatment for locally advanced gastric cancer.In order to further improve the surgical
      resection rate and survival rate by improving the efficacy of neoadjuvant therapy for locally
      advanced gastric and gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma, the investigators selected
      PD-1 monoclonal antibody combined with FOLFOX neoadjuvant therapy for locally advanced
      gastric and gastroesophageal junctions Adenocarcinoma.The aim of this study is to observe the
      efficacy, safety, postoperative pathological response rate and survival benefit of immume
      checkpoint inhibitor PD-1 SHR1210 combined with chemotherapy in neoadjuvant therapy of
      locally advanced resectable gastric and gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma. In addition
      ，the investigators will explore the relationship between the immunophenotype of gastric
      cancer and the efficacy and drug resistance of immunotherapy combined with chemotherapy, and
      screen out biomarkers that can predict the efficacy of immunotherapy.
