      This study will investigate if mindfulness training via a smartphone mobile app is effective
      in improving OA-related knee pain.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigator's primary aim in this study is to determine if regular use of a mindfulness
      application improves pain outcomes in adults with knee osteoarthritis. The investigator's
      secondary aim is to determine if self-reported Healthcare-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL)
      scores predict response to mindfulness treatment in OA. The investigators hypothesize that
      the use of an mHealth intervention for mindfulness training may be an effective adjunct
      treatment of chronic knee osteoarthritis pain; specifically, that regular use of a
      mindfulness application will result in a statistically significant reduction in pain outcomes
      and improvement in physical function as determined by the KOOS scoring system. The
      investigators also hypothesize that those with lower baseline self-reported HRQoL scores are
      more likely to see a greater improvement in their pain and function with use of a mindfulness
      application than those with higher baseline scores.

    <description>The KOOS is a validated knee-specific patient-reported outcome survey designed to assess an individual's perception of their knee pain and associated disability. It has 42 items in 5 separately scored subscales; Pain, other Symptoms, ADL function, Sport and Recreation function, and knee-related Quality of Life (QOL). All items are scored 0-4; for each subscale the scores are transformed to a 0-100 scale (0 representing extreme knee problems and 100 representing no knee problems).</description>

    <description>The FFMQ-15 is designed to provide a quantitative evaluation of mindfulness. It is based on five independently developed mindfulness questionnaires.The questionnaire has 39 items. The five facets are: observing, describing, acting with awareness, non-judging of inner experience, and non-reactivity to inner experience.</description>

    <description>Patients will be provided with a pre-paid 12-week subscription to the mindfulness application, and provided an in-person demonstration on how to use it, and the subscription license code will be recorded for the purposes of tracking use after the conclusion of the study. The intervention group will be asked to use the mindfulness app 10 minutes per day/5 days per week. To standardize Pack usage across all participants, users will be asked to complete the Headspace Essentials&quot;, &quot;Pain Management&quot;, and &quot;Physical Health&quot; Session Packs.</description>

    <description>My Water Balance calculates an individual's recommended daily water requirements and assists users in tracking their daily fluid intake. The control group will be asked to log their water intake for the duration of the study, with requested use of 5 days per week to create an equal control. This application is free to download and use. There are options for in-app purchases and application upgrades, though users will be advised against doing so. Information logged in the application may be stored on a third party server; however, no application data will be extracted by the study team. Application use will be reported via weekly surveys, alone.</description>
