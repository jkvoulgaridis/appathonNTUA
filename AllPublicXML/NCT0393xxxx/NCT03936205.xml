  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pain is a common symptom in patients nearing the end of life. Its prevalence varies between
      30 and 75%. Nowadays, morphine is the most used molecule as first line treatment of moderate
      to severe pain. However, this molecule, considering its side effects, may contribute in part
      to the discomfort of these patients and may increase the pre-existing agitation or delirium.
      There is therefore a need to find new agents, other than morphine, for pain control at the
      end of life, without the limitations that the morphine molecule has. The author reviewed the
      literature on the role of dexmedetomidine in the treatment of refractory symptoms in
      palliative care, including pain. It is an agonist of the adrenergic alpha 2 receptor having a
      sedative, analgesic action and a morphine sparing effect demonstrated postoperatively.

      This study aims primarily at demonstrating that dexmedetomidine has a beneficial role in the
      treatment of pain in patients with metastatic cancer.
