      This research project aims to generate scientific evidence on the clinical results obtained
      in the treatment of fibromyalgia, which usually presents with pain and long-term disability,
      by applying a special form of manual physiotherapy called &quot;POLD concept&quot;. This therapy is
      based on a passive, oscillatory mobilization, performed at a resonance frequency and applied
      throughout the time of the therapeutic session, on the vertebrae and the muscles of the back,
      without interruption. It is carried out on the initiative of the research team in &quot;pain
      treatment&quot;, of the physiotherapy school of the University of Lleida, in collaboration with
      the Omphis Foundation and the clinical service of the Unity of Fibromyalgia of GSS (Hospital
      Universitarios de Santa María, Lleida)

    <time_frame>Participants will be followed for the duration of treatment application, an expected average of 8 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>We will use the Visual Analog Pain Scale (VAS), consisting of a line of 10 cm, whose left end coincides with the value 0 (absence of pain) and the right end with the value 10 (maximum pain imaginable), without reference marks intemediate The patient will mark a point in the line corresponding to his pain at the time of the test, the measurement of the centimeters from the left edge will indicate the analogical score of his pain between 0 and 10.</description>

    <measure>Quality of pain: The Mc Gill pain questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Participants will be followed for the duration of treatment application, an expected average of 8 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>The Mc Gill pain questionnaire comprises 62 descriptors distributed in 15 classes and, in turn, in 3 dimensions (sensory, affective and evaluative).
A value of pain is obtained for each dimension: sensory pain intensity (VID (S), affective pain intensity (VID (A)) and evaluative pain intensity (VID (E)) The sensory component is evaluated in 7 subclasses. The patient mark one or no descriptor of each subclass, if he scores 1 he scores 1 and if he does not mark none he scores 0. The score of the VID (S) is obtained adding and will be, therefore, between 0 and 7. The affective dimension includes subclasses 8 to 13 and its score ranges from 0 to 6. The evaluative dimension corresponds to subclass 14 and the score of it will be 0 or 1. From the sum of the three, the total score (VID (T)) is obtained, from 0 to 14. In addition, the current pain intensity (VIA) is scored from subclass 15, the score is 0-no pain, 1-mild, 2-annoying, 3-intense, 4-strong, 5-unbearable.</description>

    <measure>Pain interference: We use the Brief Pain Inventory</measure>
    <time_frame>Participants will be followed for the duration of treatment application, an expected average of 8 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>We use the Brief Pain Inventory that gives two main scores: a pain severity score and a pain interference score. The pain severity score is calculated from the four items about pain intensity. Each item is rated from 0, no pain, to 10, pain as bad as you can imagine, and contributes with the same weight to the final score, ranging from 0 to 40. The pain interference score corresponds to the item on pain interference. The seven sub items are rated from 0, does not interfere, to 10, completely interferes, and contributes with the same weight to the final score, ranging from 0 to 70. The first item, pain drawing diagrams (painful and most painful areas) do not contribute to the scoring</description>
