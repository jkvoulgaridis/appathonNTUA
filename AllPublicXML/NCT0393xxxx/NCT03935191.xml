      Primary Study Objective:

      To determine the accuracy of Dexcom G6 CGM System glucose readings in reference to
      arterialized venous sample YSI glucose measurements in pregnant women with diabetes mellitus.

      Secondary Study Objective:

      To assess the safety of the Dexcom G6 CGM System, through characterization of device-related
      Adverse Events (AEs), in pregnant women with diabetes mellitus.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age ≥ 18 years;

          2. Currently in the 2nd or 3rd trimester of pregnancy;

          3. Diagnosis of GDM, T1DM, or T2DM;

          4. Willing to avoid insulin injections or wear an insulin pump insertion set within 3
             inches from the sensor site;

          5. Able to follow study procedures;

          6. Able to speak, read, and write in English or Spanish.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Extensive skin changes/diseases that preclude wearing the required number of devices
             on normal skin (e.g., extensive psoriasis, recent burns or severe sunburn, extensive
             eczema, extensive scarring, extensive tattoos, dermatitis herpetiformis) at the
             proposed wear sites;

          2. Known allergy to medical-grade adhesives;

          3. Hematocrit of &lt; 30%;

          4. Prescribed tocolytic drugs for treatment of pre-term labor or experiencing high-risk
             pregnancy complications, including, but not limited to, pre-eclampsia or HELLP
             syndrome (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and a low platelet count) during current
             pregnancy;

          5. Currently receiving dialysis treatment or planning to receive dialysis during the
             sensor wear period;

          6. Require a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scan, Computed Tomography (CT) scan, or
             diathermy during the sensor wear period;

          7. Current participation in another investigational study protocol (if a subject has
             recently completed participation in another drug study, the subject must have
             completed that study at least 30 days prior to being enrolled in this study.);

          8. Working for a competitive medical device company or having an immediate family member
             or person living within the same household who works for such a company (e.g.,
             Medtronic, GlySens Inc., Abbott Laboratories, Roche, Senseonics, Waveform, and
             Ascencia/POCTech);

          9. Any condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would interfere with their
             participation in the trial (e.g., marked visual impairment) or pose excessive risk to
             study staff handling venous blood samples (e.g., known history of HIV or Hepatitis B
             or C).
