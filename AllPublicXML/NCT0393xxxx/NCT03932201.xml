  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the HEM-POWR study is to understand better how Damoctocog alfa pegol (Jivi) is
      used to treat people with Hemophilia A in day-to-day life, how well the treatment is
      tolerated and how satisfied patients and physicians are with the treatment.

    <description>Follow clinical practice. BAY94-9027 is a B-domain-deleted recombinant factor VIII (rFVIII) product site-specifically conjugated to a single (dual 30-kDa branched) 60-kDa polyethylene glycol (PEG) molecule. BAY 94-9027 is intended for prophylaxis and treatment of bleeds in patients with hemophilia A aged ≥12 years, with a narrow, predictable weekly dose that allows for the treatment regimen to be tailored to individual patient needs.</description>
