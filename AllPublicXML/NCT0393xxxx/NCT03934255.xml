  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study seeks to examine central and peripheral circadian mechanisms in Blacks with
      appropriately dipping systolic blood pressure (blood pressure that dips by at least 10%)
      compared with non-dipping systolic blood pressure (blood pressure that dips by less than 10%)
      using a constant routine protocol. Constant routine protocols are commonly used in the field
      of circadian biology to examine rhythms in biological processes while controlling the
      entraining effects of light, activity, and diet.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will enroll a total of 40 participants (n=20 non-dippers; n=20 dippers) to
      complete a 30-hour constant routine protocol. Participants will undergo baseline testing that
      includes anthropometric measurements, clinic blood pressure measurements, completion of
      self-report questionnaires on sleep and mood, be fitted with an ambulatory blood pressure
      monitor and actigraphy watch, and be provided with home sleep testing (HST) equipment.

      Following completion of baseline assessment, eligible participants will be scheduled for the
      30-hour constant routine protocol. The 30-hour constant routine protocol will allow for the
      hourly collection of saliva, collection of buccal cells every 4 hours, and constant
      monitoring of core body temperature, all of which are primary outcomes in the assessment of
      central and peripheral circadian clock markers. Amplitude and phase of these outcomes will be
      assessed in non-dippers versus dippers.
