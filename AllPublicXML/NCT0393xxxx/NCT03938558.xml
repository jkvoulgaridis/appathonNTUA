  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a controlled pilot study with 17 participants with Multiple Sclerosis (MS). The
      primary goal of this study is to objectively examine the effects of a multimodal dance
      intervention on walking-related performance fatigability. The secondary aim is to investigate
      the effects of a multimodal dance intervention on other MS symptoms related to fatigue and
      fatigability.

      The following research questions will be addressed:

        1. Does a multimodal dance intervention have positive effects on walking-related
           fatigability?

        2. Does a multimodal dance intervention have positive effects on other MS symptoms related
           to fatigue and fatigability?

      This study distinguish two groups contributing to a dance and art production. The
      experimental group will perform 10 weeks of dance training, while the other group will
      contribute to the production in various ways (e.g. word art, photography, painting, …).

      Measures will be taken before and after the training or assistance in the production.
