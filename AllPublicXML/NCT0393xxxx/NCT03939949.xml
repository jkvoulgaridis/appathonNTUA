  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Substantial evidence suggests that psychosocial factors play a key role in explaining the
      risk for development of chronic pain, as well as for coping with it. Such factors include
      psychological perceptions or orientation towards pain, mainly referring to fear of pain and
      pain catastrophizing. Nonetheless, although this link is well documented, the underlying
      mechanisms of these processes have yet to be established. The &quot;Attention to Variability&quot;
      paradigm presents an explanatory mechanism, according to which the ability to mindfully
      attend to chronic symptoms enables and promotes increased control over the etiology and the
      expression of chronic symptoms. In support of the ATV paradigm, empirical findings
      demonstrate that ATV improved pregnancy outcomes and allowed people to gain control over
      fluctuations in their heart rates.

      The goal of the present study is to examine whether mindfully attending to pain sensations
      will decrease the intensity and frequency of chronic pain, increase perceived control of
      pain, and improve well-being and health-related quality of life.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants who experience chronic pain will be randomly assigned to one of three
      experimental groups, which differ in the content and scheduling of text messages delivered
      over a period of six days. One third of participants will be assigned to the &quot;active control&quot;
      group. These participants will receive 2 text messages per day for six days (one at 9am and
      one at 9pm) asking them to report on the activity they are currently engaged in. One third of
      participants will be assigned to the &quot;low mindfulness&quot; group. These participants will receive
      the same text messages as the participants in the active control group, but will also be
      prompted with the 9pm text to report on pain intensity and unpleasantness at that time. One
      third of participants will be assigned to the &quot;high mindfulness&quot; group. These participants
      will also receive two text message prompts about their current activity. Participants in the
      &quot;high mindfulness&quot; group will also receive questions about current pain intensity and
      unpleasantness in both the morning and evening. In order to emphasize the variability in
      pain, participants will receive these text messages on a variable schedule. In addition, they
      will sent instructions every morning to pay attention to variability in their pain throughout
      the day and asked to report on how their pain is changing over time as a part of each text
      message prompt.

      The researchers will take measurements of pain interference, perceptions of control, and pain
      experience at three time points (T0=baseline, T1= immediately after the 6 days of text
      messages, T2= 1 month after T1, and T3= 3 months after T1). All surveys will be collected
      online via the Qualtrics.com platform.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain Beliefs and Perceptions Inventory (PBAPI)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The objective of the measure is to assess new pain believes. The scale includes 16 questions, each ranging from -2 to 2, with -2 being 'Strongly Disagree' and 2 being 'Strongly Agree.' There is no zero point on the scale. The 16-question measure includes four subscales, each containing four items. The subscales (Pain as Mystery, Pain as Constant, Pain as Permanent and Self-Blame) are scored individually by adding the score for each of the four items within a subscale together and then dividing that number by four. The subtotal for each one is then added to the others for a total scale score. Five items are reverse-scores, two of which are in the Pain as Constant subscale and the other three of which are in the Pain as Permanent Subscale. Final scores can range from -8 to 8.</description>

    <measure>Multidimensional Health Locus of Control Scale - Form C (MHLC-Form C)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The objective of the assessment is to measure health-related control beliefs in individuals with an current medical condition, such that scoring indicate the degree to which an individual believes their health is under their control versus the control of others or external forces. The scale includes 18 items, each ranging from 1-6, with 1 being 'Strongly Disagree' and 6 being 'Strongly Agree'. The scale includes four subscales including Internal, Chance, Doctors, and Other People. To determine overall scale score, sum all items from all subscales together for a final score between 18 and 108.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Brief Pain Inventory- Short Form</measure>
    <time_frame>2 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>9-item scale measures pain severity and impact of pain on functional health. First item asks whether they have pain other than 'everyday' pain today (yes/No). Second question provides diagram of a person, asking one to point to pain and most pain. Next four items ask one to rate the worst, least, average and current pain over past 24 hours on a scale from 0 (No Pain)-10 (Pain As Bad As You Can Imagine). Item 7 asks about current pain treatments. Item 8 asks about % relief pain treatments provided over last 24 hours. %'s range from 0 (No Relief) to 100 (Complete Relief). Last item asks one to indicate pain interfering with 'General Activity,' 'Mood,' 'Walking ability,' 'Normal work,' 'Relations with other people,' 'Sleep,' and 'Enjoyment of life' over past 24 hours. Scales range from 0 (Does Not Interfere) to 10 (Completely Interferes). A mean composite score of items 3-6 yields pain severity. Other items are to be individually interpreted.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The MOS 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The objective of the measure is to survey health status. The assessment includes 36 items, with eight scaled scores from 8 separate dimensions, including 'Vitality,' 'Physical Functioning,' 'Bodily Pain,' 'General Health Perceptions,' 'Physical Role Functioning,' 'Emotional Role Functioning,' 'Social Role Functioning' and 'Mental Health.' Scores range from 0-100 with lower scores indicating more disability and higher score indicating less disability.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The objective of the assessment is to measure catastrophic thinking related to pain. The tool asks individuals to endorse the degree to which they identified with certain thoughts or emotions surrounding their previous experiences of pain. The measure includes 13 items asking participants to rate their responses on a five-point likert scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 4 (all the time). The measure consists of three subscales, including 'Rumination', 'Magnification' and 'Helplessness.' To score the measure, one is to sum up each of the subscales and then calculate the sum of the three subscales together. The subscales can also be individually interpreted.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Langer Mindfulness Scale- 14 item (LMS-14)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The assessment measures socio-cognitive mindfulness. The measure includes three subscales, each ranging from 1-7, with 1 being 'Strongly Disagree' and 7 being 'Strongly Agree'. Subscales are 'Novelty Seeking'; 'Novelty Producing'; 'Engagement'. Some items are reverse scored. To determine overall Mindfulness score, sum all items (items 1-14).</description>
