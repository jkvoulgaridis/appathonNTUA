  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For a long time, delirium was considered a merely temporary dysfunction of the brain. Today,
      it is established that it is a brain disease associated with network dysfunction,
      neuroinflammation and impaired transmitter homeostasis in a multicausal model. Following an
      episode of delirium, many patients do not return to their prior level of cognitive and
      functional performance. In particular, failed or delayed diagnosis with consecutive
      inadequate therapy contribute to the development of long-term cognitive decline that may
      ultimately lead to long-term care. Stroke patients are a particularly common
      delirium-affected population (10-46% depending on severity). Despite the frequency and
      clinical relevance of delirium in stroke patients, diagnostic characteristics of common
      screening methods are unknown. Similarly, the clinical phenotype and risk factors of patients
      who develop delirium have not been adequately described.

      This study primarily aims to evaluate the diagnostic properties of established screening
      tools for delirium in a prospective cohort of well-characterised patients following ischemic
      cerebral events (either transient or manifest stroke). Secondary outcome criteria include
      predictors of post-stroke delirium (PSD) such as stroke location and size, pre-stroke
      cognitive functioning, ability to participate in daily routine activities and medical
      conditions.

    <description>Binary outcomes of delirium screening tests will be compared, i.e. if they characterize an individual patient as delirious at any of two time points during the 7 day observation period. Instruments include: Nursing Delirium Screening Scale (Nu-DESC), Confusion Assessment Method (CAM), rapid assessment test for delirium (4-AT). Binary outcomes (&quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; according to each of the scales) are then aggregated in one test that compares the observed frequency of delirious patients (according the above mentioned tests) with the actual number of delirious patients as assessed by the DSM-5 standard.</description>
