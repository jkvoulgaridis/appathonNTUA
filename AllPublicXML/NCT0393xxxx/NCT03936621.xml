    <textblock>
      The study duration is 12 months. The initial enrollment visit will take approximately one
      hour. The Month 1, 3, 6, 7, 9 and 12 visits will take approximately 30 minutes each. The
      three telephone visits will take approximately 10 minutes each. The total time commitment to
      the study will be approximately four and a half hours.

      The table below explains what will be done at each study visit:

      Prior to Pre-Registration Informed Consent. Questionnaire (asking about your risks for lung
      cancer, diet and medications including food supplement). Blood test for CRP level

      Prior to Registration/Randomization Blood test for CRP level (about 6 ml or 1 teaspoon)

      Registration/Randomization Medical history Physical exam (Vital signs/Body height and weight)
      Receive 3 month supply of Omega 3 fatty acids for treatment first group. Blood tests for
      Fasting Blood insulin, etc (about 15 ml or 3 teaspoons) Receive a diary to record the amount
      of study medication you take each day and any side effects you may experience

      Week 2 telephone interview Ask about side effects you may be having Ask about other
      medications you may be taking Review study agent diary

      Month 1 visit (you will not be able to eat anything for 10 hours before the appointment)

      Month 2, 4, and 5 telephone interview Review diary Ask about side effects you may be having
      Ask about other medications you may be taking

      Month 3 visit (you will not be able to eat anything for 10 hours before the appointment)
      Physical exam with vital signs Repeat blood tests (about 15 ml or 3 teaspoons) (All

      Treatment Group:

      Collect unused omega 3 (for treatment group) Receive next 3 month supply of omega 3 (for
      treatment group) Review study medication diary Ask about side effects you may be experiencing
      Ask about other medications you may be taking

      Month 6 or end of study visit (if left study early for any reason) Physical exam with vital
      signs Blood tests (about 15 ml or 3 teaspoons) - All participants

      Treatment Group:

      Review and collect study agent diary Ask about side effects you may be having Ask about other
      medications you may be taking

      Month 7-12 Cross over study Treatment group will become observation group Observation group
      will become treatment group with the same procedures in month 1 to 6

    <description>Omega 3 fatty acids for 6 months and then off omega 3 fatty acids for the next 6 months. In the first 6 months, you will be asked to take one capsule of Omega 3 fatty acids with breakfast and 1 with dinner/day for the first week, 2 capsules in the morning and one capsule in the evening for the second week and then 2 capsules with breakfast and 2 with dinner/day for the remaining 24 weeks. In the next 6 months (Months 7 to 12), you will have a blood test for markers of inflammation at the end of Month 7 and at Month 9 and 12 to determine if the anti-inflammatory effects of Omega 3 acids are still there after you have stopped taking it.</description>

In Month 7, you will be asked to take one capsule of Omega 3 with breakfast and 1 with dinner/day for the first week, 2 capsules in the morning and one capsule in the evening for the second week and then 2 capsules with breakfast and 2 with dinner/day for the remaining 24 weeks.</description>

    <description>To evaluate the efficacy of 3.6 g omega 3 fatty acid supplements (2.4 g EPA + 1.2 g DHA)/day for 6 months versus no treatment at reducing the level of C-reactive protein (CRP) in ever smokers at high risk of lung cancer. The primary endpoint of the study is reduction of CRP.</description>

             for 30 years) smoking history or

          -  Have a greater than 1.51% chance of developing lung cancer in the next six years based
             on the investigator's risk prediction tool

          -  Have elevation of a marker of inflammation called C-Reactive Protein (CRP)

          -  Are capable of providing informed consent to participate in the study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Have been previously diagnosed with lung cancer

          -  Have had other non-curatively treated cancer outside the lung.

          -  Have any medical condition, such as severe heart disease (e.g. unstable angina,
             chronic congestive heart failure), acute or chronic respiratory failure, home oxygen
             therapy, bleeding disorder, that in the opinion of the investigator could jeopardize
             your safety during participation in the study or unlikely to benefit from screening
             due to shortened life-expectancy from the co-existing illnesses

          -  Are currently taking omega 3 fatty acid supplements
