      The purposes of this study are 1) to determine the pharmacokinetics of alcohol after
      experimental administration of alcohol simulating a &quot;binge-drinking&quot; episode in young adults
      2) to determine the profile of biomarkers of acute damage and exposure/consumption to alcohol
      3) to determine the pharmacokinetic parameters and evaluate the acute effects alcohol and its
      relationship with biomarkers.

    <textblock>
      Binge drinking (BD) has become trendy among adolescents and young adults. It is defined as a
      pattern of drinking that reach blood alcohol concentration (BAC) to 80 mg/dl in a short
      period of time (2 hours), that typically occurs after 4 drinks for women and 5 drinks for
      men. Despite its high prevalence and association with morbidity and mortality, there are no
      previous experimental studies evaluating alcohol concentrations after a &quot;binge drinking&quot;
      episode neither its effects on biomarkers of acute damage and exposure/consumption.

      The aims of this study are 1) to determine the pharmacokinetics of alcohol after experimental
      administration of alcohol simulating a &quot;binge-drinking&quot; episode in young adults 2) to
      determine the profile of biomarkers of acute damage and exposure/consumption to alcohol 3) to
      determine the pharmacokinetic parameters and evaluate the acute effects alcohol and its
      relationship with biomarkers.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Understanding and accepting the study procedures and signing the informed consent.

          -  Male and females healthy volunteers (18-35 years old)

          -  Clinical history and physical examination demonstrating no organic or psychiatric
             disorders.

          -  The ECG and general blood and urine laboratory tests performed before the study should
             be within normal ranges. Minor or occasional changes from normal ranges are accepted
             if, in the investigator's opinion, considering the current state of the art, they are
             not clinically significant, are not life-threatening for the subjects and do not
             interfere with the product assessment. These changes and their non-relevance will be
             justified in writing specifically.

          -  Body weight between 60 and 85 kilograms for men and between 50 and 65 kg in for women.
             Lower or higher weights will be accepted, if the researchers considered that do not
             pose a risk to the subjects and do not interfere with the objectives of the study.

          -  BMI between 19-27 kg/m². Lower or higher BMIs will be allow, if the researchers
             considered that do not pose a risk to the subjects and do not interfere with the
             objectives of the study.

          -  Recreational use of alcohol at least 1 standard unit alcohol (standard drink)/day
             (accumulated in the week) and previous experiences in drunkenness and binge-drinking.

          -  Women with a regular menstrual cycle lasting between 26-32 days.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Not fill the inclusion criteria.

          -  History or clinical evidence of gastrointestinal, liver, renal or other disorders
             which may lead to suspecting a disorder in drug absorption, distribution, metabolism
             or excretion, or that suggest gastrointestinal irritation due to drugs.

          -  Present history of substance use disorder according to Diagnostic and Statistical
             Manual for Mental Disorders (DSM)-IV (except for nicotine). Past history of mild
             substance use disorder (corresponding to abuse substance according to DSM-IV) could be
             included.

          -  Blood donation 8 weeks before or participation in other clinical trials with drugs in
             the previous 12 weeks.

          -  Having suffered any organic disease or major surgery in the three months prior to the
             study start.

          -  Subjects with intolerance or serious adverse reactions to alcohol. Asian subjects with
             no intolerance or serious adverse reactions to alcohol could be included.

          -  Regular use of any drug in the month prior to the study sessions.The treatment with
             single or limited doses of symptomatic medicinal products in the week prior to the
             study sessions will not be a reason for exclusion if it is calculated that it has been
             cleared completely the day of the experimental session.

          -  Daily consumption &gt;10 cigarettes.

          -  Daily consumption &gt;20 grams of alcohol in women and &gt;40 grams of alcohol in men.

        Daily consumption &gt;5 coffees, tea, cola refreshment or other stimulating drinks or
        containing xanthines in the three months prior to the study start.

          -  Subjects unable to understand the nature, consequences of the study and the procedures
             requested to be followed.

          -  Subjects with positive serology to Hepatitis B, C or HIV.

          -  Pregnant, breastfeeding women or those not use an method of contraception or not use
