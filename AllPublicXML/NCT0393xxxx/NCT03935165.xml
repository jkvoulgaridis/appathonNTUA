  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to establish a new and more accurate method to visualize the
      peritoneal changes caused by endometriosis using Indocyanine Green mediated fluorescence
      imaging. The hypothesis is that Indocyanine Green, a fluorescent dye that has wide
      applications throughout medicine in identifying vascularity of tissues and
      neo-vascularization, could facilitate the localization and excision of endometriotic lesions
      exploiting the hypervascularization due to the chronic inflammation. The already published
      Pilot Study GRE-ENDO (Cosentino F, Near-Infrared Imaging with Indocyanine Green for Detection
      of Endometriosis Lesions (Gre-Endo Trial): A Pilot Study.), encouraged the effort of a larger
      prospective trial. Based on the mini-max two-stage design by Simon [Simon R. Optimal two
      stage design for phase II clinical trials], the investigators tested the null hypothesis that
      the true rate of pathologically assessed endometriosis would improve from 87% to the
      clinically relevant alternative of 100.0%, as assessed by NIR-ICG laparoscopy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients were recruited within the clinical routine after indication for laparoscopy under
      consideration of the inclusion and exclusion criteria.

      The sample size was calculated according to the study design by Simon (Simon R. Optimal two
      stage design for phase II clinical trials), using an α-error of 0.05 (two-sided) and a
      β-error of 0.80. Thus, the first step was planned to include 13 patients; if 12 or fewer
      successfully achieved endometriosis detection through NIR-ICG vision, the study would enrol
      additional patients up to a total of 40 patients. The NIR-ICG would be considered active if &gt;
      37 patients with occult endometriosis was registered. Considering a drop-out rate around 10%,
      at least 44 cases were planned to be enrolled. The first abdominal and pelvi's inspection was
      made using direct laparoscope visualization under white light conditions. All areas suspected
      of peritoneal endometriosis was classified as white, black and red lesions and recorded
      together with their anatomic location in the surgical record for the purposes of subsequent
      extirpation. After the first visual inspection the patient was administered with 0.05 - 0.25
      mg /(kg BW) Indocyanine Green intravenously. The Indocyanine Green imaging mode of the
      Olympus Indocyanine Green Imaging System was activated and suspected areas in Indocyanine
      Green imaging mode were recorded with them corresponding appearance in white light mode. If
      suspected areas were visible either in white light or Indocyanine Green imaging mode,
      specific sample has been taken from these areas. In addition, control biopsy specimens from
      inconspicuous peritoneum has been taken.
