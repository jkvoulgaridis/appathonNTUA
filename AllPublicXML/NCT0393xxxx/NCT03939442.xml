  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy operations performed for morbid obesity are among the most
      common methods in the world. Gastric or intestinal bypass surgery with or without sleeve
      gastrectomy is thought to be more effective in controlling both weight loss and metabolic
      diseases. For this purpose, Roux-en-y gastric bypass, transit bipartition, duodenal switch,
      jejunoileal bypass are performed. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of
      jejunoileal bypass surgery on weight loss and metabolic diseases in patients with sleeve
      gastrectomy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bariatric surgery results in more and more long-term weight loss than traditional treatment
      in moderate and severe obesity. Due to morbid obesity, jejunoileal bypass has been applied
      since 1970. Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy and jejunoileal anastomosis are among the rare
      techniques described in 2012. There are few studies on this technique.

      Between 2015 and 2018, jejunoileal bypass operations with laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy for
      morbid obesity will be evaluated in Inonu University gastroenterology surgery clinic. The
      patients' age, gender, body mass index, weight loss in follow-up periods, whether there is
      back weight gain, the effects on metabolic diseases, early and late complications will be
      evaluated.

    <description>The sleeve gastrectomy was performed first, after using a sealer and divider device to dissect the omentum away from the greater gastric curvature from approximately 5 cm proximal to the pylorus up to the angle of His. Excision of the fundus and the body of the stomach was then performed with a laparoscopic linear stapler upon a 36 French orogastric tube (bougie). An isoperistaltic side-to-side anastomosis between the jejunum (at 50 cm distal to the Treitz ligament) and the distal ileum ( at 200 cm proximal to the ileocecal valve) was then created using the same linear stapler with a blue cartridge (3.5 mm). A soft Penrose drain was left at the subdiaphragmatic space, and the abdominal wound was closed.</description>
