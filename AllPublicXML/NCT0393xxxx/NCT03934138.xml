  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are investigating whether, when given detailed information about underlying
      placebo mechanisms and pain, subjects will have a response similar to that of those subjected
      to a procedure in which they receive a conventional placebo treatment (associated with
      deception).

      STUDY DESIGN: This is a non-inferior parallel, controlled and randomized, single blind trial.

      POPULATION: The investigators will include in the study 126 subjects without known pathology.
      Participants will then be divided into 2 groups on a randomized basis.

      METHODOLOGY: Each subject will undergo three sessions of Cold Pressure Test (CPT), a cold
      pain stimulation method: calibration, condition of interest (conventional placebo or educated
      placebo) and control. The investigators' main judgment criterion is be the difference in pain
      intensity experienced on the visual analog scale between the CPT control and the CPT under
      the condition of interest.

      This study will allow the investigators to rule on the non-inferiority of an educated open
      label placebo compared to a conventional placebo in the context of an acute painful
      stimulation.
