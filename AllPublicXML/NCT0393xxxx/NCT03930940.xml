  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) results from the rupture of small vessels damaged
      by chronic hypertension, amyloid angiopathy or other disease. Hematoma volume has been
      demonstrated to be strongly correlated with the severity of white matter injury and
      conditions in ICH patients. In the past decades, surgical clot evacuation and stereotactic or
      endoscopic clot aspiration with thrombolytic drugs have been investigated for the treatment
      of ICH, however, none of them have been demonstrated to be effective. As such, medical
      management remains the standard of care for most patients with ICH, leading to ICH as the
      least treatable form of stroke.

      Remote ischemic conditioning (RIC) has been found to have neuroprotective effects by in
      patients with ischemic stroke. In addition, animal studies show that RIC is safe in ICH model
      and it could accelerate the absorption of hematoma. Therefore, the investigators plan to
      undertake this study to evaluate the safety of RIC in patients with ICH, and planned for
      future study to determine if treatment with RIC can improve the outcome of patients with ICH.

      In this study, our main objectives are: 1) to evaluated the safety of RIC, by determining the
      treatment related adverse events, in patients with ICH; and 2) to determine the preliminary
      effects of RIC on hematoma absorption and cerebral edema.

      The investigators hypothesize that RIC is well-tolerated and has minimal serious adverse
      effects in patients with ICH; and that treatment with RIC will accelerate the absorption of
      hematoma and improve patients' functional outcomes. Results of this study can potentially
      bring into account new means to improve the outcomes of ICH patients.
