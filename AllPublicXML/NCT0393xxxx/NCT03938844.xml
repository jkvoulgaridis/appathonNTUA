    <textblock>
      Stress urinary incontinence surgery combined with hysterectomy can often be applied to
      patients in the same session. The aim of this study was to determine which urinary
      incontinence surgery would be a better option for patients who would have hysterectomy.

      The aim of this study was to retrospectively review the data of 69 patients between the ages
      of 2014 and 2017 who underwent total laparoscopic hysterectomy and anti-incontinence surgery
      (TOT and Burch) for benign indications (uterine pathology) and stress urinary incontinence
      (SUI). In addition to demographic data and preoperative examination findings, operative
      times, postoperative hemogram values, postvoiding residual amounts and complications were
      examined.

      In addition, FSI test results of women with sexual activity were compared with ICIQ-UI and
      UDI-6 interrogations related to urinary incontinence.
