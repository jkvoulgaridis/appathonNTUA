  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A randomized controlled split-face pilot study was planned to investigate the preventive
      effect of tretinoin 0.05% cream on hyperpigmentation during phototherapy in patients with
      vitiligo.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Vitiligo is a chronic depigmentation disorder characterized by well-demarcated white macules
      and patches, reflecting selective melanocyte destruction. Hyperpigmentation at the treated
      areas is one of the limitations of phototherapy. Topical tretinoin (retinoic acid) has been
      well established to be effective for skin pigmentary disorders including melasma. This study
      aims to investigate the preventive effect of topical tretinoin on hyperpigmentation during
      phototherapy. A randomized controlled trial based on split-face was planned. The left/right
      face will be randomized to either tretinoin or placebo cream treatment groups. All lesions
      will be treated using phototherapy twice weekly for a total of 12-week period. The degree of
      repigmentation will be assessed as % from baseline by using a computer program every 4 weeks.
