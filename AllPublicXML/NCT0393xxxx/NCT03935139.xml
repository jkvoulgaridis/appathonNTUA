  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Microdialysis is admitted to be reliable by numerous surgeons to monitor flaps. Nevertheless,
      a few authors reported follow up with microdialysis in bone free flaps, and they all describe
      the position of the catheter in the surrounding soft tissue muscle which is not the accurate
      reflect of bone vascularisation. The aim of this study is to determine the lactate/pyruvate
      ratio mean value in bone free flaps with a microdialysis catheter directly positioned in the
      bone tissue.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Failure rate of facial reconstructive surgery with bone free flaps varies between 11 and 25%.
      In case of buried bone free flaps, the follow up is even more difficult. Monitoring methods,
      such as the implantable Doppler system, laser Doppler flowmetry and microdialysis have been
      developped in the last 15 years. Ferguson et al. show a false positive rate of 31% with
      implantable doppler monitoring of buried flaps.

      The purpose of this study is to to determine the lactate/pyruvate ratio mean value in bone
      free flaps with a microdialysis catheter directly positioned in the bone tissue.
