    <textblock>
      Endotracheal tube is a commonly used for general anesthesia in head and neck surgery. It is
      necessary to place the endotracheal tube in the trachea of the patient and then inflate the
      cuff with air. This is because the air-inflated cuff contacts the inner wall of the patient's
      trachea to deliver oxygen through the tube. If the cuff does not inflate, oxygen will leak
      through the space between the cuff and the patient's trachea. In addition, the risk of
      pneumonia increases. Therefore, after placing the endotracheal tube in the patient's trachea,
      the cuff is immediately inflated with air. However, when the cuff is inflated using an excess
      of air, the cuff may pressurize the mucous membrane of the tracheal wall and cause ischemia.
      Pressure in the over-inflated cuff was also found to be associated with post-operative sore
      throat, vocal cord paralysis, and nerve damage. Therefore, appropriate amount of air should
      be used to inflate the cuff into the air and adjust the pressure within the cuff to be within
      the range of 20-30 cmH2O. The common method to inflate the endotracheal tube cuff is
      palpation method. However, the palpation of the cuff is not accurate because of the different
      size between the pilot balloon and the cuff. Thus, the investigators hypothesized that the
      different size of the tube will affect the accuracy of the palpation method.
