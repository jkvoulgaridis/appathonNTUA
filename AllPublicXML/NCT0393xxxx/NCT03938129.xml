  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pregnancy related diseases and exposures in pregnancy are known risk factors for future
      disease. For example, women with a history of preeclampsia (a hypertensive disorder in
      pregnancy) and children born to these women are at increased risk of cardiovascular disease
      later in life. Yet, the mechanisms by which these long term health risks occur are unknown.
      Clearly, this presents a significant public health hazard as preventative and therapeutic
      interventions to block these pregnancy related diseases are limited. Current barriers to
      studying these long-term mechanisms in existing cohorts include 1) lack of paired long-term
      mother-child data, 2) lack of uniformly collected biosamples and 3) challenges in integrating
      data from multiple sources and institutions. In particular, data and biosample collection
      from rural and minority populations present significant challenges. The objective of the
      iELEVATE proposal is to expand and diversify a current biobank to accelerate long-term
      translational mechanistic and outcomes research in the vulnerable pregnancy population. We
      will accomplish this by establishing a widely available biorepository that will collect a
      first trimester blood and urine sample from pregnant women with a clinical data warehouse and
      e-registry to support long-term prospective cohort studies.
