      This study was a multicenter, prospective, randomized controlled clinical trial. A set of
      unified standards were used, including the clinical research program, inclusion criteria,
      exclusion criteria, chemoradiotherapy regimen and evaluation criteria. A total of 73 patients
      with pathologically confirmed locoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma would be
      enrolled. Patients were randomly divided into two groups, with 48 patients in the combination
      group and 25 patients in the control group. The combination group was treated with Induction
      and Concurrent Chemoradiotherapy combined with Endostar. The control group was treated with
      Induction and Concurrent Chemoradiotherapy. The short term efficacy and side effects of these
      treatments would be evaluated. The 1-year, 3-year progression-free survival and overall
      survival would be analyzed. This data of this study might provide an alternative option for
      the treatment of Locoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma with higher efficacy and
      low toxicity.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Pathologically or clinically confirmed locally recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinoma;

          2. No chemotherapy, immunotherapy, radiotherapy treatment history.
