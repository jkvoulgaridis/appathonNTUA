  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In literature, superior mesenteric artery (SMA) angle, also named as aortomesenteric angle
      (AMA), varies greatly in both adult and children; while the aortomesenteric distance also
      ranges widely. Both AMA and AMD are influenced by retroperitoneal fat. Decrease of AMA and
      AMD may lead to the superior mesenteric artery syndrome(SMAS), which is a rare medical
      condition mainly presenting with duodenum obstruction. To our knowledge, normal range of AMA
      and AMD in local young Chinese population remain unclear; on the other hand, there have only
      a few studies exploring the relationship between them. This project proposes to establish the
      normal range of AMA and AMD in local young Chinese population, and to further investigate how
      the retroperitoneal adipose tissue correlates with AMA and AMD. The normal range obtained in
      this proposed study will provide more specific reference value to distinguish abnormal AMA
      and AMD, and to improve the diagnosis accuracy of SMAS in local population. Moreover, this
      study will provide deeper insight concerning the impact of retroperitoneal fat on AMA and
      AMD.

        The investigators will retrospectively recruit individuals from the local population who
        had undergone abdomen contrast CT scans within hospitals in the New Territories East
        Cluster (NTEC) of Hong Kong for both emergency and elective purposes in the year 2013-2019.
        Total sample will comprise two groups: (1) Non-SMAS Group (N=500); and (2) SMAS group
        (N=10).

          -  With abdomen contrast CT.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any patients with diagnosis of SMAS will be excluded from the Non-SMAS group.

          -  Patients who had undergone more than one CT scan during the research period.

          -  Previous retroperitoneal, abdominal surgery.

          -  Conditions causing significant weight loss, e.g. anorexia nervosa, malabsorption.

          -  Presence of abdominal masses or pathology that will affect the anatomy of aorta-
             superior mesenteric artery and the retroperitoneal structures.

          -  Presence of severe scoliosis and/or history of spinal fixation that may increase
             incidence of SMA syndrome.

          -  Presence of free intraperitoneal or retroperitoneal fluid that may affect fat
             measurement, e.g. following trauma, or ascites.
