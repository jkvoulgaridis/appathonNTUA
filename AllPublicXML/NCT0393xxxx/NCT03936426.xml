  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to investigate the safety and tolerability of a single
      dose of Cu-64 SARTATE and multiple doses of Cu-67 SARTATE administered to participants with
      meningioma. All participants in this study will be injected with a single dose of Cu-64
      SARTATE to demonstrate how it is absorbed in the body. Then participants will receive
      individualised doses of Cu-67 SARTATE for up to 4 cycles.

      This is a single centre, open label, non-randomised, single cohort, multiple dose study of
      Cu-67 SARTATE administered to male and female participants diagnosed with grade I, II, or III
      meningioma. The maximum allowable dose will be calculated using dosimetry data acquired from
      PET/CT scans completed during a pre-treatment diagnostic &amp; dosimetry phase using Cu-64
      SARTATE, a structurally identical molecule radiolabelled with copper-64 (Cu-64), instead of
      copper-67 (Cu-67). Approximately 6 participants will be enrolled in the study. Participants
      will have up to 4 therapy cycles (6-12 weeks apart). Safety visits will occur between each
      cycle at bi-weekly intervals to ensure the participant meets the safety criteria prior to
      their next therapy. An efficacy assessment will be conducted following cycle 2 to determine
      if a subsequent 2 cycles of therapy will be administered. Participants who complete all four
      cycles of Cu-67 SARTATE therapy, will complete their final study visit at 12 weeks post
      administration of cycle 4.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Signed informed consent.

          2. Age greater than or equal to 50 years.

          3. Life expectancy greater than or equal to 3 months.

          4. Has adequate organ function as defined by the following laboratory values obtained
             within 28 days prior to administration of Cu-64 SARTATE:

               1. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) greater than 40ml/min as measured
                  using Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equation.

               2. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) less than 3.0
                  x upper limit of normal (ULN).

               3. QT interval less than /=450msec as measured by 12 lead ECG.

          5. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance score of less than or equal to
             2.

          6. Diagnosis of recurrent or progressive histologically confirmed WHO grade I-III
             meningioma which has failed standard of care therapies. Patients will be considered to
             have failed standard care when they have disease that is progressing despite standard
             treatment (primarily radiotherapy) or where, in the opinion of their treating
             physician, further standard therapy is considered to be of sufficiently high risk of
             complication as to warrant consideration of alternate therapies.

          7. Male participants must agree to use contraception methods from Day 0 through to 4
             weeks after the last dose of Cu-67 SARTATE.

          8. A female participant is eligible to participate if she is of:

               1. Non-childbearing potential defined as pre-menopausal females with a documented
                  tubal ligation or hysterectomy; or postmenopausal defined as 12 months of
                  spontaneous amenorrhea [in questionable cases a blood sample with simultaneous
                  follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) greater than 40 MlU/ml and oestradiol less
                  than 40 pg/ml (less than 140 pmol/l) is confirmatory].

               2. Child-bearing potential and agrees to use contraception methods for an
                  appropriate period of time (as determined by the Investigator) prior to Day 0 to
                  sufficiently minimize the risk of pregnant females being enrolled. These measures
                  are the combination of a barrier method AND established (greater than 2 cycles)
                  hormonal methods (e.g. the oral contraceptive pill). Absolute sexual abstinence
                  may be considered acceptable at the discretion of the investigator. Abstinence
                  for the 12 days prior to therapy to allow for serum B-hCG assessment which should
                  then ensure the patient is not pregnant prior to therapy administration.

               3. Female participants must agree to use contraception until four weeks after the
                  last dose of Cu-67 SARTATE.

             the four weeks prior to Day 0.

          3. Any major surgery within the four weeks prior to Day 0.

          4. Any additional planned interventions, including surgery or radiation therapy that
             would interfere with safety or efficacy assessments.

          5. Treatment with long acting somatostatin analogues within 28 days prior to Day 0.
             Treatment with short acting somatostatin analogues within 24 hours prior to Day 0.

          6. Any other malignancy in the past 5 years except for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia
             (CIN) of the cervix, squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the skin, basal cell carcinoma
             (BCC) of the skin or clinical insignificant prostate cancer not requiring prior
             therapy.

          7. Breastfeeding females and pregnant females.

          8. Treatment with any investigational agent received within four weeks prior to Day 0.

          9. Participants unwilling or unable to comply with protocol requirements.

         10. Urinary or faecal incontinence of sufficient degree to be of concern for contamination
             risk in the opinion of the Investigator.

         11. Peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) at any time prior to enrolment in the
             study.
