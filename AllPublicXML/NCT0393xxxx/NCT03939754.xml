      Health Authority (ASL) and the municipality of Vercelli and the University of Novara have
      realized the Dedalo project: a multicomponent community intervention. In Italy, few are the
      study evaluating the effectiveness of the multicomponent community intervention. Thus, aim of

      BACKGROUND. The reduction of the non-transmissible diseases (NCDs) is a priority for the
      health community and for the economical sustainability of the healthcare system. In fact, the
      NCDs are the main global cause of death. It is demonstrated that many NCDs are lifestyle
      related; notable, even small lifestyle changes bring a health outcome improvement. The
      Italian epidemiological survey PASSI (2013-2016) reveals that the 33% of the population aged
      50-69 years old living in Vercelli is self-declared sedentary and the 45% is
      overweight/obese. The Dedalo project, started in March 2018, is finalized to promote
      evidence-based healthy behaviors in the Vercelli adult population. In Italy the studies of
      community multicomponent prevention interventions are few. In this regard, the aim of the
      study is to evaluate the Dedalo project efficacy in the promotion of lifestyle changes.

      MATERIALS AND METHODS. The study is a prospective observational one. The socio-economical and
      behaviors information are detected through an ad hoc questionnaire. The questionnaire is
      telephone-administered to the population who attended Dedalo activities and to an adult
      general population sample (40-75 years old) living in Vercelli. The same questionnaire will
      be administered 12 months later the first interview.

      EXPECTED RESULTS. In April 2018 the socio-economics and behaviors description of both the
      studied population will be available. The fist evaluation of behavioral change will be
      concluded in April 2019.

      CONCLUSIONS. The study will allow to define the efficacy of the community prevention
      intervention Dedalo is behavioral changes promotion, its capability in involving all the
      target population promoting equality in health and to improve the community prevention
      interventions.
