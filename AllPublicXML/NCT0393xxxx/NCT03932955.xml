  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center, single arm, open-lable phase 1 study to determine the safety and
      efficacy of CD19-CAR-T cells in patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell lymphoma.

    <textblock>
      In this single-center, open-label, nonrandomized, no control, prospective clinical trial,
      appoximately 15 relapsed or refractory B-cell lymphoma patients will be enrolled. Side
      effects of CD19 CAR T cells therapy will be monitored. The purpose of current study is to
      determine the clinical efficacy and safety of CD19 CAR T cells therapy in patients with R/R
      B-cell lymphoma
