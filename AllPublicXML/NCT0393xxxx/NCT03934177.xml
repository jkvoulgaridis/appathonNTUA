  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the impact of blueberry consumption on markers of gastrointestinal
      health including gut microbiota, intestinal permeability, and gut-derived inflammation in
      those vulnerable to a unhealthy gut milieu. All participants will consume a blueberry powder
      and a placebo in this crossover study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The commensal bacteria that reside in the human gut, known as the gut microbiota, is a
      complex system that modulates local gut homeostasis and systemic biological processes.
      Several environmental factors have been shown to influence the gut milieu (including
      microbiota), and thus both gastrointestinal and host health. Relevant to the current proposal
      is the influence of body weight, diet, and circadian rhythms. In the current study, the
      investigators propose to use these common disruptors of gastrointestinal health through
      recruiting obese shift workers with a low-fiber diet to identify if these disrupted
      individuals can benefit from blueberry intake. Specifically, the study objectives are to
      determine if 21 g whole blueberry powder consumed daily can beneficially modify intestinal
      permeability, gut microbiota, microbial metabolites, and both gut-derived and systemic
      inflammation in those most susceptible to a pro-inflammatory milieu. This will be
      accomplished through a 14-week crossover study in which 28 individuals will be randomized by
      treatment group order to 4 weeks of whole blueberry powder and placebo powder, with a 4-week
      wash out in between the treatment periods.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  obese (BMI +/- 30.0 kg/m2)

          -  shift workers (shift work overnight (third shift) +/= 3 days/week for the past 3
             months)

          -  19-70 years of age

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  patient history of gastrointestinal diseases except for hiatal hernia, GERD, or
             hemorrhoids, mild gastrointestinal symptoms

          -  elevated laboratory values from a comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP) and complete

             with HA1c of greater than or equal to 6.5%) and ALT, AST, or ALP over 2 times normal
             levels (to allow for mild elevations resulting from fatty liver often seen in obese)
             unless approved by study physician

             (+/= 14 g/1000 kilocalories) to increase study result generalizability to the U.S.
             population (low-fiber diet), as well as provide another stimuli for gut leakiness

          -  unwillingness to consent to the study.
