      Jitongning Tablet is a kind of traditional Chinese medicine(TCM), consists of Cortex
      Eucommiae, Duhuo(Radix Angelicae Pubescentis), Zhichuanwu(Radix Aconiti) , Rhizoma Corydalis,
      Radix Paeoniae Rubra, Radix Puerariae and Radix Glycyrrhizae. This study is being conducted
      to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Jitongning Tablet in patients with active axial
      spondyloarthritis (SpA) (Syndrome Of Kidney Yang Deficiency and Biood Stasis Stagnation),
      when compared with placebo and to explore the optimal dosage.

    <time_frame>4 weeks,8weeks,12weeks</time_frame>
    <description>the score changes of Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) at each visit compared to baseline.
This instrument consists of six 10cm horizontal visual analog scales to measure severity of fatigue, spinal and peripheral joint pain, localized tenderness and morning stiffness (both qualitative and quantitative). The final BASDAI score has a range of 0 to 10. The mean of which gives the BASDAI score (0-10). The severity of patient's symptoms from 0 (none) to 10 (most severe).</description>

    <measure>BASFI</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks,8weeks,12weeks</time_frame>
    <description>the score changes of Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index (BASFI) at each visit compared to baseline.
This instrument consists of 8 specific questions regarding function in AS and 2 questions reflecting the patient's ability to cope with everyday life. Each question is answered on a 10 cm horizontal visual analog scale, the mean of which gives the BASFI score (0-10). The severity of patient's symptoms from 0 (none) to 10 (most severe).</description>

    <measure>Spinal pain</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks,8weeks,12weeks</time_frame>
    <description>the score changes of Spinal pain at each visit compared to baseline. Spinal pain was scored as the average of two VAS questions about total spinal pain and nocturnal spinal pain. The mean of which gives the spinal pain score (0-10). The severity of patient's symptoms from 0 (none) to 10 (most severe).</description>

    <measure>PGA</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks,8weeks,12weeks</time_frame>
    <description>the score changes of PGA at each visit compared to baseline. Patient global assessment was measured using a set of visual analogue scales (VAS) on which patients rated the severity of their disease from 0 (none) to 10 (most severe).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>TCM syndrome scores</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks,8weeks,12weeks</time_frame>
    <description>the score changes of TCM syndrome scores at each visit compared to baseline. This instrument consists of three primary symptoms: spinal pain, spinal function limited, morning stiffness and six secondary symptoms: nocturnal back pain、stabbing pain、Local cold pain、aversion to cold,preference for heat、heel pain、weakness in the lower back and knees. Four levels to measure severity of primary symptoms（0、2、4、6）and secondary symptoms（0、1、2、3）, respectively. Record the tongue and pulse conditions. The final score has a range of 0 to 100. The severity of patient's symptoms from 0 (none) to 100(most severe).The TCM syndrome effect calculated by nimodipine method. The effect of TCM syndrome from negative (worsen) to 100% (disappear).</description>

    <measure>Exposure of ibuprofen sustained release capsules</measure>
    <time_frame>12weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Exposure of ibuprofen sustained release capsules in test group and placebo at 12th weeks.
Exposure of ibuprofen sustained release capsules refers to the quantity of ibuprofen capsules patient actually took. The difference between the total dispensed quantity and the sum of recycling quantity and missing quantity gives the exposure of ibuprofen sustained release capsules. The exposure of ibuprofen sustained release capsules from 0 (none) to 372 (maximum).</description>
