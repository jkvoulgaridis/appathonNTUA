    <textblock>
      The SUMMIT Study will enrol 50,000 participants in order to investigate how cancer screening
      can be improved and delivered. The SUMMIT Study has two main aims: the first is to clinically
      validate a blood test for detecting multiple cancers at an early stage. The second is to
      examine the feasibility of delivering a low-dose CT (LDCT) screening service for lung cancer
      to a high-risk population in north and east London.

      The SUMMIT Study is a prospective, observational, cohort study. Its aim is to clinically
      validate a blood test for the early detection of multiple types of cancer, and to deliver
      LDCT screening for lung cancer to an at-risk population.

      SUMMIT plans to enrol 50,000 participants aged 50 - 77 years, from participating general
      practitioner (GP) practices in north and east London. Half of the participants will be people
      who are at high-risk for lung cancer due to a significant smoking history based on validated
      risk scores (Group A). The other half will be people who are not at high-risk for
      smoking-related cancers (Group B).

      Group A: Individuals with significant smoking histories will be offered a clinical Lung
      Health Check (LHC), which includes a brief respiratory consultation including questions about
      respiratory symptoms and medical history, smoking cessation advice and referral where
      required, and certain relevant clinical measurements (blood pressure, spirometry, height, and
      weight). Those persons who are eligible for participation based on specific validated risk
      scores may then be offered participation in the SUMMIT Study. Electronic informed consent
      will be obtained if they decide to take part. Consented participants will provide a blood
      sample, complete a confidential electronic questionnaire and have an LDCT scan at the same
      visit. Participants will be asked to return for two further annual visits.

      Group B: Individuals who do not have a significant smoking history will be invited to attend
      an appointment where they will be provided with information about the study and their
      eligibility for participation will be assessed. If they consent to take part in the study
      (electronic informed consent), they will provide a blood sample and complete a confidential
      electronic questionnaire. Participants will be asked to return for two further annual visits
      to provide a blood sample and complete a confidential questionnaire.

      There will be one randomisation round carried out during this study. All participants with a
      negative LDCT at the baseline visit who have not been diagnosed with lung cancer since that
      visit will return for an LHC at approximately 12 months. At the 12-month visit, this group
      will be randomised either to have an LDCT or no LDCT.
