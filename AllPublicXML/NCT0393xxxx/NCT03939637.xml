  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an investigator initiated, multicenter, open label, randomized phase 3 study for
      subjects with newly diagnosed ITP from ages 1 to less than 18 years old.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, open label, randomized, two-arm, multi-center Phase 3 trial.

      Patients with newly diagnosed ITP are randomized 2:1 to receive the experimental treatment,
      eltrombopag, or investigator's choice of 3 standard therapies. The primary objective is to
      determine if the proportion of patients with platelet response is significantly greater in
      patients treated with eltrombopag compared to those treated with standard therapies.

Standard therapy will be administered as commercially available drug.
Investigator may choose amongst the following:
IVIg: IVIG 1 g/kg x1 (no steroids for pre-medication or adjunctive therapy)
Steroids: Prednisone/Prednisolone 4 mg/kg/day (Max 120 mg/day) x 4 days

Children 1 to 5 years: Initial: 25 mg once daily
Children ≥6 years and Adolescents: Initial: 50 mg once daily (25 mg once daily for patients of East-Asian ethnicity [e.g., Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Taiwanese])

             (if sexually active) or maintain abstinence for the duration of the study. Basic
             contraception methods include:

               -  Total abstinence (when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of
                  the subject. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal,
                  post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of
                  contraception

               -  Female sterilization (have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without
                  hysterectomy), total hysterectomy, or tubal ligation at least six weeks before
                  taking study treatment. In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive
                  status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment

               -  Male sterilization (at least 6 months prior to screening). The vasectomized male
                  partner should be the sole partner for that subject

               -  Barrier methods of contraception: Condom or Occlusive cap. For the UK: with
                  spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/ vaginal suppository

               -  Use of oral, injected or implanted hormonal methods of contraception or placement
                  of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS), or other forms of
                  hormonal contraception that have comparable efficacy (failure rate &lt;1%), for
                  example hormone vaginal ring or transdermal hormone contraception. In case of use
                  of oral contraception women should have been stable on the same pill for a
                  minimum of 3 months before taking study treatment.

          -  Male patients who are sexually active and do not agree to abstinence or to use a
             condom during intercourse while taking eltrombopag, and for 7 days after stopping
             treatment.

          -  History of alcohol/drug abuse

          -  Presence of a medical condition that in the opinion of the Investigator would
             compromise the safety of the patient or the quality of the data.

          -  Concurrent participation in an investigational study within 30 days prior to
             enrollment or within 5-half-lives of the investigational product, whichever is longer.
             Note: parallel enrollment in a non-therapeutic trial such as disease registry or
             biology study is permitted.

        Other Eligibility Criteria Considerations All patients and/or their parents or legal
        guardians must sign a written informed consent (and assent when applicable)

          -  Patients and/or parents who are unable to read English at a grade 2 level will be
             excluded from the patient-reported outcome component of the study. They will not be
             excluded from all other aspects of the study
