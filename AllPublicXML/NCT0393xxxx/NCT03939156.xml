      Preference studies reveal how individuals trade-off the potential benefits, harms and
      inconveniences of a treatment by determining the minimum benefits they judge sufficient to
      make the treatment worthwhile.

      They are especially relevant to adjuvant therapies where individuals must weigh up modest
      survival benefits only realized in time by no recurrence of their cancer with side effects
      predominantly experienced whilst on the treatment.

      Previously it was reported, for example, that over 50% of women who had adjuvant chemotherapy
      for early breast cancer judged a 1% improvement in 5 year survival rates sufficient to make
      it worthwhile.

      Larger survival benefits were required for longer duration adjuvant hormonal therapy where
      over 50% of women required at least 5% improvement in 5 year survival rates to make it
      worthwhile.

      The endocrine therapy is generally proposed to all patients with endocrine positive early
      breast cancer to reduce the risk of recurrence and death. Moreover several data support that
      the prolongation of hormonal therapy (i.e. 10 years of hormonal treatment) is associated with
      statistical improved outcome.

      In order to achieve the benefit related to hormonal therapy all women have to be treated
      despite the fact that the data and analyses are unable to differentiate as to whether a small
      prolongation in survival accrues to all women treated or a few patients survive who would
      otherwise have died. Moreover the hormonal therapy is associated with side effects that may
      impact the quality of life of the patients.

      Patients are more likely to accept treatment on the basis of presented relative rather than
      absolute risks and so the question arises as to whether unrealistic improvements in outcome
      are expected by patients.

      The interviews with patients in the proposed trial will elicit the expected gains both in
      terms of survival and life years and will be able to assess the proportion of patients who
      considered an improvement of realistic size was sufficient to justify the treatment and the
      prolongation of the treatment.

      Several studies showed that choices are guided by the personal attitude to react and adapt to
      traumatic events, individual resilience.

      It is important therefore to consider also the influence of these factors on the patients'
      treatment preferences.

      For this reason, besides the elicitation of preferences, resilience and reaction to traumatic
      events will be assessed thorough validated questionnaires.
