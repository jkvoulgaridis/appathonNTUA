  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      QPX2015 (beta-lactam antibiotic) is being studied at higher than approved doses to combine
      with a new beta-lactamase inhibitor to treat bacterial infections, including those due to
      multi-drug resistant bacteria.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The worldwide spread of resistance to antibiotics among gram-negative bacteria, particularly
      members of the ESKAPE group of pathogens, has resulted in a crisis in the treatment of both
      hospital acquired and community acquired infections. In particular, the increase in
      Enterobacteriaceae expressing extended spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) and carbapenemases
      that are resistant to all oral beta-lactams and fluoroquinolones in the community have
      resulted in many patients requiring admission just for IV antibiotics to treat their
      infections.

      Qpex Biopharma is developing a fixed combination antibiotic of QPX2015 (beta-lactam
      antibiotic) plus a new beta-lactamase inhibitor.

             age (inclusive).

          2. Body mass index (BMI) ≥ 18.5 and ≤ 29.9 (kg/m2) and weight between 55.0 and 100.0 kg
             (inclusive).

          3. Medically healthy with clinically insignificant screening results (e.g., laboratory
