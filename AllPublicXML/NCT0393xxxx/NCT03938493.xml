  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endotracheal tube is a commonly used for general anesthesia in head and neck surgery. It is
      necessary to place the endotracheal tube in the trachea of the patient and then inflate the
      cuff with air. This is because the air-inflated cuff contacts the inner wall of the patient's
      trachea to deliver oxygen through the tube. If the cuff does not inflate, oxygen will leak
      through the space between the cuff and the patient's trachea. In addition, the risk of
      pneumonia increases. Therefore, after placing the endotracheal tube in the patient's trachea,
      the cuff is immediately inflated with air. However, when the cuff is inflated using an excess
      of air, the cuff may pressurize the mucous membrane of the tracheal wall and cause ischemia.
      Pressure in the over-inflated cuff was also found to be associated with post-operative sore
      throat, vocal cord paralysis, and nerve damage. Therefore, appropriate amount of air should
      be used to inflate the cuff into the air and adjust the pressure within the cuff to be within
      the range of 20-30 cmH2O. The authors thought that the pressure in the cuff could be changed
      during the operation due to various factors and that the pressure in the cuff should be
      monitored continuously. In this study, the investigators will monitor the cuff pressure
      during anesthesia and analyze the factors affecting the cuff pressure.
