      This study evaluates the effect of auricular neurostimulation on mitochondrial bioenergetics
      and inflammation through vagal nerve modulation via non-invasive percutaneous electrical
      nerve field stimulator in children with functional gastrointestinal disorders.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In understanding the pathophysiology of pediatric functional gastrointestinal disorders
      (FGID), it has been documented that subjects have decreased vagal tone. Vagal tone in turn
      modulates mitochondrial bioenergetics and plays a role in anti inflammatory effects. Further
      defining these brain-body connections that underlie FGID's could help guide future treatment.

      The investigators postulate that a 4 week neuro-stimulation with an Electro Auricular Device
      that has already shown to increase vagal tone will produce an increase in mitochondrial
      bioenergetics and decrease in inflammatory markers in this patient group.

    <description>The Functional Disability Inventory (FDI) questionnaire will be used to assess change in symptoms. Participants will rank physical trouble or difficulty completing 15 different daily activities (Eating regular meals, Being at school all day, Walking up stairs, etc.) on a scale of 0-4 (No trouble - Impossible). Higher scores indicate more difficulty functioning due to physical health.</description>
