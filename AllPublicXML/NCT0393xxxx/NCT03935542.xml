  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was performed to investigate the anatomical attributes that determine myocardial
      territory of diagonal branches and to develop a prediction model for clinically relevant
      branches using myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) and coronary CT angiography (CCTA).

    <textblock>
      Bifurcation lesion is one of the most challenging lesion subsets in the field of percutaneous
      coronary intervention (PCI). Despite the recent advances in PCI techniques and stent
      technology, most randomized studies failed to prove the superiority of systematic 2 stenting
      strategy compared with provisional side branch intervention strategy.

      A certain amount of ischemic burden is required to achieve the benefit of revascularization
      over medical treatment. Compared with major epicardial vessels, side branches are smaller,
      more variable in anatomy, supplying less myocardium and less clinically relevant. Therefore,
      it is important to assess the myocardial mass at risk of side branches to determine the
      appropriate treatment strategy for bifurcation lesions. However, how to define the clinically
      relevant side branches which can be associated with the benefit of revascularization in a
      cardiac catheterization laboratory is not well-known.

      The investigators performed this study to investigate the anatomical attributes that
      determine ischemic burden and myocardial territory of diagonal branches and to develop a
      prediction model for a clinically relevant diagonal branch using myocardial perfusion imaging
      (MPI) and coronary CT angiography (CCTA).

    <time_frame>through study completion, an average of 1year</time_frame>
    <description>Angiographic attributes for diagonal branches were visually defined as follows :
Size was a binary attribute of vessel diameter â‰¥ 2.5mm or &lt; 2.5mm.
Number was counted as one, two, and 3 or more diagonal branches.
Dominancy in patients with 2 diagonal branches (D1/2 dominancy) was a binary attribute for one of two diagonal branches whose diameter was more than two times larger than its smaller counterpart.
LCx dominancy was defined as a left-dominant system or a presence of obtuse marginal branch originating within proximal 1/3 of LCx and crossing LAD at right anterior oblique caudal view.</description>

    <description>Myocardium of perfusion image was divided into 20 segments, and summed rest score (SRS), summed stress score (SSS), and summed difference score (SDS) were scored in each segment according to a 5-grade system (0-4) for the assessment of perfusion status. (1) SSS and SDS of diagonal segments were converted to percent of myocardial ischemia (%ischemia) of diagonal territory by dividing summed scores by 80 and multiplying by 100.</description>
