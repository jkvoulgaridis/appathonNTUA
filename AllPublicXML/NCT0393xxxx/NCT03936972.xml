  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tibial shaft fracture is a common injury worldwide. Their treatment, prognosis, and outcome
      are determined by the mechanism of injury, presence of communition, soft tissue injury and
      displacement. In developing countries, lack of education,socioeconomic backgrounds, delay in
      presentation and appropriate planning for surgery add further to complicate the situation and
      may end in delayed union, non-union, multiple surgeries and ultimate results in increased
      morbidity. This study was conducted to determine the outcome of open tibia shaft fracture
      treated with Ilizarov or AO External Fixator.

      Tibial shaft fracture is a common injury worldwide. Their treatment, prognosis, and outcome
      are determined by the mechanism of injury, presence of communition, soft tissue injury and
      displacement. In developing countries, lack of education,socioeconomic backgrounds, delay in
      presentation and appropriate planning for surgery add further to complicate the situation and
      may end in delayed union, non-union, multiple surgeries and ultimate results in increased
      morbidity. This study was conducted to determine the outcome of open tibia shaft fracture
      treated with Ilizarov or AO External Fixator. It was retrospective Cohort study. Two groups
      were compared in terms of fracture healing, mechanism of injury, fracture classification,
      Participant's ambulation at discharge, New Injury Severity Score (NISS), duration of hospital
      stay, duration of fracture union, need for secondary procedures and complications.
      Investigators concluded that circular fixator application has favorable outcomes for Gustilo
      grade III open tibial shaft fractures as compared to uniplanar external fixator.
