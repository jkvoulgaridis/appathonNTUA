  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is investigating the efficacy of PD-L1(IO103) and PD-L2(IO120) peptides in
      untreated CLL patients with unmutated IGHV gene status.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is an incurable disease with the unmutated immunoglobulin
      heavy chain variable region (IGHV) gene status being an unfavorable prognostic marker. These
      patients have shorter time to first treatment which consist of toxic chemotherapy.

      Programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) and programmed death ligand 2 (PD-L2) are immune
      checkpoints hampering immune responses in many tumors including CLL. These proteins are
      expressed by suppressive bystander cells as well as CLL cells. Vaccinating subcutaneously
      with PD-L1 and PD-L2 peptides mobilises cytoxic T-cells specific towards PD-L1 and PD-L2
      expressing cells. In this study we investigate if the PD-L1 and PD-L2 specific responses can
      overcome leukemic cells in CLL.
