  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stress reactions caused by surgical stimuli can cause sympathetic nervous system activation
      and increased stress hormones, such as catecholamines, inflammatory cytokines, and pituitary
      hormones, and insulin resistance. In addition, increased catecholamine levels may exacerbate
      postoperative outcomes, especially delayed wound recovery, increased cardiovascular and
      respiratory complications, and immunosuppression. In particular, it is important to reduce
      the stress response for cancer patients during surgery because they are already
      immunocompromised status and more vulnerable to perioperative stressful situation. However,
      there are insufficient results on the benefits of deep neuromuscular block in these patients,
      although some have reported a reduction of postoperative pain and fewer complications in the
      deep neuromuscular block compared with moderate neuromuscular block. Therefore, the
      investigators aim to investigate the difference in the stress response of patients who
      received conventional moderate neuromuscular block or deep neuromuscular block in
      robot-assisted gastric cancer surgery.
