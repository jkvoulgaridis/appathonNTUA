  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Immunotherapy has become the major breakthrough and the most promising treatment, with the
      host of development of tumor biology, molecular biology and immunology. ROBO1 is a potential
      target and spectacular paradigm in the diagnosis and treatment of solid tumors. This study is
      for evaluation of the safety and efficacy of ROBO1 CAR-NK/T cell immunotherapy for malignant
      tumors.
