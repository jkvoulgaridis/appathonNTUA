    <textblock>
      Pyrotinib is an oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor targeting both HER1, HER2 and HER4 receptors.
      This study is a single-arm, prospective, open label clinical study of pyrotinib plus
      vinorelbine as the therapy of brain metastases from HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer.
