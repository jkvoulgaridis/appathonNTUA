    <textblock>
      Background and study aims Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common type of arthritis, which
      most often affects the knee. It occurs when the protective cartilage on the end of bones
      wears away. The bones then rub against one another, which can cause stiffness, pain and a
      reduction in a person's range of movement. A knee joint replacement is a common procedure
      where the weight bearing surfaces of the knee joint are replaced with metal and plastic
      components to relieve the pain and disability brought on by OA. Tranexamic Acid（TXA） is a
      traditional method to reduce blood loss, pain score and complications. It is not known
      however, what is the best method of TXA for the patients with TKA. The aim of this study is
      to find out whetherVisual Field Infiltration of Tranexamic Acid Reduced the Blood Loss in
      patients who have had knee replacement surgery.

      Who can participate? Adults who have OA and need a total knee replacement. What does the
      study involve? Participants are randomly allocated to one of three groups. For the
      interventions field, could you please provide a brief methodology for each of your treatment
      arms, and the total duration of treatment and follow-up? Group A: Visual Field Infiltration
      of Tranexamic Acid during the operation of total knee replacement. Group B: No Visual Field
      Infiltration of Tranexamic Acid during the operation of total knee replacement.

      The blood loss, VAS pain scores, length of their hospital stay, swelling and bleeding, and
      range of motion of the affected knee are assessed in the days following surgery.

      What are the possible benefits and risks of participating? Participants who are allocated to
      receive treatment with Visual Field Infiltration of Tranexamic Acid may benefit from a
      reduction in blood loss, pain, swelling and blood loss after surgery, shortening their
      hospital stay.

      There is a small risk of discomfort, frostbite or deep vein thrombosis (a blood clot in a
      major vein in the leg) when using Visual Field Infiltration of Tranexamic Acid.
