  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      From birth to 5 months, milk is the essential and unique food of the newborn. The French
      National Nutrition Program (PNNS) recommends exclusive breastfeeding &quot;up to 6 months and at
      least 4 months for a healthy benefit&quot;. However, only 36% of infants 0-6 months of age are
      exclusively breastfed worldwide. Some mothers choose to give infant formula to their baby in
      the first few months of life. This decision may be a personal choice or be imposed by
      pathophysiological situations.

      The nutritional requirements of the infant are specific, which implies adequate nutrition.
      Infant formulas and follow-up formulas are therefore complex products, specially developed
      for a group of vulnerable consumers. In fact, the compositional and information requirements
      for infant formula are highly regulated.

      This study, defined as a pilot study, proposes to evaluate the innovative &quot;TrueGreen&quot; BIO
      infant formula based on a new whey extraction method on the growth and tolerance of infants
      from 0 to 6 months compared to the conventional BIO infant formula. As no growth and
      tolerance data are currently available for this new TrueGreen BIO formula, this study aims to
      determine them.

According to the bristol scale, seven types of stool are considered:
Type 1: Separate hard lumps, like nuts (hard to pass) Type 2: Sausage-shaped, but lumpy Type 3: Like a sausage but with cracks on its surface Type 4: Like a sausage or snake, smooth and soft Type 5: Soft blobs with clear cut edges (easy to pass) Type 6: Fluffy pieces with ragged edges, a mushy stool Type 7: Watery, no solid pieces, entirely liquid
The mean of stool type during 3 days is considered.</description>
