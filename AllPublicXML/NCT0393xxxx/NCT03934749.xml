  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In COPD patients with chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure, the prognosis is poor and the
      treatment with non invasive ventilation is actually well established. However the best mode
      of ventilation is not well known.

      In severe COPD patients various disorders of respiratory mechanics result in insufficient
      ventilation, which can be life-threatening or create NIV discomfort. The main characteristic
      of these disorders is a cyclical closing of small airways that can limit an expiratory flow
      and provoked some fluctuations in flow curve. To our knowledge, the management of dynamic
      hyperinflation seems to play an important role in explaining the effect of the NIV. Few
      studies have examined the effects of the machine's adjustments on dynamic hyperinflation.

      The main objective of this study is to analyze the impact of specific ventilatory modes
      supposed to reduce the dynamic hyperinflation on the hematosis, by studying transcutaneous
      pressure of carbon dioxide, in severe hypercapnic COPD patients ventilated by NIV. Two modes
      of ventilation will be compared. First one is an algorithmic mode developed by the company
      Löwenstein (AirTrap Control, Trigger Lockout and the Expiratory Pressure Ramp). The second
      one is a standard algorithmic mode, used in the same ventilator. These two ventilatory modes
      will be evaluated in each patient, during two consecutive nights in current living conditions
      at home.
