  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this project is to assess the effects of four weeks of mirror-box training on
      weakness of one arm secondary to stroke. Primary measures are function and strength.
      Secondary measures will evaluate muscle tone, flexibility, and the subject's perception of
      their everyday function and improvement. Research Hypothesis: For chronic upper limb
      hemiparesis secondary to stroke, four weeks of mirror-box training with movement of the
      unaffected limb only results in a mean increase of 10 points on the Fugl-Meyer Test of Motor
      Recovery (Upper Extremity).

      Due to the relatively new nature of mirror training, there are few randomized controlled
      studies. This pilot case series will serve as our initial step in trying to identify the
      frequency, duration, and treatment exercises needed in this population. Additionally, this
      pilot will allow us to ensure our outcome measures are appropriate to detect meaningful
      treatment changes. After obtaining informed consent, patients will undergo two separate
      baseline assessments of strength, function, and tone 4 weeks apart. Training sessions will
      consist of supervised activities using the unaffected arm while observing its mirror
      reflection; the affected arm will remain still. Sessions will be one hour a day, five days a
      week, for four weeks. Patients will be tested for strength, function and tone in the affected
      arm at completion of the four week treatment period by the same occupational therapist that
      performed the pretests.

    <time_frame>preintervention and post intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The Fugl-Meyer Assessment of Motor Function After Stroke, a widely used scale of motor recovery after stroke. The subscale upper extremity motor function was used. This test requires progressively more complex movements and hand grasps and measure speed and coordination. Each item is graded on a 3-point ordinal scale (0=cannot perform; 1=partially performs; 2=performs fully) with a minimum score of 0 and a maximum score of 66 for the upper extremity. Higher scores indicate better outcome.</description>

    <time_frame>preintervention and post intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The Arm Motor Ability Test evaluates disabilities in upper extremity function in activities of daily living using a quantitative and qualitative measure. The Functional Ability Scale and the Quality of Movement Scale are rated on an ordinal scale from 0-5. The score for the Functional Ability Scale ranges from 0 to 140. The score for the Quality of Movement Scale ranges from 0 to 140. Higher scores on the Functional Ability and Quality Scale of the Arm Motor Ability Test indicate more normal movement and a better outcome.</description>

    <description>The time in seconds to complete 28 tasks is recorded. The tasks are: 1 pick up utensils, 2 cut meat, 3 fork to mouth, 4 pick up sandwich, 5 sandwich to mouth, 6 pick up spoon, 7 bean in spoon, 8 spoon to mouth, 9 grasp mug handle, 10 mug to mouth, 11pick up comb, 12 comb hair, 13 grasp jar top, 14 open jar, 15 tie lace, 16 phone to ear, 17 press phone number, 18 wipe up water, 19 throw away towel, 20 paretic arm in sleeve, 21 button two buttons, 22 arms in T-shirt, 23 shirt over head, 24 straighten shirt, 25 prop on extended arm, 26 turn on light, 27 open door, 28 close door. The total time in seconds to complete all 28 tasks is recorded - as a total summary score. There is no minimum value. There is no maximum value. Lower scores (e.g., less time to complete the 28 tasks) indicate faster performance and better outcome.</description>

    <description>Training will be performed one-on-one by an investigator in a quiet room, one hour a day, five days a week, for four weeks. The mirror-box apparatus consists of an 18&quot; x 24&quot; vertical mirror secured in the center of a wooden platform. During training, the mirror-box will be placed on a table in front of the subject so that the mirror is perpendicular to the chest, slightly lateral of midline. Subjects will be asked to attend to the mirror reflection of their unaffected hand performing a series of tasks, while keeping their affected limb still. At the end of the four week training period, posttests will be administered by the same therapist who performed the pretests.</description>

        <title>The Fugl-Meyer Assessment of Motor Function After Stroke</title>
        <description>The Fugl-Meyer Assessment of Motor Function After Stroke, a widely used scale of motor recovery after stroke. The subscale upper extremity motor function was used. This test requires progressively more complex movements and hand grasps and measure speed and coordination. Each item is graded on a 3-point ordinal scale (0=cannot perform; 1=partially performs; 2=performs fully) with a minimum score of 0 and a maximum score of 66 for the upper extremity. Higher scores indicate better outcome.</description>

        <description>The Arm Motor Ability Test evaluates disabilities in upper extremity function in activities of daily living using a quantitative and qualitative measure. The Functional Ability Scale and the Quality of Movement Scale are rated on an ordinal scale from 0-5. The score for the Functional Ability Scale ranges from 0 to 140. The score for the Quality of Movement Scale ranges from 0 to 140. Higher scores on the Functional Ability and Quality Scale of the Arm Motor Ability Test indicate more normal movement and a better outcome.</description>

        <title>Arm Motor Ability Test - Timed</title>
        <description>The time in seconds to complete 28 tasks is recorded. The tasks are: 1 pick up utensils, 2 cut meat, 3 fork to mouth, 4 pick up sandwich, 5 sandwich to mouth, 6 pick up spoon, 7 bean in spoon, 8 spoon to mouth, 9 grasp mug handle, 10 mug to mouth, 11pick up comb, 12 comb hair, 13 grasp jar top, 14 open jar, 15 tie lace, 16 phone to ear, 17 press phone number, 18 wipe up water, 19 throw away towel, 20 paretic arm in sleeve, 21 button two buttons, 22 arms in T-shirt, 23 shirt over head, 24 straighten shirt, 25 prop on extended arm, 26 turn on light, 27 open door, 28 close door. The total time in seconds to complete all 28 tasks is recorded - as a total summary score. There is no minimum value. There is no maximum value. Lower scores (e.g., less time to complete the 28 tasks) indicate faster performance and better outcome.</description>

            <description>Training will be performed one-on-one by an investigator in a quiet room, one hour a day, five days a week, for four weeks. The mirror-box apparatus consists of an 18” x 24” vertical mirror secured in the center of a wooden platform. During training, the mirror-box will be placed on a table in front of the subject so that the mirror is perpendicular to the chest, slightly lateral of midline. Subjects will be asked to attend to the mirror reflection of their unaffected hand performing a series of tasks, while keeping their affected limb still. At the end of the four week training period, posttests will be administered by the same therapist who performed the pretests.</description>
