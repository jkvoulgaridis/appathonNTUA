      Assess the effect of nepicastat in the treatment of in Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)
      in conflict or combat zone experienced veterans, in comparison to placebo.

      The primary treatment objective is to assess the global efficacy of nepicastat in the
      treatment of hyper-arousal in Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) in conflict or combat
      zone experienced veterans, in comparison to placebo. The secondary treatment objectives are
      to assess the ability of nepicastat to induce PTSD remission; treat PTSD and other PTSD
      symptom clusters and improve quality of life and overall functioning. A medical safety
      objective is to assess the tolerability and side effects of nepicastat in the treatment of
      PTSD in veterans who served in conflict zones at least one time between 1990 -2008 [includes
      Operation Iraqi Freedom/Operation Enduring Freedom (OIF/OEF), Afghanistan, Gulf War, etc .

      This is a 6-week study with the long-term objective is to define the best approach to
      treating PTSD and enhancing the quality of life in patients. Results from this pilot study
      will assist clinicians in treating active military service members or veterans with PTSD by
      developing new treatment algorithms for future larger studies.

    <description>Veterans will be receiving the study medication Nepicastat initiated with a 3-day loading phase of 40 mg on day 1, 80 mg on day 2 and 120 mg on day 3 (orally) and be continued at 120 mg once daily; During the 8 weeks (weeks: 7-14) extension phase, those from both treatment groups of the RCT phase will start open-label, active Nepicastat (i.e. no chance of placebo) treatment and be followed for an additional 8 weeks. Those who have a prior defined positive clinical response to the study medication, Nepicastat, will be continued on open label Nepicastat at 120mg once daily, in order to assess further improvement and safety; those who do not have a positive clinical response during the 6 weeks RCT will be offered the addition of the standard first-line PTSD pharmacotherapy, Paroxetine. Paroxetine is an allowed concomitant medication (i.e. &quot;rescue medication&quot;) and is not considered a research medication or subject of a research question during the 8 weeks extension phase.</description>

    <description>During the 6 weeks ( weeks: 1-6) double- blind, randomized clinical trial (RCT) phase, the veterans who have been randomized to the placebo treatment group will be receiving placebo pills. During the 8 weeks (weeks: 7-14) extension phase, all veterans from both treatment groups of the RCT phase will start open-label, active Nepicastat (i.e. no chance of placebo) treatment and be followed by the study team for an additional 8 weeks. The veterans on the placebo during the RCT will receive the study medication at end of the study week 6, the medication will be initiated with a 3-day loading phase of 40 mg on day 1, 80 mg on day 2 and 120 mg on day 3 (orally) and be continued at 120 mg once daily for 8 weeks until the end of the study.</description>
