    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is see if a combination of two drugs, (ATG and rituximab), given at
      the time of the transplant surgery, will help reduce or eliminate the need for long term
      immunosuppressive medication.

    <textblock>
      Kidneys remove excess fluid and waste from the blood. When kidneys lose their filtering
      ability, dangerous levels of fluid and waste accumulate in the body — a condition known as
      kidney failure. There are two ways to treat kidney failure. One way is to get dialysis
      indefinitely. The second way is to get a kidney transplant. A kidney transplant is often the
      best treatment for kidney failure. A kidney transplant is a surgical procedure to place a
      healthy kidney from a donor into a person whose kidneys no longer function properly. This
      study is for people who will receive a kidney transplant from a very well matched, living
      blood relative. The immune system is the body's defense system against illness. After
      transplant, the immune system will think that the new kidney is a foreign invader and will
      try to attack or reject the transplanted kidney. Immunosuppressive drugs protect the
      transplanted kidney by suppressing the immune system. People who have kidney transplants must
      take immunosuppressive drug for the rest of their lives. If they stop, their immune system
      may reject the transplanted kidney. Immunosuppressive drugs make it hard for the body to
      fight off infections. In addition, they can cause high blood pressure, kidney damage, plaque
      build-up in the blood vessels, high cholesterol, diabetes and bone disease. They may also
      make the body more likely to get some types of cancer (mainly cancer of the white blood cells
      and/or skin) and other serious side effects.

      Because of the side effects of immunosuppressive drugs, an important goal of transplant
      research is to allow people to accept their transplanted organ without always having to take
      immunosuppressive drugs. This is called tolerance. The RESTARRT study is testing a
      combination of two medications, rituximab and anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG), to see if they
      can help people reduce or eliminate the need for life-long immunosuppressive medications. ATG
      has been used for over 10 years to treat transplant rejection; rituximab is used to treat
      rheumatoid arthritis and two types of cancer. ATG works on immune cells called 'T cells' that
      are involved in transplant rejection, while rituximab works on a different type of cell
      called 'B cells.' Researchers hope that targeting both these cell types at the same time will
      help reset the immune system so that it accepts the transplanted kidney.

      Frequent visits are required during the first two months of the study. Then, study visits
      take place about every 4 weeks, but more often (every 2 weeks) when reducing medication
      doses. After two years, participants will be asked to return for check-ups every 3 months.
      Study visits may include consultations with the transplant doctors, physical exam, blood
      and/or urine samples and kidney biopsies at several times during the study. In all,
      participation could last up to 4 years. All study-related medications and tests are provided
      at no charge to the patient.

    <time_frame>Transplantation through 52 weeks after discontinuation of all immunosuppression</time_frame>
    <description>Participants are considered successfully withdrawn from immunosuppression if they remained off immunosuppression for at least 52 weeks without evidence of rejection, as determined by a biopsy performed 52 weeks after completion of immunosuppression withdrawal. All participants who failed to complete immunosuppression withdrawal, regardless of reason, or failed to have a biopsy 52 weeks after completion of immunosuppression withdrawal, were considered to have failed. The endpoint is summarized with a two-sided, 95% exact binomial confidence interval.</description>

    <measure>Histological Severity of Biopsies Demonstrating Acute Rejection as Measured by Banff 2007 Grade</measure>
    <time_frame>Transplantation through end of trial participation (up to 4.4 years post-transplant)</time_frame>
    <description>Biopsy-confirmed 1.) acute cellular rejection and 2.) acute antibody-mediated rejection was classified according to Banff 2007 criteria of renal allograft pathology for renal allograft rejection. A Banff result of indeterminate was not classified as rejection.
Acute cellular rejection occurs when lesions at the site of the graft characteristically are infiltrated with large numbers of lymphocytes and macrophages that cause tissue damage. Acute cellular rejection is defined as a grade ≥ IA. Severity is graded as IA, IB, IIA, IIB, or III, with IA being the mildest form of cellular rejection and III being the most severe.
Acute antibody-mediated rejection-or humoral rejection-is defined as a grade ≥1. Severity is graded as I, II, or III, with I being the mildest form of antibody-mediated rejection and III being the most severe.</description>

    <measure>Participant Renal Function as Measured by GFR Using CKD-EPI</measure>
    <time_frame>26, 52, 104, 156, and 208 Weeks Post-Transplant</time_frame>
    <description>Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is a measure of kidney function and helps determine the stage of kidney disease. A value less than 15 indicates kidney failure, 15 to 29 indicates severe loss of kidney function, 30 to 44 indicates moderate to severe loss of kidney function, 45 to 59 mild to moderate loss of kidney function, 60 to 89 indicates mild loss of kidney function, and 90 or higher indicates normal kidney function. The equation developed by the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) is used to estimate GFR from serum creatinine. The value closest to and within 6 weeks of the day expected was selected.</description>

    <measure>Participant Systolic Blood Pressure Over Time</measure>
    <time_frame>26, 52, 104, 156, and 208 Weeks Post-Transplant</time_frame>
    <description>Systolic blood pressure measures the pressure on the blood vessels when the heart is beats and thus is pushing blood to the rest of the body. A normal systolic blood pressure is lower than 120 mmHg. High blood pressure, as known as hypertension, is a risk factor for coronary artery disease, stroke, heart failure, and other complications if left unmanaged. The value closest to and within 6 weeks of the day expected was selected.</description>

    <measure>Participant Diastolic Blood Pressure Over Time</measure>
    <time_frame>26, 52, 104, 156, and 208 Weeks Post-Transplant</time_frame>
    <description>Diastolic blood pressure measures the pressure in the arteries when the heart is at rest and is thus filled with blood. A normal diastolic blood pressure is lower than 80 mmHg. High blood pressure, as known as hypertension, is a risk factor for coronary artery disease, stroke, heart failure, and other complications if left unmanaged. The value closest to and within 6 weeks of the day expected was selected.</description>

    <measure>Participant Total Cholesterol Over Time</measure>
    <time_frame>26, 52, 104, 156, and 208 Weeks Post-Transplant</time_frame>
    <description>Total cholesterol measures the amount of cholesterol found in the blood. Cholesterol is a waxy substance your body needs to build cells, but too much can be a problem since it can build-up in arteries. Narrowed arteries can result in heart attack or stroke. A value less than 200 mg/dL is considered good. The value closest to and within 12 weeks of the day expected was selected.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Participant Glucose Level Over Time</measure>
    <time_frame>26, 52, 104, 156, and 208 Weeks Post-Transplant</time_frame>
    <description>This is a measure of glucose found in the blood. Glucose, a sugar, is an energy source that the body relies on to properly function. If levels are too high for a long period of time, diabetes can develop. Diabetes can result in many long-term complications such as eye, kidney, and nerve damage, stroke, and cardiovascular complications. Fasting levels for glucose should be around 70-99 mg/dL and less than 140 mg/dL within 2 hours after a meal. The value closest to and within 6 weeks of the day expected was selected.</description>

          <description>Adult living donor kidney transplant recipients were enrolled into the study prior to transplant. Participants received a novel induction regimen of ATG and rituximab that included 4 doses of ATG 1.5 mg/kg and 2 doses of rituximab 375 mg/m^2. The first dose of rituximab was given ~ day -6 pre-transplant, and the second dose on day 1-3 post-transplant. The first dose of ATG was given on the day of transplant, with the additional three doses administered on days 2-7 post-transplant (not on the same day as rituximab). Participants were maintained on anti-rejection medications tacrolimus, MMF, and sirolimus post-transplant. Participants were evaluated for eligibility to proceed with immunosuppressive maintenance withdrawal (IMW), a gradual withdrawal of their anti-rejection medications, starting as early as 26 weeks post-transplant. IMW for eligible participants proceeded with close monitoring per protocol over a period of 68-104 weeks.</description>

          <description>Serum creatinine provides an estimate of how well the kidneys filter (glomerular filtration rate). Higher results= poorer kidney function. The baseline creatinine interval per protocol is defined as the 2 to 4 week interval post-kidney transplant and is calculated using the lowest N=3 serum creatinine values during this pre-defined interval, the interval prior to immunosuppressive maintenance withdrawal (IMW) initiation. Normal values: Adult males, 0.7 to 1.3 mg/dL; adult females, 0.6 to 1.1 mg/dL.</description>

The equation developed by the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) is used to estimate GFR (e.g., eGFR) from serum creatinine. Baseline serum creatinine was used in the equation, which is the average of the lowest three creatinine values during 2 to 4 weeks post-transplant, excluding days on dialysis.</description>

Systolic blood pressure measures the pressure on the blood vessels when the heart is beats and thus is pushing blood to the rest of the body. A normal systolic blood pressure is lower than 120 mmHg. High blood pressure, also known as hypertension, is a risk factor for coronary artery disease, stroke, heart failure, and other complications if left unmanaged.</description>

          <description>The diastolic blood pressure collected on the day of transplant. If there is no value recorded on the day of transplant, the value from the screening visit is used. Diastolic blood pressure measures the pressure in the arteries when the heart is at rest and is thus filled with blood. A normal diastolic blood pressure is lower than 80 mmHg. High blood pressure, as known as hypertension, is a risk factor for coronary artery disease, stroke, heart failure, and other complications if left unmanaged.</description>

          <description>The total cholesterol collected on the day of transplant. If there is no value recorded on the day of transplant, the value from the screening visit is used. Total cholesterol measures the amount of cholesterol found in the blood. Cholesterol is a waxy substance your body needs to build cells, but too much can be a problem since it can build-up in arteries. Narrowed arteries can result in heart attack or stroke. A value less than 200 mg/dL is considered good.</description>

          <description>The glucose collected on the day of transplant. If there is no value recorded on the day of transplant, the value from the screening visit is used. Glucose, a sugar, is an energy source that the body relies on to properly function. If levels are too high for a long period of time, diabetes can develop. Diabetes can result in many long-term complications such as eye, kidney, and nerve damage, stroke, and cardiovascular complications. Fasting levels for glucose should be around 70-99 mg/dL and less than 140 mg/dL within 2 hours after a meal.</description>

        <description>Participants are considered successfully withdrawn from immunosuppression if they remained off immunosuppression for at least 52 weeks without evidence of rejection, as determined by a biopsy performed 52 weeks after completion of immunosuppression withdrawal. All participants who failed to complete immunosuppression withdrawal, regardless of reason, or failed to have a biopsy 52 weeks after completion of immunosuppression withdrawal, were considered to have failed.

The first dose of rituximab was given ~ day -6 pre-transplant, and the second dose on day 1-3 post-transplant. The first dose of ATG was given on the day of transplant, with the additional three doses administered on days 2-7 post-transplant (not on the same day as rituximab). Participants were maintained on anti-rejection medications tacrolimus, MMF, and sirolimus post-transplant. Participants were evaluated for eligibility to proceed with immunosuppressive maintenance withdrawal (IMW), a gradual withdrawal of their anti-rejection medications, starting as early as 26 weeks post-transplant. IMW for eligible participants proceeded with close monitoring per protocol over a period of 68-104 weeks.</description>

The first dose of ATG was given on the day of transplant, with the additional three doses administered on days 2-7 post-transplant (not on the same day as rituximab). Participants were maintained on anti-rejection medications tacrolimus, MMF, and sirolimus post-transplant. Participants were evaluated for eligibility to proceed with immunosuppressive maintenance withdrawal (IMW), a gradual withdrawal of their anti-rejection medications, starting as early as 26 weeks post-transplant. IMW for eligible participants proceeded with close monitoring per protocol over a period of 68-104 weeks.</description>

        <description>Biopsy-confirmed 1.) acute cellular rejection and 2.) acute antibody-mediated rejection was classified according to Banff 2007 criteria of renal allograft pathology for renal allograft rejection. A Banff result of indeterminate was not classified as rejection.
Acute cellular rejection occurs when lesions at the site of the graft characteristically are infiltrated with large numbers of lymphocytes and macrophages that cause tissue damage. Acute cellular rejection is defined as a grade ≥ IA. Severity is graded as IA, IB, IIA, IIB, or III, with IA being the mildest form of cellular rejection and III being the most severe.
Acute antibody-mediated rejection-or humoral rejection-is defined as a grade ≥1. Severity is graded as I, II, or III, with I being the mildest form of antibody-mediated rejection and III being the most severe.</description>

            <description>Adult living donor kidney transplant recipients were enrolled into the study prior to transplant. Participants received a novel induction regimen of ATG and rituximab that included 4 doses of ATG 1.5 mg/kg and 2 doses of rituximab 375 mg/m^2. The first dose of rituximab was given ~day -6 pre-transplant, and the second dose was given on day 1-3 post-transplant. The first dose of ATG was given on the day of transplant, with the additional three doses administered on days 2-7 post-transplant (not on the same day as rituximab). Participants were maintained on anti-rejection medications tacrolimus, MMF, and sirolimus post-transplant. Participants were evaluated for eligibility to proceed with immunosuppressive maintenance withdrawal (IMW), a gradual withdrawal of their anti-rejection medications, starting as early as 26 weeks post-transplant. IMW for eligible participants proceeded with close monitoring per protocol over a period of 68-104 weeks.</description>

          <title>Histological Severity of Biopsies Demonstrating Acute Rejection as Measured by Banff 2007 Grade</title>
          <description>Biopsy-confirmed 1.) acute cellular rejection and 2.) acute antibody-mediated rejection was classified according to Banff 2007 criteria of renal allograft pathology for renal allograft rejection. A Banff result of indeterminate was not classified as rejection.
Acute cellular rejection occurs when lesions at the site of the graft characteristically are infiltrated with large numbers of lymphocytes and macrophages that cause tissue damage. Acute cellular rejection is defined as a grade ≥ IA. Severity is graded as IA, IB, IIA, IIB, or III, with IA being the mildest form of cellular rejection and III being the most severe.
Acute antibody-mediated rejection-or humoral rejection-is defined as a grade ≥1. Severity is graded as I, II, or III, with I being the mildest form of antibody-mediated rejection and III being the most severe.</description>

        <title>Participant Renal Function as Measured by GFR Using CKD-EPI</title>
        <description>Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is a measure of kidney function and helps determine the stage of kidney disease. A value less than 15 indicates kidney failure, 15 to 29 indicates severe loss of kidney function, 30 to 44 indicates moderate to severe loss of kidney function, 45 to 59 mild to moderate loss of kidney function, 60 to 89 indicates mild loss of kidney function, and 90 or higher indicates normal kidney function. The equation developed by the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) is used to estimate GFR from serum creatinine. The value closest to and within 6 weeks of the day expected was selected.</description>

            <title>Induction (Rituximab and ATG)</title>
            <description>Adult living donor kidney transplant recipients were enrolled into the study prior to transplant. Participants received a novel induction regimen of ATG and rituximab that included 4 doses of ATG 1.5 mg/kg and 2 doses of rituximab 375 mg/m^2. The first dose of rituximab was given ~day -6 pre-transplant, and the second dose was given on day 1-3 post-transplant. The first dose of ATG was given on the day of transplant, with the additional three doses administered on days 2-7 post-transplant (not on the same day as rituximab). Participants were maintained on anti-rejection medications tacrolimus, MMF, and sirolimus post-transplant. Participants were evaluated for eligibility to proceed with immunosuppressive maintenance withdrawal (IMW), a gradual withdrawal of their anti-rejection medications, starting as early as 26 weeks post-transplant. IMW for eligible participants proceeded with close monitoring per protocol over a period of 68-104 weeks.</description>

        <title>Participant Systolic Blood Pressure Over Time</title>
        <description>Systolic blood pressure measures the pressure on the blood vessels when the heart is beats and thus is pushing blood to the rest of the body. A normal systolic blood pressure is lower than 120 mmHg. High blood pressure, as known as hypertension, is a risk factor for coronary artery disease, stroke, heart failure, and other complications if left unmanaged. The value closest to and within 6 weeks of the day expected was selected.</description>

        <title>Participant Total Cholesterol Over Time</title>
        <description>Total cholesterol measures the amount of cholesterol found in the blood. Cholesterol is a waxy substance your body needs to build cells, but too much can be a problem since it can build-up in arteries. Narrowed arteries can result in heart attack or stroke. A value less than 200 mg/dL is considered good. The value closest to and within 12 weeks of the day expected was selected.</description>

            <description>Adult living donor kidney transplant recipients were enrolled into the study prior to transplant. Participants received a novel induction regimen of ATG and rituximab that included 4 doses of ATG 1.5 mg/kg and 2 doses of rituximab 375 mg/m^2. The first dose of rituximab was given ~day -6 pre-transplant, and the second dose was given on day 1-3 post-transplant. The first dose of ATG was given on the day of transplant, with the additional three doses administered on days 2-7 post-transplant (not on the same day as rituximab). Participants were maintained on anti-rejection medications tacrolimus, MMF, and sirolimus post-transplant. Participants were evaluated for eligibility to proceed with immunosuppressive maintenance withdrawal (IMW), a gradual withdrawal of their anti-rejection medications, starting as early as 26 weeks post-transplant. IMW for eligible participants proceeded with close monitoring per protocol over a period of 68-104 weeks.</description>

        <title>Participant Glucose Level Over Time</title>
        <description>This is a measure of glucose found in the blood. Glucose, a sugar, is an energy source that the body relies on to properly function. If levels are too high for a long period of time, diabetes can develop. Diabetes can result in many long-term complications such as eye, kidney, and nerve damage, stroke, and cardiovascular complications. Fasting levels for glucose should be around 70-99 mg/dL and less than 140 mg/dL within 2 hours after a meal. The value closest to and within 6 weeks of the day expected was selected.</description>

          <description>These are adult living donor kidney transplant recipients that were enrolled into the study prior to transplant and met all criteria for study participation. These participants received a novel induction regimen of ATG and rituximab that included 4 doses of ATG 1.5 mg/kg and 2 doses of rituximab 375 mg/m2. The first dose of rituximab was given around day -6 prior to transplant, and the second dose was given on day 1-3 post-transplant. The first dose of ATG was given on the day of transplant, with the additional three doses administered on days 2-7 post-transplant (not on the same day as rituximab). Participants were maintained on the anti-rejection medications tacrolimus, MMF, and sirolimus after transplant. Participants were evaluated for eligibility to start gradual withdrawal of their anti-rejection medications starting as early as 26 weeks post-transplant. Eligible participants were gradually withdrawn from anti-rejection medication over a period of 68-104 weeks.</description>
