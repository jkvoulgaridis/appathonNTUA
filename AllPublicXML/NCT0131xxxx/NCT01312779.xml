Class I. No limitation of physical activity. Ordinary physical activity does not cause undue fatigue, palpitation, dyspnea (shortness of breath).
Class II. Slight limitation of physical activity. Comfortable at rest. Ordinary physical activity results in fatigue, palpitation, dyspnea (shortness of breath).
Class III. Marked limitation of physical activity. Comfortable at rest. Less than ordinary activity causes fatigue, palpitation, or dyspnea.
Class IV. Unable to carry on any physical activity without discomfort. Symptoms of heart failure at rest. If any physical activity is undertaken, discomfort increases.</description>

    <measure>Subject's Average Score on the EQ-5D- Quality of Life Questionnaire Over Time</measure>
    <time_frame>6 Months and 1 Year post-implant</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D is a standardized questionnaire that asks subjects to rate themselves (no problems, some problems, extreme problems) on mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. The scale is indexed and ranges from a minimum of 0.275 and a maximum of 1.000. A lower number indicates the participants experiences more problems and a higher number indicates the participants experiences fewer problems.</description>

        <description>Mitral valvular regurgitation occurs when the mitral valve in the heart does not close tightly allowing some of the blood that was pumped out of the heart to leak back into it. Mitral valvular regurgitation is evaluated by echocardiography over time. It is assessed on a scale from 0 to 4, where 0 represents no regurgitation and 4 represents severe regurgitation.</description>

        <description>The EQ-5D is a standardized questionnaire that asks subjects to rate themselves (no problems, some problems, extreme problems) on mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. The scale is indexed and ranges from a minimum of 0.275 and a maximum of 1.000. A lower number indicates the participants experiences more problems and a higher number indicates the participants experiences fewer problems.</description>
