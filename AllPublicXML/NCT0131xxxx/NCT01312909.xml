    <description>The percentage of participants who, at each visit from Week 9 through Week 12, reported no smoking and no use of other nicotine-containing products since the last study visit (on the Nicotine Use Inventory) and at each of these visits were confirmed to have quit based on urine cotinine less than 200 nanograms/milliliter (ng/mL).</description>

    <time_frame>Weeks 12, 24 and 52</time_frame>
    <description>The percentage of participants who reported no smoking and no use of other nicotine-containing products (treatment phase) or tobacco products (non-treatment phase) on the Nicotine Use Inventory in the 7 days prior to the study visits or telephone contacts at Week 12,24 and 52.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 12, 24, and 52</time_frame>
    <description>The reduction in the number of the cigarettes smoked was calculated by subtracting the reported average number of cigarettes smoked per day in the past 7 days at Weeks 12, 24 and 52 from the average number of cigarettes smoked per day in the past 7 days reported at the baseline visit.</description>

    <description>The percentage of participants who, at each visit from Week 9 to 52 (inclusive), reported no smoking and no use of other nicotine-containing products (Weeks 9-12) or tobacco products (Weeks 13-52) since the last study visit/last contact (on the Nicotine Use Inventory) and at any of the study visits were confirmed to have quit based on urine cotinine less than 200 ng/mL.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (AEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>First dose up to last dose (up-to Week 12) plus 30 days</time_frame>
    <description>An AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. A serious AE (SAE) was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. Treatment-emergent were events between first dose of study drug and up to 30 days after last dose that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pretreatment state. AEs included both non-serious AEs and SAEs.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Treatment Emergent Treatment-Related Adverse Events (AEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>First dose up to last dose (up-to Week 12) plus 30 days</time_frame>
    <description>Treatment-related AE was any untoward medical occurrence attributed to study drug in a participant who received study drug. Treatment-emergent were events between first dose of study drug and up to 30 days after last dose that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pretreatment state. Relatedness to drug Varenicline was assessed by the investigator (Yes/No). Participants with multiple occurrences of an AE within a category were counted once within the category. An AE was any untoward medical occurrence attributed to study drug in a participant who received study drug. A serious AE (SAE) was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. AEs included both non-serious AEs and SAEs.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Treatment-Emergent Neuropsychiatric Adverse Event Elicited by Neuropsychiatric Adverse Event Interview (NAEI)</measure>
    <time_frame>First dose up to last dose (up-to Week 12) plus 30 days</time_frame>
    <description>An AE was any untoward medical occurrence attributed to study drug in a participant who received study drug. SAE: AE causing: death; initial/prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent/significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. Treatment-emergent were events between first dose of study drug and up to 30 days after last dose that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pretreatment state. Solicited AEs collected by semi-structured NAEI inquiring about AEs: depression, anxiety, delusions, hallucinations, paranoia, psychosis, mania, panic, agitation, dissociative states, feeling abnormal, hostility, aggression and homicidal ideation. If a participant had a positive response to any item on the NAEI, investigator determined if it met criteria AE criteria.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Blood Pressure (BP) at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Measurement of BP included supine and sitting systolic BP, standing systolic BP, supine and sitting diastolic BP and standing diastolic BP. Blood pressure was taken after participants rested in a sitting position for 5 minutes.

        <description>An AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. A serious AE (SAE) was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. Treatment-emergent were events between first dose of study drug and up to 30 days after last dose that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pretreatment state.

Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale Anxiety subscale (HADS-A) consisted of 7 items that were assessed on a scale of 0 = no anxiety to 3 = severe feeling of anxiety. Total HADS-A subscale score range from 0 = no anxiety to 21 = severe anxiety; higher scores indicated more severe anxiety.</description>

Total HADS-D subscale score range from 0 = no depression to 21 = severe feeling of depression; higher scores indicated a greater intensity of depression.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Pulse Rate at Week 12</title>
        <description>Measurement of pulse rate included supine, sitting and standing pulse rate. Pulse rate was taken after participants rested in a sitting position for 5 minutes. Pulse rate was recorded after participants had been supine for approximately 5 minutes and then immediately upon standing.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12</time_frame>
        <population>The safety analysis set included all participants who took at least one dose of randomized study medication, including partial doses. Here, ‘Number of participants analyzed’ signifies participants evaluable for this outcome measure.</population>
