  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if celiac bloc (with injection of steroid and local
      anesthetic) is superior to a sham procedure for pain control and quality of life improvement
      in patient with chronic pancreatitis and abdominal pain.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic pancreatitis is a condition that can lead to very disabling pain symptoms that are
      difficult to control. The use of morphine is often necessary and also induces a series of
      secondary symptoms.

      In this context, the injection into the celiac plexus block of a local anesthetic has often
      been proposed as an alternative. This procedure, by interrupting the afferent pain signal of
      pancreatic origin, aims to reduce pain and improve quality of life at the cost of fewer side
      effects.

      This procedure can be performed transcutaneously using the anatomical landmark or under
      radiological control. It can also be performed via endosonography (EUS) with better control
      of the injection site under ultrasound control.

      The results of the literature concerning the efficacy of the celiac block in chronic
      pancreatitis are rather encouraging with reported figures of partial or complete pain control
      in 39 to 65% of patients [1-7].

      However, the number of prospective studies concerning this technique performed endoscopically
      remains low to date. In particular, there are no case control studies. Data is also poor on
      the impact on quality of life.

      The study proposed here will therefore attempt to provide answers to the questions still
      pending: is the block by EUS superior to a diagnostic EUS without treatment? ; how long does
      this treatment last? ; does it have an impact on the quality of life of patients? This study
      and its draft are inspired by a similar recent study conducted in our department on patients
      with pancreatic neoplasia. The results of the latter are being submitted for publication.
