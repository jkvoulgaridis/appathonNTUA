  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People who are infected with the influenza virus may develop respiratory illnesses, such as
      pneumonia, or other life-threatening complications. Currently, there are four antiviral
      medications that are used to treat influenza. This study will examine one of these
      medications, oseltamivir, to examine how it affects the shedding of influenza virus in
      infected people.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Seasonal influenza is responsible for excess hospitalizations and, despite effective
      antivirals, causes significant morbidity and mortality (about 24,000 deaths each year in the
      United States alone). The influenza virus that emerged in 2009 (A/California/07/2009 H1N1)
      caused fewer deaths (12,000 flu-related deaths in the U.S.) but in contrast to seasonal flu,
      nearly 90% of the deaths with the 2009 H1N1 occurred among people younger than 65 years of
      age. Although there are four currently licensed anti-influenza medications (amantadine and
      rimantadine, oseltamivir, and zanamivir), previous studies have not demonstrated conclusively
      to what extent these medications affect influenza viral shedding. This study will evaluate
      whether oseltamivir modifies the viral shedding during the treatment of uncomplicated
      influenza in an adult population and also assess methods to detect viral replication in the
      upper respiratory tract.

      Subjects who presented with an influenza-like illness without any risk factors for severe
      disease were screened for the study. Those with a confirmatory test for influenza (rapid
      antigen or polymerase chain reaction [PCR]) were randomized in a 1:1 manner to receive a
      blinded study treatment consisting of either the oseltamivir or placebo for 5 days. Clinical,
      virologic, and laboratory assessments on Days 1, 3, 7, and 28 were used for both safety and
      efficacy analysis.

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Alleviation of Influenza Clinical Symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>From treatment initiation to Day 28</time_frame>
    <description>The assessed symptoms were cough, nasal obstruction (stuffy nose), sore throat, fatigue, headache, muscle aches, feverishness, rhinorrhea, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea. Duration of clinical symptoms was defined as the time from Day 0 to the first of two successive measurements at which all clinical symptoms were grade 0 (absent) or 1 (mild). A measurement was considered to be the 8AM or 8PM assessment during Days 0 to 7 (so two measurements were obtained per day) and then the daily assessment thereafter. Time was calculated in half-days through to Day 7. If a subject's first two assessments on (baseline assessment and first subsequent diary card assessment) satisfied this criterion, then the duration was set to zero. For participants who did not have two successive records meeting this criterion, follow-up was censored for analysis purposes at the time of the last but one diary card record with symptoms evaluated.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Absence of Fever</measure>
    <time_frame>From treatment initiation to Day 28</time_frame>
    <description>Fever was considered present based on the diary cards if a subject reported a maximal temperature ≥38.0°C (for the period since the diary card was previously completed) or reported having taken an antipyretic drug (also for the period since the diary card was previously completed). Otherwise, fever was considered not present during the period since the diary card was previously completed, except that the evaluation was considered missing if either the temperature or the antipyretic drug use entry was not completed on the diary card. The duration of fever was defined as the time from Day 0 to the first of two successive assessments (through to Day 7) or to the first assessment (Day 8 onwards) at which no fever was present according to this definition.For participants who did not have two successive records meeting this criterion, follow-up was censored for analysis purposes at the time of the last but one diary card record with fever evaluated.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Resolution of All Symptoms AND Fever</measure>
    <time_frame>From treatment initiation to Day 28</time_frame>
    <description>The assessed symptoms were cough, nasal obstruction (stuffy nose), sore throat, fatigue, headache, muscle aches, feverishness, rhinorrhea, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea. Fever was considered present based on the diary cards if a subject reported a maximal temperature ≥38.0°C (for the period since the diary card was previously completed) or reported having taken an antipyretic drug (also for the period since the diary card was previously completed). Time to resolution of all clinical symptoms and fever is defined as the time from Day 0 to the first of two successive measurements at which all clinical symptoms are grade 0 (absent) or 1(mild) and no fever &gt;=38.0 C or antipyretic drug is reported. For participants who did not have two successive records meeting this criterion, follow-up was censored for analysis purposes at the time of the last but one diary card record with symptoms and fever evaluated.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Treatment Compliance Status</measure>
    <time_frame>From treatment initiation to Day 5</time_frame>
    <description>For each of the 5 days of treatment, participants were asked whether they took all study drug for that day. All participants were assumed to have taken at least some study drug even if they had zero days with all study drug reported as taken. Missing reports for some or all days were imputed as not having taken all study drug for the days concerned.</description>

    <measure>qPCR Viral Shedding -- Self Collected Samples</measure>
    <time_frame>At Day 0, Day 0 evening, Day 1, Day 1 evening, Day 2, Day 2 evening and Day 3</time_frame>
    <description>Median, 25% and 75% percentile of the value of viral shedding (Results &lt;LOD were imputed as the LOD value, and Results &gt;= LOD, &lt;LLOQ were imputed as the LLOQ value.). Evening samples on Day 0, 1 and 2 were only required under protocol versions 1.0-4.0 and so were only collected for about 20% of participants.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Area Under The Curve (AUC) Of Viral Shedding For Self Collected Samples</measure>
    <time_frame>From Day 0 to Day 3</time_frame>
    <description>This AUC was calculated using the trapezoidal rule and the units of measurement are (days*log10 copies/mL) with the fact that it was the level of virus above the LLOQ being considered. The calculation of AUC was undertaken using measurements from Day 0 to Day 3 which were collected under all versions of the protocol (i.e. evening measurements on Days 0, 1 and 2 were not used as these were collected for only about 20% of subjects). Missing values during follow-up were ignored. This is equivalent to imputing a missing value using linear interpolation between the preceding and succeeding available values. For the five subjects with missing values following a last available measurement which was above the LLOQ, the remaining values were assumed to be the mean of preceding value and LLOQ in calculating the AUC.</description>

          <description>Symptoms were scored on a 4-point scale : 0=absent, 1=mild, 2=moderate, 3=severe.Overall symptom score was the sum of available scores for each of the 11 symptoms assessed (so ignoring missing values). The possible range of the overall symptom score is therefore 0 (no symptoms) to 33 (severe for all 11 symptoms). Subjects with missing evaluations for all symptoms were given a missing overall symptom score.</description>

        <description>The central laboratory performed a qualitative PCR test on the NP sample from Day 0 team collected swap in order to confirm influenza infection and to determine the influenza type and subtype. For participants with a positive influenza test result at Day 0 from this qualitative PCR testing, the laboratory then performed qPCR testing of subsequent samples to quantify viral shedding.</description>

        <title>Time to Alleviation of Influenza Clinical Symptoms</title>
        <description>The assessed symptoms were cough, nasal obstruction (stuffy nose), sore throat, fatigue, headache, muscle aches, feverishness, rhinorrhea, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea. Duration of clinical symptoms was defined as the time from Day 0 to the first of two successive measurements at which all clinical symptoms were grade 0 (absent) or 1 (mild). A measurement was considered to be the 8AM or 8PM assessment during Days 0 to 7 (so two measurements were obtained per day) and then the daily assessment thereafter. Time was calculated in half-days through to Day 7. If a subject's first two assessments on (baseline assessment and first subsequent diary card assessment) satisfied this criterion, then the duration was set to zero. For participants who did not have two successive records meeting this criterion, follow-up was censored for analysis purposes at the time of the last but one diary card record with symptoms evaluated.</description>

        <title>Area Under The Curve (AUC) Of Viral Shedding For Self Collected Samples</title>
        <description>This AUC was calculated using the trapezoidal rule and the units of measurement are (days*log10 copies/mL) with the fact that it was the level of virus above the LLOQ being considered. The calculation of AUC was undertaken using measurements from Day 0 to Day 3 which were collected under all versions of the protocol (i.e. evening measurements on Days 0, 1 and 2 were not used as these were collected for only about 20% of subjects). Missing values during follow-up were ignored. This is equivalent to imputing a missing value using linear interpolation between the preceding and succeeding available values. For the five subjects with missing values following a last available measurement which was above the LLOQ, the remaining values were assumed to be the mean of preceding value and LLOQ in calculating the AUC.</description>
