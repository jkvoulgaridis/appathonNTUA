  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will include participants with previously treated systemic relapsed or refractory
      light-chain (AL) amyloidosis who require further therapy and will be aimed at determining the
      safety profile and the maximum tolerated dose/recommended phase 2 dose of MLN9078 (Ixazomib)
      administered orally.

    <measure>Number of Participants With at Least One Treatment Emergent Adverse Event (TEAE) and Serious Adverse Event (SAE)</measure>
    <time_frame>From the first dose of study drug plus 30 days after last dose of study drug or until the initiation of subsequent antineoplastic therapy (Up to approximately 13 months)</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a medicinal investigational drug. The untoward medical occurrence does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with treatment. An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that results in death; is life-threatening; requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of present hospitalization; results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; is a congenital anomaly/birth defect or is a medically important event that may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization, but may jeopardize the participant or may require intervention to prevent one of other outcomes listed in definition above, or involves suspected transmission via a medicinal product of an infectious agent. A TEAE is defined as an AE that occurs after administration of first dose of study drug and through 30 days after last dose of study drug or until start of subsequent antineoplastic therapy.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Clinically Significant Abnormal Laboratory Values Reported as TEAE</measure>
    <time_frame>From the first dose of study drug plus 30 days after last dose of study drug or until the initiation of subsequent antineoplastic therapy (Up to approximately 13 months)</time_frame>
    <description>The number of participants with any clinically significant abnormal standard safety laboratory values collected throughout the study reported as TEAEs. Parameters assessed were hematology, serum chemistry and urinalysis. Abnormal laboratory values were assessed as an AE if that value leads to discontinuation or delay in treatment, dose modification, therapeutic intervention, or is considered by the investigator to be a clinically significant change from baseline.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Peripheral Neuropathy Reported as a TEAE</measure>
    <time_frame>From the first dose of study drug plus 30 days after last dose of study drug or until the initiation of subsequent antineoplastic therapy (Up to approximately 13 months)</time_frame>

    <description>MTD was highest dose of Ixazomib, at which &lt;=1 of 6 participants experienced dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). DLT was defined using National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, v 4.03 as: Grade 4 neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count &lt;500 cells/mm^3) for &gt;7 days;Grade 3 neutropenia with fever or infection;Grade 4 thrombocytopenia (platelets &lt; 25,000/mm^3) for &gt;7 days;Grade 3 thrombocytopenia with clinically significant bleeding;platelet count &lt;10,000/mm^3;Grade 2 peripheral neuropathy with pain or &gt;=Grade 3 peripheral neuropathy; &gt;=Grade 3 nausea/emesis, diarrhea controlled by supportive therapy;Grade 3 QTc prolongation (QTc &gt;500 msec);any &gt;=Grade 3 nonhematologic toxicity except Grade 3 arthralgia/myalgia;or &lt;1 week Grade 3 fatigue;delay in initiation of the subsequent therapy cycle by &gt;2 weeks;other &gt;=Grade 2 study drug-related nonhematologic toxicities requiring therapy discontinuation, considered possibly related to therapy as assessed by Investigator.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) of Ixazomib</measure>
    <time_frame>Cycle 1 (28 days)</time_frame>
    <description>The RP2D is the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or less. The MTD is defined as the dose range at which â‰¤ 1 of 6 evaluable participants experience dose limiting toxicities (DLT) within the first 28 days of treatment (end of Cycle 1). The RP2D of Ixazomib was determined in dose escalation group on the basis of the totality of safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) data observed in Cycle 1.</description>

    <ipd_description>Takeda makes patient-level, de-identified data sets and associated documents available for all interventional studies after applicable marketing approvals and commercial availability have been received (or program is completely terminated), an opportunity for the primary publication of the research and final report development has been allowed, and other criteria have been met as set forth in Takeda's Data Sharing Policy (see www.TakedaClinicalTrials.com for details). To obtain access, researchers must submit a legitimate academic research proposal for adjudication by an independent review panel, who will review the scientific merit of the research and the requestor's qualifications and conflict of interest that can result in potential bias. Once approved, qualified researchers who sign a data sharing agreement are provided access to these data in a secure research environment.</ipd_description>

      <recruitment_details>Participants took part in the study at 9 investigative sites in the United States, Canada, France, Germany and Italy from 27 April 2011 to 13 November 2018.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Participants with previously treated systemic light chain (AL) amyloidosis were enrolled in 2 dose escalation cohorts and were treated with ixazomib 4.0 or 5.5 mg. Participants with relapsed or refractory amyloidosis were enrolled in 2 dose expansion cohorts and treated with ixazomib 4.0 mg in proteosome inhibitor (PI) Naive and PI Exposed groups.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Number of Participants With at Least One Treatment Emergent Adverse Event (TEAE) and Serious Adverse Event (SAE)</title>
        <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a medicinal investigational drug. The untoward medical occurrence does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with treatment. An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that results in death; is life-threatening; requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of present hospitalization; results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; is a congenital anomaly/birth defect or is a medically important event that may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization, but may jeopardize the participant or may require intervention to prevent one of other outcomes listed in definition above, or involves suspected transmission via a medicinal product of an infectious agent. A TEAE is defined as an AE that occurs after administration of first dose of study drug and through 30 days after last dose of study drug or until start of subsequent antineoplastic therapy.</description>
