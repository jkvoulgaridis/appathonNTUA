    <measure>Change From Baseline to 4 Week Endpoint in Weekly Mean of Night Pain and Worst Daily Pain Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The pain severity for night pain and worst pain was measured by an 11-point Likert scale, an ordinal scale with scores from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain). The 11-point Likert scale was used for assessment of night pain and worst pain each day, and evaluated as weekly means. Participants were asked to complete the severity pain for worst pain twice a day (in the morning and in the afternoon). The pain severity for night pain was filled out only once in the morning.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline to 4 Week Endpoint in Chronic Pain Sleep Inventory (CPSI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The CPSI is a validated 5-item questionnaire in which the following factors were assessed: trouble falling asleep due to pain (CPSI1), the need for sleep medication (CPSI2), awakenings by pain during the night (CPSI3) awakenings by pain in the morning (CPSI4), and overall sleep quality (CSPI5). All CPSI items are scored using a 100-millimeter (mm) visual analog scale (VAS) (VAS; 0=never and 100=always for CPSI1 through CPSI4, and 0=very poor and 100=excellent for CPSI5).</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline to 4 Week Endpoint in Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The PSQI is a self-rated questionnaire that assesses the participant's sleep habits during the last month and consists of 19 questions that cover 7 components (sleep quality, sleep onset latency, sleep duration, sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, sleeping medication use, and daytime dysfunction). Each item has a range of 0 (no difficulty) to 3 (severe difficulty). The 7 component scores were added to yield a global score with a range of 0 (no difficulty) to 21 (severe difficulties in all areas).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline to 4 Week Endpoint in Brief Pain Inventory Severity and Interference Scores (BPI-S/BPI-I)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The BPI-S and BPI-I are self-reported scales measuring severity of pain and interference on function. BPI-S consists of 4 questions assessing worst pain, least pain, average pain in the past 24 hours, and pain right now. Severity scores range from 0 (no pain) to 10 (pain as severe as you can imagine). The BPI-I average interference is the average of 7 questions assessing interference of pain for general activity, mood, walking ability, normal work, relations with other people, sleep, and enjoyment of life. Average interference scores range: 0 (does not interfere) to 10 (completely interferes).</description>

        <description>The pain severity for night pain and worst pain was measured by an 11-point Likert scale, an ordinal scale with scores from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain). The 11-point Likert scale was used for assessment of night pain and worst pain each day, and evaluated as weekly means. Participants were asked to complete the severity pain for worst pain twice a day (in the morning and in the afternoon). The pain severity for night pain was filled out only once in the morning.</description>

All CPSI items are scored using a 100-millimeter (mm) visual analog scale (VAS) (VAS; 0=never and 100=always for CPSI1 through CPSI4, and 0=very poor and 100=excellent for CPSI5).</description>

Pain subscale has 5 questions on pain associated with everyday tasks; subscale score ranges from 0=none to 20=extreme. Physical function subscale has 17 questions on physical function difficulties with everyday tasks; subscale score ranges from 0=none to 68=extreme. Stiffness subscale has 2 questions on stiffness associated with time of day (morning versus later in day); subscale score ranges from 0=none to 8=extreme.</description>

        <description>The DoloTest® is a self-reported assessment composed of 8 visual analog scale (VAS) items ranging from 0 (none) to 100 (worst possible) for the following domains: pain, problems with light physical activities, problems with more strenuous physical activities, problems doing your job, reduced energy and strength, low spirit, reduced social life, and problems sleeping). The scale is arranged in a radar plot to provide a graphic presentation of the test result. The DoloTest® Sum Score is equal to the sum of each scored domain; scores range from 0 (none) to 800 (worst possible).</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline, 4 weeks</time_frame>
        <population>The analysis included all randomized participants receiving at least 1 dose of investigational product and with a baseline and at least 1 postbaseline DoloTest value.</population>
