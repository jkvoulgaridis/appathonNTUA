  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Reverse total shoulder arthroplasty (RTSA) has been successful in patients with rotator cuff
      arthropathy, proximal humerus fractures, failed primary total shoulder arthroplasty or failed
      hemiarthroplasty, and massive irreparable rotator cuff tear. Patients who undergo an RTSA
      report pain relief and functional range of motion. It has been more than 20 years since the
      advent of the RTSA construct but an immediate post-operative rehabilitation with active
      shoulder range of motion has not been prospectively studied in comparison to the traditional
      post-operative rehabilitation highlighted by Boudreau et al.12 Investigators plan to
      prospectively follow our patients following RTSA undergoing an immediate active shoulder
      rehabilitation (IASR) vs traditional rehabilitation in a randomized controlled fashion.
      Investigators plan to document clinical outcomes, complications and cost effectiveness out to
      1 year.

      The study will hopefully fulfill the Triple Aim model for HealthPartners by improving the
      health of the population, improve the experience of each individual, and make healthcare
      affordable by decreasing the total cost of care.

    <description>1. American Shoulder and Elbow score (ASES) is a scale that measures shoulder pain and function with 11 items, one item for pain and 10 items for function. The score for each subscale is out of 50 (0-50), with a higher score indicating a better outcome. The total score is a sum of both subscales, ranging between 0-100, using the following formula, Total score = ((10 − VAS pain) × 5) + (5/3 × sum of function items).</description>

    <description>2. The Simple Shoulder Test Score (SST) is a 12 item, yes/no questionnaire assessing shoulder function. There are 2 items on function related to pain, 7 items about functions/strength and 3 items about range of motion. There are no subscales. A &quot;yes&quot; response is 1 point and a &quot;no&quot; response is 0 point. The following formula is used to calculate a score out of 100 (0-100), total= number of &quot;yes&quot; items/number of completed items × 100 = % &quot;yes&quot; responses.

    <description>3. The PROMIS Global-10 is a global health quality of life patient reported outcome tool. It is part of the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS). It measures symptoms, functioning, and healthcare quality of life for a wide variety of conditions. The PROMIS Global-10 consists of 10 questions assessing physical health, mental health, social health, pain, fatigue, and overall perceived quality of life. 7 questions inquire about health in &quot;general&quot; and 3 questions assess emotional problems, fatigue and pain in the last 7 days. Raw subscale scores for physical and mental health each are calculated out of 20. The raw score are converted to T scores for physical and mental health using the following formulas: the Global Physical Health score is generated by summing responses to Global03, Global06, Global07rescored, and Global08rescored. The Global Mental Health score is generated by summing responses to Global02, Global04, Global05, and Global10rescored.</description>

    <description>4. Range of motion (ROM) of the shoulder is an objective measure of shoulder function. A blinded examiner will measure the range of motion in forward elevation, external rotation in the neutral position external rotation with the arm in abduction, internal rotation in the neutral position, and internal rotation with the arm in abduction. A goniometer will be used measuring to the nearest degree. The range of motion for forward elevation will range between 0-180 degrees with a higher number indicating a better outcome. External and internal rotation ranges from 0-90 degrees with a higher number indicating a better outcome.</description>

    <description>This study will be a non-blinded randomized controlled outcomes study evaluating outcomes at baseline, 2 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year post-operatively from a primary reverse total shoulder arthroplasty with two different post-operative physical rehabilitation protocols. There will be 2 groups, one undergoing the immediate active shoulder physical therapy protocol consisting of four quadrant stretches and full active motion of the shoulder from post op day 1 in the hospital. The second group will follow the traditional TRIA physical therapy protocol consisting of PT (standard of care) followed by a gradual return to active range of motion of the shoulder beginning by week 6, calling for 18 physical therapy visits. The physical therapy will occur where the patient is most comfortable receiving it.</description>
