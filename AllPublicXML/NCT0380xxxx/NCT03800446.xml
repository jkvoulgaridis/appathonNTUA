  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Measurement of iron is important for identifying both low and high iron levels in the body.
      Measuring a protein in the blood called ferritin is currently the easiest way to determine a
      patient's iron status. However, the test requires a blood sample that is be sent to the
      laboratory for measurement, which can cause delays in obtaining the result. The investigators
      are testing whether a point of care device that measures ferritin levels using a capillary
      blood sample is accurate compared to current methods of testing. This could allow measurement
      of ferritin immediately in the clinic with only a drop of blood, and enable treatment
      decisions based on these results.

    <time_frame>Within 12 hours of standard testing</time_frame>
    <description>The proportion of subjects where the difference between the two different methods is less than 15Í¾ this will be measured by calculating the difference between the two results.
The proportion for the absolute difference between the two measurement methods on the same subject that is less than 15 ng/mL will be calculated. Non-inferiority test for one proportion will be performed to examine, if, the proportion is greater than 95%, where the test p value and the one-sided 97.5% confidence interval will be reported.
An interim analysis will be performed after the first 50 subjects are enrolled to test the assumptions made.</description>

    <measure>Comparison of the differences between ferritin levels as measured by the standard test and POC test in a Repeated Measures Design</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 12 hours of standard testing</time_frame>
    <description>Applies to patients who have multiple measurement points during study follow-up. The differences in ferritin levels between the two methods will be studied using a mixed model to account for the between-subject variation and the within-subject variation. The mean difference and its 95% CI, the Bonferroni-adjusted p-values and the plot of mean vs time will be reported.</description>

    <measure>Agreement between testing methods in patients who have been assessed at least twice</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 12 hours of standard testing</time_frame>
    <description>Applies only to patients with at least two repeated measures. Agreement between the two measurement methods will be quantified and summarized using probability of agreement.</description>

    <description>The Receiver Operating Characteristic curves (ROC) analysis will be performed to report the diagnostic accuracy for the new measurement method. The optimal cut-off value and the associated accuracy measures (sensitivity, specificity, predictive values and etc.) will be reported.</description>
