  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      By doing this study the investigators hope to learn if educational videos focusing on
      nutrition for bladder cancer patients are a good and effective way to help people improve
      their nutrition and recovery after radical cystectomy (RC).

    <textblock>
      Bladder Cancer is the fifth most common cancer in the USA. The primary treatment for invasive
      bladder cancer is chemotherapy followed by RC. Patients undergoing this surgery are at risk
      for complications. Being malnourished can increase the risk of mortality by three times. The
      patients also suffer from taste alterations after chemotherapy and gastrointestinal
      disturbances such as diarrhea and constipation. These can lead to poor nutritional intake and
      malabsorption of nutrients.

      This study is being done to develop an educational video series for patients undergoing RC
      and assess their impact. The videos are created to address the nutritional needs of these
      patients and improve their outcomes after surgery.

    <description>Evaluate the content of three video series focusing on practical solutions to nutritional problems common to patients undergoing a radical cystectomy through iterative process using Center for Disease Control's Clear Communication Index. The Center for Disease Control's Clear Communication Index uses 4 questions and 20 scored items to asses how materials enhance and aid people's understanding of information in seven areas - main message and call to action, language, information design, state of the science, behavioral recommendations, numbers, and risk. The range of scores is 0 to 100 with a score of 90 or higher considered a passing score.</description>
