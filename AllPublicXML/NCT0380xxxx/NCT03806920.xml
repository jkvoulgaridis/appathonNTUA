    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the different postprandial effect of isomaltulose and sucrose on the
      incretin profile and as an determinant for the second meal effect.

      In this nutritional intervention study, healthy participants and T2DM patients ingest 2
      standardized meals for breakfast and lunch in combination with either sucrose or palatinose
      on 2 separate days. In addition, blood samples are taken to analyze markers of the
      carbohydrate metabolism, incretins and specific inflammation markers.

    <textblock>
      Isomaltulose is a natural occurring disaccharide with a similar structure to sucrose. It is
      composed of glucose and fructose, but is linked by an α-1,6-glycosidic bond instead of α-1,2.
      Due to its binding, isomaltulose is slowly hydrolysed, which results in a rather weak
      postprandial glycemic-insulinemic response, accompanied by a minimal GIP secretion and a
      stimulated secretion of GLP-1. In addition, several studies have shown that the intake of
      foods with a low glycemic index, such as isomaltulose, tend to improve the metabolic reaction
      to a subsequent meal. As the exact mechanism of this &quot;second meal effect&quot; is still unknown,
      the investigators hypothesize that the modified release and action of GIP and GLP-1 are key
      players in regard to the described effects.Therefore, isomaltulose could be a suitable tool
      for reducing the risk of developing diabetes, obesity and CVD as well as improve blood
      glucose control in people with diabetes.

      In summary, this study evaluates the different postprandial effect of isomaltulose and
      sucrose on the incretin profile and as a determinant for the second meal effect.

      In this nutritional intervention study, healthy participants and T2DM patients ingest 2
      standardized meals for breakfast and lunch in combination with either sucrose or palatinose
      on 2 separated days. In addition, blood samples are taken to analyze markers of the
      carbohydrate metabolism, incretins and specific inflammation markers.
