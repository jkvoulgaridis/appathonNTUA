      This phase 2b study is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of tezepelumab as a
      monotherapy and explore its efficacy as adjunct therapy in subjects with moderate-to-severe
      AD.

      All subjects will receive a SC dose of either investigational product or placebo as the first
      dose on day 1.

      Subjects who are determined to be non-responders in Part A will receive tezepelumab SC Q2W
      following completion of all week 16 study activities. Nonresponders are defined as those
      subjects who have not achieved at least a 50% improvement in EASI at week 16 compared to
      baseline (day 1).

      Safety follow-up is 12 weeks after the EOT visit (14 weeks after the final dose of
      investigational product).

             risks).

          -  Inadequate response is defined as failure to achieve and maintain remission or a low
             disease activity state (comparable to IGA 0 = clear to IGA 2 = mild) despite treatment

             appropriate).

        Exclusion Criteria:

               -  No evidence of active TB on chest radiograph within 3 months prior to the first
                  dose of investigational product. Note: Chest radiograph is not part of screening

          -  History or evidence of severe depression, schizophrenia, previous suicide attempts, or
             suicidal ideation.

             excluded.

        Other Exclusions:

          -  Female subject is pregnant or breastfeeding or planning to become pregnant or
             breastfeed during treatment and for an additional 14 weeks after the last dose of
             investigational product. (Females of childbearing potential should only be enrolled in

          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential who are sexually active with unsterilized
             male partners unwilling to use 1 highly effective method of contraception during
             treatment and for an additional 14 weeks after the last dose of investigational
             product. Cessation of contraception after this point must be discussed with a
             responsible physician. Females of childbearing potential are defined as those who are
             not surgically sterile (ie, had bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy, or
             complete hysterectomy) or postmenopausal (defined as 12 months with no menses without
             an alternative medical cause). A highly effective method of contraception is defined
             as one that resulted in a low failure rate (ie, &lt; 1% per year) when used consistently
             and correctly. Refer to Appendix 5 for additional contraceptive information.

             with the study evaluation, procedures, or completion.

    <ipd_time_frame>Data sharing requests relating to this study will be considered beginning 18 months after the study has ended and either 1) the product and indication have been granted marketing authorization in both the US and Europe or 2) clinical development for the product and/or indication discontinues and the data will not be submitted to regulatory authorities. There is no end date for eligibility to submit a data sharing request for this study.</ipd_time_frame>
    <ipd_access_criteria>Qualified researchers may submit a request containing the research objectives, the Amgen product(s) and Amgen study/studies in scope, endpoints/outcomes of interest, statistical analysis plan, data requirements, publication plan, and qualifications of the researcher(s). In general, Amgen does not grant external requests for individual patient data for the purpose of re-evaluating safety and efficacy issues already addressed in the product labelling. Requests are reviewed by a committee of internal advisors. If not approved, a Data Sharing Independent Review Panel will arbitrate and make the final decision. Upon approval, information necessary to address the research question will be provided under the terms of a data sharing agreement. This may include anonymized individual patient data and/or available supporting documents, containing fragments of analysis code where provided in analysis specifications.
