  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common condition among sepsis patients in the intensive care
      unit (ICU) and is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Oxidative stress biomarkers
      were investigated in panels and were reported to predict renal failure in sepsis patients.
      Some biomarkers would be able to identify who will recover and not recover better than serum
      creatinine. Thus, a combining oxidative stress biomarkers are needed to predict the
      occurrence or progression of AKI in critically ill patients.

      Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common condition among sepsis patients in the intensive care
      unit (ICU) and is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Oxidative stress biomarkers
      were investigated in panels and were reported to predict renal failure in sepsis patients.
      Research on AKI has focused on new damage biomarkers for early detection of AKI and worsening
      of renal function. Some biomarkers would be able to identify who will recover and not recover
      better than serum creatinine. Thus, a combining functional and damage markers as well as
      oxidative stress biomarkers are needed to predict the occurrence or progression of AKI in
      critically ill patients. Therefore, this prospective, observational study will be conducted
      in Mainland China
