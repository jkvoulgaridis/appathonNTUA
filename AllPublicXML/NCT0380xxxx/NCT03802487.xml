  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary Objective:

      To assess the absolute bioavailability of sotagliflozin via administration of an intravenous
      (IV) microdose of a 14C-sotagliflozin tracer on top of a single oral dose of unlabeled
      sotagliflozin without charcoal administration

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To assess the PK of sotagliflozin and its main metabolite sotagliflozin-3-O-glucuronide
           (M19) after a single oral dose of sotagliflozin and an IV microdose of a
           14C-sotagliflozin tracer without charcoal administration

        -  To assess the safety and tolerability of single doses of sotagliflozin when administered
           with and without charcoal

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Study duration per participant is up to 54 days including a screening period of up to 28
      days, period 1 of 8 days, period 2 of 8 days, a washout period of at least 10 days, and a
      follow up period of 12-16 days.

      The oral drug Sotagliflozin is metabolized by the liver and released in the bile juice into
      the intestine. Ingestion of charcoal a few hours after the drug administration circumvents
      the re-uptake of the drug from the intestine back into the blood circulation; instead,
      Sotagliflozin is eliminated with the feces. By comparison of Sotagliflozin drug
      administration with and without charcoal, the extent of this so-called enterohepatic
      circulation can be assessed.
