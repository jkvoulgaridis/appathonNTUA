  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized controlled trial aimed to determine highly specific personified
      predictors of response to the therapy by different groups of hypoglycemic drugs (SGLT-2
      inhibitors, DPP-4 inhibitors, GLP-1 receptor agonists, sulfonylureas) in patients with type 2
      diabetes mellitus, develop an algorithm of personalized therapy based on them, design an
      organizational and methodological model for prevention of the cardiovascular complications,
      and create an automated decision-making system for therapy selection to reduce the incidence
      of cardiovascular events and related adverse outcomes compared to the traditional approach.
      This is an interventional, randomized controlled trial, open-label study.

      The study aims to determine highly specific personified predictors of response to the therapy
      by different groups of hypoglycemic drugs in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, to
      develop on their basis a mathematical model that allows to objectify the choice of therapy
      for each patient, and validate it in clinical practice with assessment of dynamic of
      cardiovascular risk markers (vascular wall condition, markers of fibrosis and inflammation,
      molecular-genetic markers of vascular damage, dynamic of intestinal microbiota, clinical
      outcomes, psychological parameters of quality of life, eating, treatment satisfaction) and
      pharmaco-economic component. Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and non-target HbA1c will
      be randomized to receive antidiabetic drugs (SGLT-2 inhibitors, DPP-4 inhibitors, GLP-1
      receptor agonists, sulfonylureas) in open prospective study according to: 1) standard
      recommendations; 2) predictors chosen with automated decision-making system developed on the
      literature analysis. At baseline and 3, 6, 12, and 24 months into the study patients will be
      asked to complete the questionnaires on eating behavior, appetite, propensity to alcohol
      consumption, smoking, level of physical activity, general health condition, level of anxiety
      and depression, cognitive functions, adherence to treatment and treatment satisfaction. At
      baseline and 3, 6, 12, and 24 months into the study there will be physical examination and
      laboratory tests, including: fasting and 1.5 hours post meal glucose, glycated hemoglobin,
      insulin with calculation of HOMA-IR index, indicators of lipid metabolism (total cholesterol,
      TG, LDL, calculation of HDL and VLDL), markers of kidney function (serum creatinine with GFR
      calculation, urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio), biochemical parameters of therapy safety
      (ALT, AST, bilirubin, uric acid, fibrinogen, alkaline phosphatase, amylase 5), levels of
      orexigenic / anorexigenic hormones (GLP1, GIP, ghrelin, leptin, glucagon, adiponectin,
      C-peptide). The study will also include the evaluation of endothelial dysfunction (using
      EndoPAT 2000), state of the vascular wall (using the SphygmoCor), thickness of intima-media
      complex of carotid arteries, echocardiographic study, estimation of the global longitudinal
      strain (2-D Speckle-tracking echocardiographic analysis), MRI of the heart, biomarkers of
      inflammation (CRP level by the ultrasensitive method, adhesion molecules E-selectin and
      sICAM-1), markers of oxidative stress (myeloperoxidase, paraoxanase-1), markers of fibrosis
      (PICP, PIIINP, CITP, MMP / TIMP, TGF-β, galectin-3), markers of heart failure (NT-proBNP,
      sST2). The investigators will conduct immunophenotyping of circulating progenitor cells (CD45
      + / CD34 + / collagen-I +) by flow cytometry, and assess molecular-genetic markers of
      endothelial damage (microRNA-126, microRNA-21, microRNA-27, miRNA-125 and miRoRNA-155).
