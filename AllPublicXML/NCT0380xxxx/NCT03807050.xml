  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Astaxanthin is a xanthophyll carotenoid, a naturally occurring lipid-soluble red pigment.
      Apart from its coloring ability it is also a strong antioxidative ingredient and contains
      health-promoting properties.

      Study aim is to monitor the safety and tolerability of AstaFerm™, an astaxanthin dietary
      supplement derived from the yeast Phaffia rhodozyma. Pharmacokinetics profile is tested in 12
      healthy male adults who received a single dose of AstaFerm™ in a single-center, open-label,
      non-randomized, single-dose study. Subjects are admitted to the clinical research center on
      the evening before dosing. On the next morning, after overnight fast, pre-dosing plasma
      sampling is performed, then they receive a fat balanced breakfast followed by a single
      administration of AstaFerm™ capsules. The capsules contain 50 milligram astaxanthin derived
      from Phaffia rhodozyma. Following dosing, blood sampling is performed for 24 hours in-house
      (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 and 24-hours post-dose) and ambulatory at 48, 72- and 168-hours
      post-dose. Blood for antioxidant activity assessment is also drawn.
