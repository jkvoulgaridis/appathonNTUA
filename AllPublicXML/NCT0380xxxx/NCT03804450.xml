  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study was conducted to test whether pulp-like tissue can be regenerated in mature
      teeth with closed apex? And whether the size of the apical diameter affects the success of
      REPs? And whether Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be used to quantitatively assess the
      vitality of the regenerated pulp-like tissue.

    <textblock>
      Regenerative endodontic procedures via blood clot were done on 18 mature anterior necrotic
      teeth with periapical lesions. The teeth were randomly assigned into two groups according to
      the size of the apical diameter of the rotary files used for instrumentation.

      In the test group, rotary instrumentation was done using Pro-taper Next till size X3, while
      in the control group, instrumentation was done till size X5.

      Calcium hydroxide was used as an intracanal medication for 1-2 weeks. Calcium hydroxide was
      then washed away using 1.5%NaOCl, followed by induction of blood using pre-curved K-fi;e #25
      2mm past the radiographic apex. Biodentine was then used as a cervical plug over the blood
      clot followed by resin-modified glass ionomer cement and composite resin as coronal
      restoration.

      MRI was used to assess the vitality of the regenerated pulp-like tissue, where the signal
      intensity of the regenerated pulp-like tissue was measured after 3,6 and 12 months follow up
      and compared to the normal contralateral teeth. In addition, sensibility tests using cold
      test and electric pulp testing were used to assess vitality of regenerated pulp-like tissue
      after 3,6,9 and 12 months. Cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) was also used to assess the
      healing of the periapical lesion after 12 months.
