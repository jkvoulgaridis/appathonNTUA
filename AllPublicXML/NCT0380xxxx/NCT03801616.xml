  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study of virtual reality (VR) non-opioid management for women undergoing
      mastectomy and implant-based reconstruction. Study participants will receive specialized VR
      interventions, administered via VR headsets, to manage pain.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to estimate the effect of utilizing VR on reducing
      opioid use in study participants undergoing mastectomy with implant-based reconstruction
      compared to the control group. Investigators will follow patients throughout the course of
      their hospitalization and monitor outcomes including pain levels, medication requests, and
      satisfaction.

      Eligible participants will receive a VR headset and instructed to use the VR every time they
      feel pain and before asking for a pain medication. They can take pain medications, if they
      choose to do so. At their post-op visit, study participants will be interviewed and asked
      questions regarding their experience with VR.

      Pain level and medication use will be compared with similar individuals who undergo the same
      procedure but are not provided with a VR headset.

    <description>Opioid usage is defined as mean total milligrams of morphine equivalent (MME), calculated by first multiplying the quantity of each prescribed medication by the strength of that medication (milligrams of given opioid per unit dispensed), and then multiplying this quantity-strength product by conversion factors derived from published sources to estimate the milligrams of morphine equivalent to the opioids dispensed in the prescription.</description>

    <description>Pain collected via ecological momentary assessment by hospital staff. Study participants will be asked by their assigned nurse to rate their pain using a standard 11-point numeric rating scale (NRS), where 0 is &quot;no pain&quot; and 10 is &quot;worst imaginable pain.&quot;</description>
