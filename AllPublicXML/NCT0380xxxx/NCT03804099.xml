  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of irreversible visual impairment
      in Western Countries. It is a well-established fact that vascular endothelial growth factor
      (VEGF) plays a key part in the development of the neovascular (or exsudative) form of AMD.
      Today, VEGF-inhibition by means of injection of anti-VEGF agents into the vitreous cavity
      constitutes the gold standard of AMD therapy. In physiological conditions, VEGF acts as a
      vasodilator by activating endothelial nitric oxide synthase. As a consequence, VEGF
      inhibition should result in significant ocular vasoconstriction, which has in fact been
      demonstrated for bevacizumab and ranibizumab, two of the three available VEGF-inhibitors. The
      understanding and awareness of potentially harmful implications of the induced
      vasoconstriction on retinal and/or optic nerve head structure and function is sparse. This is
      especially delicate, as most patients with exsudative AMD require repeated injections on a
      monthly basis for many years. Aflibercept, the latest anti-VEGF agent approved for
      intravitreal use in 2011, offers a superior binding affinity for VEGF compared to the former
      two drugs. However, as of today, its effect on ocular circulation is unclear. With Laser
      Speckle Flowgraphy (LSFG), a commercially available, non-invasive and patient-friendly method
      for the evaluation of blood flow at the optic nerve head, the choroid and retina has arisen
      in recent years.

      We aim to measure ocular perfusion with LSFG before and after 3 consecutive injections of
      aflibercept in unilateral neovascular age-related maculopathy.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Men and women aged over 50 years

          -  written informed consent for participation in the study

          -  Scheduled for 3 consecutive intravitreal injections (4 week intervals) of aflibercept
             for treatment of exudative AMD in one eye

          -  Subject is generally healthy with no current significant or a history of a significant
             neurological, cardiovascular, pulmonary (including asthma), hepatic, metabolic,
             rheumatic, autoimmune, hematological or renal disorder, as determined by the
             investigator's clinical judgment through collection of medical history and performance
             of a physical examination. A significant disorder is defined as a disease or medical
             condition associated with impaired health status, requiring regular or current medical
             treatment and/or follow up. For the purposes of this study, an investigator may
             classify a medical condition as a nonsignificant disorder despite the fact that the
             subject receives treatment. Subjects having controlled Stage 1 hypertension (blood
             pressure of 140-159 mmHg systolic and/or 90-99 mmHg diastolic) are eligible for
             participation in this study.

          -  Normal findings in the medical history unless the investigator considers an
             abnormality to be clinically irrelevant

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Active exudative AMD requiring treatment of both eyes

          -  Ocular surgery (including intravitreal injection) during the 3 months preceding the
             study

          -  Vitrectomized eyes

          -  Ametropia &gt; 6 Dpt

          -  Relevant ophthalmic diseases/conditions that could interfere with LSFG measurements
             (e.g. glaucoma, optic nerve head drusen, tilted disc, etc.)

          -  Ocular infection or clinically significant inflammation

          -  Opacities of the cornea (e.g. corneal scars, corneal oedema), the lens (e.g. LOCS-II
             grading &gt; 2, posterior capsule opacification) or the vitreous (e.g. vitreous
             haemorrhage, asteroid hyalosis)

          -  Patients who are not able to cooperate or with insufficient ability to fixate (tremor,
             nystagmus)

          -  Blood donation in the 3 weeks preceding the study

          -  Participation in a clinical trial in the 3 weeks preceding the study

          -  Pre- or perimenopausal women
