  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Peripheral pulmonary lesions (PPL) are defined as nodules or masses that are located in the
      lung periphery; hence cannot be seen via regular bronchoscopy. Due to their location,
      establishing a pathological diagnosis can be challenging. Investigations of PPL has
      significantly evolved in the last decade with the development of new technologies such as
      peripheral endobronchial ultrasound (pEBUS), virtual bronchoscopy and electromagnetic
      navigational bronchoscopy (ENB). Although these technologies have allowed physicians to
      safely biopsy previously difficult to access nodules, their sensitivity have been lower than
      trans-thoracic needle aspiration (TTNA). In fact, the largest registry to date has found a
      diagnostic yield of pEBUS of 57% compared to 93% for TTNA. However, TTNA caries substantially
      more procedural risk than pEBUS with a 25% rate of complication vs 2.8% for pEBUS (1, 2).
      With increased sensitivity, pEBUS could become the procedure of choice for PPL investigation
      in view of its safety profile. Rapid on-site evaluation of biopsy samples by a
      cytopathologist (ROSE) allows for direct evaluation of specimen adequacy. By offering
      real-time feedback to the bronchoscopist about specimen adequacy, the adding of ROSE to pEBUS
      could lead to an increase in diagnostic yield, allowing for a faster diagnosis of lung cancer
      and avoiding the need for further diagnostic procedures. Minitiazuration of broncoscopes can
      also allow navigation to more distal areas of the lung closer to the PPL. While this may also
      improve diagnostic yield, other technical modification such as the need for smaller sampling
      instruments and inability to use a guide sheath may have drawbacks.

      This study will use a 2 x 2 factorial design to compare diagnostic yield of pEBUS
      bronchoscopic PPL sampling with vs. without ROSE as well as with a novel &quot;slim&quot; bronchoscope
      vs. standard bronchoscope. The investigators aim to randomize 208 patients to independently
      test each hypothesis.
