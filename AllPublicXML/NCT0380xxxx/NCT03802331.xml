    <textblock>
      The main objective of this trial is to assess the effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of
      an oral tablet formulation of BI 1323495 by investigating the relative bioavailability
      following single dose administration under fed and fasted conditions.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion criteria:

          -  Healthy male subjects according to the assessment of the investigator, as based on a
             complete medical history including a physical examination, vital signs (Blood Pressure
             (BP), Pulse Rate (PR)), 12-lead Electrocardiogram (ECG), and clinical laboratory tests

          -  Age of 18 to 45 years (inclusive)

          -  Body Mass Index (BMI) of 18.5 to 29.9 kg/m^2 (inclusive)

          -  Signed and dated written informed consent prior to admission to the study, in
             accordance with Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and local legislation

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Any finding in the medical examination (including Blood Pressure (BP), Pulse Rate (PR)
             or Electrocardiogram (ECG)) deviating from normal and assessed as clinically relevant
             by the investigator

          -  Repeated measurement of systolic blood pressure outside the range of 90 to 140 mmHg,
             diastolic blood pressure outside the range of 50 to 90 mmHg, or pulse rate outside the
             range of 50 to 90 beats per minute (bpm)

          -  Any laboratory value outside the reference range that the investigator considers to be
             of clinical relevance

          -  Any evidence of a concomitant disease assessed as clinically relevant by the
             investigator

          -  Gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal, respiratory, cardiovascular, metabolic,
             immunological or hormonal disorders

          -  Cholecystectomy or other surgery of the gastrointestinal tract that could interfere
             with the pharmacokinetics of the trial medication (except appendectomy or simple
             hernia repair)

          -  Diseases of the central nervous system (including but not limited to any kind of
             seizures or stroke), and other relevant neurological or psychiatric disorders

          -  History of relevant orthostatic hypotension, fainting spells, or blackouts

          -  Chronic or relevant acute infections

          -  History of relevant allergy or hypersensitivity (including allergy to the trial
             medication or its excipients)

          -  Use of drugs within 30 days of planned administration of trial medication that might
             reasonably influence the results of the trial (including drugs that cause QT/QTc
             interval prolongation)

          -  Intake of an investigational drug in another clinical trial within 60 days of planned
             administration of investigational drug in the current trial, or concurrent
             participation in another clinical trial in which investigational drug is administered

    <ipd_description>Clinical studies sponsored by Boehringer Ingelheim, phases I to IV, interventional and non‐interventional, are in scope for sharing of the raw clinical study data and clinical study documents, except for the following exclusions:
1. studies in products where Boehringer Ingelheim is not the license holder; 2. studies regarding pharmaceutical formulations and associated analytical methods, and studies pertinent to pharmacokinetics using human biomaterials; 3. studies conducted in a single center or targeting rare diseases (because of limitations with anonymization).
