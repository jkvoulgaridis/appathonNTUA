    <textblock>
      This trial assesses current biomarker testing practices for common solid cancers in precision
      oncology in the community setting. Cancer biomarkers are used for diagnosing the disease,
      determining prognosis, predicting response to a targeted therapy, or monitoring response to
      therapy. Testing quality, including accuracy and timeliness, is imperative for correct
      disease prognosis and identification of patients who may or may not benefit from a targeted
      therapy. Assessing current biomarker testing practices may help doctors identify gaps and
      variations in testing as well as on potential ?best practices? that may be informative and
      generalizable to community oncology programs.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine capacity of pathology practices within National Cancer Institute (NCI) Community
      Oncology Research Program (NCORP) components/subcomponents for testing guideline-recommended
      biomarkers, including whether these biomarkers are tested, and how, i.e. what technologies
      are used and what ordering and testing processes / protocols have been implemented.

      II. Determine capacity for testing for novel biomarkers and tumor molecular profiling, i.e.
      whether these biomarkers are tested and how, i.e. what technologies are used what ordering
      and testing processes/protocols have been implemented.

      III. For findings in Objectives 1 and 2, determine factors influencing the heterogeneity of
      capacity for biomarker testing, particularly those factors that are modifiable (based on the
      conceptual framework above), such as cost, complexity, technologic complexity, lack of
      familiarity, physician and patient demand.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants complete a self-administered web-based Biomarker Survey and may also complete an
      Outcome Validation Survey.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Presence of reflexive testing protocols for guideline-recommended biomarkers</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 9 months</time_frame>
    <description>Defined as standing protocols that do not require an oncologist order for each of the following: 1) EGFR and ALK testing in lung cancer; 2) KRAS testing in colorectal cancer; 3) BRAF testing in melanoma; and 4) HER2 testing in breast cancer. Will itemize each guideline recommendation and determine whether each pathology practice has reflexive testing protocols through self-report on the assessment. The proportion of pathology practices and exact 95% two-sided confidence intervals with reflexive-testing protocols will be calculated.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Average turnaround time of no more than 10 business days for combined EGFR and ALK results reporting in lung cancer</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 9 months</time_frame>
    <description>The pathology practices will indicate the average number of business days between the day the tumor tissue is available and the day that all the test results are reported to the physician. Pathology practices will be considered meeting guidelines if the average is less than or equal to 10 days. The proportion of pathology practices and exact 95% two-sided confidence intervals with average turnaround time within 10 business days will be calculated.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Factors influencing heterogeneity of capacity for biomarker testing, from among modifiable testing practice-related factors, e.g. cost, complexity, technologic complexity, lack of familiarity, physician and patient demand</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 9 months</time_frame>
    <description>For each biomarker-cancer combination being investigated, univariate and multivariate logistic regression modelling will be performed. There will be variables collected at the oncology component/subcomponent level and variables collected at the pathology practice level. The analysis will be completed at the level of the pathology practice, so characteristics of the oncology component/subcomponent will have to be adapted to that of the pathology practice: repeated for all of pathology practices used by one oncology component/subcomponent, or consolidated for pathology practices that service multiple oncology component/subcomponent. Variables used to assess heterogeneity will be (a) component/subcomponent characteristics: geography (census region), size (number of adult oncology beds), safety-net hospital, minority/underserved National Cancer Institute (NCI) Community Oncology Research Program (NCORP) component/subcomponent, academic hospital, public-ownership type.</description>

        Onsite pathology practices within NCORP components and subcomponents that provide services
        to adult oncology groups
      </textblock>
    </study_pop>
    <sampling_method>Non-Probability Sample</sampling_method>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The study population is all onsite pathology practices within NCORP components and
             subcomponents that provide services to adult oncology groups.

          -  An onsite pathology practice is a laboratory (lab) that is financially administered
             and operated by an NCORP component or subcomponent. This excludes commercial reference
             laboratories, such as Quest and LabCorp. To describe biomarker testing practices
             across NCORP components/subcomponents, we will use the pathology practice as the unit
             of analysis. Participating components/subcomponents should meet [element A] AND [at
             least one element of B OR C OR D] AND element E.

               -  A) NCORP component/subcomponent provides services to adult oncology groups.

               -  B) A single onsite pathology lab (and its set of testing practices), may provide
                  biomarker/pathology testing services to one or more components or subcomponents.
                  Irrespective of the number of components/subcomponents that use this pathology
                  lab, we will consider this as one pathology practice, and one unit of analysis.

               -  C) Several onsite pathology labs may provide services to one NCORP component or
                  subcomponent, e.g. if the NCORP component or subcomponent represents a health
                  system with several hospitals, and each hospital may have its own onsite
                  pathology lab, with each pathology lab following its own set of testing
                  practices. Therefore, each lab will represent one pathology practice and one unit
                  of analysis.

               -  D) More than one onsite pathology lab may use a common set of testing practices
                  and provide services to one or more NCORP components or subcomponents. Given
                  common testing practices, we will consider these labs as one pathology practice,
                  and one unit of analysis.

               -  E) The pathology practice has an informed individual who is willing to serve as a
                  representative and gather information to complete the assessment items. This
                  person typically is the pathology practice medical director, pathology practice
                  administrative director and/or their designees.
