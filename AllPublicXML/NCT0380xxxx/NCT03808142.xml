  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study researchers want to learn more about the medication usage behavior among
      multiple sclerosis (MS) patients treated with Betaferon using the myBETAapp which includes
      the elements to what extent

        -  taking medication matches the presciber´s recommendation (adherence, compliance),

        -  treatment for the prescribed duration (persistence) is continued and

        -  injections were missed. Among MS patients treated with Betaferon using the myBETAapp the
           study will also collect information on the health-related quality of life , treatment
           satisfaction and satisfaction with treatment support.

All data recorded in the myBETAapp including demographic and injection-related data will be stored in the database once the mobile device is connected to the internet.</description>

    <ipd_description>Availability of this study's data will be determined according to Bayer's commitment to the EFPIA/PhRMA &quot;Principles for responsible clinical trial data sharing&quot;. This pertains to scope, timepoint and process of data access.
As such, Bayer commits to sharing upon request from qualified researchers patient-level clinical trial data, study-level clinical trial data, and protocols from clinical trials in patients for medicines and indications approved in the US and EU as necessary for conducting legitimate research. This applies to data on new medicines and indications that have been approved by the EU and US regulatory agencies on or after January 01, 2014.
Interested researchers can use www.clinicalstudydatarequest.com to request access to anonymized patient-level data and supporting documents from clinical studies to conduct research. Information on the Bayer criteria for listing studies and other relevant information is provided in the Study sponsors section of the portal.</ipd_description>
