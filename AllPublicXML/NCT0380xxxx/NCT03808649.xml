      Small bowel distension is mandatory for the assessment of the bowel wall in CT enterography,
      but some patients were sufferring inadequate small bowel distension. So, it is important to
      prescribe personalized regimen according to patient's personal characteristics.

      CT enterography has become an important tool in the evaluation of small bowel diseases,
      especially in patients with inflammatory bowel diseases. Small bowel distension is mandatory
      for the assessment of the bowel wall. So, it is important to find clinical risk factors for
      inadequate small bowel distension and prescribe personalized regimen according to patient's
      personal characteristics to reduce patient acceptance.

    <description>The assessment system includes four parts
Whether the contrast reached the caecum is evaluate and recorded as &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;
The overall presence of inhomogeneous contrast is evaluated and recorded as &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;
The maximum dimension of a single loop in each quadrant was recorded.
The scale of loops of small bowel distended are evaluated and recorded as &quot;0%-25%&quot;,&quot;26%-50%&quot;,&quot;51%-75%&quot;,&quot;75%-100%&quot;</description>
