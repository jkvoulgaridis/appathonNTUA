  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During pregnancy and lactation, the consumption of PUFA n-3, through the consumption of food
      products that contain more ALA than conventional products, could impact nutritional and
      non-nutritional breast milk quality (immune criteria, metabolites, hormones), and also the
      implantation of the intestinal microbiota of the newborn, which is involved in preservation
      of short term and long term health of the child.
