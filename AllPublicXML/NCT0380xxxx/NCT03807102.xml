  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tumor vaccines may make the body build an immune response to kill tumor cells. This research
      study is evaluating a new type of tumor vaccine termed as &quot;Neoantigen Tumor Vaccine&quot;. The
      purpose of this phase I/II trial study is to assess the safety and effectiveness of
      neoantigentumor vaccine in post radical operation patients with stage IIIA lung cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Outline: After successful vaccine manufacturing, patients receive neoantigen tumor vaccine
      hypodermically (5 injections for each 3 days and then 1 injection for each 3 months till
      recurrence or up to 2 years). Treatment continues in the absence of disease recurrence and
      metastasis or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed for 2 years or up to the absence of disease recurrence and metastasis.

      Projected accrual: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study.
