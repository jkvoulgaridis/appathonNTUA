    <textblock>
      In this pilot and feasibility study, the investigator will randomize 100 African-American,
      Hispanic, and/or Medicaid (all race/ethnicities) patients from KPNW with A1C ≥ 8 to one of
      two 6-month interventions: 1) patient navigation only; or 2) patient navigation + diabetes
      self-management training. Feasibility of a large-scale, pragmatic, randomized trial will be
      determined and preliminary effectiveness of treatment arms on A1C reduction among
      racial/ethnic minority and low-income patients with poorly managed diabetes will be examined.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this feasibility study is to inform the design of a future large-scale,
      randomized trial that will test if there is added benefit to addressing both social and
      economic needs and diabetes self-management to improve diabetes management long-term among
      vulnerable populations. In this pilot, the investigator will randomize 100 African-American,
      Hispanic, and/or Medicaid (all race/ethnicities) patients from Kaiser Permanente Northwest
      (KPNW) with A1C ≥ 8 and poor follow-up in primary care to one of two 6-month interventions:
      1) patient navigation only; or 2) patient navigation + diabetes self-management training. In
      both study arms, KPNW practice-embedded patient navigators will screen for medical, social
      and economic needs and connect participants to internal and external resources. In the second
      study arm, navigators will also refer participants to community health workers (CHWs)
      embedded in local community-based organizations, who will deliver diabetes self-management
      training. Feasibility of the full-scale trial will be based on several measures including
      recruitment, retention, success rate of referrals to navigators and CHWs, and whether
      medical, social, and/or economic needs are met. Qualitative interviews will be conducted with
      various stakeholders to assess intervention acceptability and determinants of implementation.
      Preliminary effects of A1C, diabetes-related care gaps, health care utilization, and
      medication adherence will also be examined. This pragmatic study design involves a
      collaborative effort among researchers, health system staff, health system senior leadership,
      and local community-based organizations. Findings from the full-scale trial will contribute
      critical knowledge on the most effective, sustainable model of care for integrating lay
      health workers in the efforts to improve diabetes management among high risk patient
      populations.

    <description>Participants randomized to the patient navigation only arm will be referred to a KPNW patient navigator using a standard electronic health record-based referral process. Once the participant has completed the Your Current Life Situation (YCLS) assessment with study staff, the navigator will receive the referral and follow-up with the participant to address the social and economic needs identified. The patient navigator will follow-up with the participant 2-3 times over the 6 month period by phone or in-person about progress with the referral and help address additional needs that may develop during the 6-month intervention. Participant will also receive monthly mailing of American Diabetes Association educational materials.</description>

    <description>In addition to receiving patient navigation as described above, participants in this arm will also be referred to Project Access NOW by study staff using REDCap. As part of the partnership with KPNW, Project Access NOW will be provided with participants' contact information via REDCap to facilitate the referral to a certified CHW within a community-based organization. Project Access NOW will connect participants to a community-based organization based on their preference, previous experience with an agency, geography, and capacity.
The CHW will follow-up with the participant to conduct a home visit and follow-up on community-based referrals already placed by the KPNW patient navigator and assess for additional needs. The timing of the diabetes self-management training will be based on the needs of the participant.</description>

    <description>The Decision-making Education for Choices in Diabetes Everyday (DECIDE) program is a nine-module, literacy adapted diabetes and cardiovascular disease education and problem-solving training program. Participants are taught the five steps of problem solving with each module going in depth on a single step: 1) identify the problem; 2) brainstorm possible strategies for problem resolution; 3) select the most appropriate strategy; 4) apply the strategy; 5) evaluate the effectiveness of the strategy. During the six months, CHWs will have weekly or bi-weekly contract with participants in-person or by phone to deliver the DECIDE modules and address social and economic needs.</description>
