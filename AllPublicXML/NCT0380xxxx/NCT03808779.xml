  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The treatment of Papillary Thyroid Microcarcinoma (PTMC) nowadays varies among physicians,
      surgeons and radiologist. The recently published articles show that the prognosis of PTMC by
      different means of treatment strategies tends to be good. But multicentered, randomized,
      parallel and prospective study is rare. RFA is the abbreviation of &quot;Radiofrequency Ablation&quot;,
      which tends to be an alternative strategy except conventional surgery. The investigator aims
      to confirm whether RFA for treating PTMC braces same effectiveness and prognosis comparing
      with conventional surgery. Besides, this trial also investigates the safety, economy and
      psychological quality under different treatments.

      The incidence of thyroid carcinoma, especially the papillary thyroid microcarcinoma (PTMC),
      has increasingly rapidly, due to the development of technologies of diagnosis, during the
      past 20 years. PTMC defined by the World Health Organization (WTO) as the largest dimension
      less than 1 cm. Previous autopsy study demonstrated that the lesions are normal in many
      people and accompany them latently until they die because of another reasons. The long-term
      outcome of PTMC is good and, as expected, more than 90% PTMC aren't progress for many years.

      Ultrasound-guided Radiofrequency Ablation (RFA) treatment was introduced to clinical practice
      few years ago. According to the 2015 American Thyroid Association (ATA) guideline, the
      treatment of radiofrequency and laser ablation are mentioned to be used in recurrent thyroid
      cancer. But clinical practice shows that the RFA treatment for low risk PTMC braces well
      effect，low financial budget，high safety and even rare postoperative complication.

      Although the cohort study was performed before, the real answer concerning about whether RFA
      is a rational choice for treating PTMC lacks more powerful evidences. The investigator
      considers to perform a randomized, controlled and multicenter study as a high-quality
      evidence and demonstrated the effect of PRF in low risk PTMC treatment.

    <description>Patients were supine with the neck exposure completely during the procedure. Local anesthesia with 1% lidocaine was injected at the subcutaneous puncture site and the thyroid anterior capsule. If the distance between the tumor and critical cervical structures was less than 5 mm, normal saline was injected to form at least 1 cm distance between the tumor and the critical structure to prevent the unwilling thermal injury. RFA was performed using the moving-shot technique and RFA power was 5 W, if a transient hyperechoic zone did not form at the electrode tip within 5-10 seconds. The RFA extent exceeded the tumor edge to prevent marginal residue and recurrence. The ablation was terminated when all portions of the target ablation area had changed to hyperechoic zones.</description>

    <description>Patient is performed total thyroidectomy or thyroid lobectomy depending on the intraoperative situation, disease condition and comprehensive judge by surgeon. Patients are routinely disinfected and spread the drapes after general anesthesia. Neck skin, fat and placenta muscle are incised and separated successively. The flap is separated to the upper edge of thyroid cartilage, neck white line is incised and anterior muscle group is separated. Then both sides thyroid lobes are exposed. Cut off the isthmus, ligature the thyroid artery, cut off the upper pole. Ligature and cut off the ipsilateral thyroid vein. Reveal and protect the ipsilateral recurrent laryngeal nerve and the parathyroid gland during the entire process.</description>
