  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The fibrotic interstitial lung diseases (fILD) is a group of debilitating chronic lung
      conditions that are characterised by scarring of lung tissue, dyspnoea on exertion and
      significant physical impairment. Exercise training is recommended for people with fILD in
      improving breathlessness and exercise tolerance. However, despite the best efforts of
      patients and clinicians, many of those who participate are not attaining its benefits. The
      current exercise training strategies of moderate intensity continuous training may not be
      well suited to fILD. High intensity interval training (HIIT), short bouts of high-intensity
      exercise regularly interspersed with periods of rest or light exercise may be an alternate
      exercise training option for people with fILD.

      The study will determine to whether HIIT is better than the current method of continuous
      exercise training at moderate intensity in improving exercise tolerance, breathlessness and
      quality of life in people with fILD. A randomised controlled, assessor blinded trial will be
      conducted. A total 130 people with fILD will be randomly assigned to moderate intensity
      continuous training or HIIT. If this trial demonstrates that HIIT is effective, it will
      provide an exercise training strategy that can readily be implemented in practice that will
      maximise the outcomes of exercise training for people with fILD.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Interstitial lung disease (ILD) is a chronic lung condition characterized by scarring of lung
      tissue. This stiffening of the lungs impairs breathing and reduces the amount of oxygen being
      delivered throughout the body limiting the ability to perform daily and physical activity.
      Around two-thirds of people with ILD have fibrotic ILD (fILD), a type of ILD, which typically
      has worse impairment and disability than other types of ILD. There is no cure for these
      conditions, although there are two new pharmacological therapies that slow the decline in
      lung function in Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF), the most common type of fILD. These
      treatments however do not provide improvement in breathlessness, exercise capacity or
      health-related quality of life (HRQoL).

      Exercise training, or Pulmonary Rehabilitation (PR), has shown to be effective at improving
      exercise tolerance and HRQoL in ILD. The investigators recently demonstrated that, at a group
      level, exercise training exerts a positive effect across varying subtypes of ILD, including
      IPF, the most rapidly progressive of all the fILDs. However less than half of those with IPF
      who undertook the exercise training achieved meaningful improvements in exercise capacity. In
      addition, a large proportion of people with IPF were unable to keep up with the recommended
      exercise training level, often due to excessive dyspnoea or desaturation. This suggests the
      current exercise training strategies used in PR, which were adopted from guidelines for
      patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), may not provide the optimal
      exercise stimuli for fILD. High intensity interval training (HIIT), which is short bouts of
      high intensity exercise regularly interspersed with periods of rest or light exercise, may be
      an alternate exercise training option for people with fILD. However, it is unknown whether
      this kind of exercise training achieves superior benefits to the traditional model of PR.

      The aim of this project is to determine whether HIIT is better than the current method of
      continuous exercise training at moderate intensity, in improving exercise capacity,
      breathlessness and HRQoL in people with fILD. A total 130 people with fILD will be recruited.
      The trial will be conducted at four hospital sites across Australia. People who agree to take
      part in the study will be randomly allocated into two groups. Group 1 will undergo the
      traditional PR model of moderate intensity continuous exercise training and group 2 will
      undergo HIIT. Participants in both groups will participate in exercise training twice weekly
      for eight weeks. The participants will be monitored continuously during exercise by an
      experienced physiotherapist or exercise physiologist. At the beginning and the end of the
      eight weeks of exercise training, and six months later, participants will undergo
      measurements of exercise capacity and health status. This study will determine whether HIIT
      is effective, providing an important exercise training strategy that can be readily used for
      people with fILD to achieve positive benefits from PR.

    <measure>Change in dyspnea measured using the Dyspnea-12 questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, nine weeks and 6 months following intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Dyspnea-12 is a uni-dimensional 12-item questionnaire divided in 2 domains: physical items (1 to 7) and affective items (8-12). Each item evaluate breathing experience and can be scored as: None (0), Mild (1), Moderate (2) or Severe (3). Results of this questionnaire will be reported as total score that can range from 0 to 36 and separate scores that can range from 0 to 21 for physical component and 0 to 15 for affective component. Higher scores indicate worse dyspnea.</description>

    <measure>Changes in fatigue evaluated by the Fatigue Severity Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, nine weeks and 6 months following intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), a self reported rating scale including 9 items to measure how fatigue affects motivation, exercise, physical functioning, carrying out duties and how fatigue interferes with work, family, or social life. Each item is scored on a 7 point scale in which 1 = strongly disagree and 7= strongly agree. Total score range from 9 to 63. Higher scores indicate greater fatigue severity.</description>

    <measure>Change in health related quality of life using the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis specific version (SGRQ-I)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, nine weeks and 6 months following intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The SGRQ-I is a disease specific HRQoL measure with similar psychometric properties to the original SGRQ that is designed to be more relevant in patients with IPF. The questionnaire is divided in 3 domains: Symptoms (frequency and severity), Activity (activities that cause or are limited by breathlessness) and Impact (social functioning and psychological disturbances resulting from airways disease). Values of each domain as well as the total score value will be reported. Each item is weighted based on empirical data. Total score and scores in each domain can range from 0 to 100. Higher scores indicate more limitations in quality of life.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, nine weeks and 6 months following intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The CRQ consists of 20 items across 4 domains: Dyspnea (activities that cause breathlessness and are performed frequently), fatigue, emotional function and mastery ( the patient's feeling of control over their disease). Each domain includes four to seven items, and each item is scored on a 7-point Likert score. Total scores for each domain range from 4-35. Values of each domain will be reported. Lower scores indicate more limitations in quality of life.</description>
