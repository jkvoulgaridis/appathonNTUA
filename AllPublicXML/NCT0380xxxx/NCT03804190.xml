    <textblock>
      Musculoskeletal disorders(MSD) are one of the most common causes of occupational injuries and
      disability in industrialized nations and developing countries .with substantial financial
      consequences due to workers' compensation and medical expenses Otolaryngology (pronounced
      oh/toe/lair/in/goll/oh/jee) is the oldest medical specialty in the United States.
      Otolaryngologists are physicians trained in the medical and surgical management and treatment
      of patients with diseases and disorders of the ear, nose, throat (ENT), and related
      structures of the head and neck. They are commonly referred to as ENT physicians.

      MSD were identified as a significant issue for the profession and Research has recognized
      that MSD in Otolaryngology contribute considerably to sick leave, reduced productivity and
      leaving the profession Because there are few studies available about MSD among Egyptian
      otolaryngologists So, the purpose of this study is to investigate musculoskeletal disorders
      among Egyptian otorhinlaryngologist and the relationship between the risk factors and the
      development of musculoskeletal disorders among Egyptian otolaryngologists
