    <textblock>
      This is a 36 months, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-groups,
      equivalence multicenter trial in patients with inactive Systemic Lupus Erythematosus to
      evaluate if low disease activity can be sustained with withdrawal of glucocorticoids in
      patients on stable clinical remission or low disease activity.
