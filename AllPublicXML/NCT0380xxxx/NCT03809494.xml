  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the performance of the HemaTrate™ Blood
      Filtration system in the treatment of critical limb ischemia. The primary endpoint measure is
      comparing the percentage of patients between the treatment arm and control arm who have
      freedom from major amputation, arterial intervention below the knee, and death through 12
      months.

    <description>Anticoagulated whole blood is loaded into the filtration system. During gravity filtration, the majority of platelets, plasma, and red blood cells pass through the filter into a filtrate bag. The TNCs are captured in the filter material and recovered via a back-flush with 0.9 % saline into a syringe.</description>
