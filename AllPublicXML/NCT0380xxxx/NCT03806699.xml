  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate safety, immunogenicity of ID93+GLA-SE compared to
      placebo following three intramuscular (IM) injections on Days 0, 28 and 56 in BCG-vaccinated
      QFT-negative healthy adolescent. The healthy adolescent will all have had the childhood TB
      vaccine called BCG, and all of them must have a negative result for a blood test for exposure
      to the bacteria that cause TB (QuantiFERON-TB Gold Plus, or &quot;QFT&quot;). Study participants will
      be followed for 12 months after the last injection for safety reasons. Blood will be drawn
      for laboratory tests for safety and immunogenicity tests. The study hypothesis is that the
      vaccine is safe and immunogenic in this study population.

      After signing a written informed consent to participate in the study(under the premise the
      legal representative also agree their children participate in the study), subjects will be
      screened by required assessments per protocol. Eligible subjects who meet the
      inclusion/exclusion criteria will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to Group 1, Group 2 or
      Control Group, receiving either ID93+GLA-SE or saline placebo on Days 0, 28 and 56. The
      investigator will evaluate the safety, immunogenicity of the Investigational Product in the
      subjects through-out the study.

      For safety assessment, subjects will be instructed to record any adverse events in the
      Subject diary after each vaccination. Subject's safety will be reported to the investigators
      after 7 days from each vaccination via site visit or a phone call. Solicited AEs will be
      collected up to 7 days after the final vaccination with the Investigational Product and
      unsolicited AEs will be collected up to 28 days after the final vaccination with the
      Investigational Product. For long-term safety assessment of the Investigational Product,
      serious adverse events and adverse events of special interest will be monitored up to 12
      months after the final vaccination with the Investigational Product.

      For immunogenicity assessment, blood samples will be collected and analyzed before and after
      each vaccination. QFT-Gold Plus testing will be performed after 1 month and 12 months from
      the final vaccination with the Investigational Product.

    <masking_description>Since the vials of ID93+GLA-SE and placebo control (normal saline) and their appearances after preparation are different, for double-blinding of the study, the study nurse who administers the study drug or the study pharmacist who stores and manages the study drug will be unblinded to maintain the quality of study blinding. Additionally, an unblinded study monitor will be responsible for confirming the quantity and release of the study drugs. Unblinded study personnels and unblinded study monitor should only be involved in the duties related to administration and/or recording of the study drug, and must not be involved in other duties that may break double-blinding of the study.</masking_description>
