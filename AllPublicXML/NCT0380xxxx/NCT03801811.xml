  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The use of glue as a device in the implantation of central venous catheters has recently been
      introduced into European clinical practice, initially with the aim of blocking bleeding at
      the point of exit of the PICCs, but at the same time also to close the cutaneous incision
      practiced to create the PORT positioning pocket.

      It is possible that the surgical incision created for the insertion of the PORT may undergo
      complications such as: local bleeding, infections or wounds of the surgical wound.

      A solution to this problem could be the application of the cyanoacrylate dermal glue on the
      edges of the surgical wound, after intradermal suture. The glue would have the purpose of
      sealing the surgical wound so as to immediately seal the skin incision with hemostatic effect
      and create a potential barrier against infections.

      Patient's informed consent signature for adhesion at the study will be initially requested.
      With their acceptance, parameters will be recorded anonymously in the Case Report Form,
      identified by a numeric code, until hospital discharge.

      The parameters analized will be related to:

        -  essential patient data (identification number, gender, age, height weight)

        -  basic diseases

        -  associated diseases and risk factors

        -  origin of the patient (department or home)

        -  reason for positioning

        -  hemorrhagic complications detected in the first 24 hours

        -  hemorrhagic complications detected in the first 7 days

        -  non-bleeding complications detected at 7 days (local and systemic infections, wound
           delescence)

      The data wil be transferred to an Excel worksheet, in order to conduct a descriptive analysis
      related to every variable

    <description>The use of glue as a device in the implantation of central venous catheters has recently been introduced into European clinical practice. It is possible that the surgical incision created for the insertion of the PORT may be subject to complications such as: local bleeding, which if not properly treated may last even a few days, infections or surgical wound outbreaks. This possibility of bleeding occurs more easily in patients suffering from coagulation problems or when appropriate preventive measures have not been taken at the time of implantation of the device. A solution to this problem could be the application of the cyanoacrylate dermal glue on the edges of the surgical wound, after intradermal suture. The glue would have the purpose of sealing the surgical wound so as to immediately seal the skin incision with hemostatic effect and create a potential barrier against bacterial infections.</description>
