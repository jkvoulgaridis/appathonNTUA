  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lack of quality-assured pediatric formulations of the first-line antituberculosis (anti-TB)
      drugs is barrier to optimized tuberculosis (TB) treatment outcome in children. In 2010 and
      subsequently modified in 2014, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended increased
      dosages of the first-line anti-TB drugs for children, but there were no child-friendly
      fixed-dose combination (FDC) formulations based on the guidelines. A large proportion of
      children treated with the new guidelines using old formulations did not achieve the desired
      rifampin peak concentration (Cmax) &gt; 8 mg/L and pyrazinamide Cmax &gt; 35 mg/L. The TB Alliance
      and the WHO led the development of a new child-appropriate isoniazid/rifampin/pyrazinamide
      (HRZ) and isoniazid/rifampin (HR) FDC formulation in line with current WHO recommended dosing
      guidelines. The new formulations dissolve quickly in liquid, have palatable fruit flavors,
      and are expected to improved daily adherence but no studies have evaluated the
      pharmacokinetics (PK) of the FDC formulation in children. The study team hypothesize that the
      new dispersible HRZ FDC tablet, dosed according to current WHO weight-band dosing
      recommendations will result in better PK parameters for each drug component than that
      achieved by the old formulation.

      This study will evaluate the PK of the new pediatric HRZ FDC tablet in Ghanaian children with
      TB with and without HIV coinfection. The new HRZ FDC dispersible tablet was designed to be
      child-friendly and to achieve recommended dosages for each weight-band. The formulation has
      been rolled out in Africa without PK studies in the target population to verify that the
      tablets achieves adequate drug concentrations. The current study will evaluate the adequacy
      of the formulation by examining the PK of the component drugs as well as the effect of HIV
      coinfection. The direct PK data will be used in a population PK model and stimulations to
      define optimal weight-band dosages and proportions of the components of the pediatric FDC
      tablets.
