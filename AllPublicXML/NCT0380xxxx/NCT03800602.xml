  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well nivolumab and metformin work in treating patients with
      microsatellite stable (MSS) stage IV colorectal cancer that has not responded to previous
      treatment. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab, may help the body's
      immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow
      and spread. Metformin is an antidiabetic drug that and may reduce the risk of colorectal
      cancer development in patients. Giving nivolumab and metformin may work better in treating
      patients with refractory microsatellite metastatic colorectal cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To evaluate the effect of nivolumab and metformin combination on the overall response rate
      (ORR) as assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the effect of nivolumab and metformin combination on clinical outcomes,
      progression free survival and overall survival, and biochemical response (CEA).

      II. To compare the effect of nivolumab and metformin combination on immune and metabolic
      biomarkers in the tumor microenvironment and systemic circulation (pre and post treatment
      paired biopsies required).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive metformin PO BID starting on day 1. After 14 days of metformin only period
      patients also receive nivolumab IV every 4 weeks starting on day 15. Courses repeat every 28
      days for up to 2 years in the absence of disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or
      consent withdrawal

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at day 30 and then periodically
      thereafter.
