  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Autoimmune polyendocrinopathy candidiasis ectodermal dystrophy (APECED) is an autosomal
      recessive disease caused by mutations in the autoimmune regulator (AIRE) gene, characterized
      by the clinical triad of chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis (CMC), hypoparathyroidism, and
      adrenal insufficiency. CMC can be complicated by systemic candidiasis or oral squamous cell
      carcinomas (SCCs) and may lead to death. The role of chronic Candida infection in the
      etiopathogenesis of oral SCC is unclear. Long term use of fluconazole lead to emergence of C.
      albicans strains with azoles decreased susceptibility. CMC is associated with an impaired
      Th17 cell response, however, it remains unclear whether decreased serum IL-17 and IL-22
      levels are related to a defect in cytokine production or to neutralizing autoantibodies
      resulting from mutations in the AIRE gene

                  women between the ages of 18 and 85.

               -  a reasonable delay of 2 weeks after the resolution of an intercurrent infectious
                  episode is to be observed.

               -  assent of the patient after information adapted to his age and his degree of
                  understanding.

               -  informed, express and written consent of the patient or of each of the holders of
                  parental authority.

          2. Inclusion criteria specific to group 1: Patients with a APS type 1 whose molecular
             diagnosis (mutation of the AIRE gene) has been established in the diagnosis of the
             disease, regardless of their mycological status (history of mycosis) or the presence
             of antifungal treatment.

          3. Inclusion criteria specific to group 2 : Patients with APS type 2: - with adrenal
             insufficiency for 50% of them. - a delay of two weeks after stopping antifungal or
             antibiotic treatment in patients is to be respected.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  impossibility to receive informed information for adults, or impossibility to receive
             enlightened information for the holders of parental authority if minor subject

          -  inability to participate in the entire study, refusal to sign the consent.

          -  people in an emergency situation.
