  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if the use of a pacing device, a metronome,
      improves functional outcome measures in aquatic therapy when compared to a control group.

    <description>The patients will be educated on proper performance of aquatic exercises following normal physical therapy procedures. Patients will start with 10-20 repetitions of the exercises depending on their physical ability and progressed as the patient's strength and endurance improve. Each session will last approximately 30 to 45 minutes. The BORG scale (a valid, subjective measure of perceived exertion) will be used as a monitoring device to ensure that a desired level of exercise intensity is reached. The desired level is a score between 12 and 16. The patients will be asked to rate their level of exertion at the end of each session. Intensity of the exercises will be adjusted the next session if the patient's reported level of exertion does not fall within the desired range. The pain rating and the BORG number will be recorded for both groups in the chart and flow</description>

  <intervention>
    <intervention_type>Device</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>Metronome</intervention_name>
    <description>Pacing aquatic exercises to the beats per minute of a metronome. The metronome will be adjusted to each patient's pain free exertion level. Patients will start with 10-20 repetitions of the exercises depending on their physical ability. The repetitions will be progressed as the patient's strength and endurance improve and noted in the chart and the flow sheet. The metronome will be synchronized during their second aquatic therapy treatment. The beats per minute (BPM) will be increased on the metronome during the series of treatments until the patient can no longer maintain proper technique with the exercises. The exercises will continue at this BPM during future visits. The patient will be instructed to keep pace with the beat of the metronome for the duration of the exercise.</description>
