  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sudden cardiac arrest (CA) in adults remains a major public health issue in industrialized
      countries, leading to a mortality rate greater than 90%. The analysis of French data
      estimates the number of sudden deaths at around 40,000 per year. The incidence rate for
      non-hospital CAs is 55 per 100,000 every year with an immediate survival rate of 9% and 4.8%
      at one year.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 80 % of patients who survive CA with cardiopulmonary resuscitation are
      comatose. The longer it lasts, the lower chances of recovery. The evaluation of the
      neurological prognosis of these patients is an important issue. Indeed, 72% of patients
      admitted to an intensive care unit after resuscitation from CA will give rise to an ethical
      discussion with the family. The prognostication strategy is usually based on a multimodal
      process involving clinical examination, electro-neurophysiological and biological
      examinations. We plan to study the relevance of early neurological prognostic tests in the
      aftermath of CA and in particular the most recent techniques such as the use of a clinical
      score (CAHP for Cardiac Arrest Hospital Prognosis), automated infrared pupillometry
      (NEUROLIGHT ALGISCAN, IDMED) for pupillary reflex measurement and quantitative analysis of
      the continuous amplitude-integrated electroencephalogram (aEEG) BRAIN QUICK ICU LINE,
      MICROMED. These new prognostic criteria for CA (CAHP score, pupillometry and aEEG) developed
      separately have not yet been integrated into a multimodal strategy.

      The goal of this study is to evaluate the performance of CAHP score, infrared automated
      pupillometry and aEEG to predict as early as 24h from ROSC the neurological prognosis
      (Cerebral Performance Categories) at hospital discharge.

    <description>The Cerebral Performance Categories (CPC) score is evaluated by a physician at hospital discharge (CPC baseline assessed on basal statut before CA). Good neurological outcome defined as CPC &lt;3. CPC 1: no or minor disability (conscious and independent, able to work and lead a normal life. May have mild dysphasia, non-incapacitating hemiparesis, or minor cranial nerve abnormalities). CPC 2: Moderate disability (Conscious and independent, able to travel by public transport and work in sheltered environment, independent in activities of daily life. May have hemiplegia, seizures, ataxia, dysarthria or memory changes). Poor neurological outcome defined as CPC 3-5. CPC 3: severe disability (conscious but dependent, limited cognition, dementia, locked-in, minimally conscious. Usually in institution, but sometimes looked after at home with exceptional family effort). CPC 4: unconscious (persistent vegetative state). CPC 5: dead (certified brain dead or traditional criteria).</description>
