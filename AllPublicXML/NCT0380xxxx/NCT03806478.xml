  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2 study assessing the safety, tolerability and efficacy of intranasal
      delivery of APH-1105 for the treatment of mild to moderate Alzheimer's in adult.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a multi-center, randomized, triple blind placebo-control with parallel groups.
      Patients diagnosed with mild to moderate AD will be enrolled and randomly assigned in a
      blinded fashion to receive study drug APH-1105. Groups will receive either 0.5 µg (15 active,
      5 placebo), 1.0 µg (15 active, 5 placebo), or 2.0 µg (15 active, 5 placebo). A full
      assessment will be made of all relevant tolerability and safety data.

      Patients will be administered the study drug outside of the clinic setting by a study partner
      twice a week. The initial dose of APH-1105 will take place in a clinic setting for the
      purpose of collecting initial Pharmacokinetic data.

      The total duration for patient participation will be approximately 18 weeks which includes 1
      week for screening, 12 weeks of treatment and followup 4 weeks post final dose. Study visits
      will occur during screening, baseline, weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, 12 and 16 for a total of 7 visits.
      Week 16 represents the followup visit after the final dose of study medication.

      Cognitive assessments will be performed at screening, and will repeat at weeks 4, 12 and 16.
      Behavioral Functioning and Quality of Life measures will be done at weeks 2,4,8,12 and 16.

      Blood samples will collected though out the study for Pharmacokinetic analyses.

    <description>Change in Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cog (ADAS-COG) total score from baseline to post final treatment dose.
The Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale test(ADAS-Cog) measures language and memory and is comprised of 2 parts targeting cognitive and non-cognitive functioning. It consists of 11 items which include (but not all) word recall, naming of objects, word recognition, comprehension and word finding. The ADAS-COG is scored 0-70. The higher the score the greater the impairment.</description>

    <description>Change in the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised from baseline to day 60 post final treatment dose The Hopkins Verbal Learning Test, a three-trial list of 12 words is a learning and free recall task. The Hopkins Verbal Learning Test measures episodic memory. The test is made up of three trials which requires the patient to free-recall words from the 12 word list involving yes/no responses. The score range is from 0-12. Lower scores (numbers) indicate more impairment.</description>

    <description>Change in the Behavioral Pathology in Alzheimer's Disease Rating Scale -Frequency-Weighted (BEHAVE-AD-FW). The Behavioral Pathology in Alzheimer's Disease Frequency Weighted Severity Scale (BEHAVE-AD-FW) assesses the possible neurological basis of behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia, the relationships between behavioral functioning and cognitive functioning. The scale consists of seven (7) behavioral categories (paranoid and delusional ideation, hallucinations, activity disturbances, aggressiveness, diurnal rhythm disturbances, affective disturbances, anxieties, and phobias) and consists of twenty-five (25) symptoms grouped into these categories. Items are score on a 4 point severity - higher the score, higher the impairment.</description>

    <description>Change in the Clinical Global Impression of Improvement (CGI-I) and the Caregiver Clinical Global Impression of Improvement (CGI-I) is a 3-item observer-rated scale that measures illness severity, global improvement or change, and therapeutic response. It is rated on a 7-point scale, with the severity of illness scale using a range of responses from 1 (normal) through to 7 (amongst the most severely ill patients). CGI-C scores range from 1 (very much improved) through to 7 (very much worse). Each component of the CGI is rated separately; the instrument does not yield a global score.</description>

    <measure>Risk of Suicide</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, week 4, 8, 12 and week 16 post final dose</time_frame>
    <description>The Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) is an assessment tool that evaluates suicidal ideation and behavior. It is comprised of ten categories, with binary responses (yes/no) to indicate a presence or absence of the behavior. The ten categories included in the C‐SSRS are as follows: Category 1 - Wish to be Dead; Category 2 - Non‐specific Active Suicidal Thoughts; Category 3 - Active Suicidal Ideation with Any Methods (Not Plan) without Intent to Act; Category 4 - Active Suicidal Ideation with Some Intent to Act, without Specific Plan; Category 5 - Active Suicidal Ideation with Specific Plan and Intent; Category 6 - Preparatory Acts or Behavior; Category 7 - Aborted Attempt; Category 8 - Interrupted Attempt; Category 9 - Actual Attempt (non‐fatal); Category 10 - Completed Suicide. A yes/no binary response is also utilized in assessing self‐injurious behavior without suicidal intent. The outcome of the C‐SSRS is a numerical score obtained from the these categories.</description>
