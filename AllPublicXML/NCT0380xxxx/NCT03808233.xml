  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the measurement properties of the Ability
      Captured Through Interactive Video Evaluation-mini (ACTIVE-mini) for quantifying movement in
      infants with Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA). Specifically, I will investigate within-day and
      between-day test-retest reliability and calculate the minimal detectable change of the
      ACTIVE-mini. Additionally, I will determine the concurrent validity of the ACTIVE-mini with
      The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia Infant Test for Neuromuscular Disease (CHOP INTEND)
      and the construct validity of the ACTIVE-mini in infants with SMA using a known group
      methodology.

      This study was a cross-sectional, repeated measure design, investigating the test-retest
      within- and between-day reliability and the convergent construct validity and the
      known-groups method construct validity of the ACTIVE-mini. The group variable included two
      levels (non-rolling infants with SMA and function matched non-rolling typically developing
      infants). The dependent variables included a predicted CHOP INTEND score determined by data
      captured by the ACTIVE-mini and the CHOP INTEND extremity score. The dependent variables were
      collected at two time points over two days at a minimum of 24 hours and no more than 30 days
      between collections. Variables were collected in a standard order of assessment. All
      participants underwent all assessments as set out in the procedures. Based on results from
      pilot data, the conclusion was made that the ACTIVE-mini could quantify infant movement
      parameters well enough to warrant further investigation. These data were important in
      establishing the feasibility of the specific aims of this research, because they provide
      initial validation of the ability of ACTIVE-mini to quantify basic infant movement parameters
