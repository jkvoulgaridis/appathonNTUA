  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A prospective longitudinal, observational study of adolescent and adults that will identify
      novel metabolites associated with dysphagia in Eosinophilic Esophagitis (EoE).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators seek to understand whether a metabolomic profile obtained
      from esophageal samples correlate with the symptom of dysphagia in adolescent and adults. The
      investigators hypothesize that intraluminal secreted metabolite(s) will change during
      episodes of dysphagia. The aim of the study will be to use a novel method of producing
      esophageal luminal samples, the esophageal string test, to capture esophageal metabolites
      when a patient is and is not experiencing dysphagia.

    <description>An EST will be performed for a 1hour sampling period on the same day as the scheduled clinic visit. Subjects will be asked to swallow a capsule and the attached EST string will be taped to the cheek with tegaderm tape. At the completion of the 1-hour sampling period, the EST will be removed and it will immediately be processed and cryopreserved for metabolomics profiling.</description>
