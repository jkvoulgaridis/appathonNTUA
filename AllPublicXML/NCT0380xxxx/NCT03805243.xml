  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      BioSerenity suggests developing innovative solutions, from intelligent clothes which can be
      used in a hospital environment or at home. These textiles allow, in particular, to measure
      the biophysiological signals while letting to the participant the freedom pursue its daily
      activities.

      BioSerenity has already developed two wearable wireless and portable medical devices:
      cardioskin with textile ECG electrods , and the Neuronaute with textile EEG, EMG electrods.

      The aim of the study is to test these sensors to optimize their signal to integrate them in
      future Bioserenity devices like a somnonaute to help diagnosis of sleep disorders, like
      uronaute to help diagnosis of urination disorders, like toconaute to help monitoring of
      pregnancy. Others CE-marked sensors developed by others manufacturers will be tested to
      choose those that will be integrated in the Bioserenity devices.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The various alone sensors tested in the clinical trial (sensors of Bioserenity and the other
      manufacturers), will supply information which will allow to develop future devices. Some of
      these sensors will then be selected to integrate them.

      The tests will be made according to the therapeutic area of the concerned device(plan). There
      are 5 therapeutic areas:

      Cardiovascular (Cardioskin device), neurology ( Neuronaute device), urology ( Uronaute
      device), obstetrics ( Toconaute device), somnologie (Somnonaute device).

      One subject would likely test either one sensor of a device or multiple sensors, either an
      entire device.
