  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, randomized, 2 way crossover, multiple dose, open label study of the effect
      of PF 04965842 on rosuvastatin PK in healthy participants. Participants will be randomized to
      1 of the 2 treatment sequences. A total of approximately 12 healthy male and/or female
      participants will be enrolled in the study so that approximately 6 participants will be
      enrolled in each treatment sequence. Each treatment sequence will consist of 2 periods. In
      both sequences, participants will remain in the CRU for a total of 11 days and 10 nights
      (including Period 1 and Period 2). To adequately remove any drug effects of rosuvastatin from
      Period 1 to Period 2, there will be a minimum 5 day washout period between the 2 rosuvastatin
      dosing events.

        Exclusion Criteria

        Participants are excluded from the study if any of the following criteria apply:

        Medical Conditions:

          1. Evidence or history of clinically significant hematological, renal, endocrine,

             condition (eg, contact dermatitis or psoriasis) or visible rash present during
             physical examination.

          3. Participants, who according to the product label for rosuvastatin, would be at

          8. Other acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition including recent (within the
             past year) or active suicidal ideation or behavior or laboratory abnormality that may
             increase the risk associated with study participation or investigational product
             administration or may interfere with the interpretation of study results and, in the
             judgment of the investigator, would make the participant inappropriate for entry into
             this study.

        Prior/Concomitant Therapy:

        10. Use of prescription or nonprescription drugs and dietary and herbal supplements within
        7 days or 5 half lives (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of investigational
        product.

        omeprazole, voriconazole, cimetidine, esomeprazole, and felbamate) or inducers (eg,
        rifampin, ritonavir, efavirenz, enzalutamide, phenytoin, and St. John's Wort) within 28
        days or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to dosing.

        diosmin, disulfiram, fluvastatin, fluvoxamine, voriconazole, efavirenz, isoniazid) or
        inducers (eg, aprepitant, carbamazepine, enzalutamide, rifampin, ritonavir, nevirapine,
        phenobarbital, and St. John's Wort) within 28 days or 5 half lives (whichever is longer)
        prior to dosing.

        12. Use of CYP3A4 inhibitors (eg, ketoconazole, ciprofloxacin, diltiazem) or other inducers
        (eg, phenytoin, carbamazepine) within 28 days or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) prior
        to dosing.

        Prior/Concurrent Clinical Study Experience:

        13. Previous administration with an investigational drug within 30 days (or as determined
        by the local requirement) or 5 half lives preceding the first dose of investigational
        product used in this study (whichever is longer).

        Diagnostic Assessments:

        14. A positive urine drug test. 15. Screening supine systolic blood pressure (BP) &lt;90 mm Hg
        or &gt;=140 mm Hg following at least 5 minutes of supine rest; OR Screening supine diastolic
        BP &lt;50 mm Hg or &gt;=90 mm Hg following at least 5 minutes of supine rest.

        If a participant meets any of these criteria, the BP should be repeated 2 more times and
        the average of the 3 BP values should be used to determine the participant's eligibility.

        16. Screening supine 12 lead ECG demonstrating:

          -  QTcF &gt;450 msec; OR

          -  QRS interval &gt;120 msec. If QTcF exceeds 450 msec, or QRS exceeds 120 msec, the ECG
             should be repeated 2 more times and the average of the 3 QTcF or QRS values should be
             used to determine the participant's eligibility.

             17. Participants with ANY of the following abnormalities in clinical laboratory tests
             at screening, as assessed by the study specific laboratory and confirmed by a single
             repeat test, if deemed necessary:

          -  Alkaline phosphatase, creatine kinase, aspartate aminotransferase (AST)/serum glutamic
             oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT)/serum glutamic

          -  Total bilirubin level &gt; ULN; participants with a history of Gilbert's syndrome may
             have direct bilirubin measured and would be eligible for this study provided the
             direct bilirubin level is &lt;=ULN.

          -  Estimated creatinine clearance &lt;90 mL/min.

          -  Confirmed microscopic proteinuria or hematuria.
