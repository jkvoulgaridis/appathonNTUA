      This research study will test the effects of macadamia nuts on adiposity, and traditional and
      emergent risk factors of cardiometabolic disease in adult men and women

      Purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of Macadamia nuts on body weight,
      adiposity, , oxidative stress, glucose, insulin an lipid levels. it will a randomized cross
      over study that will include two study diets (Macadamia nut diet and control diet) with a
      wash out period of 4 weeks in between. 40 subjects will be selected and randomized into
      either of the two phases. During the Macadamia nut diet phase subjects will be provided the
      appropriate portion of Macadamia nuts (15% of daily calories or 30-45 grams based on kcal
      requirement of the individual, instructions will be provided on how to incorporate nuts into
      the diet. this phase will last for 8 weeks. During the control diet phase, subjects will
      continue with their normal diet and abstain from eating nuts. subjects will be tested for
      various outcomes at baseline and twice at the end of each phase. The intervention will last
      for 5 months in total.

    <description>The objective of this measure is to see if eating macadamia nuts could reduce body weight. An In body machine will be used to identify this by measuring the weight of the participants at the baseline and at the end of each diet phase. The weight will be measured in Kilograms</description>
