  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the safety and tolerability of SP-420 and it's efficacy
      in terms of lowering iron in subjects with Beta-thalassemia or other rare anemias who need
      regular blood transfusions.

    <intervention_model_description>This is a multi-center, open-label, dose-escalation study designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and iron clearing efficacy of SP 420 administered three-times per week in subjects with transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia or other rare anemias. Approximately 24 subjects are to be enrolled in 3 cohorts (doses of 28 mg/kg, 56 mg/kg and 84 mg/kg) of approximately 8 subjects each. Based upon the results from lower dose cohorts, if needed the size of latter cohorts may be increased to improve the power of the study to detect efficacy to approximately 74 subjects in total.</intervention_model_description>
