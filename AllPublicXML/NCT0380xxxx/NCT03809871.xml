  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Participants who have signed up to the Watford Football Club Community and Education Trust
      Weight management programme called Shape Up will be approached to see if they would like to
      take part in this research study. Their participation in the Shape Up programme will not be
      affected if they do not choose to opt in to the research component. Fifty participants will
      be recruited and randomised in to one of two groups. One group will be the control group and
      they will undertake the Shape Up programme as normal and will be asked to complete some
      questionnaires in week 1, week 12 and then at 12 weeks follow up. The intervention group will
      be asked to complete the same questionnaires and will also have a venous blood sample taken
      at week 1, 12 and then at 12 weeks follow up. This is for measures of cholesterol, sugar,
      vitamin D, vitamin B12 and iron. The participants will receive a report from a medical doctor
      in layman terms on these results a week later and will have access to their data on an online
      portal set up by Medichecks.

      The weight management programme is based on a behaviour change programme where the
      participants attend a 90-minute session for 12 weeks, and they are then supported for another
      12 weeks following the end of the supervision. The participants have weight and BMI measured
      at week 1, 12 and 12 weeks follow up. Each session consists of an education component
      followed by an exercise component. Initially, the education part is longer and the exercise
      is shorter, but as the programme progresses the education part becomes shorter and the
      exercise longer. The education programme includes topics such as healthy eating, increased
      physical activity and stress. The exercise programme includes whole body activities such as
      circuit training as well as other group exercise such as football.

      The questionnaires will include The Treatment Self-Regulation Questionnaire which will
      identify the motivation behind the participants' health. A general health questionnaire which
      is a subjective measure of health (Euro qol EQ-5). The Mental Component Summary of the 12-
      item Short Form (SF12) which measures emotional quality of life. Physical activity will be
      measured through the short Active Lives Questionnaire. All these questionnaires have been
      attached as appendices.

      All participants will complete an exit telephone interview from the study to determine
      qualitative feedback on their experience of the study and to explore whether the biomarkers
      influenced their motivation to change their lifestyle. Some example questions have been
      attached.

      This is just a feasibility study, therefore no hypothesis testing will be undertaken.

    <description>To determine the behaviour regulation by measuring autonmoic regulation versus controlled regulation through the use of the Treatment Self-Regulation Questionnaire.
An average of the scores on the subscale for autoregulation and also for the controlled regulation questions will be calculated. Scores will be from 1-7 for both sub scales.</description>

    <measure>Subjective health measure</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>A standardised measure of health status will be calculated using the Euro qol EQ-5 questionnaire. There are 5 dimensions to the questionnaire (mobility, self care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression) and each is rated from 1-5. An average of the 5 is calculated as a general health score. A visual analogue scale is also presented for a self related health measure and this is from 0-100. 100 being the best health you can imagine and 0 being the worst health you can imagine.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Physical Activity</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Amount of physical activity measured through the short Active Lives questionnaire. The amount of minutes where breathing is increased will be calculated per week.
For each activity that respondents indicate was sufficient to raise their breathing rate, the total number of days is multiplied by the usual minutes spent undertaking the activity to give a measure of total minutes over the 7-day period for that activity.
The respondent's final score is calculated by summing all activities which were sufficient to raise breathing rate, as follows:
(Days of walking * usual minutes of walking IF sufficient to raise breathing rate) + (Days of cycling * usual munities of cycling IF sufficient to raise breathing rate) + (days of sport, fitness or dance * usual minutes of sport, fitness or dance IF sufficient to raise breathing rate).</description>
