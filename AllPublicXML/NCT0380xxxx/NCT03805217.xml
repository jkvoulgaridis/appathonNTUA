    <textblock>
      A prospective, single-arm, open-label, multicenter post-approval study to determine whether
      the use of the Acumen HPI Software to guide intraoperative hemodynamic management in
      non-cardiac surgery reduces the duration of intraoperative hypotension below a threshold of
      Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP)

        Subjects recruited and enrolled should be classified as American Society of
        Anesthesiologist (ASA) physical status 3-4 who are scheduled for moderate-to-high-risk
        non-cardiac surgery and will be receiving pressure monitoring with an arterial line.
        Potentially qualifying patients will be evaluated during their preoperative anesthesia
        clinic visits.
