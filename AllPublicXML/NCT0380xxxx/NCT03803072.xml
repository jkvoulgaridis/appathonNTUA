  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is an urgent need to implement novel diet approaches to combat the increasing rates of
      gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). The primary aim of this study is to establish the
      feasibility of time-restricted eating in pregnancy, to prepare for future larger controlled
      trials in this research project to determine the efficacy of time-restricted eating in women
      at risk of GDM. Expectations:

        1. Women who have an increased risk of GDM will be able to adhere to time reduced eating
           during pregnancy.

        2. Time reduced eating will improve short-term glycemic control in pregnancy.

During the intervention period, they will be counselled by weekly phone calls to provide encouragement, support and monitoring to improve adherence to the TRE window.</description>
