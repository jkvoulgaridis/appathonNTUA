  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, efficacy, tolerability and
      pharmacokinetics (PK) of TAK-788. At first, Phase 1 part of this study is designed to
      determine a recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of TAK-788 in Japanese participants with locally
      advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). After phase 1 study, the phase 2
      part of this study will be conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of TAK-788 in
      treatment naive Japanese NSCLC patients with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) exon 20
      insertion mutation.

      The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-788. TAK-788 is being tested to treat
      Japanese participants with NSCLC. This study has two parts (Phase 1 part and Phase 2 part),
      Phase 1 part of this study will look at the safety, efficacy, tolerability and PK of TAK-788
      orally administered once daily, and will determine a RP2D. Phase 2 study will look at the
      efficacy and safety of TAK-788 in treatment naive Japanese NSCLC patients with epidermal
      growth factor receptor (EGFR) exon 20 insertion mutation. All participants will be assigned
      to Phase 1 part or Phase 2 part and will be asked to take TAK-788 capsule as following dosage
      and regimen;

      Phase 1 part; TAK-788, 40 mg as starting dose, once daily, and escalating up to 160 mg until
      a Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD). An expansion phase may be followed at any dose to further
      confirm safety observations following identification of MTD/RP2D.

      Phase 2 part; TAK-788, 160 mg, once daily

      The study will enroll approximately 58-63 participants (Phase 1 part; 28-33 and Phase 2 part;
      30).

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in Japan. The overall time to participate in this
      study of Phase 1 part is approximately 3 years and Phase 2 part is approximately 4 years.
      Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic in the treatment period, and the
      post-treatment period including follow-up assessments after the last dose of the study drug.

             8.Currently have or have a history of interstitial lung disease (ILD), radiation
             pneumonitis that required steroid treatment, or drug-related pneumonitis.

             9.Female patients who are lactating and breastfeeding or have a positive serum
             pregnancy test during the screening period.

          -  Note: Female patients who are lactating will be eligible if they discontinue
             breastfeeding.

             10.Have gastrointestinal illness or disorder that could affect oral absorption of
             TAK-788.

             11.Have any condition or illness that, in the opinion of the investigator, might
             compromise patient safety or interfere with the evaluation of the safety of the drug.

          -  Phase-Specific Exclusion Criteria (Phase 1 part);

               1. Previously received TAK-788.

               2. Received small-molecule anticancer therapy (including cytotoxic chemotherapy and
                  investigational agents) within 14 days prior to the first dose of TAK-788 (except
                  for reversible EGFR TKIs [ie, erlotinib or gefitinib] up to 7 days prior to the
                  first dose of TAK-788).

               3. Received antineoplastic monoclonal antibodies including immunotherapy within 28
                  days prior to the first dose of TAK-788.

               4. Received radiotherapy within 14 days prior to the first dose of TAK-788,
                  Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) and stereotactic body radiosurgery are allowed up
                  to 7 days prior to the first dose.

               5. Have symptomatic CNS metastases (parenchymal or leptomeningeal) at screening or
                  asymptomatic disease requiring corticosteroids to control symptoms within 7 days
                  prior to the first dose of TAK-788.

                  Note: If a patient has worsening neurological symptoms or signs due to CNS
                  metastases, the patient needs to complete local therapy and be neurologically
                  stable (with no requirement for corticosteroids or use of anticonvulsants) for 7
                  days prior to the first dose of TAK-788. Patients with no prior history of signs
                  or symptoms of CNS metastases but who receive prophylactic steroids or
                  anticonvulsants are allowed.

               6. Received a strong cytochrome P450 (CYP)3A inhibitor or strong CYP3A inducer
                  within 2 weeks prior to first dose of TAK-788.

          -  Phase-Specific Exclusion Criteria (Phase 2 part);

               1. Received radiotherapy within 14 days before the first dose of TAK-788 or has not
                  recovered from radiotherapy-related toxicities. Stereotactic radiosurgery,
                  stereotactic body radiotherapy, or palliative radiation outside the chest and
                  brain is allowed up to 7 days before the first dose of TAK-788.

               2. Have known active brain metastases (have either previously untreated intracranial
                  CNS metastases or previously treated intracranial CNS metastases with
                  radiologically documented new or progressing CNS lesions). Brain metastases are
                  allowed if they have been treated with surgery and/or radiation and have been
                  stable without requiring corticosteroids to control symptoms within 7 days before
                  the first dose of TAK-788, and have no evidence of new or enlarging brain
                  metastases.

               3. Received a moderate or strong CYP3A inhibitor or moderate or strong CYP3A inducer
                  within 10 days prior to first dose of TAK-788.

    <ipd_description>Takeda makes patient-level, de-identified data sets and associated documents available for all interventional studies after applicable marketing approvals and commercial availability have been received (or program is completely terminated), an opportunity for the primary publication of the research and final report development has been allowed, and other criteria have been met as set forth in Takeda's Data Sharing Policy (see www.TakedaClinicalTrials.com for details). To obtain access, researchers must submit a legitimate academic research proposal for adjudication by an independent review panel, who will review the scientific merit of the research and the requestor's qualifications and conflict of interest that can result in potential bias. Once approved, qualified researchers who sign a data sharing agreement are provided access to these data in a secure research environment.</ipd_description>
