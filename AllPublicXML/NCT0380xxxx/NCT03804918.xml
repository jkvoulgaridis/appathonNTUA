    <textblock>
      Design:

      A pre-post mixed methods pilot study. All participants granted access to a breaking bad news
      mobile learning resource (VitalTips).

      Baseline and post-intervention questionnaires, pre- and post-intervention simulated patient
      encounters, and post-intervention semi-structured interviews.

      Objective:

      To assess if a selected breaking bad news mobile learning resource can improve the ability of
      clinicians to break bad news.

      Population/Eligibility:

      15-20 junior doctors and nurses working within two NHS hospitals trusts and one private
      hospital in England.

      Duration:

      January 2018 to August 2019.

      Purpose:

      Digital and mobile learning is at the forefront of healthcare education. Though there is
      evidence for the use of digital learning for practical skills acquisition, there is little
      evidence of the use of digital learning for breaking bad news training. This quasi-randomised
      controlled study aims to address this gap in knowledge by assessing how a mobile learning
      resource may impact the ability of clinicians to break bad news.

      Hypothesis:

      The addition of a breaking bad news mobile learning resource to clinical practice improves
      the ability of junior doctors and nurses to break bad news.

      Study objective:

      To assess if a breaking bad news mobile learning resource can improve the ability of
      clinicians to break bad news.

      Methodology:

      Potential participants will be sent an invitation and participant information sheet (PIS) via
      e-mail. Potential participants will be given up to two weeks to decide if they want to
      participate, with a reminder sent after one week. Each potential participant will be
      referenced by a participant ID number for confidentiality purposes.

      Once potential participants have read the PIS and given consent, they will be asked to
      complete a baseline questionnaire to understand their demographics, their previous exposure
      to breaking bad news (through formal or informal training) and their engagement with digital
      resources.

      Following this, participants will be asked to complete a baseline simulated patient encounter
      (SPE) with a simulated patient (SP) (role-played by an actor) to assess their baseline
      ability to break bad news. Participants will be given a task sheet with a brief history of
      the SP and what news they need to deliver. The details and history of the SP will be
      documented on a character sheet for the actor to refer to. The SPE will last 15 minutes and
      it will be video-recorded. The SPEs will be evaluated against a validated mark sheet
      completed by the actor, the CI (immediately following the SPE) and an independent assessor
      (by watching the video footage).

      Access to the mobile learning resource will be granted following the baseline SPE. The mobile
      learning resource is the freely available VitalTips mobile application, provided by
      VitalTalks. Participants will be expected to spend at least three hours using the mobile
      learning resource, ensuring that this time does not impact on their clinical and academic
      commitments. As the in-application metrics will not be available to the researchers,
      participants will be asked to self-report their engagement with the resource in the
      post-intervention questionnaire.

      Four to six weeks later, participants will be asked to complete a second videoed SPE, which
      will be marked as described above. The participants will also be asked to complete a
      post-intervention questionnaire to gauge the impact on their clinical practice and their
      engagement with the mobile resources.

      The questionnaires utilise a five-point Likert scale ranking of the user's confidence and
      agreeability with statements. Some statements have a white space to write comments. The
      questionnaires are novel to this study and were developed using principles of Kirkpatrick's
      Model of Learning Evaluation, the Theory of Planned Behaviour and the Technology Acceptance
      Model, whilst also drawing on the most important curricula competencies derived from the
      content analysis of a sample of medical and nursing curricula followed by an expert
      consensus.

      Soon after the completion of the post-intervention questionnaire, the participant will be
      asked to participate in a 15-30 minutes semi-structured interview with the researcher. The
      participant will be asked about their general impressions of the mobile learning resource,
      their use of the resource in and outside of the clinical environment, their perception of
      their ability to break bad news before and after the intervention, their perception of their
      performance in the SPE and any impact on their practice.

      Data handling and confidentiality:

      Following consent, participants will be referenced by their participant ID number (e.g.
      MLR001). Their e-mail address will be recorded next to their participant ID number, gender,
      role (i.e. doctor or nurse) and training grade, on an Excel spreadsheet for the purpose of
      contacting participants as the study progresses. The participant's hospital of work will not
      be recorded. Once their commitment to the study has been ended, the e-mail address will be
      deleted.

      Video recordings from the SPEs will be transferred from the recording device to a password
      protected USB stick referenced by the participant ID followed by SPE1 (baseline) or SPE2
      (post-intervention), e.g. MLR001_SPE1. Once the independent reviewer has viewed the video and
      marked the participant, the video file will be destroyed.

      Audio files from the interviews will be transferred from the recording device onto a password
      protected computer using a USB stick. Once the transfer is completed the files will be
      deleted from the USB stick. The transferred files will be stored on the password protected
      computer till the returned transcriptions have been checked by the CI. Once the files have
      been checked, these recordings will be deleted.

    <description>Baseline and post-intervention questionnaires utilise a five-point Likert scale ranking of the user's confidence and agreeability with statements. Some statements have a white space to write comments. The questionnaires are novel to this study. A combination of a spreadsheet for the quantitative elements (converting the Likert scale into a numerical scale), and qualitative data management software for thematic analysis of the white space answers will be used to record and analyse the data. With each participant acting as their own control, comparisons will be made from their own baseline and post-intervention Likert scale ratings. A paired sample t-test will be used to statistically analyse the results (with p &lt; 0.05 considered a statistically significant change).</description>
