  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Introduction: Although inflating tracheal cuff using lidocaine is effective for cough
      suppression, it may pressure tracheal cuff too much. Intravenous continuous infusion of
      lidocaine has emerged recently for most general anesthesia in the context of opioid-sparing
      anesthesia for cancer, but the 95% effective dose (ED95) for cough suppression during
      anesthesia emergence is not determined yet. Objective: the objectives of this study are to
      determine the ED95 of continuous infusion lidocaine for suppressing cough reflex during
      extubation by sex and age group.

      Ideal patient weight in kg will be considered.

      Initial dose will be 0.5mg/kg.h and dose-change steps of 0.5mg/kg.h will occur depending on
      the incidence of emergence cough in the previous patient of the same group:

        -  It will increase if coughed in a probability of 95%

        -  It will decrease if not coughed in a probability of 5%.

        -  It will remain the same otherwise. Maximum dose will be 3mg/kg.h. All patients will
           receive remifentanil 0.025mcg/kg.min continuous infusion until extubation.

      Patients groups will be determined by sex and age group (18-60 or &gt;60 years old), therefore,
      four independent groups will be studied:

        -  Female 18 to 60 years old

        -  Male 18 to 60 years old

        -  Female &gt; 60 years old

        -  Male &gt; 60 years old

    <masking_description>A study participant who will not participate during assessment of the main outcome will prepare the drug solutions to be infused at 10ml/h accordingly to the response of the previous patient and to the dose calculated for the next patient. The participant who will verify the main outcome during anesthesia emergence will not know the dose the patient is receiving. Participants will not be informed of the dose they will receive. The outcomes assessor will not handle individual data and statistical analysis plan was developed in advance.</masking_description>
