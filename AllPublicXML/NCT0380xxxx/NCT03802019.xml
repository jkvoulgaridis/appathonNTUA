  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of changes in cigarette package color on
      smoking behaviors, harm exposure, and risk perceptions when using low nicotine content (LNC)
      cigarettes.

    <textblock>
      This project will utilize a randomized, parallel-design trial to examine the effects of low
      nicotine content (LNC) cigarette packaging on smoking behaviors, harm exposure, risk
      perceptions, and subjective ratings of cigarettes. The investigators will aim to recruit and
      randomize 500 daily smokers (~250 male, ~250 female) in a 35-day protocol. After completing a
      5-day baseline period of smoking their own brand, participants will be randomized to a 30-day
      experimental period when they will receive either their own preferred brand (control), or LNC
      cigarettes in one of four types of packaging: standard investigational (gray packaging); red,
      or blue (tobacco industry strategy); or plain packaging (tobacco control strategy).
      Participants will be asked to attend in-person sessions at the Center for Interdisciplinary
      Research on Nicotine Addiction (CIRNA) every 4-6 days, for a total of 8 in-person sessions
      across 35 days.

    <intervention_model_description>This project will recruit current, daily cigarette smokers to a 35-day, randomized, controlled, parallel design protocol. After a 5-day period of smoking their own preferred brand cigarettes, participants will be randomized to a 30-day experimental period when they will receive either their own preferred brand (control group), or LNC cigarettes in one of four types of packaging: standard investigational (current gray packaging); red, or blue (tobacco industry strategy); or plain packaging (tobacco control strategy), for 30 days.</intervention_model_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Daily Cigarette Consumption</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0 through Day 35</time_frame>
    <description>Daily cigarette consumption will be assessed by participant self-report and verified through collection of spent filters for all cigarettes smoked throughout the entire 35-day study.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Total Puff Volume</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0 through Day 35</time_frame>
    <description>Total puff volume (total smoke inhaled per cigarette measured in milliliters [mL]) will be collected for each cigarette smoked during each laboratory session using a handheld, portable, electronic topography device. Total puff volume will be assessed for each cigarette smoked at in-person sessions throughout the entire 35-day study.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Carbon Monoxide (CO)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0 through Day 35</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will assess CO (measured in parts per million [ppm]), a measure of toxicant exposure, at the onset of each session, as well as before and after each cigarette smoked during each in-person laboratory session. CO collected at the onset of each session represents daily exposure, while CO boost - the change in CO values before and after smoking a cigarette - estimates smoke exposure due to smoking an individual cigarette.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Total Nicotine Equivalents</measure>
    <time_frame>Days 5 and 35</time_frame>
    <description>Urine collected at Day 5 and Day 35 will be assessed for changes in total nicotine equivalents, nicotine plus its primary metabolites, across the experimental study period (Days 5-35). Total nicotine equivalents will be measured in nanograms per milliliter (ng per mL).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Total NNAL</measure>
    <time_frame>Days 5 and 35</time_frame>
    <description>Urine collected at D5 and D35 will be assessed for changes in NNAL, a biomarker of carcinogen exposure, across the experimental study period (Days 5-35). Total NNAL will be measured in nanograms per millilleter (ng per mL).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Subjective Cigarette Ratings (Visual Analog Scale [VAS] of Cigarette Characteristics)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0 through Day 35</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will provide subjective ratings of each cigarette smoked during each in-person laboratory session using a 14-item, 100 mm visual analog scale (VAS) of cigarette characteristics. Anchors are item-specific (e.g., taste: 0 = &quot;very bad,&quot; 100 = &quot;very good&quot;), with lower scores indicating less favorable ratings.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cigarette Risk Beliefs</measure>
    <time_frame>Days 0, 5, 20, and 35</time_frame>
    <description>To assess risk beliefs about the assigned cigarettes, the investigators will use an 8-item, 5-point scale (1 = definitely untrue; 5 = definitely true) including previously validated items (i.e., &quot;Compared to your own cigarettes, the cigarettes you are currently smoking: are lower in nicotine&quot;). The Cigarette Risk Beliefs questionnaire will be administered Session 1 (Day 0) before lab cigarette 1 (18-item baseline version), Session 2 (Day 5) before lab cigarette 1 and 2, Session 5 (Day 20) before lab cigarette 1, and Session 8 (Day 35) before lab cigarette 1.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cigarette Craving (Questionnaire on Smoking Urges [QSU])</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0 through Day 35</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will report cigarette craving at the onset of each in-person session. Craving will be assessed using a summary score and two factor subscales (i.e., desire to smoke and craving due to anticipation of negative affect relief) from a 32-item Questionnaire on Smoking Urges (QSU). Participants will respond to each item along a 7-point scale (1=Strongly disagree; 7=Strongly agree).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cigarette Withdrawal (Withdrawal Symptom Checklist [WSC])</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0 through Day 35</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will report cigarette withdrawal at the onset of each in-person session. Withdrawal will be assessed using a summary score from the 20-item (21 items at Session 1 [Day 0]) revised version of the Withdrawal Symptom Checklist with a one-week frame of reference (WSC-W). Specifically, participants will respond regarding to how they felt in regards to each potential withdrawal symptom along a 4-point scale (0=Not Present; 3=Severe).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Total Puff Count</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0 through Day 35</time_frame>
    <description>All cigarettes smoked during each in-person session will be smoked through a smoking topography machine. This device is specifically designed to collect smoking topography variables. In addition to total puff volume, the topography equipment collects other measures of puffing behavior, including a total puff count (total number of puffs) for each cigarette smoked. Total puff count will be assessed for each cigarette smoked at in-person sessions throughout the entire 35-day study.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Puff Duration</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0 through Day 35</time_frame>
    <description>All cigarettes smoked during each in-person session will be smoked through a smoking topography machine. This device is specifically designed to collect smoking topography variables. In addition to total puff volume, the topography equipment collects other measures of puffing behavior, including puff duration (measured in milliseconds [ms]). Puff duration will be assessed for each cigarette smoked at in-person sessions throughout the entire 35-day study.</description>
