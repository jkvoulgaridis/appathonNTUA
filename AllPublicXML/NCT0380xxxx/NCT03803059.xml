             being treated or judged to potentially impact results by the Investigator.

          -  Women of child bearing potential agree to take a urine pregnancy test at the Baseline
             visit and 6-months post-treatment or when deemed by Investigator and/or Sponsor. This

             of childbearing potential must have a negative urine pregnancy test result and must
             not be lactating at the baseline visit. Women must be willing and able to use an
             acceptable method of birth control (e.g. barrier methods used with a spermicidal
             agent, hormonal methods, IUD, surgical sterilization, abstinence) during the study.
             Women will not be considered of childbearing potential if one of the following
             conditions is documented on the medical history:

               -  Postmenopausal for at least 12 months prior to study;

               -  Without a uterus and/or both ovaries;

             agent, hormonal methods, IUD, surgical sterilization, abstinence) during the study.
             Women will not be considered of childbearing potential if one of the following
             conditions is documented on the medical history:
