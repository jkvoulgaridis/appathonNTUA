  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The MyRA study will primarily investigate whether there are associations between the
      structure and function of the gut microbiome and response to methotrexate in early rheumatoid
      arthritis patients. The microbiome will be characterised via shotgun metagenomic sequencing
      of microbial DNA present in stool samples taken during the participant's first 6 months of
      taking methotrexate.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Methotrexate is often the first drug of choice for patients with early rheumatoid arthritis
      (RA), but its efficacy is highly variable and it can lead to severe side effects. There are
      currently no reliable predictors of methotrexate efficacy for people with early RA.

      Microbial dysbiosis (an imbalanced microbiome) has recently been implicated in RA, with
      associations between specific microbes and RA biomarkers or disease activity. Gut microbes
      have extensive capabilities in terms of xenobiotic (e.g. drug) metabolism. Several gut
      microbes are able to alter the drug methotrexate in vitro, and it is possible this could
      effect drug efficacy in vivo. Alternatively methotrexate efficacy could be affected by
      baseline microbial composition or alterations to microbial composition over the course of
      treatment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Initially commencing combination therapy (prior to first stool sample) rather than
             methotrexate monotherapy i.e. MTX combined with another DMARD or prednisolone

          -  Commencement of MTX therapy prior to first stool sample or cessation of MTX therapy at
             any point during the study

          -  History of psoriasis
