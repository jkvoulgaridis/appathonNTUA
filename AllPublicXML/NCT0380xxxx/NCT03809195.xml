  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which includes Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis
      (UC), is a chronic, immune-mediated disease increasingly prevalent in youth. Patients with
      IBD experience pain, fatigue, altered bowel habits, psychological distress, and reduced
      quality of life. Regardless of disease activity, persistent pain and psychiatric
      comorbidities both have a negative impact on quality of life. Alongside standard
      pharmacologic and nutritional therapies, clinical hypnosis is a complementary therapy that
      may improve physical and psychosocial outcomes in these patients. Clinical hypnosis consists
      of guiding the patient into a relaxed and focused state and providing therapeutic suggestions
      to induce desired physiologic and psychologic change. Children and adolescents are excellent
      candidates for hypnosis by virtue of their vivid imaginations. Hypnosis is effective in
      management of functional abdominal pain, irritable bowel syndrome, anxiety, chronic pain, and
      distress related to medical procedures. To date, there are no clinical trials that evaluate
      the effects of hypnosis in pediatric patients with IBD, but there is strong conceptual
      support for its role in improving pain and psychological distress in these patients. In
      addition to genetic, environmental, and microbial influences, a growing body of evidence
      supports the role of a dysregulated brain-gut axis and chronic stress in IBD. Animal and
      human studies demonstrate the effect of stress on the immune system and gastrointestinal
      tract. Studies show that the benefits of hypnosis may extend to its role in increasing vagal
      tone and regulating the immune system via the brain-gut axis. Adults with UC receiving a
      hypnosis intervention demonstrated improved remission and decreased inflammatory markers.
      Case series suggest that children with inflammatory bowel disease benefit from hypnosis, and
      it can be safely and easily delivered via audio recordings. Patients with IBD are interested
      in integrative therapies to reduce symptoms and improve quality of life, and a
      biopsychosocial approach is essential in their care. The addition of hypnosis may improve
      outcomes through influence on stress, inflammation, coping, symptom perception, and quality
      of life.

      The investigators hypothesize that pediatric patients with CD participating in a clinical
      hypnosis intervention as an adjunct to standard of care will report improved quality of life
      compared to a waitlist control group. The specific aims of the study are as follows: (1) To
      implement hypnosis as an adjunctive therapy in adolescents with CD. (2) To evaluate the
      impact of hypnosis in CD on measures of quality of life. (3) To evaluate the impact of
      hypnosis in CD on pain, depression, anxiety, sleep, and coping.

    <measure>IMPACT-III</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to 8 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>Pediatric inflammatory bowel disease-specific health-related quality of life measure. &quot;IMPACT&quot; is not an abbreviation, but rather the name of the scale. Minimum score 0 to maximum score 100, with higher signifying better quality of life. Subjects get a total score (0 to 100) and a score for each of six subscales (0 to 100): Bowel Symptoms (7 items), Treatment/Interventions (3 items), Social Functioning (12 items), Emotional Functioning (7 items), Body Image (3 items), Systemic Symptoms (3 items). Each of the 35 total items has five multiple choice options and is given a score of 0, 25, 50, 75, or 100 points. The subscale scores are an average of the scores for each item that corresponds to that subscale. The total score is an average of all item scores.</description>

    <measure>PedsQL 4.0 Generic Core Scale, Parent Proxy</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to 8 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>&quot;PedsQL&quot; refers to Pediatric Quality of Life. This is a pediatric 23-item measure of health-related quality of life. Questions fall under one of five domains: Physical Functioning (8 items), Emotional Functioning (5), Social Functioning (5 items), School Functioning (5 items). Yields a total score and two summary scores—Physical Health (comprised of physical functioning domain) and Psychosocial Health (comprised of each item in the 5-item emotional, social, and school functioning domains). Each item is rated on a 5-point Likert scale. Total score and the two summary scores are linearly transformed into a 0 to 100 point scale, with higher scores representing better quality of life.</description>

    <measure>PROMIS Pediatric Anxiety, short form</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to 8 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>PROMIS stands for Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System. This measure is 8 items each scored from 1 to 5 points, with the lowest possible raw score being 8 and the highest possible raw score being 40. Higher scores indicate greater anxiety, i.e. worse. The raw score is translated into a T-score. The T-score rescales the raw score into a standardized T-score with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation (SD) of 10. Therefore, a person with a T-score of 40 is one SD below the mean.</description>

    <measure>PROMIS Pediatric Depressive Symptoms, short form</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to 8 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>PROMIS stands for Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System. This measure is 8 items each scored from 1 to 5 points, with the lowest possible raw score being 8 and the highest possible raw score being 40. Higher scores indicate greater depressive symptoms, i.e. worse. The raw score is translated into a T-score. The T-score rescales the raw score into a standardized T-score with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation (SD) of 10. Therefore, a person with a T-score of 40 is one SD below the mean.</description>

    <measure>PROMIS Pediatric Sleep Disturbance, short form</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to 8 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>PROMIS stands for Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System. This measure is 8 items each scored from 1 to 5 points, with the lowest possible raw score being 8 and the highest possible raw score being 40. Higher scores indicate greater sleep disturbance, i.e. worse sleep. The raw score is translated into a T-score. The T-score rescales the raw score into a standardized T-score with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation (SD) of 10. Therefore, a person with a T-score of 40 is one SD below the mean.</description>

    <measure>Pain Beliefs Questionnaire, short form</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to 8 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>This is an 18-item measure designed assess youth's beliefs about their abdominal pain. It is comprised of three subscales each with 6 items—Pain Threat, Problem-Focused Coping Efficacy (PFCE), and Emotion-Focused Coping Efficacy (EFCE). The respondent rates each item on how true the statement is for them on a 5-point scale ranging from 0 (&quot;not at all true&quot;) to 4 (&quot;very true&quot;). Subscale scores are computed by averaging the items pertaining to each subscale. For Pain Threat, higher score indicates stronger beliefs that one's pain represents a personal threat. For the PFCE and EFCE subscales, higher scores indicate a stronger belief in one's ability to cope with pain.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Abdominal Pain Intensity</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to 8 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>Two items combined for a total score, range from 0 to 20, with higher scores representing greater pain intensity. Each item rated on a scale from 0 (no pain) to 10 (most possible pain). The first item assesses the respondent's worst pain in the past week, and the second item assesses the usual intensity of the pain experienced during the past week.
