  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Autologous monocyte-derived dendritic cells pulsed with tumor lysate (PV-001-DC) will be
      given to a group of 3 people. If this is found to be safe, it will be given to up to 7 other
      people, for a total of up to 10 people in this arm. This will be the first study of
      PV-001-DC.

      Eligible patients must be progressing after having completed prior therapy with a PD-1/PD-L1
      antagonist alone or in combination with anti-CTLA-4. If the patient is positive for BRAF, the
      patient must have progressed on at least one BRAF inhibitor in addition to a PD-1/PD-L1
      inhibitor alone or in combination with CTLA-4 for metastatic melanoma.

      Although other kinds of dendritic cells (DCs) have been approved to treat some forms of
      cancer, they have not been approved to treat melanoma. PV-001-DC is a special kind of DCs
      that is combined with tumor lysate. The study procedures will start with the removal of a
      small amount of tumor tissue processed into protein fragments (lysate). There will also be
      collection of white blood cells through apheresis (a procedure in which blood is drawn from a
      patient and separated into its different cell types), the white blood cells will be collected
      and the remainder returned to the patient. Dendritic cells will be grown from the collected
      white blood cells and combined with the lysate to form PV-001-DC.

      On the first day of study treatment, patients will go to the clinic and have a needle placed
      in a vein. The PV-001-DC product will be infused into the patient's vein. Approximately every
      3 weeks, for a total of 4 treatments, patients will receive additional infusions of
      PV-001-DC. Patients will be at the clinic for at least 1 hour following the end of the
      PV-001-DC infusion and if they feel fine, they may go home.

      Scans will be performed during the study at different times to see if their tumors have
      changed in size. Patients will also have their blood and small samples of tumors tested for
      changes to the immune system. After 365 days, the trial will be completed for that patient.

      Investigators will monitor patients carefully for any harmful side effects. The side effects
      in people cannot be completely known ahead of time
