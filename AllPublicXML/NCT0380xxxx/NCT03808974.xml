  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research project is to test the effectiveness of a previsit educational
      video designed to help women understand the risks and benefits of a midurethral sling for
      treatment of stress urinary incontinence. A total of 38 participants will be recruited from
      both the Urogynecology pre-operative clinic of the university of California, Irvine Medical
      Center and the Urogynecology pre-operative clinic at Kaiser Permanente, Anaheim and Orange
      County. Participants will be randomized either to watch a 10 minute educational video
      (intervention group) or read a standard handout describing the midurethral sling (control
      group). Participants will then complete their pre-operative visit in the usual fashion.
      Participants will complete a pre- and post- intervention knowledge questionnaire to assess
      the primary outcome (change in knowledge before and after intervention). Participants will
      repeat the knowledge questionnaire and complete validated questionnaires for satisfaction
      with decision scale and decision regret at 2 and 6 weeks post-operative.

    <description>The change in participant knowledge as measured with a patient knowledge questionnaire. This questionnaire was created by the study investigators and piloted by physicians within our institutions. It was submitted to and approved by our IRB for use in this study. This is a 15-point questionnaire (true/false/unknown answer choices) in which 1 point is given for each correct response and 0 points given for incorrect or unanswered questions (minimum score: 0/15, maximum score: 15/15). The questions pertain to the risks, benefits, and procedure of the mid-urethral sling surgery. Higher scores indicate better participant knowledge. A subscale of mesh-related questions will also be examined. This subscale reports the participant knowledge pertaining to complications and procedural knowledge specific to the use of mesh in the mid-urethral sling. The scale of this subset ranges from 0/5 to 5/5, with higher scores indicating greater participant knowledge.</description>
