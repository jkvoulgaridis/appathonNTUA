  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is the evaluation of erector spinae plane (ESP) blocks as an
      alternative to interscalene brachial plexus nerve blocks for rotator cuff repair and total
      shoulder arthroplasty procedures. Currently, single shot interscalene nerve blocks are
      performed for rotator cuff repair surgeries, and interscalene nerve catheters are placed for
      total shoulder arthroplasty surgeries. Erector spinae plane blocks are commonly used as part
      of the anesthetic plan for other surgeries, but less so for shoulder surgeries. The
      investigators would like to study whether an ESP block can provide similar pain control
      compared to an interscalene nerve block, with less risk of upper extremity motor block and
      phrenic nerve block.

    <description>Patients undergoing rotator cuff repair surgery or total shoulder arthroplasty will undergo a single shot interscalene brachial plexus nerve block or an interscalene brachial plexus nerve catheter. In the preoperative area, all participants will be asked baseline indicators of pain level via a Numeric Rating Scale (NRS, 0-10, where 0 is no pain and 10 is the worst imaginable pain) and diaphragmatic excursion will be measured bilaterally using ultrasonography before nerve block placement. Motor and sensory exams will also be performed. The same parameters will be measured 30 minutes after the block is performed. In the recovery room, those with nerve catheters will receive a dose of local anesthetic. All patients will have the same parameters measured 30 minutes postoperatively.</description>
