  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pilot and feasibility study; a complex intervention focusing on lifestyle change to increase
      physical activity and reduce cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk among high risk individuals.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Interdisciplinary, mixed-method, prospective and single-arm exploratory study aimed to
      explore study feasibility, responsiveness, participants adherence and adverse events among
      the participants before deciding to proceed to full-scale evaluation.

      Enrollment of max. 20 obese people (BMI&gt;30) with sedentary lifestyle and increased CVD-risk
      (NORRISK2)..

      Participants general health status including cardiopulmonary fitness will be assessed both
      before and after the intervention (blood pressure, ECG, spirometry, treadmill tests VO2max,
      blood tests, body composition by Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) measurements)
      Participants´ functional capacity assessed by several range of motion tests. Participants
      nutritional and psychological status assessed by validated questionnaires.

      Several blood-tests and ECG will be recorded at three months.

      Daily activity level during and six months after the intervention period monitored by Polar
      M430 pulse watch.

      The participants will be interviewed with focus on their prior health, activity habits and
      intervention experiences at three months and six months after end of the intervention. Two
      focus-group interviews at end of intervention.
