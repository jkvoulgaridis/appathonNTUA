      This is a pilot trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a combined oral formulation of
      THC and CBD in patients with Essential Tremor.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Essential tremor (ET) is the most common neurological movement disorder, affecting up to 1%
      of the population and up to 5% of individuals over the age of 65. ET is characterized by
      often disabling tremors that occur when an individual moves. The tremors most commonly affect
      the hands, head, voice, and legs in order of frequency, leading to impairment in activities
      of daily living and morbidity. No pharmacological agent has been developed for ET, though
      existing agents such as propranolol and primidone are used off-label to reduce tremor
      amplitude. Deep brain stimulation surgery is often reserved for only individuals with the
      most severe tremors. Patients with ET have long reported tremor benefits with the use of
      cannabis, though no controlled trials have been conducted. The investigators plan to conduct
      the first double-blind, placebo-control clinical trial of cannabis in an oral capsule.
      Various validated tremor rating methods will be used to quantify tremor severity, while
      looking at tolerability and safety.
