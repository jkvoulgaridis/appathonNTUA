  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a two-part study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and
      pharmacodynamics of CC-92480 and explore the effect of food on the bioavailability of
      CC-92480 in healthy subjects.

      Part 1:

      Part 1 is a single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the
      safety, tolerability, PK, and pharmacodynamics (PD) of CC-92480 following administration of
      single oral doses in healthy adult subjects. Part 1 will consist of escalating single doses
      in sequential groups. Approximately 40 subjects will be enrolled into 5 planned dose level
      cohorts. Each dose level cohort will consist of 8 subjects; 6 subjects will receive CC-92480
      and 2 subjects will receive placebo according to the randomization schedule.

      Part 2 Part 2 is a single-center, open-label, randomized, 2-period, 2-way crossover study to
      explore the effect of food (Food and Drug Administration [FDA] standard high-fat breakfast)
      on the single-dose PK of CC-92480 in healthy adult subjects.

             least 3 months after the last dose of study medication. For females: Female subjects
             must have been surgically sterilized (hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy; proper
             documentation required) at least 6 months before screening, or be postmenopausal
             (defined as 24 months without menses before screening, with a plasma
             follicle-stimulation hormone [FSH] level of &gt; 40 IU/L at screening).

          6. Must have a body mass index between 18 and 33 kg/m2 (inclusive) at the time of signing
             the ICF.

          7. No clinically significant laboratory test results as determined by the investigator.

          8. At the screening visit, must be afebrile, with supine systolic BP: 90 to 140 mmHg,
             supine diastolic BP: 50 to 90 mmHg, and pulse rate: 40 to 90 bpm. Eligibility criteria
             for vital signs performed during check-in and/or predose on Day 1 will be at the

             discretion.

          9. Must have a normal or clinically-acceptable 12-lead ECG at screening. Male subjects
             must have a corrected QT interval using Fridericia's formula (QTcF) value ≤ 430 msec.
             Female subjects must have a QTcF value ≤ 450 msec.

         10. Subject must agree and be willing to consume a standard high-fat meal (which may
             contain gluten), for Part 2 subjects only.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        The presence of any of the following will exclude a subject from enrollment:

          1. History of any clinically significant and relevant neurological, GI, renal, hepatic,

             Statistical Manual [DSM]) within 2 years before dosing, or positive drug screening
             test reflecting consumption of illicit drugs.

          9. History of alcohol abuse (as defined by the current version of the DSM) within 2 years
             before dosing, or positive alcohol screen.

         10. Known to have serum hepatitis; known to be a carrier of the hepatitis B surface
             antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis B surface antibody (anti-HBs), hepatitis B core antibody
             (anti-HBc), or hepatitis C antibody (HCV Ab); have a positive result to the test for
             hepatitis B or hepatitis C virus at screening or have a positive result to the test
             for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibodies at screening. Subjects whose results
             are compatible with prior immunization against hepatitis B may be included at the
             discretion of the Investigator.

         11. Exposure to an investigational drug (new chemical entity) within 30 days preceding the
             first dose administration, or 5 half-lives of that investigational drug, if known
             (whichever is longer).

         12. Use of tobacco- or nicotine-containing products within 3 months prior to Day -1
             (Period 1 for Part 2).

         13. Vaccination within 30 days of dosing or plans to receive vaccination within 30 days
             after dosing.

         14. Systemic infection within 30 days of dosing.
