      Testing the efficacy of high intensity interval training (HIIT), as compared to current
      research supporting moderate intensity continuous training (MICT), as a means to improve
      cardiometabolic health after spinal cord injury.

      This study aims to challenge the effectiveness of the current aerobic exercise
      recommendations for individuals with spinal cord injuries (SCI). Currently, moderate
      intensity continuous training (MICT) is suggested however this study intends to explore the
      effectiveness of high intensity interval training (HIIT). To do so, approximately 8
      individuals with SCI will be undergo a 6 week HIIT intervention consisting of 3 sessions per
      week. With a focus on cardiometabolic health markers (listed in outcome measure section), we
      aim to provide support for HIIT as a viable method of mitigating cardiovascular risk in a SCI
      population.

    <intervention_name>High Intensity Interval Training</intervention_name>
    <description>Participants assigned to this group will perform a very mild 5-minute warm-up (0 resistance, and 60 rpm), followed by 5 one-minute bouts of high intensity exercise, with 90 seconds between each bout. These bouts will be followed by a 3-minute cool down (0 resistance, and 60 rpm). The high-intensity exercise will be performed at an intensity of 17 on the Borg rating of perceived exertion (RPE) scale (very hard), and the 90 second active rest intervals will be performed at an intensity of 7-9 (very, very light - very light). The exercise will be performed on the NuStep machine 3 times a week for 6 weeks.</description>
