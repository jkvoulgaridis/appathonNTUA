  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, open-label, dose-escalation, single-center study of ADG106 in subjects
      with advanced or metastatic solid tumors and/or relapsed/ refractory non-Hodgkin lymphoma.
      ADG106 is a fully human ligand-blocking, agonistic anti-CD137 IgG4 mAb. It binds to the
      activated human T cells via a T cell receptor CD137. T cell is a kind of lymphocyte (a
      subtype of white blood cells) that protects bodies by eliminating tumor cells, and normal
      cells infected with viruses or bacteria. By binding to CD137, the study drug is expected to
      enhance the activity of activated T cells and thus stimulate a more intense immune attack to
      kill tumor cells. ADG106 is expected to enhance the activity of activated T cells.

      Primary objective:

      To assess safety and tolerability at increasing dose levels of single agent ADG106 in
      subjects with advanced or metastatic solid tumors and/or non Hodgkin lymphoma.

      To determine the recommended dosage and dosage regimen for further study. Secondary
      Objectives To characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles of ADG106. To evaluate the
      immunogenicity of ADG106. To evaluate the potential anti-tumor effect of ADG106. To
      investigate serum biomarkers related to immune regulation and cytokine releasing.

      Exploratory Objective:

      To identify the potential biomarkers of ADG106.
