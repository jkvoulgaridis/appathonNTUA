  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study consisting of four cohorts in this setting. In Cohort 1, the safety and
      efficacy of ipatasertib (ipat) in combination with atezolizumab (atezo) and paclitaxel (pac)
      or nab-paclitaxel will be evaluated for participants with locally advanced or metastatic
      triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) who have not previously received chemotherapy. In Cohort
      2, ipatasertib and atezolizumab (with no chemotherapy), will be administered to participants
      with locally advanced or metastatic TNBC. In Cohort 3, the safety and efficacy of neoadjuvant
      ipatasertib, atezolizumab, doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (AC) (Ipat + Atezo + AC) followed
      by Ipat + Atezo + Pac will be evaluated in participants with locally advanced Type 2-4 (T2-4)
      TNBC. In Cohort 4, the safety and efficacy of Ipat + Atezo + Pac will be evaluated in
      participants with PD-L1 (Programmed Death-Ligand-1) positive locally advanced or metastatic
      TNBC that is not amenable to resection and who have not previously received chemotherapy in
      the advanced setting.
