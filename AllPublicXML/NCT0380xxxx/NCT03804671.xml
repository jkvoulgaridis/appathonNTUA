        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy male subjects according to the assessment of the investigator, as based on a
             complete medical history including a physical examination, vital signs (Blood Pressure
             (BP), Pulse Rate (PR)), 12-lead Electrocardiogram (ECG), and clinical laboratory tests

          -  Age of 18 to 65 years (inclusive)

          -  Body Mass Index (BMI) of 18.5 to 29.9 kg/m2 (inclusive)

          -  Signed and dated written informed consent prior to admission to the study, in
             accordance with Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and local legislation

          -  Further inclusion criteria apply

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any finding in the medical examination (including Blood Pressure (BP), Pulse Rate (PR)
             or Electrocardiogram (ECG)) deviating from normal and assessed as clinically relevant
             by the investigator

          -  Repeated measurement of systolic blood pressure outside the range of 90 to 139 mmHg,
             diastolic blood pressure outside the range of 45 to 89 mmHg, or pulse rate outside the
             range of 40 to 100 bpm

          -  Any laboratory value outside the reference range that the investigator considers to be
             of clinical relevance

          -  Any evidence of a concomitant disease assessed as clinically relevant by the
             investigator

          -  Clinically significant gastrointestinal (including known or suspected inflammatory
             bowel disease), hepatic, renal, respiratory, cardiovascular, metabolic, immunological
             or hormonal disorders

    <ipd_description>Clinical studies sponsored by Boehringer Ingelheim, phases I to IV, interventional and non‐interventional, are in scope for sharing of the raw clinical study data and clinical study documents, except for the following exclusions:
1. studies in products where Boehringer Ingelheim is not the license holder; 2. studies regarding pharmaceutical formulations and associated analytical methods, and studies pertinent to pharmacokinetics using human biomaterials; 3. studies conducted in a single center or targeting rare diseases (because of limitations with anonymization).
