      The primary object of this study is, to investigate the current procedure of neuromuscular
      monitoring at a tertiary academic university medical center.

    <textblock>
      Residual neuromuscular block is known to be a significant but frequently overlooked
      complication after the use of neuromuscular blocking agents. Aim of this prospective,
      observational study is to detect the incidence and severity of residual paralysis at a
      tertiary academic german university medical center.

      Methods:

      All infantile patients recieving neuromuscular blocking agents are included over a 12 week
      observational period. At the end of the operation procedure, directly prior to tracheal
      extubation a train-of-four ratio was assessed quantitatively by an independet observer using
      the TOF Watch SX monitor. Data related to patient postoperative outcome were collected in the
      operating theatre, during the way to the postoperative care unit (PACU) and during the stay
      in the PACU:

        -  incidence of residual paralysis

        -  incidence of aspiration, bronchospasm, laryngospasm, oxygen desaturation, airway
           obstruction,
