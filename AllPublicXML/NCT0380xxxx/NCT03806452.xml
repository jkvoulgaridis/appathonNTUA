        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Signed and dated Informed Consent Form (ICF) by a legally competent patient.

          2. Patients above 18 years.

          3. Patients with HbSS or HbSÎ²0 SCD.

          4. Patients with a value of albuminuria, assessed by ACR, over 3 mg/mmol and inferior to
             100 mg/mmol confirmed by 3 positive urine samples taken one day apart.

          5. Female patients of childbearing potential or postmenopausal female with last period &lt;
             12 months before screening agreeing to use a highly effective form of contraception
             (oral, injected or implanted hormonal contraception, intrauterine device, diaphragm,
             condom) during the trial and for 3 months after hydroxycarbamide discontinuation.

          6. Male patients with partners of childbearing potential agreeing to use a highly
             effective contraception during the trial and for 3 months after hydroxycarbamide
             discontinuation. Men with pregnant or lactating women should be advised to use a
             barrier method of contraception (condom) to prevent the foetus or breastfed infant
             from exposure to hydroxycarbamide.

          7. Patients who are covered by insurance scheme according to local regulatory
             requierements.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients who had severe VOC requiring hospitalisation or ACS within the last 4 weeks
             preceding screening visit.

          2. Patients treated with hydroxycarbamide for any reason within the previous 6 months.

          3. Patients who have had chronic blood transfusion or transfusion in the last 3 months.

          4. Patients without any semen cryopreservation except vasectomised patients.

          5. Patients with a history of hypertension (systolic blood pressure â¥ 140 or diastolic
             blood pressure â¥ 90 mmHg) treated with antihypertensive agent belonging to
             pharmacological class of RAS inhibitor.

          6. Patients who have symptoms suggestive of urinary tract infection or patients with
             gross haematuria.

          7. Patients with a concomitant primary kidney disease.

          8. Patients with any systemic condition that could result in a glomerulopathy not related
             to SCD (e.g. diabetes mellitus, active hepatitis B or C infections, HIV infection,
             systemic lupus erythematosus, inflammatory arthropathies).

          9. Patient with a stage 3, 4 or 5 chronic kidney disease (eGFR &lt; 60 mL/min per 1.73 m2).

         10. Patients with eGFR â¥ 140 ml/min/1,73mÂ² due to the lack of information regarding the
             magnitude, direction and significance of the trends in eGFR evolution that could be
             expected in this population

         11. Patients requiring long-term treatment with drugs potentially nephrotoxic (see
             non-exhaustive list).

         12. Patients requiring ACE inhibitors or ARBs within the 3 months before inclusion
             regardless of the indication.

         13. Patients requiring long-term treatment with non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs.

         14. Patients who have a treatment which can modify the kidney function (see non-exhaustive
             list) in the last 3 months.

         15. Patients known to be infected with HIV.

         16. Female patients who are pregnant or lactating.

         17. Unreliable patients including non-compliant patients, patients with known alcoholism
             or drug abuse or with a history of a serious psychiatric disorder as well as patients
             unwilling to give informed consent or to abide by the requirements of the protocol.

         18. Simultaneous participation in other clinical trials on an investigational medicinal
             product or previous participation within 30 days before inclusion.

         19. Persons in detention by judicial or administrative decision.

         20. Patients with chronic conditions that upon investigator judgment may lead to a limited
             life expectancy
