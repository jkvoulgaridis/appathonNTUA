  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, propofol-controlled phase III clinical
      trial. The primary objective is to compare the efficacy and safety between propofol and
      HSK3486 for the induction of general anesthesia in elective surgery subjects, so as to
      provide reference for marketing registration of HSK3486.
