        Inclusion Criteria:

        Able to provide written informed consent and can understand and comply with the
        requirements of the study;

        Men/Women from 18 to 75 years old;

        Life expectancy of longer than 3 months ( clinical assessment);

        With an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0-1;

        Histological or cytological diagnosis of Squamous non-small cell Lung cancer;

        Locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC(stage IIIB/IV or recurrent NSCLC that do not meet the
        criteria for radical radiotherapy and chemotherapy，Tumor stage will be classified according
        to UICC/AJCC staging system version 8).Participants has received at least two previous
        chemotherapy regimens for treatment failure (including disease progression and unacceptable
        toxic and side effects).

        Note: a. first-line chemotherapy must be a platinum-containing two-drug regimen;b. Prior
        adjuvant/neoadjuvant chemotherapy is permitted.If recurrence or metastasis occurs during or
        within 6 months after the completion of adjuvant/neoadjuvant chemotherapy, it is considered
        that adjuvant/neoadjuvant chemotherapy is a first-line systemic chemotherapy failure for
        advanced disease.&quot; According to RECIST 1.1 , patients must have at least one measurable
        lesion that can be accurately assessed at baseline.

        Adequate organ and marrow function as defined below:

        Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) greater than/equal to 1.5×l09/L; Platelets greater
        than/equal to 75×109/L; Hemoglobin greater than/equal to 80g/L; Aspartate aminotransferase
        (AST)/alanine aminotransferase (ALT) less than/equal to 3 times ULN, or less than/equal to
        5 times ULN if known liver metastases; Total bilirubin less than/equal to 1.5 within
        institutional limit of normal (ULN); Serum creatinine less than/equal to 1.5 times ULN;
        Electrolyte: magnesium greater than/equal to normal.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Patients are allergic to antibodies or other components contained in the test drugs;

        Symptomatic metastatic central nervous system and/or cancerous meningitis.(After treatment
        for brain metastasis, disease should be stable and last for at least 4 weeks prior to the
        first study administration, not requiring for steroid or anticonvulsant therapy,Subjects
        with stable neurological symptoms may be enrolled ).For stable asymptomatic brain
        metastases that have been treated with radiotherapy, at least one other site besides the
        brain metastasis can be measured ,The subject can be enrolled, but the interval between the
        last radiotherapy should be more than 4 weeks..

        Subject receiving bisphosphonate or denosumab treatment for bone metastases was initiated
        within 28 days prior to study. (If the subject has received bisphosphonate or denosumab
        treatment prior to study and showing stable time less than 28 days,the subject is allowed
        to use it.) If the ongoing bisphosphonate therapy dose is considered to be increased or
        bisphosphonate therapy is initiated due to the aggravation of bone pain, researchers should
        confirm whether the subject has PD according to the RECIST1.1 version.

        Patients with other primary malignancies, except for before 5 years or more, malignant
        lesions had been treated with therapeutic measures and no known active lesions existed, and

        immune therapy, the antibody therapy, radiotherapy) or research drugs(42 days for
        nitrosourea or mitomycin C), or patients with grade 2 or more adverse reaction caused by
        previous anti-tumor therapy(except alopecia or neurotoxicity grade 2 or less);

        Patients are currently enrolled in other research devices or in research drugs, or less
        than 4 weeks from other research drugs or devices.

        &quot;Patients received major surgery(such as general anesthesia ) within 4 weeks ,or subjects
        did not recovered from the injury associated with the surgery.

        Note: surgery requiring local/epidural anesthesia must have been completed for at least 72
        hours and subjects must have recovered before starting the study medication.Skin biopsy
        under local anesthesia has been completed for at least 1 hour.&quot;

        Patients treated with EPO, G-CSF or GM-CSF before enrollment 2 weeks.

        pectoris, symptomatic congestive heart failure (NYHA, greater than II), uncontrollable
        severe arrhythmia); Patients occurred myocardial infarction within 6 months.

        Patients who have interstitial lung disease, such as interstitial pneumonia, pulmonary
        fibrosis, or on baseline chest CT or MRI reminder ILD .

        infection, there is no need to detect);

        Patients with uncontrolled active infections before enrollment 2 weeks (except simple
        urinary tract infection or upper respiratory tract infection);

        Pregnant or lactating women(Serum test must be negative within 7 days prior to study
