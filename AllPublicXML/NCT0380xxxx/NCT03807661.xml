      The objective of this post-market study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the
      LimFlow System in creating a below-the-knee arterio-venous fistula for venous arterialization
      in subjects with critical limb ischemia.

      This study will investigate the safety and effectiveness of the LimFlow System for creating
      an arterio-venous fistula in the below-the-knee vascular system using an endovascular,
      minimally invasive approach for the treatment of critical limb ischemia in subjects
      ineligible for conventional endovascular or surgical limb salvage procedures.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject must be &gt; 21 and &lt; 95 years of age

          -  Clinical diagnosis of symptomatic critical limb ischemia, defined as Rutherford
             category 5 or 6

          -  Assessment that no conventional surgical or endovascular treatment is possible

          -  Proximally, the target in-flow artery at the cross-over point must be treatable with a
             3.5 - 4.0 mm stent after pre-treatment (by visual estimate), and be &lt;50% stenosed

          -  Subject is willing and has adequate support to comply with protocol requirements,
             including medication regimen and follow-up visits

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Concomitant hepatic insufficiency, deep venous thrombus in target limb, uncorrected
             coagulation disorders, or current immunodeficiency disorder

          -  Prior vein stripping surgery and/or vessel harvesting for CABG in the limb intended
             for study

          -  Life expectancy less than 12 months

          -  Patient currently taking coumarin/warfarin which, in the opinion of the attending
             physician, interferes with the patient's treatment

          -  Any significant medical condition which, in the attending physician's opinion, may
             interfere with the patient's optimal treatment

          -  Patient currently participating in another investigational drug or device study that
             has not completed the primary endpoint or that clinically interferes with the
             endpoints of this treatment

          -  Patient unable to give consent

          -  Pregnant or breastfeeding women

          -  Documented myocardial infarction or stroke within previous 90 days

          -  Patients suffering from renal insufficiency (GFR value less than 30 ml/min/1.73 mÂ²)
             who are not on hemodialysis

          -  Patients with vasculitis and/or untreated popliteal aneurysms

          -  Patients with acute limb ischemia

          -  Prior peripheral arterial bypass procedure above or below the knee which could inhibit
             proximal inflow to the stent graft

          -  Lower extremity venous disease with significant edema in the target limb that may
             inhibit the procedure and/or jeopardize wound healing, in the investigator's opinion

          -  Known or suspected systemic or severe infection (e.g., WIfI foot Infection grade of 3)

          -  Known or suspected allergies or contraindications to stainless steel, nickel, or
             contrast agent that cannot be adequately pre-treated, or patients who cannot receive
             anticoagulation or antiplatelet aggregation therapy

          -  Severe heart failure, which in the opinion of the investigator may compromise
             subject's ability to safely undergo a percutaneous procedure (e.g., known ejection
             fraction of &lt; 40%, NYHA Classification III-IV)
