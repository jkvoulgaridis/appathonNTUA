    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the immune profile of blast cells and immune
      effector cells in paired peripheral whole blood and bone marrow samples from AML and MDS
      patients by standardized flow cytometry. A special emphasis will be focused on monitoring
      expression of CD200 as well as PGP-170 (MDR1) on blasts cells.

    <description>Twenty patients will be included in a prospective way over a period of nine months. No additional medullary or serum samples will be carried out in addition to those required for the clinical routine. Only an additional blood sample taken during a routine blood test will be recovered as part of the research. Just as some leftover bone marrow, taken as part of a usual unused follow-up will be recovered as part of this trial.
The persons concerned will be recruited on the occasion of their hospitalisation in one of the hematology services participating in the research, or during their consultation with one of the hematologists of the corresponding service (or services). On this occasion, detailed information on their pathology and research will be given, as well as the information document on the proposed research protocol.</description>
