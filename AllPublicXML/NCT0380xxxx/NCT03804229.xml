  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Butylphthalide soft capsule has been confirmed to have beneficial effects for patients with
      vascular dementia (VaD) in clinical trial of phase II study. So the investigators hypothesize
      that Butylphthalide soft capsule may have same beneficial effects for patients with VaD in an
      extended samples in phase III study. In present study the investigators will recruit patients
      with mild to moderate VaD in a multi-center, random, double blind and placebo control methods
      to confirm the efficacy and safety of Butylphthalide soft capsule. The outcome measures
      include general cognitive function, executive function, daily living skills, and mental
      behavior changes of symptoms in VaD patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Butylphthalide soft capsule is a synthetic chiral compound containing L- and D-isomers of
      butylphthalide. Studies in the past several decades have demonstrated that it could alleviate
      the learning and memory deficits induced by cerebral ischemia in rats. The phase II study
      enrolled 281 patients showed greater effects than placebo on ADAS-cog and CIBIC-plus.
      Butylphthalide soft capsule were uncommon and primarily consisted of mild gastrointestinal
      symptoms. In the present phase III study the investigators will re-assess the efficacy and
      the safety of Butylphthalide soft capsule for the treatment of mild to moderate vascular
      dementia in 700 subjects.

    <time_frame>Change from baseline VaDAS-cog score at Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>The group difference between the treatment group and the control group in the difference between the Vascular AD Assessment Scale Cognitive Subscale (VaDAS-cog) score at weeks 13, 26, 39 and 52 and the baseline score. The 6 areas of the cognitive function assessed by VaDAS-cog include the memory, the language competence, the orientation, the inferential capability, the practical ability and the comprehension. The total score is from 0 to 90 and the lower the score the milder the disease.</description>

    <description>The group difference between the treatment group and the control group in the difference between the Clinician Interview Based Impression of Severity (CIBIC-plus) score at weeks 13, 26, 39 and 52 and the baseline score. CIBIC-plus is a kind of scale that is assessed based on the clinical changes of the patient according to the impression obtained through interviewing the patient and other insiders. The score is from 1 to 7. And 1 indicates that the recovery is optimal, 4 indicates that there is no change and 7 indicates overall worsening.</description>

    <measure>Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline NPI score at Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>It evaluates both the presence and severity of 12 neuropsychiatric features. The caregiver is asked to rate the frequency of the symptoms of that domain on a scale of 1 to 4 (1 = occasionally, less than once per week; 4 = very frequently, once or more per day or continuously) as well as their severity (1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe). The total score for each domain is calculated by multiplying the frequency by the severity. A total score is calculated by adding all the domain scores together. Caregiver distress is rated by the caregiver on a six-point scale from 0 (no distress) to 5 (very severe or extreme distress). The total score of the caregiver's distress is obtained separately. The total NPI score is from 0 to 144 and the lower the score the milder the disease, the total caregiver distress score is from 0 to 6. The group difference between the NPI scores at weeks 13 (±7 days), week 26 (±7 days), week 39 (±7 days) and week 52 (±7 days) and the base line score.</description>
