  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Previous studies have explored the correlation and impact of astrological events in relation
      of diseases, health concerns and relationship between birth chart and disease risk.
      Cardiovascular conditions, sleep and fertility were found significantly associated with moon
      phase. However, to best of our knowledge no study has documented the impact of astrological
      intervention in disease management.

      This is a randomised, multi-center, double blind placebo controlled clinical trial with two
      parallel arms. This trial aims to evaluate the effectiveness of Vedic medical astrological
      intervention for patients with mild to moderate hypertension,with respect to decreasing their
      blood pressure and improving their quality of life.
