    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine the characteristics of patients with diabetes and
      sarcoidosis and to compare them with those of patients with diabetes and no sarcoidosis. The
      investigators will approach these aims by measuring hemoglobin A1c, C peptide, insulin
      levels, and 2-hour glucose tolerance test results on the study population as well as
      collecting clinical data from records. Three groups of patients will be identified from
      pulmonary and endocrinology clinics at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. The first
      group will have a diagnosis of sarcoidosis without diabetes, the second group will have a
      diagnosis of both sarcoidosis and diabetes, and the third group will have a diagnosis of
      diabetes without sarcoidosis. Sample size is not pre-determined, but investigators anticipate
      this number to be less than 100. These patients will be asked in person during an office
      visit to join the study. For each patient who agrees to join, at a clinic visit,
      investigators will review and sign consent. Following the visit or at a time convenient for
      each patient, study subjects will undergo a fasting plasma venous sample collection for a
      hemoglobin A1c, C peptide, insulin level and perform a 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test.
      The degree of glucose intolerance and prevalence of diabetes will be analyzed and compared
      between the groups and to historical published control data via T test comparisons. At a
      later separate visit, patients recruited will undergo ultrasound of the pancreas to assess
      pancreatic size and morphology.
