  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      AZD9977 is an oral, selective mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) modulator. AZD9977 is a partial
      antagonist and partial agonist in reporter gene assays and has a different interaction
      pattern with the MR compared to eplerenone. This study will assess the safety, tolerability
      and pharmacokinetics (PK) of AZD9977, following oral administration of single and multiple
      ascending dose of AZD9977.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a Phase I, randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled, single and multiple
      ascending dose sequential-group design study. The study will be conducted in healthy Japanese
      participants and performed at a single study center. Fourth-five healthy Japanese
      participants are planned to be included in the study and up to 5 additional participants may
      be enrolled into the study if replacement participants are needed.

      Three cohorts consisting of 9 participants each will participate in the study. Depending on
      the findings, up to 2 additional cohorts may be added if the Safety Review Committee (SRC)
      considers it necessary to repeat a dose level or if additional dose steps are required.

      Within each cohort, 6 participants will be randomized to receive AZD9977 and 3 participants
      randomized to receive placebo.

      Each participant will receive AZD9977 at the selected dose level or placebo on Day 1 and from
      Day 3 to 9, with single dose on Day 1 and Day 9 and twice a day (BID) dosing on Day 3 to Day
      8. No dose will be given on Day 2.

      The study will comprise of:

        -  A Screening Period of maximum 28 days;

        -  A Treatment Period during which participants will be resident at the Clinical Unit from
           the day before Investigational Medicinal Product (IMP) administration (Day -1) until at
           least 48 hours after IMP administration; discharged on Day 11, and

        -  A Follow-up Visit within 5 to 7 days after the last IMP dose. Each participant will be
           involved in the study for approximately 6 weeks.

          3. Healthy male Japanese participants aged 18 to 50 years (inclusive) with suitable veins
             for cannulation or repeated venipuncture. A Japanese participant is defined as having
             both parents and 4 grandparents who are ethnically Japanese. This includes second and
             third generation Japanese whose parents or grandparents are living in a country other
             than Japan.

          4. Have a body mass index (BMI) between 18 and 30 kg/m2 inclusive and weigh at least 50
             kg and no more than 100 kg inclusive.

          5. Provision of signed, written and dated informed consent for optional genetic/biomarker
             research. If a participant decline to participate in the genetic and/or biomarker
             component of the study, there will be no penalty or loss of benefit to the
             participant. The participant will not be excluded from other aspects of the study
             described in this protocol.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. History of any clinically important disease or disorder which, in the opinion of the
             Investigator, may either put the participant at risk because of participation in the
             study, or influence the results or the participant's ability to participate in the
             study.

          2. History or presence of gastrointestinal, hepatic or renal disease or any other
             condition known to interfere with absorption, distribution, metabolism or excretion of
             drugs. 3. Any clinically important illness, medical/surgical procedure or trauma
             within 4 weeks of the first administration of IMP.

        4. Any clinically important abnormalities in clinical chemistry, hematology or urinalysis
        results at the Screening Visit and/or admission.

        4.1. Serum potassium &gt; 5.0 mmol/L 4.2. Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) &gt; 5.7% 5. Any positive result
        on Screening for serum hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis C antibody and human
        immunodeficiency virus (HIV).

        6. Abnormal vital signs, after 10 minutes supine rest at the Screening Visit and/or
        admission 7. Any clinically important abnormalities in rhythm, conduction or morphology of
        the resting electrocardiography (ECG) and any clinically important abnormalities in the 12
        Lead ECG as judged by the Investigator that may interfere with the interpretation of QTc
        interval changes, including abnormal ST-T-wave morphology, particularly in the protocol
        defined primary lead or LV hypertrophy at the Screening Visit and/or admission.

        8. Known or suspected history of drug abuse in the last 12 months before the Screening
        Visit as judged by the Investigator.

        9. Current smokers or those who have smoked or used nicotine products (including
        e-cigarettes) within the previous 3 months.

        10. History of alcohol abuse in the last 12 months before the Screening Visit or current
        excessive intake of alcohol as judged by the Investigator.

        11. Positive screen for drugs of abuse, alcohol or cotinine (nicotine) at Screening or
        admission.

        12. History of severe allergy/hypersensitivity or ongoing clinically important
        allergy/hypersensitivity, as judged by the Investigator or history of hypersensitivity to
        drugs with a similar chemical structure or class to AZD9977.

        13. Excessive intake of caffeine-containing drinks or food (e.g., coffee, tea, chocolate,)
        as judged by the Investigator.

        14. Use of drugs with enzyme inducing properties such as St John's Wort within 3 weeks
        prior to the first administration of IMP.

        15. Use of any prescribed or nonprescribed medication including antacids, analgesics (other
        than paracetamol/acetaminophen), herbal remedies, mega-dose vitamins (intake of 20 to 600
        times the recommended daily dose) and minerals during the 2 weeks prior to the first
        administration of IMP or longer if the medication has a long half-life.

        16. Plasma donation within 1 month of the Screening Visit or any blood donation/blood loss
        &gt; 500 mL during the 3 months prior to the Screening Visit.

        17. Has received another new chemical entity (defined as a compound which has not been
        approved for marketing) within 3 months of the first administration of IMP in this study.
        The period of exclusion begins 3 months after the final dose or 1 month after the last
        visit, whichever is the longest. Participants consented and screened, but not randomized in
        this study or a previous Phase I study, are not excluded.

        18. Participants who have previously received AZD9977. 19. Involvement of any Astra Zeneca
        or Clinical Unit employee or their close relatives.

        20. Judgment by the Investigator that the participant should not participate in the study
        if they have any ongoing or recent (i.e., during the Screening Period) minor medical
        complaints that may interfere with the interpretation of study data or are considered
        unlikely to comply with study procedures, restrictions and requirements.

        21. Vulnerable participants, e.g., kept in detention, protected adults under guardianship,
        trusteeship, or committed to an institution by governmental or juridical order.

        In addition, any of the following is regarded as a criterion for exclusion from the genetic
        research:

        22. Previous bone marrow transplant. 23. Non-leukocyte depleted whole blood transfusion
        within 120 days of the date of the genetic sample collection.
