  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The third space robotic and endoscopic cooperative surgery (TS-RECS) combines the endoscopic
      techniques and the merits of Da Vinci surgical robot, such as flexible and precise
      instruments, tremors filtering system and a 3-D surgical view. TS-RECS takes full advantage
      of the methodology of the third space, making it possible to dissect gastric GISTs
      (gastrointestinal stromal tumors) entirely without the damage of mucosal layer. Here, this
      study preliminarily assessed the feasibility, safety and effectivity of the novel hybrid
      operation.
