  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Home non-invasive ventilators are daily used by patients with chronic respiratory failure.
      There are frequently used with warming and humidifying systems. These systems need to be
      cared for and frequently washed by the patient.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate if the humidifying system of home ventilators are
      colonized by microbiological germs.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The use of non-invasive ventilators is common for treating respiratory failure. Their care
      relies on the patients and their carers.

      No study has assessed the efficacy of such care with respect to the number of microbiological
      specimens that remain in the humidifier.

Who is maintaining the ventilator (descriptive)
At which frequency are you changing the water (Everyday (adequate), every other-day (almost adequate), every week (inadequate), more than weekly (inadequate)
What type of water are you using (descriptive)
At which frequency are you cleaning the mask (Everyday (adequate), every other-day (almost adequate), every week (inadequate), more than weekly (inadequate)
At which frequency are you cleaning the humidifier (Everyday (adequate), every other-day (almost adequate), every week (inadequate), more than weekly (inadequate)
How are you cleaning the humidifier? Water (inadequate), soap (adequate), dishawashing liquid (inadequate)</description>
