    <measure>Lung function as assessed by spirometry (air volume)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline Spirometry score at 2 months</time_frame>
    <description>Spirometry is the most common form of measurement of lung function. The test measures the amount (volume) of air that can be inhaled and exhaled. Spirometry generates pneumotachographs, which are charts that plot the volume of air coming in and out of the lungs from one inhalation and one exhalation.</description>

    <description>Survey of health status and quality of life
From (https://www.rand.org/health-care/surveys_tools/mos/36-item-short-form/scoring.html) &quot;Scoring the RAND 36-Item Health Survey is a two-step process. First, precoded numeric values are recoded per the scoring key given in Table 1. Note that all items are scored so that a high score defines a more favorable health state. In addition, each item is scored on a 0 to 100 range so that the lowest and highest possible scores are 0 and 100, respectively. Scores represent the percentage of total possible score achieved. In step 2, items in the same scale are averaged together to create the 8 scale scores. Table 2 lists the items averaged together to create each scale. Items that are left blank (missing data) are not taken into account when calculating the scale scores. Hence, scale scores represent the average for all items in the scale that the respondent answered.&quot;</description>

    <measure>Lung Information Needs Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline Lung Information Needs Questionnaire score at 2 months</time_frame>
    <description>The questionnaire used to identify a person with COPD's need for information about their disease. The questionnaire measures the extent to which the patient needs more information, as perceived by the patient and clinician. It is scored to produce an overall score and 6 domain scores (Disease knowledge, medicines, self-management, exercise, diet, smoking).
The score is the sum of all 6 domains with a range from 0-25. High scores indicate high information needs, a lower score is better.</description>

    <description>Participants in the Pulmonary Rehabilitation Paper-Based Home Program will receive usual care pulmonary rehab home programs (paper handout). Home programs typically consist of exercises including upper extremity strengthening, lower extremity strengthening, aerobic exercises such as walking and balance training. Each program is personalized as per the participant's ability. The intervention is exercise and education, which is personalized for each participant. No drugs are being tested in this study.</description>
