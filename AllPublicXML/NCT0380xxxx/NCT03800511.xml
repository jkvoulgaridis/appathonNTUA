  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recognition of intraabdominal adhesion before doing repeated cesarean section is helpful for
      the surgeon and patients.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      the repeated cesarean section is associated with recorded maternal morbidity including
      placenta preavia and accreta , liability to injuries to the bladder, intestine or vascular
      injuries. The anticipation of the problem is important for decreasing its adverse effect .
      preoperative diagnosis of pelvic adhesion between the uterus and anterior abdominal wall,
      bladder, intestine or omentum could b of help to give time for a surgeon to prepare senior
      staff obstetrician or others and theatre requirements to overcome any problem happened.
