  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this double-blind, randomized trial is to compare the clinical performance of
      a composite restorations in root surface carious lesions with or without resin modified glass
      ionomer lining.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Thirty-nine patients with at least one pair of equivalent root caries lesions and a mean age
      of 39.6 years (range 18-65 years; median 39 years) were enrolled in this study. After caries
      removal, the depth, length, and width of the cavity were measured. Lesions in the same
      patient was randomly divided into two groups, and the dentin surfaces were either lined with
      resin-modified glass ionomer liner (Glass liner II, Willmann &amp; Pein GmbH Dental, Barmstedt,
      Germany) or not. All cavities were restored with nanohybrid composite resin (Clearfil Majesty
      Esthetic, Kuraray, Tokyo, Japan). A total of 100 restorations (50 lined, 50 unlined) were
      placed according to manufacturer's instructions. The restorations will be evaluated at
      baseline and at 6, 12, 24, 36, 48 months and 5-year after placement using the modified
      Haveman Criteria for marginal adaptation, anatomic form, marginal staining, anatomic form,
      caries in adjacent tooth structure, caries at the cavosurface margin and sensitivity.
      Statistical analysis will be conducted using the Chi- Square, Fisher's Exact, Mann Whitney-U
      and Cochran Q tests at a significance level of 5% (P &lt; 0.05).

    <description>1.Retention Alpha for at least 90% of the restorations The primary factor for determining the clinical performance of a restorative material is the retention rate. It represents the survival rates of the restorations after a period of time. According to ADA (American Dental Association) guidelines, a restorative material should show at leat 90% alpha retention rate after 18 months to be considered as clinically acceptable. The retention is assessed as alpha (retentive restoration) or charlie (failed restoration). Clinical evaluation is performed to examine if the restoration is in place or has fallen.</description>
