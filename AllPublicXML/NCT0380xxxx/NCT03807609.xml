  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the present study is to compare the effect of an exercise performed 180 or 30
      minutes before lunch on the energy intake of adolescents with obesity.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The present study will compare the nutritional response to the realisation of an acute
      exercise 180 or 30 minutes before an ad libitum buffet meal in adolescents with obesity. 18
      adolescents with obesity will be asked to randomly complete three experimental sessions: i)
      one control session (rest); ii) one session with an acute exercise realized 180 minutes
      before lunch; iii) one session with the same exercise performed 30 minutes before lunch.
      Their ad libitum energy intake will be assessed during lunch as well as at dinner time.
      Appetite feelings will be assessed at regular intervals and their food reward in response to
      the lunch will also be assessed.

    <measure>Energy intake measured during an ad libitum buffet meal (in kcal).</measure>
    <time_frame>at day 1</time_frame>
    <description>food intake will be measured ad libitum during a lunch buffet. The adolescents will be offered an ad libitum buffet-type meal composed based on their food intake preferences. Their intake will be weighted using an electronic food scale (Casio Scale, units: grams) by a member of the investigation team and then analysed using Bilnuts software.</description>

    <measure>Hunger feelings</measure>
    <time_frame>at day 1</time_frame>
    <description>hunger area under the curve will be assessed using visual analogue scale (VAS) through a the day ranging from 0 to 150, 0 being &quot;not at all&quot;, 150 being &quot;completely&quot;. The question asked being: How hungry are you right now?&quot;</description>

    <description>Leeds Food Preference Questionnaire; LFPQ.Briefly, the LFPQ provides measures of the wanting and liking for an array of food images, varying in both fat content and taste.To measure the explicit liking and explicit wanting, participants are asked to rate the extent to which they &quot;liked&quot; or &quot;wanted&quot; each randomly presented food item with a 100-mm visual analogue scale. . The construct from the scales are : Explicit liking; Explicit Wanting; Implicit liking, implicit wanting, Fat Choice and Fat Taste. Each component ranged from -50 to +50. There is no total score.</description>
