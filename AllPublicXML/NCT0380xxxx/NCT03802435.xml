  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is the most common peripheral entrapment neuropathy with
      involving compression of the median nerve in the carpal tunnel. The technique of perineural
      injection therapy (PIT) by using 5% dextrose (D5W) is now commonly used for peeling the nerve
      from surrounding soft tissue (called nerve hydrodissection), which may help antineurogenic
      inflammation, allow the impulse to pass, and rescue the nerve with ischemic damage. However,
      the evidence and reference of PIT and nerve hydrodissection are very seldom until our series
      researches since 2017. Moreover, our research revealed PIT with D5W is more beneficial than
      that of corticosteroid in patients with mild-to-moderate CTS at 4 to 6 months postinjection.
      However, the accumulative effect and long-term effect (more than 6 months) of PIT is still
      unknown. Hence, we design a randomized, double- blind, controlled trail to assess the
      long-term effect of ultrasound-guided PIT in patients with CTS. The aim one is to survey the
      possible accumulative effect of different sessions of PIT (6 months follow-up) and aim two is
      to evaluate the long-term effect and safety of PIT (one year follow-up).

      After obtaining written informed consent, patients clinically diagnosed with mild-to-moderate
      CTS were includes and randomized into three groups. Group A, patients received two-sessions
      of ultrasound-guided PIT with 10cc D5W (3 months interval); Group B, patients received
      one-session of ultrasound-guided PIT with 10cc D5W and 5cc normal saline separately (3 months
      interval); Group C (control group), patients received two-sessions of ultrasound-guided PIT
      with nerve hydrodissection with 10cc normal saline. The primary outcome is Boston Carpal
      Tunnel Syndrome Questionnaire (BCTQ) and secondary outcomes include visual analog scale
      (VAS), cross-sectional area (CSA) of the median nerve, nerve conduction velocity of the
      median nerve, and Global assessment of treatment. The evaluations were performed pretreatment
      as well as on the 1st, 3rd, 6th, 9th month and one year after first injection.

    <description>Boston carpal tunnel syndrome questionnaire (BCTQ) is a frequently used patient-based questionnaire for measurement of CTS which encompasses two components. In total, 11 questions and 8 items were evaluated to rate the symptom severity scale (SSS) and functional status scale (FSS), respectively. Both subscales range from 1 to 5 with a higher score indicating a higher degree of disability. The mean of total SSS and FSS divided with each item score were used for further analysis.</description>
