  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic autoimmune neurodegenerative disease of the central
      nervous system (CNS). The symptoms of MS are wide-ranging, but patients perceive loss of
      physical function (gait) and cognitive function as the most critical consequences of the
      disease. Moreover, recent studies have shown that already at early disease stages functional
      impairments are present.

      One of the more recent approved medical treatments for MS patients is Alemtuzumab (product
      name Lemtrada), a humanized monoclonal antibody targeting CD52 cells, that depletes and
      repopulates B lymphocytes and T lymphocytes, causing sustained changes in the adaptive
      immunity. In 2013 and 2014 Alemtuzumab was approved in EU and USA, respectively.

      With the exception of the MS Functional Composite z-score, the previous clinical studies
      investigating the effect of Alemtuzumab have exclusively focused on clinical parameters such
      as MRI indications of disease activity (accumulation of lesion, total and regional brain
      atrophy etc.), relapse-rates, changes in 'expanded disability status scale' (EDSS) and
      side-effects/adverse events. However, no previous studies have performed in depth monitoring
      on how physical or cognitive performance are affected following initiation of treatment with
      Alemtuzumab despite the paramount importance to patients.

      The primary purpose of this project is to monitor the changes in physical performance during
      the first two years of treatment with Alemtuzumab in a well characterised Danish cohort of
      people with relapsing-remitting MS. A secondary purpose is to monitor the impact of
      Alemtuzumab treatment on cognition during the first two years of treatment.
