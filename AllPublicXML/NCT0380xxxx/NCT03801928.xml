    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, observational, multicenter study conducted in adult patients with
      ulcerative colitis (UC) or Crohn's disease (CD). The study plans to recruit 300 subjects in
      the United States and Canada in which the participating physician has decided to treat with
      INFLECTRA. The study will evaluate treatment patterns, adherence, disease activity, remission
      status, relapse status, treatment satisfaction, and healthcare resource utilization. Patient
      outcomes will be assessed at four time points (quarterly) for approximately 52 weeks after
      the decision to initiate treatment with INFLECTRA.

        A total of 300 patients are planned to be enrolled from approximately 30 40 physician
        clinics. Enrollment is planned to be competitive, but an upper limit of 20 patients per
        site per cohort will be applied to maintain the generalizability of the study. This is an
        observational study; therefore the decision to treat a patient with INFLECTRA must be made
        prior to a decision to enroll them in this study. Patients are eligible to participate if
        they have:

          -  Initiated therapy with INFLECTRA as their first biologic;

          -  Switched to INFLECTRA while in remission on a stable dose of REMICADE; or,

          -  Switched to INFLECTRA from another biologic, due to non responsiveness, intolerance,
             or other reasons.
