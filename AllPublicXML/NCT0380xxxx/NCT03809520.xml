  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The immediate goal of the proposed research is to test the value of a new low-cost, low-dose
      standing CT system for efficient early detection of both joint degeneration and elevated
      contact stress. The standing CT scanner holds promise for detecting arthritic changes earlier
      than other imaging modalities because of the combination of its 3D nature and ability to
      image joints in a weight-bearing pose. A secondary goal of the proposed research is to enable
      predictive models for osteoarthritis risk based on measures of post treatment contact stress,
      both to inform treatment and so that new interventions can be tested in a manner
      incorporating risk stratification.

      Individuals who present with an intra-articular of the tibial plafond will be consented to
      participate in this study. We will obtain pedCAT scans at 6, 12, and 18 months post-injury,
      as well as several questionnaires that will be administered during the clinical visits. We
      will also review the subjects' electronic medical record for data related to the injury,
      including the timing and mechanism of injury, time from injury to surgery, length of hospital
      stay, any complications and/or subsequent ankle surgeries, as well as any clinic notes,
      imaging, and/or outcomes scores related to the calcaneus fracture.
