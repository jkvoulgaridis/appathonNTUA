  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Women who deliver their baby vaginally often suffer from a perineal wound. The wound is after
      being sutured sometimes dehisced after days up to a few weeks and this study will investigate
      whether it is better to resuture early or leave the rupture for secondary healing.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      140 women will be included in the trial, 70 women will be randomized to resuturing and 70
      women will be randomized to expectant management. The investigators will follow the women
      with clinical investigations after 2 and 4 weeks. After two weeks the healing will be
      measured using the REEDA scale and the women will be asked whether they breastfeed or not.
      The psychological wellbeing will be measured using the EPDS (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression
      Scale).

      After four weeks the above will be done again as well as collecting of the daily pain diary
      that the women have filled in since being included in the trial.

      After one year the women will be seen again and the investigators will do a clinical
      investigation including ultrasound of the perineal body, measurement of the perineal body,
      POP-Q ( Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantification System) as well as multiple validated scales as
      EPDS, FSFI ( Female Sexual Function Index), PFIQ (Pelvic Floor Impact Questionnaire) and PFDI
      (Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory). These scales will help the investigators to find out if
      the women have moderate to much trouble with vaginal wideness and/ or moderate to much
      problems during defecation and therefore, if the perineal body is palpated smaller than 2 cm,
      there will be indication for a perineal reconstruction.

      The primary outcome will be to investigate whether early resuturing is reducing the need of a
      later secondary reconstruction of the perineal body compared with conservative management
      concerning dehisced perineal wounds.

      The secondary outcomes will be to investigate whether early resuturing is reducing the risk
      of having symptoms from the perineum and/or sexual problems one year after delivery.

      The healing of the wound and the estimated pain will be compared between the two groups.

      Certain questions concerning secondary fear of childbirth will also be asked and compared
      between the two groups.

    <description>Digital palpation of the perineal body and assessment of thickness. POP-Q score; nine points in the vagina are identified. The hymen is the reference point to which the other points are compared. The prolapsed organs are measured in centimeters to the hymen. The measurements are taken when the Valsalva maneuver is performed by the woman.
Anovaginal distance using perineal ultrasound. Validated scales to identify specific symptoms from the perineum and to identify the feeling of vaginal wideness and the need for digital assistance during defecation.

    <description>The PFDI 20 is both a symptom inventory and a measure of the degree of bother and distress (quality-of-life) caused by pelvic floor symptoms. It includes 20 questions and 3 scales. The 3 scales include questions taken from the following widely used outcome measures: Urinary Distress Inventory - 6 questions, Pelvic Organ Prolapse Distress Inventory - 6 questions, and Colorectal-Anal Distress Inventory - 8 questions. Each of the 3 scales is scored from 0 (least distress) to 100 (greatest distress). The sum of the scores of these 3 scales serves as the overall summary score of the PFDI-20 and ranges from 0 - 300.</description>

    <description>The PFIQ-7 is used to assess life impact in women with pelvic floor disorders. It consists of 3 scales of 7 questions each taken from the Urinary Impact Questionnaire, the Pelvic Organ Prolapse Impact Questionnaire, and the Colorectal-Anal Impact Questionnaire. The 3 scales are scored from 0 (least impact) to 100 (greatest impact) and an overall summary score (0 to 300).</description>

    <description>The FSFI comprises of a 19 item questionnaire focused on sexual functioning. There are six domains assessed. The subject is advised to consider each of the questions in the context of the last 4 weeks. The answer choices in the FSFI carry a number of points and are summed to obtain six domain scores and an overall score. For the latter here is a threshold at 26.55 which means that all values below are classed as indicating female sexual dysfunction (FSD).</description>

    <description>One question concerning fear of giving birth in the future will be asked: &quot;What kind of delivery method would you prefer if getting pregnant again in the future, vaginal delivery or planned c-section?&quot;. W-DEQ B (Wijma Delivery Expectancy Questionnaire) is a questionnaire measuring the fear of giving birth after delivering. The questionnaire consists of 33 questions, every question has a score from 1-6. The higher score, the higher is the fear of giving birth.</description>
