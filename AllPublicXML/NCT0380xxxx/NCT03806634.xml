    <measure>System Usability Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>2019.04.01~2019.06.30</time_frame>
    <description>It consists of a 10 item questionnaire with five response options for respondents; from Strongly agree to Strongly disagree. And also we can know the sanctification of the patient with ALS and their caregiver.</description>

    <time_frame>2019.04.01~2019.06.30</time_frame>
    <description>ALSSQOL-R is a 50 item instrument that measures overall quality of life (QOL) and six specific domains for individuals with ALS.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Taiwanese Depression Questionnaire, TDQ</measure>
    <time_frame>2019.04.01~2019.06.30</time_frame>
    <description>The TDQ is a culturally relevant questionnaire, which is adaptable for screening depressive people in the local communities.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Caregiver Burden Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>2019.04.01~2019.06.30</time_frame>
    <description>The burden experienced by family caregivers is the most important caregiver-related variable in care at home of a chronically-ill person. The extent of subjective burden has significant impact on the emotional and physical health of the family caregiver, and even influences the mortality of spouse caregivers. It affects the way the family caregiver deals with the care-receiver and determines the time of institutionalization.</description>

        Participants with ALS were recruited from ALS clinics(Taipei Veterans General Hospital,
        Taiwan, R.O.C),20 participants. Participants were eligible for this study if they were
        diagnosed with definite, probable, probable laboratory-supported, or possible ALS according
        to the criteria (Brooks et al., 2000).

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Escorial revised criteria (Brooks et al., 2000),The diagnosis of ALS requires:

        (A) the presence of:

          -  (A:1) evidence of lower motor neuron (LMN) degeneration by clinical,
             electrophysiological or neuropathologic examination (A:2) evidence of upper motor
             neuron (UMN) degeneration by clinical examination, and

          -  (A:3) progressive spread of symptoms or signs within a region or to other regions, as
             determined by history or examination, together with: (B) the absence of (B:1)
             electrophysiological or pathological evidence of other disease processes that might
             explain the signs of LMN and/or UMN degeneration, and (B:2) neuroimaging evidence of
             other disease processes that might explain the observed clinical and
             electrophysiological signs.

               -  If they were Taiwanese and used traditional Chinese(Mandarin).

               -  If they were older than age 20 years.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  If they had been diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia, severe depression, or
             schizophrenia.

          -  If they cannot see the communication board after correction.

          -  If they cannot complete the questionnaire with researchers or family members help.
