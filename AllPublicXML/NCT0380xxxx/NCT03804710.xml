      This study will be a randomized, evaluator-blind, single-center, two-treatment regimen,
      controlled, parallel-group, with a treatment period of 4 weeks. The study will assess the
      skin barrier function of the two-treatment regimen in healthy participants with dry,
      sensitive skin on the face and lower legs. All participants will be centrally randomized to
      one of the 2 treatment groups using an Interactive Response Technology (IRT).

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Trans-epidermal Water Loss (TEWL) Following Application of Test Regimen on Face (Area 1 Compared to Area 2) at Day 29</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Day 29</time_frame>
    <description>TEWL was measured using the Tewameter TM 300. TEWL is a non-invasive method to measure the integrity of stratum corneum barrier function. Tewameter probe measures the density gradient of the water evaporation from the skin indirectly by two pairs of sensors (temperature and relative humidity) inside a hollow cylinder. The probe was held in place on the skin for one measurement, for 40 sec, to ensure that a stable value has been established. The values of the last 10 sec are averaged as the actual measurement values. An increase in TEWL values shows damage to the skin barrier function. TEWL was measured at area 1 (right face) and 2 (left face) at baseline visit (Visit 2) prior to any study product application and then measured throughout the study period per the study schedule. Change from baseline was calculated as the value at specified visit (Visit 5/Day 29) minus the baseline value.</description>

    <description>Stratum corneum (SC) moisturization measured using the Corneometer CM 825. The measuring principle is based on changes in the capacitance of the measuring head, functioning as condensator. The electric field was created between gold conductors to enable the dielectricity of the SC to be measured. Because the dielectricity varies as a function of the skin's water content, the SC moisturization was measured. Corneometer probe was placed in contact with the skin of the participants test site for 1 to 2 sec per measurement. The measurement will be taken 5 times in total and then an average reading will be calculated for each site and time point. The Corneometer values lower than 30 international units (i.u) represent very dry skin and values between 30 to 50 i.u represent dry skin on the forearm. Higher value of Corneometer indicates high moisture content. The area 1 (right face) and area 2 (left face) were considered.</description>

          <title>Fitzpatrick Skin Type Grading</title>
          <description>Fitzpatrick scale was used to classify a participant’s skin type by their response to sun exposure. This scale emphasizes on potentials for irritation, burns and hyperpigmentation, indicators for future product choices. This scale has six grading, where I refers to always burns easily; never tans, II refers to always burns easily; tans minimally, III refers to burns moderately; tans gradually, IV refers to burns minimally, always tans well, V refers to rarely burns, tans profusely and VI refers to never burns.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Trans-epidermal Water Loss (TEWL) Following Application of Test Regimen on Face (Area 1 Compared to Area 2) at Day 29</title>
        <description>TEWL was measured using the Tewameter TM 300. TEWL is a non-invasive method to measure the integrity of stratum corneum barrier function. Tewameter probe measures the density gradient of the water evaporation from the skin indirectly by two pairs of sensors (temperature and relative humidity) inside a hollow cylinder. The probe was held in place on the skin for one measurement, for 40 sec, to ensure that a stable value has been established. The values of the last 10 sec are averaged as the actual measurement values. An increase in TEWL values shows damage to the skin barrier function. TEWL was measured at area 1 (right face) and 2 (left face) at baseline visit (Visit 2) prior to any study product application and then measured throughout the study period per the study schedule. Change from baseline was calculated as the value at specified visit (Visit 5/Day 29) minus the baseline value.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in TEWL Following Application of Test Regimen on Legs (Area 5 Compared to Area 6) at Day 15</title>
          <description>TEWL was measured using the Tewameter TM 300. TEWL is a non-invasive method to measure the integrity of stratum corneum barrier function. Tewameter probe measures the density gradient of the water evaporation from the skin indirectly by two pairs of sensors (temperature and relative humidity) inside a hollow cylinder. The probe was held in place on the skin for one measurement, for 40 sec, to ensure that a stable value has been established. The values of the last 10 sec are averaged as the actual measurement values. An increase in TEWL values shows damage to the skin barrier function. TEWL was measured at area 5 (right leg) and 6 (left leg) at baseline visit (Visit 2) prior to any study product application and then measured throughout the study period per the study schedule. Change from baseline was calculated as the value at specified visit (Visit 5/Day 29) minus the baseline value (Visit 2).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Corneometer Values Following Application of Test Regimen on Face (Area 1 Compared to Area 2) at Two Different Time-points [30 Minutes (Mins) and 6 Hrs After First Application] at Day 1 and One Time-point at Day 2</title>
        <description>Stratum corneum (SC) moisturization measured using the Corneometer CM 825. The measuring principle is based on changes in the capacitance of the measuring head, functioning as condensator. The electric field was created between gold conductors to enable the dielectricity of the SC to be measured. Because the dielectricity varies as a function of the skin's water content, the SC moisturization was measured. Corneometer probe was placed in contact with the skin of the participants test site for 1 to 2 sec per measurement. The measurement will be taken 5 times in total and then an average reading will be calculated for each site and time point. The Corneometer values lower than 30 international units (i.u) represent very dry skin and values between 30 to 50 i.u represent dry skin on the forearm. Higher value of Corneometer indicates high moisture content. The area 1 (right face) and area 2 (left face) were considered.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Corneometer Values Following Application of Test Regimen on Face (Area 1 Compared to Area 2) at Day 15 and 29</title>
        <description>SC moisturization measured using the Corneometer CM 825. The measuring principle is based on changes in the capacitance of the measuring head, functioning as condensator. The electric field was created between gold conductors to enable the dielectricity of the SC to be measured. Because the dielectricity varies as a function of the skin's water content, the SC moisturization was measured. Corneometer probe was placed in contact with the skin of the participants test site for 1 to 2 sec per measurement. The measurement will be taken 5 times in total and then an average reading will be calculated for each site and time point. The Corneometer values lower than 30 i.u represent very dry skin and values between 30 to 50 i.u represent dry skin on the forearm. Higher value of Corneometer indicates high moisture content. The area 1 (right face) and area 2 (left face) were considered.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in TEWL Following Application of Test Regimen on Face (Area 1 Compared to Area 2) at Day 30, 31, 32, 33 and 34</title>
        <description>TEWL was measured using the Tewameter TM 300. TEWL is a non-invasive method to measure the integrity of stratum corneum barrier function. Tewameter probe measures the density gradient of the water evaporation from the skin indirectly by two pairs of sensors (temperature and relative humidity) inside a hollow cylinder. The probe was held in place on the skin for one measurement, for 40 sec, to ensure that a stable value has been established. The values of the last 10 sec are averaged as the actual measurement values. An increase in TEWL values shows damage to the skin barrier function. TEWL was measured at area 1 (right face) and 2 (left face) at baseline visit (Visit 2) prior to any study product application and then measured throughout the study period per the study schedule. Change from baseline was calculated as the value at specified visit (Visit 5/Day 29) minus the baseline value.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in TEWL Following Application of Test Regimen on Legs (Area 5 Compared to Area 6) at Day 30, 31, 32, 33 and 34</title>
        <description>TEWL was measured using the Tewameter TM 300. TEWL is a non-invasive method to measure the integrity of stratum corneum barrier function. Tewameter probe measures the density gradient of the water evaporation from the skin indirectly by two pairs of sensors (temperature and relative humidity) inside a hollow cylinder. The probe was held in place on the skin for one measurement, for 40 sec, to ensure that a stable value has been established. The values of the last 10 sec are averaged as the actual measurement values. An increase in TEWL values shows damage to the skin barrier function. TEWL was measured at area 5 (right leg) and 6 (left leg) at baseline visit (Visit 2) prior to any study product application and then measured throughout the study period per the study schedule. Change from baseline was calculated as the value at specified visit (Visit 5/Day 29) minus the baseline value.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Corneometer Values Following Application of Test Regimen on Face (Area 1 Compared to Area 2) at Day 30, 31, 32, 33 and 34</title>
        <description>SC moisturization measured using the Corneometer CM 825. The measuring principle is based on changes in the capacitance of the measuring head, functioning as condensator. The electric field was created between gold conductors to enable the dielectricity of the SC to be measured. Because the dielectricity varies as a function of the skin's water content, the SC moisturization was measured. Corneometer probe was placed in contact with the skin of the participants test site for 1 to 2 sec per measurement. The measurement will be taken 5 times in total and then an average reading will be calculated for each site and time point. The Corneometer values lower than 30 i.u represent very dry skin and values between 30 to 50 i.u represent dry skin on the forearm. Higher value of Corneometer indicates high moisture content. The area 1 (right face) and area 2 (left face) were considered.</description>

        <title>Change From Pre-challenge in TEWL Following Application of Test Regimen on Face (Area 3 Compared to Area 4) at 3 Different Time Points of Strips Removal (3,6 and 9) at Day 29</title>
        <description>Tape-stripping method was used to evaluate the impact of physical challenge to the skin barrier after product use. Stripping challenge was performed on D-Squame sites on area 3 (right face) and area 4 (left face) at Day 29 by sequential application and removal of D-Squame adhesive 3, 6, and 9 discs. A Series of D-Squame discs were applied over the areas with uniform pressure for 5 sec with a stamp to ensure consistent adhesion to the skin. The disc was pulled off the skin with one fluent and decisive movement. TEWL was measured pre-challenge and after 3, 6, and 9 discs had been removed. TEWL was measured using the Tewameter TM 300. Tewameter probe measures the density gradient of the water evaporation from the skin indirectly by two pairs of sensors (temperature and relative humidity) inside a hollow cylinder. TEWL measurement was taken in triplicate. The average reading was considered for each area and time point. An increase in TEWL values shows damage to the skin barrier function.</description>

        <title>Total Protein Content Extracted From D-Squame Discs From a Total of 9 Adhesive Discs on Face (Area 3 Compared to Area 4) at Day 29</title>
        <description>Total protein content was measured using the SquameScan 850. SquameScan 850 is an instrument used to measure the protein content extracted from the skin by D-Squame tape strips. The determination is carried out by measuring the optical absorption of the strip at 850 nanometers (nm). Value displayed in percentage (%) was proportionally related to protein content. An 18 D-Squame discs were taken from participant (two sets of 9 discs from each side of the face). The protein content was analyzed for each of the discs obtained from the D-Squame stripping on area 3 (right face) and area 4 (left face) on Day 29.</description>
