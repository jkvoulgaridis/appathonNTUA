  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to investigate a treatment approach for alcohol use disorder (AUD)
      using a novel form of brain stimulation called deep repetitive transcranial magnetic
      stimulation (rTMS). The investigators will be targeting frontal regions of the brain that are
      important for memory and decision making. These brain regions have been shown to be impaired
      in patients with AUD. Previous studies have mostly used rTMS to a different frontal brain
      region that is not as deep. These studies have shown that rTMS can reduce craving for
      alcohol, but there is a lack of research showing that rTMS impacts alcohol consumption.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to examine the effect of rTMS on alcohol drinking behavior in an observed
      laboratory setting. Participants with AUD will be recruited and admitted to the inpatient
      unit for the whole study. After a brief detoxification period, they will receive 3 weeks of
      rTMS while in the research unit. Before and after the 3 weeks of stimulation, participants
      will participate in a decision-making experiment where they can choose to have an alcoholic
      drink or the equivalent amount of money that the drink would cost (alcohol
      self-administration sessions). The investigators will examine their response to alcohol, as
      well as their performance on tasks that relate to impulsivity and memory. Participants will
      also undergo an MRI scan (with spectroscopy) before and after the stimulation period to look
      at changes in the medial prefrontal cortex of the brain. Participants will then meet with a
      study physician for 6 weeks after the study for assessments of alcohol use and medical
      management sessions.

    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This AUQ (Bohn et al. 1995) is an 8-item self report questionnaire where participants rate a seven-point Likert scale with responses ranging from &quot;strongly disagree&quot; to &quot;strongly agree&quot;, and a total score is derived from the sum of these items following reverse scoring of two items. A lower score is a better outcome which represents less desire to drink. Scores range from 8-56.</description>

             intracardiac lines.

          2. Substance use disorder with substances other than alcohol or nicotine. The current use
             of sedative-hypnotics or opiates will be exclusionary

          3. Meets DSM-5 criteria for other psychiatric illness, such as major depression, that
             would interfere with participation.
