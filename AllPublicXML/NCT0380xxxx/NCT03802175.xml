  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative hypoxemia was persistent and common after surgery.Rapid diagnosis and
      subsequent therapeutic measures must be adopted by anesthesiologists.Lung ultrasound has been
      confirmed to be more sensitive and accurate for diagnosis of pulmonary ailment than chest
      radiography.The primary objective of the present study was to evaluate lung complications by
      bedside lung ultrasonography on patients suffered from hypoxemia after general anesthesia in
      the postoperative period.
