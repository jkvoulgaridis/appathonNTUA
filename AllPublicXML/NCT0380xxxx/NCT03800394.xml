  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tenofovir (TFV) disoproxil fumarate (TDF) plus emtricitabine (FTC) or lamivudine (3TC) is the
      preferred nucleoside backbone of first-line antiretroviral therapy (ART) for adolescents in
      sub-Saharan Africa. In addition, TDF/FTC is recommended for preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP)
      for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in adolescents at substantial risk of
      acquisition of HIV infection, as well as for hepatitis B virus (HBV) treatment in those with
      HBV/HIV coinfection. The efficacy TDF and FTC are dependent on intracellular concentrations
      of the active phosphate anabolites, called TFV diphosphate (TFV-DP) and FTC triphosphate
      (FTC-TP). However, the intracellular pharmacokinetics of TFV-DP and FTC-TP to examine the
      adequacy of current dosages in African adolescents has not been previously studied. Thus,
      examining the pharmacokinetics (PK) of these widely used antiretrovirals in African
      adolescents is important as ART outcomes remain poor and the recommended dosages of these
      drugs for children and adolescent were extrapolated from drug approval clinical trials in
      adult in the United States and Europe.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the intracellular PK of TFV-DP and FTC-TP in Ghanaian HIV-infected
      adolescents with and without TB coinfection. As the clinical effects of TDF and FTC are
      related to the intracellular concentrations of the phosphate anabolites, called TFV-DP and
      FTC-TP, there is a need to understand the cellular pharmacology of TDF interactions in
      African HIV-infected adolescents with and without TB, as the study team cannot extrapolate
      from US patients not on antituberculosis (anti-TB) drugs. This study will enroll HIV-infected
      adolescents aged 10 to 18 years old with and without TB coinfection who are already
      established on ART. The study team hypothesize that younger age, adenosine triphosphate
      (ATP)-binding cassette subfamily C (ABCC) single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and anti-TB
      therapy may influence the intracellular TFV-DP and FTC-TP concentrations in adolescents.
