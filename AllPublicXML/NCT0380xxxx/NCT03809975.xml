  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Osteoarthritis knee is the leading cause of chronic disability among older adults. Our
      current model of care is doctor-centric and inefficient leading to suboptimal use of allied
      health intervention for effective lifestyle and behaviour changes resulting in potentially,
      unnecessary surgery.

      The study is designed using an effectiveness-implementation hybrid study design utilizing a
      mixed methods approach. The hybrid study has dual aims. The primary aim is to evaluate the
      clinical effectiveness (pain, function and quality of life) of a 12-week multidisciplinary
      (Orthopaedics, Physiotherapy, Dietetics, Psychology) personalized, community-based program
      for patients with knee osteoarthritis through a randomized-controlled trial. The secondary
      aim is to obtain data that will inform the context for implementation and guide future wider
      scale application. The investigators hypothesize that this multidisciplinary program is
      clinically more effective in the treatment of knee osteoarthritis at 12 months compared to
      standard care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      BACKGROUND With a rapidly aging population, osteoarthritis is expected to become the 4th
      leading cause of global disability by 2020. Established guidelines for knee osteoarthritis
      strongly advocate lifestyle changes, such with exercises and weight loss as first line of
      treatment, whilst reserving surgery as the last resort. Our current model of care is
      doctor-centric and inefficient leading to suboptimal use of allied health intervention for
      effective lifestyle and behaviour changes resulting in potentially, unnecessary surgery.
      Redesigning the model of care by moving away from costly surgical treatment through the
      optimization and synergizing of proven non-surgical treatments is key to deliver value-based
      care.

      AIMS AND HYPOTHESIS Primary Aim and Hypothesis. Evaluate the clinical effectiveness (pain,
      function and quality of life) at 12 months of a personalized, community based 3-month
      multidisciplinary program (Orthopaedics, Physiotherapist, Dietitian and Psychologist) as
      compared with usual care for patients with knee osteoarthritis. The investigators hypothesize
      that patients with knee osteoarthritis who undergo a personalized, community based 3-month
      multidisciplinary program will have better pain, function and quality of life scores at 12
      months post initiation of program compared to patients who undergo usual care.

      Secondary Aim. Evaluate the cost effectiveness of a personalized, community based 3-month
      multidisciplinary program (Orthopaedic, Physiotherapist, Dietitian and Psychologist) for
      patients with knee osteoarthritis. Qualitative assessment of the acceptability, feasibility
      and scalability of such a program

      METHODOLOGY The study will be conducted as a single centre, single-blinded, gender
      stratified, block permutated randomized controlled trial using a mixed method approach
      (quantitative and qualitative), comparing a proposed new multidisciplinary personalized
      community-based model of care and the current model of care.

      Patients with suspected knee osteoarthritis who are referred from the Polyclinics in the
      primary healthcare setting to the Tan Tock Seng Hospital Orthopaedic Specialist Outpatient
      Clinic. Patients will then be evaluated based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria and
      subsequently invited to join the study if eligible. Consent for participation into the study
      will be obtained prior to randomization. Randomization will be done via gender stratified
      permutated block randomization.

      ECONOMIC EVALUATION An economic evaluation from a societal perspective will be undertaken to
      determine the cost effectiveness of the intervention. The incremental cost effectiveness
      ratio of this multidisciplinary non-surgical community-based program for knee osteoarthritis
      compared to routine care will be determined. Cost data will be collected via questionnaires
      and hospital databases to estimate both the direct medical, direct non-medical and indirect
      cost. Indirect cost of health-related productivity loss due to knee osteoarthritis will be
      calculated using a human capital approach. The primary measure of health benefit will be
      Quality of Life Years measure using the EQ-5D.

      QUALITATIVE COMPONENT The qualitative component of our study will employ several qualitative
      methods such as focus group discussions and individual interviews with a variety of subjects
      including both patients and stakeholders. The focus will on identifying the potential
      barriers and facilitators to implementing and upscaling the intervention.

    <measure>Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcomes Score (KOOS4)</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed at baseline, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Change in disease specific pain and functional outcome scores between patients undergoing the multidisciplinary community program and the current model of care will be evaluated. A composite score of the following subscales will be calculated using the averaged score - Pain, Symptoms, Activities of Daily Living and Quality of Life will be calculated. Scores between 0 and 100 represent the percentage of total possible score achieved, with zero representing extreme knee problems and 100 representing no knee problems.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcomes Score (KOOS) subscales - Pain, Symptoms, Activities of Daily Living, Sports/Recreational Activities, Quality of Life</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed at baseline, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The five patient-relevant subscales of KOOS are scored separately: KOOS Pain (9 items); KOOS Symptoms (7 items); KOOS ADL (17 items); KOOS Sport/Rec (5 items); KOOS QOL (4 items). A Likert scale is used and all items have five possible answer options scored from 0 (No Problems) to 4 (Extreme Problems) and each of the five scores is calculated as the sum of the items included. Scores are transformed to a 0-100 scale, with zero representing extreme knee problems and 100 representing no knee problems</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>EuroQol-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D)</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed at baseline, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>EuroQol-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) which consist of 2 dimensions, the EQ-5D descriptive system and the EQ visual analogue scale (EQ VAS). The descriptive system comprises five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems and extreme problems. The patient is asked to indicate his/her health state by ticking the box next to the most appropriate statement in each of the five dimensions. This decision results in a 1-digit number that expresses the level selected for that dimension. The digits for the five dimensions can be combined into a 5-digit number that describes the patient's health state. The EQ VAS records the patient's self-rated health on a vertical visual analogue scale, where the endpoints are labelled 'The best health you can imagine' and 'The worst health you can imagine'. The VAS will be used as a quantitative measure of health outcome.</description>
