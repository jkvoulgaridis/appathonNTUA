  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the study is to show the concordance between the dual-task test achieved usually
      on an electronic treadmill and the dual-task test achieved with a cyclo-ergometer.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Usually, dual task tests are only achieved on electronic treadmills. Patients who are coming
      to perform these tests are mainly subjects with various levels of cognitive disorders and
      with a high risk of fall because of potential motor and cognitive disorders.

      The investigator will select patients referred for double task walking tests. After the
      walking test, investigator will perform dual-task tests with a new bicycle device &quot;Cycléo
      BRAU&quot; which allows the patients to achieve mental tasks while cycling. The aim of using a
      bicycle is to limit the risk of falls compared to the treadmill or walking task. The &quot;Cycléo
      BRAU&quot; device is equiped with a video projector which projects an environment of virtual
      reality. It allows cycling without resistence and thus is not based on any incremental
      worload. The mental tasks on bicycle will be of increasing difficulty and parameters such as
      cycling speed will be recorded. Loss of speed regularity will be considered as an abnormal
      response. The task for which cycling is stopped will be recorded and compared to the results
      of the usual walking test.

    <description>The study consists to practice these dual-task tests with a new device which name is &quot;Cycléo BRAU&quot; that allows to the patients to achieve carefully an attentional task: cycle. Results will be compared tothe results obsvered during the routine GAITRITE analysis ( a validated tool for elderly patients and gait analysis).</description>
