  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate the use of deep neuromuscular blockade and low-pressure
      pneumoperitoneum in bariatric surgery. The investigators propose to conduct a double-blind
      randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing deep neuromuscular blockade versus standard
      blockade, and its impact on operative conditions during bariatric surgery. This trial will be
      conducted at one of the highest volume bariatric centers in Canada. This study also aims to
      examine the effects of deep neuromuscular blockade on patient-relevant outcomes, including
      postoperative pain and narcotic use. The investigators anticipate this study will facilitate
      the continual improvement of care provided to a growing number of bariatric patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a double-blind randomized controlled trial comparing patients undergoing a deep
      neuromuscular blockade with a paralytic reversal agent versus patients undergoing standard
      anesthetic protocols in low-pressure pneumoperitoneum bariatric surgery. The study population
      will include patients aged 18-65 referred to St. Joseph's Healthcare for Roux-en-Y Gastric
      Bypass (RYGB) after completion of standard work-up for bariatric surgery through the Ontario
      Bariatric Network (OBN). The investigators plan to recruit and randomize 100 patients in a
      1:1 ratio between deep NMB and standard anesthetic in low-pressure pneumoperitoneum bariatric
      surgery. Once enrolled in the study, patients will be assigned to one of the two groups using
      computer-based randomization on REDCap software. Allocation will be concealed until the time
      of the operation and will be provided directly to the anesthetist in opaque envelopes. The
      anesthetist will be aware of the assigned group, but the patient, surgeon, PACU nurses, ward
      nurses, research assistants and house staff will be blinded. The primary outcomes to be
      examined will include maximum intra-abdominal pressure, Leiden-Surgical Rating Scale, and
      postoperative pain scores. Secondary outcomes will include operative time, postoperative
      nausea, postoperative narcotic use, and length of stay.

    <time_frame>Intraoperative</time_frame>
    <description>Two operative times will be recorded. The first will be related strictly to the surgery, from time of Veress needle insertion to time of removal of the final port. In addition, total operative time will also be recorded which will include time of induction and reversal of anesthesia</description>

    <description>All patients will receive anesthetic induction and maintenance as per routine using a combination of propofol, opioids, dexamethasone, and 0.6 mg/kg of rocuronium for induction. Patients will also receive lidocaine 1 mg/kg/hour IV infusion, followed by 3-5 mg of morphine equivalents prior to extubation. Patient monitoring will be according to local practice and consist of electrocardiography, blood pressure, heart rate and bispectral index monitoring. Neuromuscular function will be monitored every 20 minutes using a standardized nerve monitor. After induction and intubation, patients in the Deep Neuromuscular Blockade group (experimental group) will receive additional rocuronium to achieve a NMB blockade of TOF of 0 twitch and maintained at this level until reversal.</description>

    <description>Patients in the standard anesthetic (or control group) will also receive anesthetic induction as per routine using a combination of propofol, opioids, dexamethasone, and rocuronium, with a lidocaine infusion. Patient monitoring will be similar to the experimental group, with electrocardiography, blood pressure, heart rate, and bispectral index monitoring. Patients in the control group will receive rocuronium 30 mg intravenous prior to intubation, followed by repeated 10 mg doses to reach a TOF of 1-2 twitches.</description>
