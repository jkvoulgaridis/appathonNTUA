  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The most common neuropsychiatric disorder in early childhood is attention
      deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) with evidence of abnormality in structure and function
      of brain. Epilepsy is one of the commonest comorbidity associated with ADHD with negative
      outcome on childrens' quality of life, and is considered to be a risk for academic
      underachievement. These two disorders are highly associated, with more possibility to be a
      bidirectional relationship. The mechanisms of this comorbidity are unknown. In this
      association, a difficult challenge is presented since antiepileptic therapy and drugs used to
      treat ADHD may aggravate the clinical picture of each other. The main objectives are to
      evaluate this overlap of those disorders, find their complications on child and his family,
      and to suggest possible solutions to improve the outcome of those children.

    <textblock>
      The commonest childhood disorder is attention deficit hyperactivity disorder(ADHD) which
      continues into adulthood.The main two symptoms are inattention and hyperactivity.

      As epilepsy is one of the commonest comorbidity with ADHD to about (40%), there are many
      overlap symptoms between both disorders for example:

        -  Behavioral features which are shared in both frontal lobe epilepsy with ADHD such as
           impulsivity, disinhibition, and irritability

        -  The electroencephalogram: there is an increase in the rate of spikes in children with
           ADHD with no epileptic symptoms, which supports the theory of presence similar mechanism
           about central nervous system dysfunction.

      These reasons lead to increase obstacles for diagnosis, assessment, and treatment for both
      disorders.

      As this comorbidity duplicates the complications (i.e. drop the school, financial cost,
      stress on families, negative effect on academic, vocational, social relations and self-esteem
      ) so there is a great need to study this comorbidity to give a proper care for these
      patients.

      In this study, all participants will be enrolled over a period of 12 months from Assiut
      outpatients clinic .All participants will be assessed in the psychiatric interview by using
      prepared child and adolescent psychiatric sheet include (psychiatric and neurology history,
      physical examination and mental state examination). After that electroencephalogram(EEG) will
      be done to diagnoses epilepsy and identify different types of seizures.

      All participants will be categorizing into 4 groups ( ADHD, epilepsy, ADHD,and epilepsy,
      healthy) according to EEG and the psychiatric sheet. Each group will be assessed by different
      psychometrics scales to evaluate cognitive, social, economic and behavioral outcome. The
      results of all groups will be analysed by using Stata version 15 to evaluate the effect of
      ADHD and epilepsy in children and adolescent and identify the possible risk factors to
      improve outcome

    <description>WISC-III provided scores for Verbal IQ (VIQ), Performance IQ (PIQ), and Full-Scale IQ (FSIQ).
The child's verbal IQ score was derived from scores on six of the subtests: information, digit span, vocabulary, arithmetic, comprehension, and similarities.
The child's performance IQ was derived from scores on the remaining seven subtests: picture completion, picture arrangement, block design, object assembly, coding, mazes, and symbol search.
The overall intelligence quotient, called the full scale IQ, as well as a verbal IQ and a performance IQ. The three IQ scores are standardized in such a way that a score of 100 is considered average and serves as a benchmark for higher and lower scores.</description>

    <description>It will be measure by Socioeconomic class scale which consist of It contain four main variables 1-the educational level of the father and mother 2-the occupation of the father and mother 3-total family income 4-life style of the family. The total score of the scale equal the sum of scores in each level, the scores 36-42 mean the high socioeconomic class, the scores 21-26 mean the low socioeconomic class, and scores between them mean the middle class.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>measure quality of life for children with comorbid epilepsy and ADHD</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline</time_frame>
    <description>It is composed of 23 items that assessment function in the following four areas: physical (eight items), emotional (five items), social (five items), and school (five items). Patients report their function using a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 0 to 4. These responses are reverse scored and linearly transformed to a 0 to 100 scale, with a higher score indicating a higher QOL.
The Psychosocial Health Summary score is a computed mean of the emotional, social, and school functioning subscales of the PedsQL. The physical functioning scale is the same as the Physical Summary score. In addition, the computed mean of the Emotional, Social, School functioning, and Physical scales are used to generate a Total Summary score. PedsQL scales are composed of parallel child self-report and parent-proxy report formats.</description>
