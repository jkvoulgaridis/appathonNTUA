      A simulated clinical use testing on the HTL-Strefa's safety lancets
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate the safety of the use of the safety lancets: ergoLance and
      Acti-Lance in the prevention of NSI and to evaluate the user's opinion with regards to the
      handling characteristics of the medical devices.

      The simulated use clinical study will involve healthcare professionals (HCPs) who routinely
      use safety lancets to collect blood samples and lay persons.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        The inclusion criteria for HCP and lay person evaluators have been chosen based on FDA
        guidance:

          -  (HCP evaluators only) - evaluators who routinely use safety lancets to collect
             capillary blood samples (prevention of the learning curve artifacts)

          -  evaluators will be United States (US) residents

          -  evaluators can read, write, and speak English

          -  evaluators are at least 18 years old

          -  evaluators are able to understand and provide signed consent for the study

          -  evaluators are willing to comply with the study protocol, including being willing to
             answer questions and complete questionnaires.

          -  evaluators have no concerns about the ability to perform the simulated skin pricking.

        Lay person evaluators will have a diverse range of ages (18+ years), socioeconomic
        statuses, and race/ethnic backgrounds. UL-Wiklund will recruit some lay person evaluators
        with reduced vision and dexterity. Users without safety lancet experience may also be
        included in this simulated clinical use study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        HCPs:

          -  They do not routinely use safety lancets to collect capillary blood samples,

          -  They cannot read, write, and speak English,

          -  They or a family member have a business or consulting relationship with a
             pharmaceutical or medical device company, or

          -  They have participated in a product evaluation or marketing study involving safety
             lancets within the last six months

        Lay people:

          -  They cannot read, write, and speak English,

          -  They or a family member have a business or consulting relationship with a
             pharmaceutical or medical device company, or

          -  They have participated in a product evaluation or marketing study involving safety
             lancets within the last six months
