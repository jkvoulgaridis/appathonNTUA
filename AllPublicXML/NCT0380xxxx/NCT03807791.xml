  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The clinical finding of skin rashes which appear after a vitamin C deficiency in Long Term
      Care Unit leads us to believe that the institutional diet could predispose to this kind of
      deficiency. Vitamin C has a key role into the struggle against oxidant stress and is involved
      into the connective tissue formation of the skin and the vascular endothelium. Vitamin C
      deficiency affects currently 15 to 25% of the elderly over 65 years old reaching 15% women
      and 20% men after 65 according to Johnston and Al. It concerns mainly the people in
      precarious situations (persons without fixed homes, ethyl-smoking persons) and elderly over
      65 years. Hypovitaminosis C, defined by plasma level between 5 mg/L and 15 mg/L (28.41 to
      85.23 µmol/L), is currently undiagnosed, especially with people with a risk of food
      deficiency and its prevalence increases with age. The treatment consists of a daily oral
      supplementation of 1 gram of vitamin C/d for 15 days. A minimum intake of 10 mg/D of vitamin
      C is required to prevent scurvy and maintain a total pool of 350 mg. A diet modification by a
      systematic intake of 2 glasses of fresh orange juice and/or the consumption of raw fruits and
      vegetables would prevent the appearance of scurvy.

    <description>A blood sample will be taken by the nurse of our unit within a week after their consent. It consists as a simple blood sample and it will be taken during the normal analysis planed by the chief of the service in order to avoid to collect two different samples.
The measurement method will use equipment from the Lyon Sud hospital laboratory. The samples need a pre-treatment in the 3 hours after taking the blood to avoid the oxidation of vitamin C and a result lower than expected.</description>
