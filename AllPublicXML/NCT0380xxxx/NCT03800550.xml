  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the effect of steady-state clarithromycin once every
      12 hour on the pharmacokinetic parameters of bedaquiline and its active metabolite M2 after a
      single dose of bedaquiline.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  A female participant must have a negative highly sensitive serum (beta-human chorionic
             gonadotropin [beta-hCG]) pregnancy test at screening and on Day -1 in each treatment
             period

          -  Contraceptive use by women should be consistent with local regulations regarding the
             use of contraceptive methods for participants participating in clinical studies

          -  A female participant must agree not to donate eggs (ova, oocytes) for the purposes of

             last dose of bedaquiline

          -  During the study and for a minimum of at least 90 days after receiving the last dose
             of bedaquiline: a) A male participant must wear a condom when engaging in any activity
             that allows for passage of ejaculate to another person (male participants should also
             be advised of the benefit for a female partner to use a highly effective method of
             contraception as condom may break or leak. b) A male participant must agree not to
             donate sperm for the purpose of reproduction

             gastrointestinal disease (such as significant diarrhea, gastric stasis, or
             constipation that in the investigator's opinion could influence drug absorption or
             bioavailability), thyroid disease, neurologic or psychiatric disease, infection, or
             any other illness that the investigator considers should exclude the participant or
             that could interfere with the interpretation of the study results

          -  Participant with a past history of heart arrhythmias (extrasystoles or tachycardia at
             rest), or history of risk factors for Torsade de Pointes syndrome (for example,
             hypokalemia, or family history of long QT syndrome). Family history of sudden
             unexplained death (including sudden infant death syndrome in a first-degree relative
             (that is, sibling, offspring, or biological parent). Ongoing bradyarrhythmias or
             ongoing hypothyroidism (confirmed by elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone [TSH] level)

          -  Participant with any history of clinically significant skin disease such as, but not
             limited to, dermatitis, eczema, drug rash, psoriasis, food allergy, or urticaria

          -  Participant has taken any disallowed therapies before the planned first intake of
             study drug

          -  Participant has a history of drug or alcohol abuse according to Diagnostic and
             Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (5th edition) criteria within 5 years before
             screening or positive test result(s) for alcohol and/or drugs of abuse (including
             barbiturates, opiates, cocaine, amphetamines, methadone, benzodiazepines,
             methamphetamine, tetrahydrocannabinol, phencyclidine, and tricyclic antidepressants)
             at screening and on Day 1 of each treatment period
