  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study addresses a difficult barrier to hepatitis C elimination, specifically development
      and maintenance of a productive relationship between the health care provider and patient to
      ensure both treatment success and engagement in harm reduction services. Improvements in
      these domains may be observed through the use of a technique called &quot;Motivational
      Interviewing&quot; (MI). The aim of this study is to determine whether a customized motivational
      interviewing curriculum by general primary care and addictions medicine primary care
      providers changes rates of curative hepatitis C therapy completion.
