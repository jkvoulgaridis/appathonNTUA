  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to compare outcomes and functionality measures of subjects
      treated with platelet rich plasma (PRP) after arthroscopic debridement of triangular
      fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) tears to subjects treated with arthroscopic debridement alone.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Forty-eight (48) subjects with TFCC tears will be randomized to treatment with PRP versus
      placebo (normal saline). Subjects and medical staff outside of the operating room will be
      blinded to treatment group throughout the duration of the study. Outcome measures will
      include Modified Mayo Wrist scores (pain scale scores, grip strength, wrist range of motion,
      functional status) and Patient-rated Wrist Evaluation (PRWE) scores.

    <description>The Patient-rated Wrist Evaluation is a 15 item patient-reported questionnaire to assess change from pre to post-op that asks the patient to rate their pain and function on a 10-point scale. 0 (minimum) means no pain/did not experience functional difficulties and 10 (maximum) means the worst pain/difficulty to function. Total minimum is 0 and total maximum for this scale measure is 150.</description>
