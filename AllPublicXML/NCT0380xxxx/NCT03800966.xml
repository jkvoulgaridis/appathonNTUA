  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The brief RCT will be conducted in the form of a questionnaire survey, with two kinds of
      leaflets embedded in the same questionnaire. The RCT will be conducted in classrooms by
      teachers who will be given two kinds of questionnaires (with leaflet embedded) used for
      intervention and control groups. The questionnaires will be mixed in a way that two adjacent
      questionnaires are always different. The intervention leaflets will contain information for
      tobacco industry denormalisation. The control leaflets will contain information for tobacco
      control policy in Hong Kong. The study aims to test the effect of a leaflet-based
      intervention on primary school students' attitudes towards tobacco industry.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Attitudes towards tobacco industry in children</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>Children will report their opinions towards 4 statements: 1); Tobacco companies are a trustworthy industry; 2) Tobacco industries use many tactics to resist tobacco control regulations; 3) Tobacco industries do everything they can to get young people to smoke; 4) Tobacco industries cheated the public for commercial gain. All the 4 questions have 5 options from definitely yes to definitely no. The options will be recoded into 0-4 or 4-0, as appropriate, with higher scores indicating more negative attitudes towards the industry. A sum of scores from the 4 questions will be deemed as measurement of attitudes towards tobacco industry in primary school students.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Intention to smoke cigarettes in children</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>Two questions will be used to assess this outcome: 1) If one of your good friends offers you a cigarette, will you smoke it? 2) Do you think you will smoke cigarettes in the next 12 months? Response options are definitely not /probably not /not sure /probably yes /definitely yes. Those choosing options &quot;definitely not&quot; for all the two questions will be deemed having no intention to smoke cigarettes; other responses will be deemed having intention to smoke cigarettes.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Intention to use e-cigarettes in children</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>Two questions will be used to assess this outcome: 1) If one of your good friends offers you an e-cigarette, will you use it? 2) Do you think you will use e-cigarettes in the next 12 months? Response options are definitely not /probably not /not sure /probably yes /definitely yes. Those choosing options &quot;definitely not&quot; for all the two questions will be deemed having no intention to use e-cigarettes; other responses will be deemed having intention to use e-cigarettes.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Tobacco control policy support in children</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>Children will report their opinions towards 2 statements: 1) The Hong Kong government should enact a total ban on e-cigarettes promptly; 2) The Hong Kong government should prohibit the sale of all tobacco products by legislation. All the 2 questions have 5 options from definitely yes to definitely no. The options will be recoded into 4-0, with higher scores indicating stronger support towards the tobacco control policy in Hong Kong. A sum of scores from the 2 questions will be deemed as measurement of support for tobacco control policy in Hong Kong in primary school students.</description>
