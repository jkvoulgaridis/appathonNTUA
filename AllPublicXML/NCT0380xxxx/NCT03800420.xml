          -  Male or female, aged &gt;=18 years

          -  Diagnosed with active UC for at least 3 months prior to screening

          -  Total Mayo score &gt;=5 and Endoscopic sub-score &gt;=1

          -  Stable dosing regimens of oral drugs (if currently administered) as follows: 5-ASA or

             and low-dose oral corticosteroid (up to 20 mg prednisone/day or equivalent) for at
             least 4 weeks prior to the first dose of study treatment. Doses of oral drugs must
             remain stable until the end of study treatment (with possible exception for tapering
             steroid dose after 8 weeks)

          -  For females of reproductive potential: use of highly effective contraception for at
             least 1 month prior to screening and agreement to use such a method during study
             participation and for an additional 3 months after the last dose

          -  For males of reproductive potential: use of condoms or other methods to ensure
             effective contraception with partner during study participation and for an additional
             3 months after the last dose

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Use of anti-TNF-a biologics or any other biologics for treatment of UC within 60 days
             prior to randomization.

          -  Any rectal therapy for treatment of UC or intravenous corticosteroids within 2 weeks
             prior to randomization.

          -  Presence of Crohn's disease, indeterminate colitis, ischemic colitis, fulminant
             colitis, ulcerative proctitis, or toxic mega-colon

          -  Previous extensive colonic resection (subtotal or total colectomy)

          -  Ileostomy, colostomy, or known fixed symptomatic stenosis of the intestine

          -  Evidence of or treatment for Clostridium difficile infection or other pathogenic bowel
             infection within 60 days or for another intestinal pathogen within 30 days prior to
             randomization

          -  Active infection with the HIV or Hepatitis B or C viruses

          -  Clinically significant active extra-intestinal infection (e.g., pneumonia,

             and alkaline phosphatase) &gt; 2X the upper limit of normal (ULN) at screening

          -  Other clinically significant abnormal laboratory results at screening in the
             investigator's opinion

          -  History of any clinically significant medical condition that, in the investigator's
             opinion, would preclude participation in the study

          -  Pregnancy or lactation

          -  Treatment with another investigational drug or other intervention within 30 days prior
             to screening
