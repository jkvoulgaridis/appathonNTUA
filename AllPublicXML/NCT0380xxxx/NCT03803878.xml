  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is to translate the Medical, Epidemiologic, and Social aspects of Aging (MESA)
      urinary incontinence questionnaire into a Chinese language version and test the reliability
      and validity among women with urgency-predominant mixed urinary incontinence.

      The hypothesis is that the Chinese language version of the MESA questionnaire will have
      adequate measurement properties (e.g. reliability and validity).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mixed urinary incontinence(MUI) is regarded as urgency-predominant when urgency incontinence
      episodes dominate over stress incontinence episodes, and vice versa. The treatment of MUI
      often begins with the most bothersome symptoms.

      MESA questionnaire is a reliable and validated tool to evaluate the severity and predominance
      of stress or urgency urinary incontinence. At present, it hasn't been translated into a
      Chinese language version and validated.

      The validation study of MESA questionnaire is embedded in a randomized controlled trial
      conducted among female patients, of which the data will be collected and analysed.

    <measure>The construct validity of MESA questionnaire compared with International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire Short Form (ICIQ SF) in severity assessing among women with urgency-predominant mixed urinary incontinence.</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline</time_frame>
    <description>ICIQ SF is a validated questionnaire to evaluate both the severity of incontinence symptoms and influence on QoL in the past four weeks. The questionnaire is consisted of four items, including frequency, leakage amount, impact on QoL and the cause of urinary incontinence. The total score of the ICIQ SF ranges from 0 to 21, with a higher score indicating worse symptoms and QoL.</description>
