    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and how well copanlisib works when given
      together with fulvestrant in treating postmenopausal patients with estrogen receptor positive
      (ER+) and epidermal growth factor receptor 2 negative (HER2-) breast cancer that has spread
      to other places in the body and progressing after prior treatment. HER2 and ER are two types
      of proteins called receptors that can affect the growth of breast cancer cells. Additionally,
      investigators hope to learn from this study if tumor genetic information is important for
      predicting whether this type of breast cancer will respond to fulvestrant and copanlisib.
      Copanlisib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell
      growth. Hormone therapy using fulvestrant may fight breast cancer by blocking the use of
      estrogen by the tumor cells. Giving copanlisib and fulvestrant may work better in treating
      patients with ER+ and HER2- breast cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Establish safety of the combination of copanlisib and fulvestrant (FC). II. Evaluate the
      response rate (RR) of the combination of copanlisib and fulvestrant in patients with
      estrogen-receptor positive (ER+)/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) negative
      metastatic breast cancer that has previously progressed on aromatase inhibitor (AI)/cyclin
      dependent kinase (CDK) 4/6 inhibitor therapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Estimate progression-free survival (PFS) in patients treated with copanlisib and
      fulvestrant.

      II. Estimate the RR in subjects with PTEN loss by immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis
      performed retrospectively.

      III. Evaluate toxicity in patients treated with FC in Phase II.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate copanlisib pharmacokinetics (PK) when given in combination with fulvestrant.

      II. Explore association between intrinsic subtype and response to FC therapy. III. Assess
      baseline levels and treatment-induced proteomic changes and correlate with response to FC.

      IV. Evaluate circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) (ctDNA) mutations at baseline and
      over time for response predictors at baseline, clonal evolution associated with treatment,
      and resistance mechanisms at disease progression.

      V. Evaluate circulating markers of metabolism before and after PI3K inhibitor therapy which
      may predict treatment response and resistance mechanisms.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive copanlisib intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15 and
      fulvestrant intramuscularly (IM) over 1-2 minutes on days 1 and 15 of cycle 1 and on day 1
      beginning cycle 2. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.

    <description>Prognostic effect of biomarker for PFS will be examined by the Kaplan Meier (KM) method or/and Cox proportional hazard model and for objective response rate (ORR) using logistic regression model. Predictive effect of biomarker will be explored by examining the interaction effect of biomarker and arm in Cox or logistic regression model. For markers measured along multiple time points, generalized linear mixed effects model will be used to model longitudinal trajectories along time with the inference focus on the arm factor, without and with adjustment for other covariates. Two sample t-test or Wilcoxon rank sum test will be applied to compare time-matched biomarkers between the two arms or two patient subsets. Paired sample t-test or Wilcoxon signed rank test will be applied to compare subject-specific biomarkers between two time points. Multiple comparisons will be adjusted to control false discovery rate. Proposed subset analyses will be applicable to biomarkers.</description>

                  tubal ligation, or bilateral oophorectomy) or they are naturally postmenopausal
                  for at least 12 consecutive months. A high follicle stimulating hormone (FSH)
                  level in the postmenopausal range may be used to confirm a post-menopausal state
                  in women not using hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement therapy.
                  Documentation of postmenopausal status must be provided

             enrollment in this current protocol. The testing may have been done at any time prior
             to enrollment. For patients who have not yet had tumor genomic assessment, after
             consultation with the principal investigator (PI), tumor specimens will be sent to the
             University of North Carolina (UNC) Hospitals Clinical Molecular Genetics Laboratory

          -  Subjects with moderate or severe hepatic impairment (ie, Child-Pugh B or C)

          -  Copanlisib is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4. Therefore, the concomitant use of
             strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin,
             ritonavir, indinavir, nelfinavir and saquinavir), and strong inducers of CYP3A4 (e.g.
             rifampin, phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, St. John's Wort) are not permitted
             from 14 days prior to enrollment until the end of the study. Other medications that
             are prohibited while on copanlisib treatment:

             stopped or reduced to the allowed dose at least 7 days prior to the computed
             tomography (CT)/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) screening; if a patient is on chronic
             corticosteroid therapy, corticosteroids should be de-escalated to the maximum allowed
             dose before the screening; patients may be using topical or inhaled corticosteroids;
             short-term (up to 7 days) systemic corticosteroids above 15 mg prednisolone or
             equivalent will be allowed for the management of acute conditions (e.g., treatment
             non-infectious pneumonitis); the use of corticosteroids as antiemetics prior to
             copanlisib administration will not be allowed

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness, including but not limited to, psychiatric

                  rest. Less than ordinary activity causes fatigue, palpitation, dyspnea, or
                  anginal pain

               -  Note: Class IV NYHA Heart failure classification: Patients with cardiac disease
                  resulting in the inability to carry on any physical activity without discomfort.
                  Symptoms of heart failure or the anginal syndrome may be present even at rest. If
                  any physical activity is undertaken, discomfort is increased.

        Other cardiovascular-related abnormalities or therapy that prohibit study participation
        are:

          -  Myocardial infarction less than 6 months before start of study medications

          -  Anti-arrhythmic therapy (exceptions: beta blockers or digoxin are permitted)

               -  Pregnant or lactating (Pregnant women or women who are breastfeeding are excluded
                  from this study because copanlisib is a PI3K inhibitor agent with the potential
                  for teratogenic or abortifacient effects; there is no safety data in pregnancy;
                  because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing
                  infants secondary to treatment of the mother with copanlisib, breastfeeding
                  should be discontinued if the mother is treated with copanlisib and/or
                  fulvestrant; fulvestrant may also cause fetal harm and based on animal studies,
                  may impair fertility in females of reproductive potential)

               -  Hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV). All patients must be screened
                  for HBV and HCV up to 28 days prior to study drug start using the routine

                  unwilling or unable to change to antiretroviral therapies without such
                  interactions are ineligible because of the potential for pharmacokinetic
                  interactions with copanlisib

               -  Cytomegalovirus (CMV) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) positive at baseline
