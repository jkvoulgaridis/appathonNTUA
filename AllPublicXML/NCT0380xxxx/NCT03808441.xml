      The stay aims to determine whether switching from targeted therapy to immunotherapy based on
      a decrease in levels of circulating tumour DNA in the blood, will improve the outcome in
      melanoma patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The optimal scheduling of targeted and immune therapies in metastatic melanoma is unknown. At
      present, patients are treated with targeted therapy until acquired resistance develops, and
      then switched to immune therapy. Pre-clinical data has revealed that BRAF inhibition results
      in an environment that can enhance immune responses. Tumours responding to BRAF inhibitors
      but not resistant have been shown to have increased T cell infiltration, improved T cell
      recognition of melanoma associated antigens and reduced production of immunosuppressive
      cytokines. Furthermore, in response to targeted therapy LDH levels, which are associated with
      decreased response to immune therapy reduces, which may improve efficacy of immunotherapy.

      A precise definition of response is required in order to decide upon a switch to immune
      therapy. A radiological definition of response is currently the standard assessment. However
      a scan at a fixed time point of 2 or 3 months does not reflect the wide range of response
      dynamics or allow decision making on an individual patient basis. The investigators have
      developed techniques using circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) in the metastatic setting, which
      are able to accurately monitor tumour burden over time.

      The aim of this pilot study is to provide a signal as to whether:

        1. In BRAF mutant melanoma the efficacy of immune therapy is enhanced by response to
           pre-treatment with MAPK pathway inhibition with dabrafenib + trametinib.

        2. Changes in ctDNA levels can be used to accurately inform when to switch from targeted to
           immune therapy.

      Data from this study will provide the basis for follow on studies with sufficient power to
      assess whether tumours responding to BRAF inhibition as defined by response in ctDNA can
      improve efficacy of immune therapy.
