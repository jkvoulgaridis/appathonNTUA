  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the sensitivity of a wearable sensor to detect
      changes in knee joint loading using an experimental knee joint effusion as a model for a
      common clinical physiological alteration in joint status. The rationale for this project is
      that it will establish the efficacy of an inexpensive, clinically, and publicly available
      device that can detect changes in biomechanical loading due to acute physiologic change in
      joint status. The study will utilize a cross-sectional cohort study design and will seek to
      enroll 25 male and female healthy adult participants (18-35 yo). Participants will report to
      the laboratory for three total sessions (Session 1: informed consent and task
      familiarization; Session 2: testing; Session 3: knee joint status assessment). The primary
      outcomes of interest include lower extremity thigh and shank acceleration and velocity data
      (wearable sensor data), lower extermity 3D kinematics and kinetics (motion capture data), and
      lower extremity muscle function (EMG data) during walking gait, as well as functional balance
      and patient-reported subjective outcomes. Data will be analyzed by calculating change scores
      from the pre- to post-experimental effusion outcome measure testing. Paired-samples t-tests
      and Cohen's d effect sizes will be used to assess changed in wearable sensor data from pre-
      to post-experimental effusion. Correlation statistics will be used to determine if there are
      association between the motion capture and wearable sensor data. The potential risks
      associated with an experimental joint effusion will be addressed by maintaining appropriate
      sterile conditions and having the participant check-in with the PI (licensed healthcare
      provider) at 48 hours following testing session.
