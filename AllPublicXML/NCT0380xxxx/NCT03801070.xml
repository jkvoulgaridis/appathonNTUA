  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a retrospective chart review study examining 1) demographic data such as age, sex,
      etiology of pancreatitis 2) clinical data including radiological characteristics of walled
      off pancreatic necrosis, walled off necrosis related admissions and readmission following
      endoscopic drainage, surgical or percutaneous procedures performed for the management of
      walled off pancreatic necrosis, and clinical outcomes following treatment of WON (including
      hospital readmissions, WON resolution, procedure complications, WON related death) 3)
      endoscopy data including indication for initial endoscopic drainage and subsequent endoscopic
      procedures performed for management of walled off necrosis (including additional EGD's,
      endoscopic drainage procedures, and/or necrosectomy)

             endoscopic) following endoscopic drainage

          -  Patients who required further intervention for walled off pancreatic necrosis (either
             surgical, percutaneous, or endoscopic) following endoscopic drainage.

          -  Patients who underwent percutaneous or surgical interventions prior to endoscopic
             drainage
