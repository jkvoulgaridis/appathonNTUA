  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a randomized, cross-over, unblinded study with subjects randomized upon entry
      into the study to either begin using the Klue software for 6 weeks or to continue with their
      usual care for 6 weeks. Subjects are eligible for enrollment if they are using a continuous
      glucose monitor (CGM) with an insulin pump or an insulin pen with memory, and are missing or
      late in giving at least 4 food boluses in the previous two weeks. Missing or late meal
      boluses will be assessed through their pump/pen and sensor downloads. This is a pilot study.
      There is no preliminary data to do a true power calculation. The primary outcome will be the
      change in the number of missed meal boluses in the two weeks prior to each visit. Secondary
      outcome measures will be the number of missed meal boluses in each month of the study, change
      in HbA1c levels (measured every 6 weeks), accuracy of the Klue software in detecting meals
      (true positive and false positive rates), and a user satisfaction survey.
