  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study seeks to investigate the efficacy of two internet-based self-help programmes
      administered with support from a therapist. The two active conditions consist of an internet
      cognitive behavioral therapy (ICBT) programme and a intervention of internet-based
      interpersonal psychotherapy (IIPT), both of which have been developed for the present study.
      The active conditions will be compared to a wait-list control group.

      Participants will be recruited in Sweden with a nationwide recruitment.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change on UCLA Loneliness Scale, Version 3 (UCLA-LS-3)</measure>
    <time_frame>During week 2, 4, 6, and 8 of the intervention, 10 weeks after start of intervention, 4 months after completion of intervention, 12 months after start of intervention.</time_frame>
    <description>Measure of loneliness, total score ranging from 20-80 (representing the sum of each of the 20 individual items). Lower scores represent less loneliness and a more favourable outcome.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change on Brunnsviken Brief Quality of Life Scale (BBQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>10 weeks after start of intervention, at 4 month follow-up, 12 month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Measure of quality of life, total score ranging from 0 to 96 with a higher score indicating a higher quality of life. The scores of each of the six primary questions regarding perceived quality of life within an area of life are multiplied with the score of an item measuring the perceived importance of the area in question.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change on Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9)</measure>
    <time_frame>10 weeks after start of intervention, at 4 month follow-up, at 12 month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Measure of depressive symptoms. Possible range for the total sum: 0 to 27 (created by summing up the score from each item). Clinical cut-offs for mild, moderate, moderately severe and severe major depressive disorder are considered to be 5, 10, 15, and 20 points.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change on Social Interaction Anxiety Scale (SIAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>10 weeks after start of intervention, at 4 month follow-up, at 12 month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Measure of social interaction anxiety, closely correlated with social anxiety disorder. The score on each of the 20 items are summed up. Possible range for the total sum between 0 and 80. Higher scores indicate a higher degree of social interaction anxiety.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change on Generalised Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale (GAD-7)</measure>
    <time_frame>10 weeks after start of intervention, at 4 month follow-up, at 12 month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Measure of symptoms of generalised anxiety disorder (GAD). Seven items, the score is interpreted by summing up the score from each individual item. Higher scores indicate more severe problems with worry and generalised anxiety. The total sum ranges from 0 to 21 with cut-offs of 5, 10, and 15 representing mild, moderate and severe generalised anxiety.</description>
