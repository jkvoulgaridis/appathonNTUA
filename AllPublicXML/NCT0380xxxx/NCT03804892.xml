    <textblock>
      Briefly, participants will be assessed for their eligibility for the study using an oral
      glucose tolerance test, which involves drinking a sugary drink followed by a series of small
      blood samples. If eligible, participants will be asked to take part in a fitness test and
      then two trials which will involve walking on a treadmill at a steady pace. Before and after
      the exercise a small piece of muscle will be taken from their thigh under local anaesthesia,
      as well as several small blood samples. Muscle muscle samples will be assessed for lipid
      metabolites.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The accumulation of fat in skeletal muscle is linked with insulin resistance in obesity and
      T2D. However, fat also accumulates in the muscle of lean, healthy people, but they remain
      insulin sensitive. This is because healthy people are able to burn this fat to generate
      energy during exercise. However, overweight/obese inactive people can't use muscle fat during
      exercise in the same manner, which is related to the high blood lipid concentrations that are
      observed in these individuals. Acipimox is a lipid-lowering agent that specifically reduces
      the breakdown of fat in adipose tissue and has been shown improve the blood lipid profile of
      obese individuals and T2D patients, at least in the short-term (1-2 weeks). Previous research
      has shown that the combination of Acipimox with exercise restores the ability of obese people
      to burn fat during moderate-intensity cycling exercise. It is now important to test whether
      Acipimox also increases the ability to burn muscle fat during low-intensity walking in people
      with prediabetes. If it does, then the next step will be to test whether the combination of
      Acipimox and walking can lead to improved insulin sensitivity and reduced T2D risk over a
      longer intervention programme. Twelve people with pre-diabetes will be recruited to undertake
      two experimental trials in a randomised order. Each trial will involve walking for 45 minutes
      on a treadmill, with muscle biopsies obtained from the thigh before (basal), immediately
      following (post-exercise) and 3 h post-exercise. Each trial will be identical, except that
      participants will ingest either Acipimox or a placebo in a double-blind design. Muscle
      biopsies will be used to examine differences in muscle fat between the two trials.
