      This study aims to assess the effect of personalized support using instant messaging
      application on smoking cessation in smokers proactively recruited from smoking hotspots in
      Hong Kong.

      Detailed Description: With the advancement of information communication technologies (ICTs),
      instant messaging applications (IM Apps, e.g. WhatsApp and WeChat) can be used for providing
      synchronous, personalized, interactive interventions for health promotion. This study
      proposes to apply IM Apps for enhancing our tested brief smoking cessation (SC) intervention
      model from AWARD to e-AWARD (AWARD: Ask, Warn, Advise, Refer, Do-it-again,) without
      medications to increase SC in smokers proactively recruited in smoking hotspots in Hong Kong.
      Such smokers are the majority and have low quit rate. IM Apps allows trained SC advisors to
      proactively deliver personalized SC advices, response to smokers' needs promptly, and provide
      psychosocial support. No similar trials are found in PubMed, Cochrane Library and trial
      registries (ClinicalTrials.gov &amp; ISRCTN) (except the pilot trial of this study). The aims of
      this study are as follows:

        1. To assess the main effect of the personalized support using instant messaging
           applications (Intervention) vs. Control group on biochemical validated smoking
           abstinence at 6-month and 12-month.

        2. To assess the effects on self-reported past 7-day abstinence, 24-week continuous
           abstinence, smoking reduction, self-efficacy of quitting, intention to quit, quit
           attempts and SC medications and services use at 6-month and 12-month.

        3. To identify the mediators, which can inform mechanisms of the intervention on SC.

        4. To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the above interventions.

        5. To understand the effects subjects' experience of IM support on SC using a qualitative
           study approach.
