  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single institutional, single arm, open labeled phase II study to assess the overall
      radiographic response of adding Avelumab to chemotherapy and palliative radiotherapy in
      patients with metastatic advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Avelumab belongs to the group of immune checkpoint blockade cancer therapies. Avelumab binds
      to the programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) and therefore inhibits binding to its receptor
      programmed cell death 1 (PD-1). In the case of avelumab, the formation of PD-1/PDL1 ligand
      pairs is blocked and CD8+ T cell immune response should be increased. This study comprises 2
      phases, the concurrent immune-chemoradiotherapy (Ave-PF-CRT) phase and the
      immune-chemotherapy (Ave-PF) phase. In the immune-chemoradiotherapy phase, patients are
      treated with PF-CRT and concomitant Avelumab. In the immune-chemotherapy phase, patients are
      treated with PF plus Avelumab. Overall radiological response, time to progression, overall
      survival and adverse events will be evaluated. Subjects' health-related quality of life will
      be assessed as well.

    <description>The tabulations will count the number of subjects reporting individual adverse events. Adverse events are collected/assessed during treatment period (every week in the Ave-PF-CRT phase [one cycle, 4 weeks], the first and third week of each cycle in the Ave-PF phase [5 cycles, each cycle is 4 weeks]), every 3 months during evaluation, and in 2 years.</description>

    <measure>Heath-related quality of life</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>The self-reported health-related quality of life specific to esophageal cancer is a 44-item functioning scale captured using the Functional Assessment Of Cancer Therapy-Esophageal (FACT-E) Traditional Chinese version. Each question uses a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 0 to 4, and higher scores indicate better quality of life (0-176 for FACT-E total score). The FACT-E is assessed before treating is given, in the third week of Ave-PF-CRT phase (one cycle, 4 weeks), in the first week of every cycle (4 weeks) during the Ave-PF phase (5 cycles), and in the 2 years.
Changes in total score of FACT-E from baseline to each assessment point will be calculated.</description>
