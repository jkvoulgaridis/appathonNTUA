    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the BA of 30 or 60 milligram (mg) dexlansoprazole
      capsule manufactured at TOB (Takeda GmbH Plant Oranienburg) to the corresponding 30 or 60 mg
      dexlansoprazole manufactured at TPC (Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Ltd.).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called dexlansoprazole. Dexlansoprazole is being
      tested in healthy participants to compare the BA of dexlansoprazole capsules manufactured by
      TOB relative to dexlansoprazole capsules manufactured by TPC, under fed conditions. The study
      consists of two parts: Part 1 participants will receive dexlansoprazole 30 mg capsules
      manufactured by TOB and TPC in a crossover fashion; Part 2 participants will receive
      dexlansoprazole 60 mg capsules manufactured by TOB and TPC in a crossover fashion.

      The study will enroll approximately 120 participants. Participants will be randomly assigned
      (by chance, like flipping a coin) to 1 of the 4 treatment sequences as following:

        -  Part 1: Dexlansoprazole 30 mg (TOB) + Dexlansoprazole 30 mg (TPC)

        -  Part 1: Dexlansoprazole 30 mg (TPC) + Dexlansoprazole 30 mg (TOB)

        -  Part 2: Dexlansoprazole 60 mg (TOB) + Dexlansoprazole 60 mg (TPC)

        -  Part 2: Dexlansoprazole 60 mg (TPC) + Dexlansoprazole 60 mg (TOB)

      All participants will be asked to take capsule of assigned dexlansoprazole on Day 1, 30
      minutes following the beginning of a high-fat/high calorie breakfast of each treatment
      period.

      This single center trial will be conducted in the United States. The overall time to
      participate in this study is approximately 86 days. Participants will be contacted by phone
      call approximately 10 days after the last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.
