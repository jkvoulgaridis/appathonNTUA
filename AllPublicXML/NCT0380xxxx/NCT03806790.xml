    <description>Overall improvement rate for the target lesion defined as 'substantial resolution' of clinical signs or at least 'moderately improved' in the general change in the target lesion. 'Substantial resolution' is defined as a clinical score for thickness and scaliness of 0 and a clinical score for redness of 1 or less in the severity of clinical signs of the target lesion.
The severity scale for the clinical signs ranges from 0 (no clinical sign) to 4 (severe clinical signs); there are 3 clinical signs in total (redness, thickness, and scaliness).</description>

The severity for each of the 3 clinical signs will be recorded according to a 9-point scale that ranges from a score of 0 to 4 in increments of 0.5; the severities are scored from low to high with 0 = none and 4 = severe.</description>
