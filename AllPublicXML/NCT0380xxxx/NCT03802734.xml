  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is evidence to show that mindful meditation has a positive impact on health. To date,
      all the studies done to investigate the effect of mindfulness on pregnancy outcomes have been
      done through a traditional 8-10 weeks mindfulness classroom program with some home practice.
      This time-intensive classroom training may be expensive and not convenient for many busy
      pregnant women. This study will investigate the use of a smartphone app-based intervention to
      determine if it has the potential to make mindfulness training more accessible, acceptable,
      and convenient to a larger number of pregnant women. The use of an app as opposed to
      traditional structured classes may increase a woman's ability and willingness to practice
      mindfulness because the app can be used almost anywhere and at any time. This pilot study
      aims to explore the feasibility and acceptability of a smartphone mindfulness meditation
      application for pregnant women. As well, this study will compare the pregnancy outcomes of
      women who use the app to those women who do not use the app.

      This is a randomised controlled trial to study the effect of the use of a mindfulness
      meditation app on pregnancy outcomes. This study will measure how often the app is used, as
      well as indicators of maternal health such as sleep, stress, depression, anxiety and other
      perinatal outcomes (premature delivery, diabetes during pregnancy (gestational diabetes),
      high blood pressure in pregnancy (hypertensive disorders of pregnancy), inadequate growth of
      the baby inside the womb (fetal growth restriction), bleeding in later pregnancy, mode of
      delivery, pain relief during delivery, length of stay for mother and baby in the hospital,
      admission of baby in ICU, pain relief medication requirement after delivery, and
      breastfeeding).

      Participants will be randomly assigned to either group A (the experimental group) or group B
      (the control group). All participants will be given a an actigraph to measure sleep.

      Participants in Group A will be given a free subscription to a mindfulness meditation app for
      six months. They will also be given a general pregnancy sleep leaflet. Participants assigned
      to Group B will be given the general pregnancy sleep leaflet only.

      There will be 3 visits associated with this study. At each of the 3 visits, participants will
      be given four questionnaires to complete - the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Perceived
      Stress Questionnaire, Beck's Anxiety Inventory, and the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale.
      Participants in Group A will also be asked to complete a fifth survey at their post-partum
      visit. This survey will collect information on how easy it was to use the mindfulness
      meditation app.

      Information on delivery outcomes will also be collected. This information will include things
      such as any complications that occur during delivery, baby's birth weight and Apgar score,
      any complications with baby's health, method of delivery, and pain medications used during
      delivery.

    <measure>Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)</measure>
    <time_frame>PSQI will be completed at 3 time-points: &lt;= 20 weeks gestation, 35-40 weeks gestation, 6 weeks post-partum.</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will rate the frequency of sleep disturbances on a 4-point Likert scale (0 = &quot;Not during the past month&quot;; 1 = &quot;Less than once a week&quot;; 2 = &quot;Once or twice a week&quot;; 3 = &quot;Three or more times a week&quot;. Scores will be tallied. A score of 5 or more indicates poor sleep quality. Scores will be compared across 3 time-points.</description>

    <description>This scale measures post-natal and prenatal depression by asking participants to rate how they have felt emotionally during the last 7 days. Various 4-point Likert scales are used to measure the frequency of occurance (e.g. 0 = No never, 1 = Not very often, 2 = Yes, some of the time, 3 = Yes, most of the time). Scores will be tallied to measure level of depression. Higher scores indicate higher levels of post-natal depression. Scores will be compared across 3 time-points.</description>
