  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the study is to compare the outcomes after a surgical procedure with
      minimally invasive Ponto surgery (MIPS, test group) and tissue preservation surgery (control)
      for placing Oticon Medical Ponto implants and abutments.

    <measure>Surgical wound healing time</measure>
    <time_frame>36 months</time_frame>
    <description>Investigate and compare healing time after surgery.
Follow-up visits after surgery will assess the healing of wound. This will be a yes/no assessment to be answered by the attending physician. The investigators will also evaluate skin reactions and record any medications that were given to aid in skin healing.</description>
