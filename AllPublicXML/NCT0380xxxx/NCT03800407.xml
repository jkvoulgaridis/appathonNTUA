  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Efavirenz (EFV)-based antiretroviral therapy (ART) remains the preferred regimen in human
      immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected children aged 3 years or older on rifampin-containing
      antituberculosis (anti-TB) therapy. This is because drug interactions between first-line
      anti-TB therapy with protease inhibitors (PIs) are more severe to adjust for, and
      interactions with integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs) are not well studied in that
      age group. Although, current weight-based EFV dosing recommendation is not optimal in some
      children, pharmacokinetic-treatment response (PK-PD) data to guide optimal dosing of EFV
      during concurrent rifampin-containing therapy in children is very limited. The study team
      propose that EFV concentrations outside the optimal therapeutic range in children will be
      associated with virologic failure due to lack of efficacy because of low concentrations or
      increased central nervous system (CNS) toxicities from high concentrations leading to poor
      medication adherence. The study will determine virological suppression rates in HIV-infected
      children with and without TB coinfection treated with standard efavirenz-based therapy and
      examine the factors contributing to poor virologic response.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In a previous study, the study team found that first-line anti-TB therapy had minimal effect
      on EFV pharmacokinetics (PK) at the population level, but children with TB/HIV coinfection on
      anti-TB therapy had a trend towards worse virologic outcome compared to those with only HIV
      infection. Due to the small sample size, the study team were unable to examined the patient
      factors contributing to the poor virologic response. The study team hypothesized that
      virologic suppression rates on EFV-based therapy is significantly lower in children with
      TB/HIV coinfection compared to those with HIV alone. In addition, virologic response will be
      dependent EFV plasma concentrations, CYP2B6 516 G&gt;T genotype and/or adherence level. This
      hypothesis is based on the premise that extremes (low and high EFV concentration,
      respectively) could lead to virologic failure because of lack of efficacy or intolerable side
      effects leading to poor adherence. The current study will investigate the effect of anti-TB
      therapy, CYP2B6 genotype and pharmacokinetically determined adherence level on virologic
      response in children with TB/HIV coinfection treated with EFV-based ART.
