  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Delayed cord clamping (DCC) in preterm infants results in a decrease in mortality and a trend
      towards fewer intraventricular haemorrhages. However, preterm infants needing immediate
      interventions for stabilisation or resuscitation were generally clamped immediately and
      excluded from trials, while these infants might benefit the most of DCC.

      Studies in preterm lambs demonstrated that delaying cord clamping beyond ventilation onset
      resulted in more stable hemodynamic transition. This approach was called 'physiological-based
      cord clamping' (PBCC). The hypothesis of this study is that PBCC in preterm infants at birth
      will lead to an increase in intact survival when compared to standard care.

      This study is a multicentre randomised controlled, parallel design, superiority trial,
      including preterm infants less than 30 weeks of gestation. The intervention is PBCC:
      stabilisation of the infant with the umbilical cord intact and only clamp the cord when the
      infant is stable. Stable is defined as the establishment of heart rate greater than 100 bpm
      and oxygen saturation above 85% while using supplemental oxygen lower than 40%. In the
      control group cord clamping will be performed time-based: infants are clamped first (at 30-60
      seconds if the clinical condition allows) and then moved to the resuscitation table for
      further stabilisation.

      The primary outcome will be intact survival at NICU discharge, defined as survival without
      cerebral injury (intraventricular haemorrhage ≥ grade 2 and/or periventricular leukomalacia ≥
      grade 2 and/or periventricular venous infarction) and/or necrotizing enterocolitis (Bell
      stage ≥ 2).

    <description>Stabilisation of the infant is performed while the cord is intact and the cord will be clamped after the infant is cardiopulmonary stable. Stable is defined as the establishment of heart rate greater than 100 bpm and oxygen saturation above 85% while using supplemental oxygen lower than 40%. The maximum cord clamping time is 10 minutes and prior to cord clamping a trial of weaning from PPV to CPAP is performed. With the exception that the infant is stabilised close to the mother and the cord is clamped later, the infant will receive standard resuscitation interventions.</description>
