    <textblock>
      The PREPARE TAVR pilot study will examine the effects of remotely administered physiological
      reconditioning program (RAPR) on quality of life (QOL) and clinical outcomes at one year post
      TAVR in frail older adults.

      The main objective of this study is to evaluate the effects of a home based exercise and
      dietary intervention program on the quality of life (QOL) and clinical outcomes in frail
      adults undergoing Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) procedures. Patients will be
      randomly (1:1) assigned to the standard of care (SOC group) where patients will receive all
      medical care as decided by their treating physicians or assigned to a home based program
      known as remotely administered physiological reconditioning (RPR) program which will include
      receiving personalized instructions for a progressive exercise program and dietary changes.
      Patients will be contacted for regular phone and in-person follow up for monitoring their
      progress. The primary endpoint will be quality of life as assessed by KCCQE questionnaires at
      one-year post TAVR. The secondary endpoints include length of stay post TAVR, all-cause
      mortality, repeat hospitalization and a composite of all-cause mortality and repeat
      hospitalization at one year.

    <description>Quality of life as assessed by the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ). KCCQE is a 23-item self-administered questionnaire developed to independently measure the patient's perception of their health status, which includes heart failure symptoms, impact on physical and social function, and how their heart failure impacts their quality of life (QOL) within a 2-week recall period. KCCQ responses are provided along a rating scale continuum with equal spacing from worst to best.</description>
