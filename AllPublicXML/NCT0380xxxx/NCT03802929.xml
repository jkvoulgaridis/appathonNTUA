      The objective of this proposal is to develop and validate diagnostic and prognostic
      (including short-term and long-term prognoses) prediction models for patients with venous
      thromboembolism (VTE) in China.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Venous thromboembolism (VTE), which clinically manifests as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and
      pulmonary embolism (PE), is one of the leading causes of mortality that need to be accurately
      diagnosed and effectively managed. Although a number of clinical decision rules in the domain
      of VTE have been presented in the literature, such as the well-known prediction models
      developed by Wells and colleagues, the prognostic models to assess VTE recurrence risk in
      patients who suffered from a VTE or the Pulmonary Embolism Severity Index (PESI) for
      short-term mortality risk in PE patients, and various other diagnostic models for both DVT
      and PE. They are few designed for Chinese patients. The primary objective of this proposal is
      to develop and validate diagnostic and prognostic (including short-term and long-term
      prognoses) prediction models for patients with VTE in China.
