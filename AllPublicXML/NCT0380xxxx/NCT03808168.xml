      The study design is a phase II interventional trial for women with biopsy proven high-grade
      cervical dysplasia. The study is an open label study and randomized. The study will have two
      arms. Patients will be randomized to both arms.

      High-grade cervical dysplasia (cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) II/III), is both
      detectable and quantifiable, which presents many opportunities for evaluation or early
      treatment, intervention and eventually, for cancer prevention. High-grade dysplasia is
      typically detected during cervical cancer screening with a pap smear. To determine the
      pathologic response rate of high grade cervical dysplasia with PD-1 checkpoint modulation
      with Nivolumab.This is a randomized phase II trial with two experimental arms (1 dose of
      nivolumab and 3 doses of nivolumab).

          -  All patients must have cervical biopsies demonstrating high-grade cervical dysplasia.

          -  All patients must have a satisfactory colposcopy with visualization of the entire
             squamo-columnar junction

          -  All patients must be candidates for a cervical conization procedure or LEEP procedure

             informed consent is obtained before any study-related procedure is performed

          -  Negative screening test results for hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and human
             immunodeficiency virus

          -  At least six weeks must have elapsed from any prior chemotherapy, radiation therapy or
             immunotherapy

          -  Patients must have adequate:

               -  Bone marrow function: Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) greater than or equal to
                  1,500/mcl. Platelets greater than or equal to100, 000/mcl. Hemoglobin &gt; 9 gm/dL.

               -  Renal function: creatinine less than or equal to institutional upper limit normal
                  (ULN) or calculated creatinine clearance (Cockcroft-Gault) â‰¥ 50 ml/min.

               -  Serum creatinine &lt;/= 1.5xULN or creatinine clearance (CrCl) &gt;/=50 mL/min (using
                  the Cockcroft-Gault formula)

               -  Female CrCl = (140-age in years) x weight in kg x 0.85 72 x serum creatinine in
                  mg/dL

               -  Metabolic function: Calcium, Magnesium, Phosphate, and Potassium levels within
                  institutional normal limits.

               -  Hepatic function: Bilirubin less than or equal to 1.5 x ULN. AST and ALT less
                  than or equal to 3 ULN and alkaline phosphatase less than or equal to 2.5 x ULN.

          -  Patients must have signed an approved informed consent and authorization permitting
             release of personal health information.

          -  Patients of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test prior to
             the study entry and be practicing an effective form of contraception. The effects of
             Nivolumab on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason and because other
             therapeutic agents or modalities used in this trial are known to be teratogenic, women
             of child-bearing potential must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or
             barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry, through the
             duration of study participation and for a period of 5 months after the last dose of
             nivolumab. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while
             participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The patient is lactating or pregnant

          -  The colposcopy is inadequate; the entire transformation zone is not visualized and
             endocervical curettage is positive for high-grade dysplasia

          -  Clinical concern for invasive cervical cancer

          -  Patients must not have received any prior oncology vaccine therapy

          -  Intercurrent medical illnesses that would impair patient tolerance to participation

             intercurrent illnesses

             may increase the risk associated with study participation or study drug
             administration, impair the ability of the subject to receive protocol therapy, or
             interfere with the interpretation of study results;

          -  Prior treatment with anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, anti-PD-L2, anti-CTLA-4 antibody or any

             detection or management of suspected drug-related pulmonary toxicity

          -  Subjects with history of life-threatening toxicity, including hypersensitivity
             reaction, related to prior immunoglobulin treatment for another condition or any other
             study drug component.

             restriction;

          -  Subjects unable (e.g., due to pacemaker or ICD device) or unwilling to have a

          -  History of allergy or hypersensitivity to study drug components

          -  Subjects with a condition requiring systemic treatment with either corticosteroids (&gt;
             10 mg daily prednisone equivalents) or other immunosuppressive medications within 14
             days of study drug administration. Inhaled or topical steroids, and adrenal
             replacement doses &gt; 10 mg daily prednisone equivalents are permitted in the absence of
