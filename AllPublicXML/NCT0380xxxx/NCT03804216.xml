  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Little knowledge exist on the short and long-term ophthalmological effect of the dialysis.
      Some studies stated a variation of the thickness subfoveal choroidal before and after a
      session of dialyse as well as variations of the coat of optical fibers measured in OCT.

      The Optical Coherence Tomography angiography OCT is a not invasive imaging technique which is
      now a part of examinations of investigation in imaging of retina. This technique allows to
      study the retinal macula vascularization without injection of contrast agent and thus allows
      to deepen the knowledge in medical domains where the exploration was to limited because of
      the invasive character of the examinations.

      The hypothesis of this project is that hemodynamic change during the hemodialysis may lead
      fine variations of the retinal vascularization in the short-term (the day of the dialysis)
      but also in the longer term (over 1 year).
