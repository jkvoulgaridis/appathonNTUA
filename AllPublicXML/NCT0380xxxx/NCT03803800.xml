  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Exercise therapy and increased physical activity in persons with Multiple Sclerosis (MS)
      improves mobility, muscular strength, physical fitness and fatigue without increasing relapse
      rate. As such, physical activity and more particular exercise therapy have become an
      important part of MS rehabilitation. Despite the fact that the positive effects of exercise
      therapy in MS are obvious only 43 percent of the MS community reports to participate in an
      exercise program4. Therefore, new exercise therapy approaches that further optimize
      rehabilitation, improve exercise adherence and promote participation in physical exercise in
      MS are interesting to explore. Therefore, the randomized controlled trial investigates two
      types of exercise interventions (classic progressive vs periodized) with or without the
      addition of ergogenic supplements (beta-alanine vs placebo).

      Following inclusion, baseline measurements (PRE) will be performed in MS patients (n=80).
      First, static(isometric) muscle strength (dynamometry), exercise capacity (maximal graded
      exercise test) and body composition (DEXA) will be evaluated. After 4 days of recovery, m.
      vastus lateralis muscle samples (Bergström procedure) will be taken. Hereafter, MS patients
      will be randomly allocated to one of four intervention groups following either 12 weeks of
      'classical' moderate intensity cardiovascular exercise therapy (n=40) or periodized exercise
      therapy (n=40), with (MSβclassic, n=20; MSβperiod, n=20) or without (MSclassic, n=20;
      MSperiod, n=20) β-alanine supplementation. Groups not receiving β-alanine supplements, will
      receive placebo tablets that will be identical in taste and appearance. To evaluate post
      training fatigue, perceived exertion will be recorded following each training session (6-20
      BORG scale). Following 12 weeks of classic or periodized training POST intervention
      measurements will be performed similar to baseline.

    <time_frame>3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Exercise capacity will be assessed using a maximal (12-lead ECG) graded cardiopulmonary exercise test (♂: 30W+15W/min, ♀: 20W+10W/min, GE eBike Basic®) with pulmonary gas exchange analysis (Jaeger Oxycon®). VO2, VE, RER will be monitored. This test will be performed at least 48 hours separated from the muscle strength test, to prevent interference of muscle fatigue. RER values will be evaluated to verify if the test was performed maximally (RER &gt;1.1).</description>

    <description>Quadriceps and hamstrings muscle strength will be assessed using a isokinetic dynamometer. Back- and abdominal muscle strength will be assessed using an isokinetic dynamometer (System 3, Biodex, ENRAF-NONIUS, New York, USA). After adequate warming-up and movement familiarization, subjects will perform 3 maximal isometric contractions of back- and abdominal muscles for 4-5sec. This test will be executed in two starting positions (semi-flexed and lumbar isolated) to evaluate adequate co-contraction of m.Iliopsoas and m.Glutei during back flexion and extension respectively.</description>

    <measure>Muscle carnosine concentration</measure>
    <time_frame>3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Muscle biopsies will be obtained from the middle part of the m.vastus lateralis (Bergström needle technique), by an experienced medical doctor.. The first two samples will be immediately embedded in Tissue-Tek, frozen in isopentane cooled with liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C, until further analysis will be performed. The second two samples will be 'snap freezed' between pincers cooled with liquid nitrogen, and also stored at -80°C until further analysis.
Carnosine concentrations will be determined using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Samples (15mg) are deproteinized using 35% sulfosalicylic acid and centrifuged (5min, 16,000g). Deproteinized supernatant is mixed with AccQ Fluor Borate buffer and reconstituted Fluor Reagent (1:7:2) from the AccQTag chemistry kit (Waters). Derivatized samples are applied to a Waters HPLC system comprised of an AccQTag column (3.9x150mm) and fluorescence detector (excitation/emission wavelength: 250/395nm).</description>
