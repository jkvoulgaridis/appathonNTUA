  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of oral psilocybin in post-traumatic
      headache. Subjects will be randomized to receive placebo, low dose psilocybin, or high dose
      psilocybin on two separate test days approximately 14 days apart. Subjects will maintain a
      headache diary prior to, during, and after the treatments in order to document headache
      frequency and intensity, as well as associated symptoms. Blood samples will be drawn at
      various timepoints to measure levels of inflammatory peptides.
