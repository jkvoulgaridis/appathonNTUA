      Research question: If adults with bone or joint infection have local antibiotic therapy, can
      they do without prolonged treatment with antibiotics by mouth (oral) or injection?

      Adults with bone or joint infections are usually given long courses of oral antibiotics or
      into a vein (intravenous) following surgery. It is also safe to give antibiotics directly
      into the bone or joint at the time of surgery: this is called local antibiotic therapy. This
      study investigates whether using local antibiotic therapy would allow shorter courses of oral
      or intravenous antibiotics, in order to limit antibiotic resistance, side effects and cost.

      This study compares short against long courses of oral or intravenous antibiotics for adults
      who have been given appropriate local antibiotic therapy to treat bone or joint infection.
      Patients who can take part will be randomly divided into two groups within 7 days of surgery.
      One group will stop oral or intravenous antibiotics, while the other group will continue for
      4 weeks or more (standard treatment).

      Adults with bone and joint infections who have already had surgery and local antibiotic
      therapy will be invited. Patients will not take part if they need intravenous antibiotics for
      another reason, or if their infection is caused by bacteria resistant to the antibiotic(s)
      used in their local antibiotic therapy.

      Main measurement: how many patients' infections return within 12 months after surgery. This
      will be decided by a group of doctors who do not know what treatment the patient received.

      Other important measurements: serious adverse events; side-effects; quality of life; cost of
      treatment.

      Patients will be asked questions at their usual clinic visits, and will be given a
      questionnaire at the start of treatment and 1 year later.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Using antibiotics wisely, only when and where they are really needed, is important to prevent
      superbugs emerging. At the moment, bone and joint infections are usually treated by a
      combination of surgery and antibiotics. Traditionally, treatment relies on several weeks of
      antibiotics as tablets or injections (systemic antibiotics), but these can sometimes cause
      problems.

      It is now possible to administer local antibiotics at the time of surgery directly to the
      site of infection. This allows much higher levels of the antibiotic to be delivered, for days
      or weeks, following surgery. Therefore, this study will investigate whether local antibiotics
      with a shorter course of systemic antibiotics can treat bone and joint infections as
      effectively as local antibiotics with a prolonged course of systemic antibiotics (usual
      treatment). If so, it may be possible to reduce antibiotic side effects, help to prevent
      antibiotic resistant bacteria emerging and limit overall treatment costs.

      Patients who agree to participate in this study will be allocated at random to two treatment
      strategies after surgery for bone and joint infection.

      One group of patients will be treated with local antibiotics and a long course of systemic
      antibiotics, which is the usual treatment: this is the 'long group'.

      The other group will be treated with local antibiotics and a short course of systemic
      antibiotics: this is the 'short group' whose treatment differs from the current usual
      treatment.

      Patients will be involved in the study for one year, and infection recurrence will be
      assessed at the time of routine clinic review up to 12 months after surgery. Whether or not
      treatment has been successful will be assessed by an independent committee of specialists,
      who will remain unaware of the patient's allocated treatment strategy.
