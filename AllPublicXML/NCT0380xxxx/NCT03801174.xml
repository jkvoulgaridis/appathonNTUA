  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study involves an evaluation of the role of domestic partner support in a comprehensive
      weight loss initiation and maintenance program.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Couples will be randomized to a comprehensive weight program directed at patients alone or
      involving their partners. In months 1-6, all patients will receive group-based weight loss
      program. In months 7-18, all patients will receive a telephone-based weight loss maintenance
      intervention. In the partner-assisted arm only, partners will participate in the
      intervention, learning and practicing communication skills and support strategies. In months
      19-24, intervention will be withdrawn to examine sustainability of effects.

      Due to COVID-19, option of doing screening and outcome assessment visits and attending the
      group classes (including exercise) remotely via a video conference may be available. COVID-19
      survey will be administered every 3 month starting at screening/enrollment visit.
