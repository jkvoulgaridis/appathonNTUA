  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      SNRB, as measured by the change in pain and objective functional ability, can solicit crucial
      information regarding a patient's clinical picture and can predict a patient's outcome
      post-surgery. By using the walk test as an objective functional assessment, the aim is to
      better standardize the threshold for a positive response to SNRB.

      In summary, SNRB, despite utilized frequently in the diagnostic work-up with patients with
      lumbar radiculopathy, vary widely in their sensitivity and specificity. The reasons, as
      outlined above, are multifactorial. The proposed study aims to minimize the known limitations
      of these injections and prospectively define their positive and negative predictive value in
      a homogenous group of patients undergoing surgery for lumbar foraminal stenosis and
      radiculopathy. The design will define a threshold of response utilizing both subjective and
      objective measures and more accurately predict excellent results following surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study will identify the threshold response level that quantifies the predictive
      value of diagnostic SNRBs in patients who present with lumbar foraminal stenosis and
      radiculopathy. Specifically, the proposed study will address the question of whether there is
      a degree or length of response to SNRB, which predicts an excellent surgical outcome. The
      hypothesis is that diagnostic SNRBs, when performed correctly, are useful in localizing the
      level of involvement in LSS and improve the accuracy and efficacy of surgical intervention.
      Use of diagnostic SNRBs will thus be used to clarify the clinical picture, giving the surgeon
      the information to make the right decision to operate or not, and, in the case of operation,
      predicting the optimal level(s) for surgical intervention. In addition, the investigators
      plan to identify and fully characterize a standard threshold level and time of nerve block
      response that will optimize the accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity of SNRB in predicting
      surgical outcomes.

    <measure>Visual Analog Scale (VAS) Leg Pain Score</measure>
    <time_frame>12-months</time_frame>
    <description>Aim: 0-2 point improvement
The Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) consists of a straight line with the endpoints defining extreme limits such as 'no pain at all' (0) and 'pain as bad as it could be' (10). The patient is asked to mark their pain level on the line between the two endpoints. The distance and change between '0' and the mark then defines the subject's pain. This will be measured at each subject visit.</description>

    <measure>Oswestry Disability Index Questionnaire (ODI)</measure>
    <time_frame>12-Months</time_frame>
    <description>Aim: 15-point improvement
The Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) is one of the principal condition-specific outcome measures used in the management of spinal disorders. The ODI is the most commonly outcome measures in patients with low back pain.
Structure / Content
There are 10 questions. The questions are designed in a way that to realize how the back or leg pain is affecting the patient's ability to manage in everyday life.
Scoring Method
Each of the 10 items is scored from 0 - 5. The maximum score is therefore 50. The score can be multiplied by 2 to produce a percentage.
If the FIRST statement is marked, the section score = 0, If the LAST statement is marked, it = 5
Interpretation
1.0%-20%: Minimal disability. Usually no treatment is indicated.
2.20%-40% Moderate disability
3.40%-60%: Severe disability
4.60%-80%: Crippled
5.80%-100%: These patients are either bed-bound or exaggerating their symptoms.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>EQ-5D Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>12-Months</time_frame>
    <description>Aim: Improvement in quality of life
The descriptive system comprises five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems and extreme problems. The patient is asked to indicate his/her health state by ticking the box next to the most appropriate statement in each of the five dimensions. This decision results in a 1-digit number that expresses the level selected for that dimension. The digits for the five dimensions can be combined into a 5-digit number that describes the patient's health state.
The questionnaire also records the patient's self-rated health on a vertical visual analogue scale, where the endpoints are labeled 'The best health you can imagine' and 'The worst health you can imagine'. The VAS can be used as a quantitative measure of health outcome that reflect the patient's own judgement.</description>

    <measure>Pain Disability Questionnaire (PDQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>12-months</time_frame>
    <description>Aim: 26-point improvement
The Pain Disability Questionnaire (PDQ) assesses perception of disability in relation to pain.
PDQ scores: mild/moderate (0-70), severe (71-100), and extreme (101-150).</description>

    <description>Prior to single level foraminotomy for lumbar foraminal stenosis, patients will undergo SNRB of the suspected nerve root. Patients will undergo surgery despite the response to injection. Patients will complete an ambulation assessment immediately before and after the injection. Distance and time will be noted. Patients will be called within 48 hours of injection to determine response to injection, and recorded as Pre-and Post-injection VAS leg as well as duration of the response. Patients will be seen at 6 weeks, 3,6, and 12 months post-surgery and outcome measured by VAS-leg, ODI, PDQ and EQ-5D scores. Data will be used to determine the ideal improvement in leg pain and duration of improvement, predicting a statistical and meaningful improvement in leg pain following foramintomy.</description>
