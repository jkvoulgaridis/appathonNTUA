  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients hospitalized in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) are at risk for developing severe
      disabilities, physical or cognitive. In particular, ICU-acquired weakness is frequent. The
      causes of this weakness are multiple and the physiopathology is still not fully understood.
      Immobilization in bed and sepsis are known risk factors.

      ICU-acquired weakness has been associated with prolonged mechanical ventilation duration, and
      increased in ICU and hospital length of stay. It has also been associated with significant
      decrease in functional capacity and with higher mortality. An early screening using a
      specific diagnostic protocol could help improving the management of patients suffering from
      ICU acquired weakness.

      The aim of this study is to early detect ICU acquired weakness in patients suffering from
      septic shock and ventilated for more than 72 hours.

    <description>Physical examination of muscle strength is conducted using the Medical Research Council (MRC) scale in 6 muscles bilaterally.
Patients with an MRC score of less than 48 of 60 are diagnosed with critical illness polyneuromyopathy (CIPNM).
The evaluation is completed by a routine neurological examination. In patients meeting the inclusion criteria, the screening Peroneal nerve test (PENT test) is performed on the day of study enrollment and subsequently in 1 week intervals until pathologic findings are detected or patient is discharged from the ICU.
PENT measures the peroneal nerve Compound muscle action potential (CMAP) amplitude in one leg. If the PENT is normal, the contra-lateral peroneal nerve is measured. An abnormal condition is identified if the peroneal nerve CMAP amplitude is reduced below the normal limits of the participating centre in at least one leg. In Lausanne, the abnormal response is &lt; 2,5 mV.</description>
