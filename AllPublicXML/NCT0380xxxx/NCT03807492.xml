  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The EMPOWeR study is proposed as a cohort study with longitudinal follow-up to determine
      rates of genetic mutations among men with or at-risk for prostate cancer to address the
      various facets of genetic education and counseling for optimized genetic assessment and
      wellness of men. The results will inform practice guidelines and future studies for maximal
      impact of genetic evaluation of men for inherited prostate cancer.

    <description>Participants will undergo gene panel testing through a saliva or blood sample. A genetic test summary will be generated to give to participants at disclosure of results. Participants will receive genetic test results in person, by phone or via telehealth. Fisher's exact test will be used to determine association of mutations and variants to patient characteristics.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <study_pop>
      <textblock>
        Any male &gt;18 years with prostate cancer is eligible. Furthermore, unaffected men at higher
        risk for prostate cancer (family history of prostate cancer or African American males) are
        also eligible for the study. Men will be approached by their providers or study staff
        during their clinical appointments for participation. Emails or mailings may also be sent
        to introduce the study to patients and to contact us for participation. Men who previously
        participated in the Genetic Evaluation of Men (GEM) study (IRB#14S.546) will be offered
        participation in EMPOWeR.
