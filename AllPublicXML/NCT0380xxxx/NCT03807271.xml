  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are studies that suggest that unsatisfying levels of anesthesia can cause peri- and
      postoperative complications in the patient undergoing surgery. Having a unnecessary &quot;deep&quot;
      anesthesia level can be harmful, causing acute renal failure, injure to myocard, cause
      delirium and increase the mortality rate. Being too &quot;light&quot;, on the other hand, can make the
      patient experience awareness when muscle relaxant is used. This can lead to serious
      psychological struggles.

      Evaluating the depth of anesthesia is the most important task of the anesthesia team, but can
      be difficult because clinical signs depend on many factors. In addition to clinical
      evaluation, EEG is commonly used for interpreting the level of anesthesia in todays practice.
      Unfortunately, this method is not always accurate and has a delay.

      New devices are now developed to calculate the anesthesia level based on the drugs given. The
      level is simultaneously presented graphically on screen. The purpose of this study is to
      investigate and compare clinical parameters within patients undergoing general anesthesia,
      with and without the use of such devices. Hemodynamic stability, less use of adrenergics,
      higher EEG-levels, a more rapid wake-up and shorter time in post operative care can indicate
      a more precise level of anesthesia, hence, promote patient safety.

    <intervention_name>Calculated and graphically produced depth of anesthesia (Smart Pilot® View)</intervention_name>
    <description>Smart Pilot® View is a device integrated in the ventilator used under general anesthesia. The depth of anesthesia is calculated based on age, weight, height and the medication given - both volatiles and intravenous. The device does not control the supply of medication directly, but provides an estimate of anesthesia depth that can help the anesthesia team to control the supply of anesthetic agents under general anesthesia, ie indirectly.</description>
