    <textblock>
      This study is looking at the safety, tolerability, and acceptability of twice-daily dosing
      with deferiprone delayed-release (DR) tablets in patients with systemic iron overload who are
      currently taking deferiprone immediate-release tablets (Ferriprox) three times a day.
      Ferriprox doses range from 75 milligrams per kilogram of body weight (mg/kg) per day to 100
      mg/kg per day. Half the patients in the study will be on a dosage that is closer to the low
      end of the range, and half will be on a dosage that is closer to the high end. Both groups
      will be switched for one month to deferiprone DR tablets at approximately the same total
      daily dosage that they have been taking for Ferriprox.
