  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to measure the concentration and the regional brain
      distribution of pathologic tau deposition using the PET tracer AV-1451 in participants in the
      UAB-ADC cohort. The amount and distribution of AV-1451 in the brain will be correlated to
      demographic, clinical, genetic, and biospecimen data acquired through the separate ongoing
      UAB-ADC study. Assessment of interactions between race and vascular risk factors, brain tau
      levels measured with AV-1451-PET, and cognitive status will be the primary outcome of this
      imaging study. Individuals participating in this AV-1451-PET/MRI study will also be enrolled
      in an ongoing [C-11]PiB-PET/MRI study (IRB-300001005, IND-138128), and their amyloid, tau and
      cognitive statuses will be compared in terms of race and vascular risk factors.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Enrollment in the UAB-ADC study under a separate IRB-approved research protocol.

          2. Enrollment in the UAB-ADC amyloid-PET substudy under a separate IRB-approved research
             protocol. The amyloid-PET study does not have to have been completed prior to
             enrollment and participation in this tau-PET study.

          3. Negative urine or serum hCG test within 2 days of [F-18]AV-1451 administration in
             women of child bearing potential. Women who are post-menopausal with at least 1 year
             since last menses or documented surgical sterilization will not require pregnancy
             testing.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Meets any exclusion criteria for the UAB-ADC study.

          2. Inability or contraindication for undergoing MRI and/or PET imaging

          3. Inability to participate in the imaging studies due to severity of dementia
