  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of rivogenlecleucel, and how well
      it works, in treating patients with blood cancer that has come back (recurrent) after stem
      cell transplant. Donor T-cell therapy (rivogenlecleucel) may help control transplant-related
      infections after stem cell transplant.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a dose-escalation study of rivogenlecleucel.

      Each subject may receive up to 3 doses of rivogenlecleucel intravenously (IV), at intervals
      of no less than 28 days. Subjects meeting protocol-specified severity criteria for acute
      GVHD, chronic GVHD, cytokine release syndrome (CRS), prolonged aplasia, or encephalopathy
      will be treated with rimiducid infusion(s).

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for 5 years and
      then annually for 10 years.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Original HCT donor: The most recent transplant was from a related or unrelated donor
             with an allele-level match to the recipient at HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C, HLA-DRB1, HLA-DQB1
             (10/10) or with a single antigen or allele mismatch (9/10), or with one or two
             umbilical cord blood units that are individually antigen-level matched to the
             recipient in at least 4 of 6 HLA loci (HLA-A, -B, -DRB1).

          -  Graft source: The most recent transplant (and any previous allotransplant) was from
             mobilized peripheral blood stem cells and/or bone marrow and/or umbilical cord blood.

          -  Transplant number: The relapse occurred after a 1st, 2nd or 3rd allogeneic HCT.

          -  Diseases: The subject relapsed or progressed with the same or related disease which
             prompted the previous allogeneic HCT.

               -  Leukemia (acute myeloid leukemia [AML], acute lymphoblastic leukemia [ALL],
                  chronic myelogenous leukemia [CML], chronic lymphocytic leukemia [CLL], chronic
                  myelomonocytic leukemia [CMML], blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell,
                  biphenotypic, bilineage)

               -  Myelodysplasia

               -  Myeloproliferative neoplasm

               -  Myelodysplasia/myeloproliferative neoplasms (including &quot;unclassified&quot;).

          -  For subjects with persistent or relapsed acute B-cell lymphoblastic leukemia, the
             subject must have previously received a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell product
             and blinatumomab at any point (not necessarily to treat the current relapse or after
             the current allogeneic transplant), unless the subject is ineligible for a
             commercially-available CAR T cell product or blinatumomab or declines those
             treatments.

          -  Relapse stage: The disease stage may be ascertained any time after engraftment of the
             original donor cells, where engraftment is defined as the first of 3 consecutive days
             of absolute neutrophil count &gt;= 500/uL unsupported by granulocyte-colony stimulating
             factor (G-CSF) within the preceding 5 days. (Note that eligibility for the protocol
             does not require an ANC &gt; 500/uL at the time of enrollment.) Subjects with any of the
             following disease stages are eligible for this protocol:

               -  Morphologic disease persistence or relapse (defined as &gt;= 5% bone marrow blasts
                  in a bone marrow aspirate or biopsy, and/or the presence of circulating blasts
                  detected by automated differential or review of the peripheral blood film and
                  confirmed to be malignant, and/or &gt;= 5% bone marrow blasts with aberrant
                  immunophenotype consistent with malignancy detected by flow cytometry of blood or
                  marrow)

               -  Extramedullary disease persistence or relapse (e.g., granulocytic sarcoma,
                  leukemia cutis)

               -  A new hematologic malignancy related to the prior transplant indication (such as
                  AML arising from myelodysplastic syndrome [MDS] or ALL arising from mixed lineage
                  leukemia [MLL]-rearranged AML) as per above

          -  Subject may have received prior DLI and/or prior genetically-modified DLI such as
             CAR-T cells and/or prior chemotherapy other than purine analogues to treat minimal
             residual disease (MRD) or morphologic/clinical relapse or disease persistence but must
             have had relapse as defined at some point after the most recent HCT to be enrolled on
             this study.

          -  Adequate HCT donor chimerism as indicated by original-donor T cell chimerism (from the
             most recent HCT) in peripheral blood &gt;= 50%. In the case of double umbilical cord
             transplant, one of the cord donors should constitute &gt;= 50% of the peripheral blood T
             cells.

          -  For subjects who received genetically-modified T cells such as CAR-T cells or
             antigen-specific T-cell receptor (TCR) T cells, the non-engineered, polyclonal T cells
             must constitute at least 50% of total peripheral blood T cells.

          -  Performance status: Karnofsky or Lansky performance status (PS) &gt;= 80% or Eastern
             Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) PS 0-1.

          -  Capable of giving informed consent, if the subject is 18 years of age or older. A
             parent or legal representative will be asked to consent for patients young than 18
             years old.

          -  DONOR: The donor must be available to undergo apheresis at the Seattle Cancer Care
             Alliance, South Lake Union site or at Bloodworks Northwest.

          -  DONOR: The donor must be suitable for medical reasons to donate according to
             institutional Standard Practice Guidelines and National Marrow Donor Program (NMDP)
             guidelines, including the absence of transmissible infections (hepatitis A, B, HIV,
             HTLV I/II, syphilis, West Nile virus [WNV] and Chagas disease).

          -  DONOR: The donor must not be homozygous to the recipient at an HLA allele that is
             common to recipient and donor. (Homozygosity at antigenic resolution is permitted.)
             Therefore, people who are homozygous at any HLA allele will be excluded.

          -  DONOR: The donor may not knowingly be related to a subject on this study by blood
             (e.g., sibling, parent, child, cousin). This is to prevent &quot;coercive recruitment&quot; of
             donors.

          -  DONOR: The donor must be 18-50 years old.

          -  DONOR: Capable of giving informed consent.

          -  DONOR: Not pregnant or breastfeeding at the time of apheresis.

          -  DONOR: Not on any prescription medications other than birth control pills or vitamins.

          -  DONOR: The donor must be cytomegalovirus (CMV) seronegative at the time of screening.
             For the product to be banked, the CMV polymerase chain reaction (PCR) done on the day
             of apheresis must be negative.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who currently have &gt;= grade 1 acute GVHD or any chronic GVHD manifestation
             beyond pre-existing ocular or oral sicca or pre-existing sclerosis.

             prednisone-equivalent for a minimum of 7 days prior to BPX-501 cell infusion. This
             determination will be made by the subject's treating physician (who is managing the
             subject's GVHD), documented in a clinical note, and verified by the protocol principal
             investigator (Pl).

             this trial.

          -  Central nervous system (CNS) leukemia (including leukemia detectable in the
             cerebrospinal fluid and/or solid chloromas and/or leptomeningeal leukemia) that has
             not cleared with radiation, intrathecal or systemic therapy.

          -  Inadequate cardiac function defined by left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &lt;
             40%.

          -  Inadequate pulmonary function defined by any one of the following: forced expiratory

             negative nasopharyngeal aspirate or nasopharyngeal swab.

          -  Positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), chronic hepatitis B, chronic
             hepatitis C, or human T-lymphotropic virus (HTLV) pre-transplant (To continue on
