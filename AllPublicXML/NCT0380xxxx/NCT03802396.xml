      This research study will evaluate the effectiveness and estimate the feasibility of
      administering an investigational drug called 'CN-105' (the study drug), to prevent
      postoperative cognitive decline, delirium (serious confusion) and underlying brain
      inflammatory and brain activity changes in adults 60 years and older undergoing surgery.

      This research study will evaluate the effectiveness and estimate the feasibility of
      administering an investigational drug called 'CN-105' (the study drug), to prevent
      postoperative cognitive decline, delirium (serious confusion) and underlying brain
      inflammatory and brain activity changes in adults 60 years and older undergoing surgery. The
      word &quot;investigational&quot; means the study drug is still being tested in research studies and is
      not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

      It is hoped that CN-105 will block signaling via a gene known as ApoE4, the most common gene
      implicated in late life Alzheimer's disease.

      Depending on when patients enroll in this study, participants will receive either a placebo
      or a progressively higher dose of CN-105 until the safest and best tolerated dose is reached.
      The study drug is given via IV (intravenous, meaning through a vein) infusion in the
      hospital. Study drug infusions will be given up to 4 days after surgery.

      Participants will also perform memory and thinking tests, as well as complete a survey and
      functional assessments, both prior to surgery and again 6 weeks after surgery. Each of those
      research visits will last about 1 hour.

      Additionally, the investigators will collect a blood sample and a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
      sample prior to the participant's surgery, 24 hours after surgery, and again 6 weeks after
      surgery. To obtain the CSF (cerebrospinal fluid) sample, investigators will perform a lumbar
      (the lower part of the spinal column) puncture. During surgery, investigators will also
      record participant brain waves from the scalp using an EEG (electroencephalography) monitor.
      An electroencephalography monitor reads the electrical activity of the brain in different
      places using a cap with sensors that is worn on the head.

      Although previous studies have not found any associations between the study drug and any
      serious medical problems, investigators will monitor its effect on wound healing and
      postoperative infections.

      Benefits of this study include the possibility of fewer problems in thinking and memory after
      surgery if this study drug works as hoped.

      Risks of participation in this study include headache, infection/discomfort from the lumbar
      puncture, discomfort from the blood draw, and minor skin irritation or redness from the EEG
      and heart rate monitor procedures.

    <intervention_model_description>Investigators will enroll 201 patients total in this phase 2 escalating dose study, with escalating CN-105 doses occurring in three successive groups of 67 patients each. In each group of 67 patients, 50 will receive a given dose of CN-105 and 17 will receive placebo.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>Participants will be randomized to receive either CN-105 or placebo after they consent to participate in the trial. Participants will be enrolled in 1 of 3 dose cohorts of 67 subjects each. An independent statistician will prepare dose stratified mixed block size randomization lists in a 3 to 1 ratio to achieve the desired distribution of drug and placebo. In each block of 67 trial participants, 50 will receive CN-105 and 17 will receive placebo, in a double-blind fashion.
CN-105 and placebo will be prepared in identical bags labelled simply with the trial participant's number (1-201) to keep all trial staff and clinicians blinded to randomization. Only the investigational pharmacist will have the randomization list for each participant showing what dose of CN-105 or placebo will be administered. To minimize bias, investigators conducting the laboratory assays on the CSF and blood samples will be blinded to trial group assignment during the course of the trial.</masking_description>
