    <description>Philips ISC is a Class-II Medical Device in the US and provides objective data regarding cognition via scoring algorithms that HCPs can use to inform diagnostic decision making and treatment planning. It enables tracking cognition over time and offers the possibility of new outcome measures. ISC can be used in a variety of healthcare environments such as neurology and neuropsychology practices.</description>

          -  If examinee has vision impairment or hearing loss, must be corrected to normal.

          -  Must have normal fine and gross motor ability

          -  Must have use of fingers, hands, and arms to be able to use a pencil to write symbols.

          -  Must be able to understand subtest instructions and participate fully in testing.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Evidence of current cognitive impairment.

          -  Disruptive behavior or insufficient compliance with testing to ensure a valid
             assessment.

          -  Examinee must not be currently admitted to a hospital, assisted living, nursing home
             or a psychiatric facility.

          -  Examinee must not be diagnosed with a neurological disorder or disease (e.g.,
             Parkinson's, brain tumor, stroke, TBI, epilepsy [if # seizures â‰¤ 2 and not receiving
             ongoing treatment for seizures, and not currently seeking medical evaluation or
             attention related to seizures, examinee can be accepted], encephalitis, dementia,
             language disorder (expressive or mixed receptive/expressive excluded; articulation
             disorder is ok), learning disorder.

          -  Must not have been unconscious related to traumatic brain injury or &quot;medical
             condition&quot; &gt; 20 minutes (however, e.g., heat stroke, medication induced are ok) or any
             head-injury resulting in an overnight hospital stay.

          -  Any history of a medical event requiring resuscitation in which examinee was
             non-responsive for &gt; 15 minutes.

          -  Must not have current or recent functional change (ability to carry out usual duties
             at work, in school, IADLs [driving, shopping, managing money], etc.) due to cognitive
             change.

          -  Examinee must not be receiving chemotherapy treatment, or have received chemotherapy
             treatment in the past 2 months.

          -  Examinee must not be (currently or in the past) diagnosed with a psychotic disorder,
             or currently diagnosed with a mood disorder (however, Major Depressive Disorder in
             remission or with no current episode, and Dysthymic and Adjustment Disorders, are
             acceptable) or an anxiety disorder with symptoms significant enough to interfere with
             optimal test performance.

          -  Autoimmune disorder (e.g., LUPUS, Multiple Sclerosis)

          -  Examinee must not be currently diagnosed with substance abuse or dependence, or have
             carried any substance abuse or dependence diagnosis in the past year (&gt; 1 year in
             remission diagnoses are ok). Long term alcohol abusers are excluded as well (e.g.,
             abused substance for more than 10 years).

          -  Any history of Autism Spectrum Disorder or Intellectual Disability.

          -  The examinee must not be currently taking medication that might impact test
             performance (e.g., anti-convulsants, antipsychotics, benzodiazepines,
             psychostimulants, opiods, tricyclic antidepressants, some norepinephrine reuptake
             inhibitors). Most antihypertensive medications and statins are acceptable.

          -  If previously diagnosed with any physical condition or illness that might depress test
             performance, illness must not interfere with normal cognitive functioning at work,
             school, ADLs, etc. Diabetes, hypothyroidism, and hypertension are acceptable if
             controlled.

          -  Exclude primarily nonverbal or uncommunicative. Must not have a diagnosis of aphasia.

          -  Examinees should not have received neuropsychological testing although previous MMSE
             testing is allowed if more than 6 months prior

          -  Examinee must not be seeking medical diagnostic procedures for cognitive difficulties
             from a medical professional.
