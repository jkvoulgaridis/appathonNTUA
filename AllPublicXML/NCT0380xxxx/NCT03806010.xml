  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To establish the sensory profile of patients using quantitative sensory testing (QST) and
      questionnaires as well as the level of sensitisation using temporal summation and diffuse
      noxious inhibitory control paradigms in all patients undergoing a chronic pain intervention
      at Barts Health NHS Trust.

      Primary objective- To identify the phenotype of responders and non-responders to a chronic
      pain intervention using QST sensory profile as well as the sensitisation paradigms.

      Secondary objective- To establish the correlation between sensory profile, and sensitisation
      parameters as well as other measures of chronic pain as per Initiative on Methods,
      Measurement and Pain Assessment in clinical trials (IMMPACT) recommendation.

      Common interventions performed at Barts Health NHS Trust includes Neuromodulation, targeted
      epidural steroid and/or radiofrequency treatment, 8% Capsaicin patch and pharmacological
      interventions such as anti-neuropathic agent and opioids.
