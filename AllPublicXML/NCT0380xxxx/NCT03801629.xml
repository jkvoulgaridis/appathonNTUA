  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, a novel human laboratory model will be evaluated.

      Preclinical research indicates acute opioid administration evokes an immune response in the
      periphery and brain. Here, we will translate those preclinical findings to healthy human
      volunteers and quantify the neuroimmune response to a morphine challenge (Specific Aim). To
      measure the neuroimmune system, we will use [11C]PBR28 positron emission tomography (PET)
      imaging to quantify 18kDa translocator protein (TSPO) availability. TSPO is an imaging marker
      of the neuroimmune system shown to scale with microglia levels. Up to twenty healthy
      volunteers will complete two 120-minute [11C]PBR28 PET scans. Subjects will complete one scan
      prior to, and one scan 2-hr after, a single morphine injection (0.07 mg/kg i.m.).

      Specific Aim: To determine whether an acute morphine injection increases TSPO availability in
      healthy volunteers.

      Hypothesis: Relative to baseline, morphine will significantly increase whole-brain TSPO
      availability, consistent with a neuroimmune response.
