  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite research demonstrating the efficacy of buprenorphine (BPN), effectiveness in
      real-world settings has been limited by shorter retention than for methadone, and the need
      for daily or near-daily dosing (frequently supervised in Australia). Newly developed
      sustained-release BPN formulations could provide rapid onset and sustained release of BPN.

      Current formulations include six-monthly implants, and once-weekly or once-monthly
      injections, removing the need for frequent clinic or pharmacy attendance. Improved medication
      adherence may result in improved patient outcomes and fewer unintended consequences such as
      diversion, but more data are needed in real-world settings. These innovations have the
      potential to dramatically change the treatment settings and options for people who are opioid
      dependent.

      The study aims to evaluate the patient outcomes following the implementation of a monthly BPN
      depot injection for the treatment of opioid dependence in community-based treatment settings
      with a focus on opioid and other illicit drug use, adherence and retention, and participants'
      experiences of the implementation.

      Opioid agonist treatment (OAT) is effective for opioid dependence and newer extended-release
      buprenorphine (BUP-XR) injections represent a significant development. The Community
      Long-Acting Buprenorphine (CoLAB) study aims to evaluate client outcomes among people with
      opioid dependence receiving 48 weeks of BUP-XR treatment, and examines the implementation of
      BUP-XR in diverse community healthcare settings in Australia.

      The CoLAB study is a prospective single-arm, multicentre, open-label trial of monthly BUP-XR
      injections in people with opioid dependence. Participants are being recruited from a network
      of general practitioner and specialist drug treatment services located in the states of New
      South Wales, Victoria and South Australia in Australia. Following a minimum 7 days on 8-32mg
      of sublingual buprenorphine (+/- naloxone), participants will receive monthly subcutaneous
      BUP-XR injections administered by a healthcare practitioner at intervals of 28 days (-2/+14
      days). The primary endpoint is participant retention in treatment at 48 weeks after treatment
      initiation. Secondary endpoints will evaluate dosing schedule variations, craving,
      withdrawal, substance use, health and well-being, and client-reported treatment experience.
      Qualitative and costing sub-studies will examine implementation barriers and facilitators at
      the client and provider level.

        receiving sublingual buprenorphine treatment at participating drug and alcohol services,
        express interest in receiving depot buprenorphine injections and are deemed suitable for
        treatment with RBP-6000 by the Investigator.

        Inclusion criteria

        To be eligible for the study, participants must meet all of the following inclusion
        criteria:

          1. Voluntarily signed the informed consent form

          2. Aged 18 to 65 years

          3. Opioid-dependent (ICD-10) currently receiving treatment

          4. Has been receiving 8-32mg sublingual buprenorphine +/- naloxone tablets/film for at
             least 7 days

          5. Negative pregnancy test at screening and baseline in females of childbearing potential
             (please refer to Section 5.7 for long acting reversible contraceptive methods with
             efficacy considered to reasonably eliminate pregnancy potential)

        Exclusion criteria

        Participants who meet any of the exclusion criteria are not to be enrolled in this study:

          1. Currently lactating or pregnant, or of childbearing potential and not willing to avoid
             becoming pregnant during the study

          2. History or presence of allergic or adverse response (including rash or anaphylaxis) to
             buprenorphine or the ATRIGEL® Delivery System

             other circumstances which, in the opinion of the Investigator, would compromise
             compliance with the protocol and/or patient safety. Specific conditions of interest
             include severe hepatic disease (Child-Pugh Class B), severe renal or respiratory
             disease, or severe cognitive impairment or psychiatric condition that impairs the
             ability to provide informed consent (e.g. psychosis, delirium, hypomania, severe
             depression or suicidal ideation)

          4. Subjects who are currently participating in any other clinical study involving
             investigational medication(s)

          5. Inability or unwillingness to provide informed consent or abide by the requirements of
             the study
