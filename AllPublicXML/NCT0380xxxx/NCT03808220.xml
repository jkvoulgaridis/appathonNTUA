    <textblock>
      PAIN OUT is a multi-national, non-interventional registry and benchmark project, assessing
      and analysing clinical and patient-reported outcome data of postoperative pain.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PAIN OUT offers a large registry as well as a system for benchmarking and feedback of outcome
      quality and decision support in acute pain conditions. It collects demographic, clinical and
      outcome data, using a validated assessment tool available in multiple languages.

      The registry part of the project aims at performing population-based research. Furthermore,
      its infrastructure allows for the conduct of prospective studies comparing the effectiveness
      of processes of care.

      The benchmark part of the project provides the medical community with a unique, user-friendly
      system to improve treatment of patients with postoperative pain. A web-based information
      system, featuring two main functions, was developed:

      a feedback and benchmarking system which provides participating sites with continuously
      updating data and analyses about the quality of care they provide compared to other
      institutions and allows identification of best clinical practice.

      a knowledge library which provides clinicians with easily accessible and regularly updated
      summaries of evidence-based recommendations tailored to specific post-operative situations.

      From 2016 on, sub-projects in Mexico, China and several European countries have started. This
      programs take place over a period of two years during which collaborators carry out a Quality
      Improvement project in their hospital using methodology provided by PAIN OUT. This includes
      collection of baseline data in a first phase, analysis of findings according to a protocol
      provided by PAIN OUT, review of findings and developement of improvement measures,
      implementation of the improvements and assessment of outcomes after a second phase of data
      collection.
