  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The sponsor, Pfizer has developed a formulation of tramadol hydrochloride/ paracetamol 37.5
      mg/ 325 mg (test drug) as a generic alternative to the reference listed product Ultracet®. In
      order to meet the requirements for registration as a generic drug, this study is being
      conducted to demonstrate the bioequivalence between the formulation of tramadol
      hydrochloride/ paracetamol 37.5 mg/ 325 mg provided by Pfizer and the reference drug tramadol
      hydrochloride/ paracetamol 37.5 mg/ 325 mg, available in the pharmaceutical market in Brazil
      (Ultracet®, Janssen Cilag Farmacêutica Ltda).

                  the past year) or active suicidal ideation or behavior or laboratory abnormality
                  that may increase the risk associated with study participation or investigational
                  product administration or may interfere with the interpretation of study results
                  and, in the judgment of the investigator, would make the research subject
                  inappropriate for entry into this study.

              20. Research subjects who are investigator site staff members directly involved in
