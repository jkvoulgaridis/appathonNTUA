  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is the intervention phase of a study to investigate the impact of low-cost bundled
      interventions on improving the infection control practices in the labor and delivery units in
      rural healthcare settings in Zambia. A baseline observational phase of the health care
      providers' infection control procedures was done. In this intervention phase, low-cost bundle
      of interventions, including health care provider education, behavior feedback, visual and
      Short Message Service (SMS)/text message reminders, and provision of alcoholic hand rubs,
      will be implemented at 5 study sites. 12 weeks after the initiation of interventions, endline
      data will be collected. The data from endline after interventions will be compared with
      baseline data from observational phase to detect changes in infection control practices at
      each study site after the interventions.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The total duration of the intervention phase is estimated to be 4 months. During this time,
      the investigators will collaborate with the healthcare workers (HCWs) at each study site and
      the district pharmacist.

      The study team will visit each site separately and administer the training modules on-site
      during the first month of the research until all of the modules have been completed for all
      of the Labor and Delivery (L&amp;D) staff, which usually consist of about 2-3 people. A quiz will
      be administered before and after the training session to assess change in knowledge after the
      training.

      SMS reminders will be sent every weekday to promote best infection control practices in the
      L&amp;D. Posters will also be posted for visual reminders of best practices around the health
      center.

      After the initial training, each health centers will be visited twice a month by a study team
      member to assess alcohol rubs (AHR) stock, gather feedback and comments, and evaluate
      postpartum maternal and neonatal infectious complications and hospital outcomes. Infection
      and outcome data will be shared with each site monthly. About 2 months after initial
      training, a refresher education and training course will be held at each study site. A quiz
      will be administered before and after the refresher course to assess knowledge.

      The investigators will collaborate with the district pharmacy for production and distribution
      of AHR. The pharmacists will receive training on how to combine and mix the hand rub
      components per WHO guidelines, and test batches will be made prior to distribution to study
      sites to ensure familiarity of the pharmacy staff with its production. Quality control with
      an alcoholmeter will be performed with the alcohol ingredient and with the finished product,
      as per World Health Organization (WHO) recommendation. Afterwards, the head pharmacist will
      be consulted biweekly by study team member to document AHR production, budget, distribution,
      and any other issues.

      Endline data collection will occur 12 weeks after initiation of intervention implementation.
      During data collection period, a study team member will meet with a L&amp;D floor administrator
      in a private setting at a time convenient to the administrator to go through the
      questionnaire portion of the ICAT together.

      Eligible pregnant women will primarily be recruited and consented outside the facility in the
      waiting area where they congregate prior to admission for delivery. Women who are consented
      will be given a &quot;consent card&quot; in addition to a copy of the consent form. This card will
      state that they have previously consented to the study, and can then be presented once they
      are admitted for delivery. A member of the research team will accompany the primary care
      provider during their provision of care and patient contact during first, second, and third
      stages of labor to observe, assess and document infection control behaviors and practices by
      the providers, using the ICAT.

      A retrospective review of the logbook will be done to assess for rates of postpartum maternal
      and neonatal infectious complication and outcomes for participants.

      During the endline data collection, an anonymous, self-administered survey will be
      administered to the study site HCWs to assess the knowledge, attitudes and practices of the
      study site HCWs towards the implemented study interventions.

    <measure>Infection control practices assessed by Infection Control Assessment Tool (ICAT) score</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A survey including 98 questions detailing infection control practices in the L&amp;D. It includes questions on facility, Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) program, general IPC, hand hygiene, L&amp;D practices, and postpartum care practices. The scores from each question on the survey will be summed for the ICAT score for each health center. Maximum score is 140 points and minimum score is 0 points, with higher score indicating better infection control practices. Of the 98 questions, 34 questions are duplicated in an observation tool in order to corroborate the accuracy of survey information by direct observation. The observation tool includes topics on supplies in the L&amp;D and healthcare worker behaviors during childbirth. ICAT was developed by the Rational Pharmaceutical Management plus Infection Control Project team in 2009.</description>
