      : The aim of this study is to investigate Cord blood irisin and nesfatin-1 levels in
      pregnancies with intrauterine growth retardation and to determine whether they are associated
      with abnormal fetal doppler findings or not.

      This study was conducted at Yüzüncü Yıl University Medical Faculty Obstetrics and Gynecology
      Clinic. The study group included 34 pregnant women ranged from 18 to 45 years old who have
      intrauterine growth retardation and underwent ceseraen section. 32 pregnant women who had no
      abnormality on prenatal follow-up and underwent elective ceserean seciton served as control
      group. The maternal age, height, weight, body mass index (BMI), systolic and diastolic blood
      pressures were recorded in both groups of patients. Maternal serum total blood count and
      biochemical parameters were obtained from the laboratory parameters. Gestational week at
      birth, birth weight, sex, 1st and 5th minute APGAR scores were recorded. Blood samples were
      collected from all the cases during the cesarean section for measurmenet of nesfatin-1 and
      irisin by doubly clamped umbilical cord. Blood samples were immediately centrifuged in
      sterile tubes and maintained at -80 ° C until assessed.
