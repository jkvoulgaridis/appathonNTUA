  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be a single center, Phase 2, open-label trial to evaluate the safety and
      efficacy of 200mg CC-11050 administered twice daily taken with food for patients with
      moderate to severe ENL. The study will be performed in two steps: 1) to evaluate immediate
      effect in safety and efficacy of drug in 10 males with new or new recurrent episode ENL and,
      if found to be safe and effective by the DSMB and 2) if allowed by the DSMB, and approved by
      relevant study stakeholders, an additional 40 ENL patients will be enrolled for up to 52
      weeks of treatment. A safety analysis will be conducted on all patients who have received at
      least one dose of study drug, and will include the frequency of all adverse events and
      laboratory abnormalities as well as frequency of dose interruptions, dose reductions and
      treatment discontinuation.

    <measure>Number of participants with moderate to severe ENL with severity changes as assessed by the ENL Severity Scale.</measure>
    <time_frame>10 days, 28 days and monthly up to 1 year of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in ENL Severity Scale Score (Walker et al., PLoS Negl Trop Dis 11(7): e0005716, https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0005716) as compared to baseline and any previous time points. Ten clinical categories contribute 0-3 points toward the total score of 0-30. An ENL patient with a total scale score of less than 9 is considered to have mild ENL, while scores &gt;9 are considered moderate to severe ENL. A minimum score of 9 is required to indicate sufficient ENL symptoms from which post-intervention reduction in score(s) can be determined meaningful improvement.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of participants with moderate to severe ENL with decreased duration of episode(s) as assessed by standard ENL episode definition.</measure>
    <time_frame>10 days, 28 days, monthly up to 1 year of treatment and up to 1 year followup after treatment cessation.</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in ENL episode duration(s) as compared to baseline and any previous time points. By definition, if ENL symptoms are separated by time and no need of treatment for &gt;28 days, they are considered separate episodes. Recurrence is anytime another episode occurs after &gt;28 days of no prior treatment or symptoms.</description>

    <description>Changes in slit skin smear microscopy BI as compared to baseline. BI can range from 0-6.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of patients with moderate to severe ENL with improved peripheral neuropathy as assessed by standardized monofilament and voluntary muscle tests.</measure>
    <time_frame>enrolment, 10 days, 28 days, biweekly (as needed), up to 1 year treatment, up to 1 year followup after treatment cessation</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in scores for peripheral neuropathy as indicated by monofilament and voluntary muscle tests compared from baseline and any previous time points. To check neuropathy, 7 motor function nerves and 6 sensory function nerves on each side of the body are assessed for a total 26 nerves. Each are assessed on 3 sites using a standard set of Semmes-Weinstein monofilaments. The 200mg filament and the 2g filament represent threshold for the hand and foot, respectively. The 0-5 Medical Research Council (MRC) scale is used for motor function assessment. Sensory scores &gt;3 and motor nerve scoring (MRC) &lt; 5 are regarded impaired (indicating neuropathy).

    <measure>Number of participants with moderate to severe ENL with improved quality of life as assessed by the World Health Organization Quality of Life tool.</measure>
    <time_frame>Enrolment, 28 days, monthly up to 1 year of treatment and up to 1 year followup after treatment cessation.</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in scores for the World Health Organization Quality of Life assessment as compared to baseline and any previous time points. There are 26 questions in this questionnaire and each can be scored from 1 to 5 points. The highest possible score is 130 and lowest possible score is 26. A higher score denotes better quality of life.</description>
