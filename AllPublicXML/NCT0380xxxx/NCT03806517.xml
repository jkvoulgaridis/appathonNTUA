  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The bone loss in Parkinson's disease (PD) emerges as a non-motor symptom with motor and
      non-motor outcomes, such as fracture and musculoskeletal pain. Bone mineral density (BMD) is
      decreasing in patients with PD when compared to sex and age-matched healthy controls. The
      changes in BMD according to clinical subtypes of PD is unknown. The investigators are
      planning to compare the BMD status between the tremor dominant and postural instability and
      gait difficulty type of PD.

      The investigators are planning to complete this study between January and February 2019. This
      study will be performed at Ordu University Education and Research Hospital, Neurology
      Department.

      All patients admitted to the outpatient clinic will be evaluated in terms of inclusion
      criteria. The control group consisted of people who do not have any orthopedic, neurological
      or metabolic disorders which may affect the BMD.

    <measure>Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA)</measure>
    <time_frame>10-15 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Bone mineral density will be dertermined using DEXA results. The results will be interpreted by WHO (World Health Organization) criteria.
: T-score (T-score) is determined by DEXA method. A T-score value of more than minus means that there is excess bone loss.
Obsolete osteoporosis: A T-score of less than -2.5 SD and a history of fracture in a patient.
Osteoporosis: T-score below -2.5 SD. (Like -3, -4 ...)
Osteopenia: T-score between -1 and -2.5 SD
Normal: T-score value better than -1</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Hoehn and Yahr Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>2 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Disease progression will be assessed with Hoehn and Yahr Scale. The original scale included stages 1 through 5.
Stage 0: No signs of disease.
Stage 1: Unilateral symptoms only.
Stage 2: Bilateral symptoms. No impairment of balance.
Stage 3: Balance impairment. Mild to moderate disease. Physically independent.
Stage 4: Severe disability, but still able to walk or stand unassisted.
Stage 5: Needing a wheelchair or bedridden unless assisted.</description>

    <measure>Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) - Section of Activities of Daily Living (ADL)</measure>
    <time_frame>10 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The UPDRS- ADL section evaluates the impact of Parkinson disease on ADL according to patient's perspective. The ADL section consists of 13 items for gathering information on the patient's own perception of functional impairment due to PD. Each item scores between 0-4. 0 means normal and 4 means severe impairment. The total score change between 0-52. High scores indicate severe impairment.</description>

    <measure>Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) - Motor Section</measure>
    <time_frame>10 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Motor section of UPDRS determines the impairment due to the Parkinson's disease. Rigidity, bradykinesia and tremor items which are relating with upper extremity function will be assessed. Each item scores between 0-4. 0 means normal and 4 means severe impairment. The total score change between 0-56.</description>

    <measure>Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) - non-motor Section</measure>
    <time_frame>5 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Non-motor section of UPDRS evaluates the impact of the non motor symptoms in PD. Each item scores between 0-4. 0 means normal and 4 means severe impairment. Total score changes between 0-52.</description>

    <measure>Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) - complications Section</measure>
