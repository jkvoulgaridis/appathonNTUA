  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators examined the effects on post-digestion brachial artery flow mediated
      dilation (FMD) and in vitro antioxidant capacity of 40% semolina flour replacement with
      sprouted chickpea flour.

      The purpose of the current study was to examine in-vitro and in-vivo effects of replacing 40%
      of semolina flour with sprouted chickpea flour for the use in pasta. Antioxidant capacity
      in-vitro was measured by Trolox Equivalent Antioxidant Capacity. Brachial artery
      flow-mediated dilation, a test of in-vivo endothelial function, was performed for assessment
      of effects on post-digestion endothelial function. The investigators hypothesized that FMD
      would be higher after consuming 40% of semolina flour with sprouted chickpea flour pasta vs.
      100% of semolina flour pasta.
