  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is the most common peripheral entrapment neuropathy with
      involving compression of the median nerve in the carpal tunnel. Rather than other progressive
      disease, CTS is characterized by remission and recurrence. The hydrodissection could decrease
      the entrapment of nerve to restore blood supply. In addition, the Vitamin B12 was considered
      to be beneficial for peripheral neuropathy and pain relief. The investigators design a
      randomized, double-blind, controlled trail to assess the effect after ultrasound-guided
      hydrodissection with Vitamin B12 in patients with CTS.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After obtaining written informed consent, patients with mild to moderate CTS will been
      randomized into intervention and control group. Participants in intervention group received
      one-dose ultrasound-guided hydrodissection with 3cc Vitamin B12 and control side received
      one-dose ultrasound-guided injection 3cc normal saline. No additional treatment after
      injection through the study period. The primary outcome is Boston Carpal Tunnel Syndrome
      Questionnaire (BCTQ) and secondary outcomes include visual analog scale (VAS),
      cross-sectional area (CSA) of the median nerve, sensory nerve conduction velocity of the
      median nerve. The evaluation was performed pretreatment as well as on the 2nd week, 1st, 2nd,
      3rd and 6th month after the treatment.

    <description>Boston carpal tunnel syndrome questionnaire (BCTQ) is a frequently used patient-based questionnaire for measurement of CTS which encompasses two components. In total, 11 questions and 8 items were evaluated to rate the symptom severity scale (SSS) and functional status scale (FSS), respectively. Both subscales range from 1 to 5 with a higher score indicating a higher degree of disability. The mean of total SSS and FSS divided with each item score were used for further analysis.</description>
