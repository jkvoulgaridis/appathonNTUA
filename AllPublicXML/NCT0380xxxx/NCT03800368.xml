    <textblock>
      The objective of this randomized controlled trial (RCT) is to compare the changes of the
      sleep-related memory functions in patients with psychosis after they have completed the
      12-week high-intensity exercise intervention, the 12-week low-intensity exercise
      intervention, or the 12-week controlled non-exercise intervention respectively. Fifty-one
      patients with psychosis, patients who received either the high-intensity exercise or
      low-intensity exercise as intervention shown a significant improvement to their impaired
      sleep-related memory function, while those who received non-exercise intervention has no such
      improvement. Moreover, high-intensity exercise may have a more prominent effect compare to
      low-intensity exercise.
