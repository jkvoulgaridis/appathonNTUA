      Better understanding of the specificities of the vaccine response in patients with COPD

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) will become the third leading cause of death
      worldwide in 2020 (3.5 million patients, 16500 deaths in France). Its socio-economic cost is
      related to the handicap induced by the decline of the respiratory function, as well as to the
      occurrence of exacerbations, main causes of hospitalization and mortality. Since
      exacerbations are mostly infectious, a preventive strategy involves routine influenza
      vaccination. Although it is highly recommended in this population, there is no formal
      evidence of its effectiveness during COPD. While correlates of influenza vaccine efficacy
      exist, cellular and humoral responses to this vaccine have been poorly evaluated in these
      patients. This alteration of the vaccine response could also be integrated into an overall
      deficit of the response to a vaccine in these patients.

      As influenza virus infection is one of the most important causes of death in patients with
      COPD, and vaccination is the best way to prevent it, it is essential to better understand the
      immune response in the context of vaccination in this population. The investigator's
      hypothesis is that there would be a global alteration of the immunological immune response in
      the COPD patient involving abnormalities of lymphocyte B differentiation and the effector
      capacity of T lymphocytes, notably through the activation of the PD1 / PDL1 axis.
