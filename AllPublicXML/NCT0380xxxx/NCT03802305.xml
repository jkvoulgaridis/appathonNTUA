  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The irreversible acute pulpitis is the most common emergency at the hospital during dental
      consultation. Pulpitis are characterized by intense and spontaneous oro-facial pains. In case
      of mandibular molar, the emergency treatment consists in realizing a pulpotomy (eviction of
      cameral pulp) under locoregional anesthesia called inferior alveolar nerve block (IANB). The
      latter represents a real challenge, since inflammation may decrease its action. To mitigate
      this deficiency and the drawbacks of the IANB (onset and duration of the anesthesia, bites
      risk reported with IANB) other anesthesias are proposed. In particular the computerized
      intraosseous technique anesthesia of which the Quicksleeper™ system is a part. However,
      according to the observers, a mild to severe tachycardia have been reported.

      Very few valid clinical trials exists on the subject, most being realized with systems of
      intraosseous anesthesia other than Quicksleeper™. Therefore, the aim of this study is first
      to analyze the variations of the cardiovascular parameters into two groups of anesthesia:
      locoregional anesthesia and Quicksleeper ™ system; and then, to compare the efficiency, side
      effects, operating consequences of both techniques. This study should provide better data
      about potential risk with computerized intraosseous technique such has Quicksleeper ™ system
      in healthy or cardiovascular risk patient.

      When the patient arrive in the dental care center, an initial assessment is made to get the
      diagnosis of irreversible pulpitis:

        1. Anamnesis:

           acute and spontaneous oro-facial pain, pulsatile severe intensity, which could irradiate
           toward the ear and/or jaw, exacerbated by cold or hot.

        2. Clinical exams: positive vitality tests (electric test and cold pressor test)

        3. Further examination (radiography)

      The inclusion and exclusion criteria will be checked and the informed consent of the patient
      will be taken. The patient is then randomized in one of the group (experimental or control).
      He will fill a questionnaire (Corah's scale) for evaluating his state of anxiety during care.
      A monitoring of cardiac parameters is made during the care at defined moment.

      The patient evaluates his pain himself with the VAS (Visual Analog Score), before the
      intervention. The anesthesia is carried out by only one experimenter, with the Quickslepper™
      handpiece but different specific needles.

      Each patient receive 1.8 mL of 4% articaine 1:100 000 on a period of 2 minutes.
