  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) has become one of most important medical imaging tools over
      the past 30 years because it is non-invasive, requires no ionizing radiation, and provides
      exquisite images of soft tissues and anatomic structures with many tissue/disease specific
      contrasts. While MRI has served the community well for many years, it is increasingly clear
      that it also has significant limitations.

      One of the principle limitations is the lack of quantitative information for tissue/structure
      characterization. The current paradigm of MRI is to use a set of scanner settings to generate
      an image &quot;weighted&quot; by a specific MR contrast mechanism (physical parameter), where it is
      hoped that variations in the parameter will be accentuated. However, without quantitative
      knowledge of the parameters, the final image contrast may depend on many factors, which
      complicates image interpretation and diagnostic performance. Quantitative measurement can
      provide a great deal of information about tissue properties and pathological conditions,
      since these parameters ultimately determine the contrast that is observed in conventional
      images.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate novel quantitative MRI techniques in clinical
      studies to determine whether they can provide better, faster and more useful information for
      clinical diagnosis. Quantitative MRI has been a continuous interest in the MRI community, but
      extremely challenging due to long acquisition times and sensitivity to motion. Recently, the
      investigators have introduced a novel MRI data acquisition approach, namely MR Fingerprinting
      (MRF), for simultaneous measurement of several important parameters in a single MRI scan.

      In this study, the investigators propose to apply MR Fingerprinting at UNC and evaluate its
      performance for different neurological diseases. The investigators hypothesize that the
      quantitative MR imaging technique will lead to improved tissue characterization and
      diagnosis.
