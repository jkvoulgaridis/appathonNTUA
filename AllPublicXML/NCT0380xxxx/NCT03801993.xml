  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multicenter, observational study designed to collect gastrointestinal
      related data in patients with Cystic Fibrosis (CF).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are currently no large, multicenter prospective clinical trials examining management of
      constipation or other gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms in people with cystic fibrosis (CF).
      Current recommendations in the CF literature are largely based on expert consensus and
      opinions. Yet, constipation and other GI symptoms are crucial factors in quality of life
      (QOL) and maintenance of optimal nutritional state in people with CF. This study will use
      GI-symptomatology questionnaires to understand the multiple overlapping GI symptoms in people
      with CF.

      Eligible subjects will be consented and enrolled in the study at the Enrollment Visit. At the
      visit, the subject or parent/guardian will complete the patient reported outcome surveys
      (PROs) using a mobile device (e.g., smartphone or tablet). The same questionnaires will be
      completed on a mobile device outside the clinic three additional times. The PROs will consist
      of four questionnaires: Patient Assessment of Constipation Symptoms (PAC-SYM), Patient
      Assessment of Gastrointestinal Symptoms (PAGI-SYM), Patient Assessment of Constipation
      Quality of Life (PAC-QOL) and a disease-specific questionnaire (Bristol Stool Scale and
      questions about fecal incontinence, and stool quality and frequency).
