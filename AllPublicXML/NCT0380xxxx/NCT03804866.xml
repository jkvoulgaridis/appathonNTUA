  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this extension protocol is to evaluate the early safety of a new
      schedule of NGR-hTNF given weekly, instead of every 3 or 4 weeks, in a cohort of 12 patients
      randomized to the experimental arm A, as compared to a reference cohort of 12 patients
      randomized to an anthracycline alone

      In this extension protocol IPR/26 of completed IPR/24 study, considering the relatively short
      half-life of approximately 1 hour and the favourable toxicity profile of NGR-hTNF,
      characterized by transient constitutional symptoms occurring during the first day of
      administration, an additional cohort of 24 patients will be randomized and the 12 patients
      enrolled in arm A will receive the same dose of NGR-hTNF 0.8 mcg/m2 given as 60 minutes
      infusion every week. the weekly schedule of NGR-hTNF 0.8 mcg/m2 has previously been tested in
      several studies
