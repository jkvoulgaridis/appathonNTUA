  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Clopidogrel is an anti-platelet agent used to inhibit blood clots. Variation in response to
      clopidogrel has been reported among different population and may lead to reoccurring ischemic
      events. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the incidence of clopidogrel resistance
      in ischemic stroke patients from different ethnicities in Northern Israel and to find
      different strategies to overcome high platelet reactivity including clopidogrel dose
      adjustment or the choice of alternative agents. Quantification of platelet aggregation will
      be determined by vasodilator stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) assay.

        This prospective study will be conducted in two sites (Ziv Medical Center, Safed,
        department of neurology, and Galilee Medical Center, Nahariya, department of neurology) on
        300 patients from different ethnic backgrounds with an ischemic cerebrovascular event
        (ischemic stroke and TIA), treated with clopidrogel for secondary stroke prevention. The
        groups will consist of Jewish communities (Ashkenazi, Sephardi and Ethiopian) and Arab
        populations (Muslim, Christian and Druze).

        To be considered eligible to participate in this study, patients have to be able to provide
        signed and dated written informed consent or written assent from their relatives. Both
        genders aged 18 and above are eligible for this trial. Pregnant patients will be excluded.
