  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a pilot randomized control trial of a validated intervention, Mindfulness Based
      Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) adapted for pregnancy, developed to reduce risk for postpartum
      depression. This study examines emotion regulation as a potential mechanism of action, at
      both the behavioral and neurobiological level, that carries forward to the postpartum period.
      A secondary mechanism of action to be explored is cognitive control. This study will also
      consider other potential influences on treatment response and psychiatric outcomes, including
      perinatal stress and depressive symptoms. The study population is pregnant women age 21-45.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will involve an online screen of potentially eligible pregnant women. If
      participants are eligible after the online screen, they will be invited in for an in person
      assessment, including cognitive testing and a diagnostic interview, to determine eligibility.
      After the assessment, they will be informed of their eligibility status and, if applicable,
      randomized to Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) or treatment as usual (TAU).
      Participants in the MBCT group will complete 8 weekly, 2 hr group therapy sessions during
      pregnancy, as well as receive TAU. The TAU group will engage in regular care during pregnancy
      and be offered the option to attend one mindfulness psychoeducation session postpartum.
      Participants in the MBCT group will complete questionnaires prior to the 1st group session,
      after the 4th session, and after the 8th/final session. Participants in the TAU group will
      complete the same questionnaires at equivalent time points. All participants will come in for
      an in-person session at 34 weeks GA, during which they will complete questionnaires and a
      brief clinical interview. Participants will come in for an MRI scan session at 6 weeks
      postpartum. In addition to structural and functional MRI scanning, they will also complete
      questionnaires, a cognitive task, and brief psychiatric interview. At 6 months postpartum,
      participants will return for a visit, during which they will complete questionnaires,
      cognitive measures, and a clinical interview. This will be the final visit for women in the
      MBCT group. Women in the TAU group will complete a singe mindfulness psychoeducation session
      between 6 and 9 months postpartum; this must occur after their 6 month visit.

    <intervention_model_description>The study is a randomized, control trial with an intervention arm, Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) adapted for pregnant women (Dimidjian, Goodman, et al., 2016), and treatment as usual (TAU) arm. The study will be blinded to staff (except for the study coordinator(s) and interventionists), but participant blinding is not possible due to the nature of the intervention. Participants will be randomized using a stratified block design after initial eligibility determination. Randomization will be stratified based on current depressive symptoms and current stress levels.</intervention_model_description>
    <primary_purpose>Prevention</primary_purpose>
    <masking>Double (Investigator, Outcomes Assessor)</masking>
    <masking_description>Given the use of group therapy, participants and interventionists cannot be blinded to group assignment. The study is designed to minimize the extent to which study staff, aside from interventionists and the primary Study Coordinator(s), are aware of group assignment. The Study Coordinator(s) needs to know group assignment because they will inform participants of their group assignment and will be the main point of contact for participants throughout the study, as to reduce risk of participants revealing their group assignment to other study staff. Participants will be informed that only the Study Coordinator(s) and interventionists, if applicable, are aware of their group assignment. Therefore, in order to ensure the integrity of the research study, they should refrain from discussing their group assignment with other staff members.</masking_description>

    <description>All participants will receive routine prenatal care from an identified medical provider, which they have initiated on their own. They will be able to engage in any services recommended by their primary medical provider or that they voluntarily initiate. For ethical reasons, they are not prohibited from engaging in any type of therapeutic, complementary, or medication treatment (after enrollment). The TAU group will be offered a delayed treatment option, after the 6 month follow-up. This will be a 2 hour mindfulness psychoeducation session, offered between 6 and 9 months postpartum. Several core mindfulness concepts included in the full MBCT curriculum will be taught and participants will complete several brief mindfulness activities.</description>
