  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to advance the understanding of people who experience urinary
      and bladder problems. The investigators are interested in learning about people's experiences
      with urinary symptoms and how these symptoms will be managed. The investigators want to
      understand the important differences among people and what factors affect urinary and bladder
      problems. After all of the information is collected, the investigators will have a better
      understanding of how to improve the care and treatment for people who have urinary and
      bladder problems.

      This protocol is part of an overall effort to create a state-of-the-art resource for
      measuring patient-reported health for patients with lower urinary tract dysfunction (LUTD).
      The primary purpose of this resource, known as the LURN PRO Battery, is to comprehensively
      characterize the self-reported experiences of patients with LUTD for the purpose of enhancing
      efforts to characterize and explain important subtypes of patients with LUTD (phenotypes).
      Secondary purposes of the LURN PRO Battery, for which additional development work will be
      required, include developing better patient-reported endpoints for clinical trials,
      monitoring symptoms in the course of clinical care, and screening patients into important
      subgroups for purposes of tailored interventions.

      Incorporating methods the investigators have used successfully in prior measure validation
      work, the investigators propose to conduct a diary study in which patients record their
      symptoms at various time points - at the end of each day, or across multiple days. The
      investigators also ask them to complete self-report measures with different recall periods
      (i.e., 3-day, 7-day, and 30-day recall), and will determine how well each of these correspond
      to daily experiences recorded in more frequent assessments (i.e., end-of-day and 3-day
      patient bladder diaries). These data will help LURN investigators to determine the most
      appropriate reporting period for specific symptoms. This study can also help to identify
      causes of differences that exist between shorter and longer recall periods.
