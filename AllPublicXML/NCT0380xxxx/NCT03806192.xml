    <textblock>
      This trial studies the feasibility of delivering the Partners in Care Program to caregivers
      of patients with acute myeloid leukemia. Psychological counseling interventions, such as the
      Partners in Care Program, may help to improve caregivers' psychosocial functioning, marital
      adjustment in the context of the cancer, communication, and support skills to the patient.
