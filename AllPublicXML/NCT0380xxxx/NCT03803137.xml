  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bronchopulmonary cancer, with 39 000 new cases and 30 000 deaths per year, is a main issue in
      public health in France. It is the leading cause of cancer death in France. A lot of progress
      in medical care has been made, but surgery remains the most effective treatment, when it is
      still possible. The goal is to detect and manage the lung cancer as early as possible.
      Alongside screening strategies by annual thoracic scanner, new approaches with innovative
      technologies open up for cancer detection and therapeutic follow-up.

      The study of volatile organic compounds (VOC) detected in exhaled air or in sweat, is an
      innovative research area for respiratory diseases. The volatolomic analysis can be done
      either by the technique of the mass spectrometry which allows the identification of each VOC
      in the exhaled air or by the technique of electronic nose, simpler and faster, which provides
      an idea of the general profile of the VOC without identifying them. The VOC have shown their
      interest in some situations, such as diagnostic or prognostic tool in patients followed for
      thoracic tumorous pathology or bronchial or pulmonary vascular diseases.

      The composition of VOC in exhaled air and sweat is altered in patients with lung cancer. The
      VOC analysis and their variation could be used particularly in the follow-up of patients
      treated for lung cancer.

      The purpose of this clinical research is to identify the VOCs related to lung cancers by
      comparing the VOC profiles in exhaled air and in sweat from patients diagnosed with localized
      lung cancer before and after resection surgery.
