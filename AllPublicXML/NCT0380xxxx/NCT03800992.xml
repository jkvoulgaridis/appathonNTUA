  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      &quot;Bad news&quot; are defined as&quot;any information which adversely and seriously affects an
      individuals` view of future. Families of chronic ill children are exposed to a high stress
      load. This project is to investigate the stress burden directly after diagnosis of epilepsy
      in childhood and coping capabilities in the course of time and how quality of communication
      at the time of diagnosis effects stress perception and coping behaviour in the following 12
      months.

      Perceived/ experienced advisory skills of the physician will be assessed by parents and
      children (older than eleven) on the basis of SPIKES - a Six-Step Protocol for Delivering Bad
      News.

      The subjective perception regarding quality of dialogue in relationship to childrens and
      their parents quality of life and their coping strategies will be assessed.
