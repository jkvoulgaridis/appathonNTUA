      This study is a multi-center, single arm, non-interventional study to assess the safety and
      performance of NOVOCART® Basic and the clinical outcome of MAC with NOVOCART® Basic in
      patients treated for cartilage defects in the knee. In this study data will be collected
      retrospectively from patient files of adult and pediatric patients who had received an MAC
      with NOVOCART® Basic for cartilage defects in the knee according to medical practice. In
      addition, at the time when a patient consents to participate in the study, he/she will have
      to fill-out questionnaires on current symptoms and knee function, quality of life,
      satisfaction with treatment and subsequent surgical interventions on the target knee
      performed outside the study site, i.e. the duration of follow-up is not standardized. All
      clinical sites having treated more than 8 patients with NOVOCART® Basic between 2014 and 2017
      will be contacted for participation. Participating clinical sites will be asked to collect
      informed consent from their patients to document relevant data from their medical charts and
      to complete the questionnaires. Consenting patients will send the signed informed consent
      form(s) and the completed questionnaires back to the study site. The date of questionnaire
      completion is regarded the end of observation for an individual patient. For data
      documentation, a medical documentation specialist authorized by TETEC AG will be given access
      to the patient files, the informed consent forms, and the completed questionnaires. The
      relevant data will be entered directly into an electronic database by the medical
      documentation specialist. Only data from patients who have given informed consent to study
      participation will be documented. If available, post-MAC MRIs will be collected and reviewed
      by independent experts.

    <description>NOVOCART® Basic is a biphasic, collagen-based matrix to support the biological reconstruction of localized and full-thickness cartilage damages after treatment with bone marrow stimulation techniques (microfracture). The procedure is called matrix associated chondrogenesis (MAC). It is a single-step procedure.
NOVOCART® Basic is tailored to fit the prepared defect size and is inserted in the defect area after microfracture. The NOVOCART® Basic device component is fully resorbed over a period of a few months as new reparative cartilage tissue is generated and integrated with the surrounding host tissue.</description>

        knee are eligible for this study, provided that they have given their informed consent for
        data collection and the involved clinical site has agreed to participate.
