             have received first-line treatment);

          -  5. Subjects must have at least one measurable target lesion (lesion with longest
             diameter ≥10mm, or lymph node with short diameter ≥15mm) tested by CT or MRI according

             or sections prepared from tumor archived tissues or fresh tissues that meet the test
             criteria, and are willing to perform biopsy of tumor tissues for test of PD-L1 if
             needed. The archived tissue shall be a representative tumor specimen within three
