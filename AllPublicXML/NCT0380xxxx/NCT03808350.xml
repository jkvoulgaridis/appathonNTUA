  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study seeks to determine the effect of a quality improvement policy regarding allowing
      family members to remain in a patient's room during ICU procedures. The investigators
      hypothesized that our change in policy to invite family members to remain during procedures
      will improve patient &amp; family engagement and improve long term psychological outcomes after
      an ICU admission. The study also seeks to determine if inviting family members to remain in a
      patient's room during ICU procedures will not increase clinician stress.

      This is a research study about the effect of a quality improvement policy change regarding
      family presence at ICU procedures on family and patient engagement, psychological outcomes
      and stress levels in clinicians. In the study, ICU patients, their family members and ICU
      clinicians will be surveyed regarding these outcomes, with some surveys obtained prior to a
      policy change and a second set during a second time period after policy change. The patients
      and family members will be asked survey questions after the procedure and 3 months later.
      This study will also evaluate the change in clinician stress related to this policy change,
      and clinicians will also answer survey questions.
