  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gallbladder disease is one of the most common diseases of the gastrointestinal tract. Various
      studies have shown an association between gallstones and an alteration in the serum lipids.
      The objective of this study will be to compare serum lipid profile of gallstone patients with
      the controls.

      This prospective cross-sectional study will be conducted in the Surgical Department of the
      Services Institute of Medical Sciences. A total of 50 patients will beincluded in the study
      after screening through the inclusion criteria. A control group of 50 inpatients with no
      personal or family history of gallstones will be also recruited for comparison. Results will
      be expressed as mean with standard deviation. Students t- test will be used to compare the
      data between the patients and the control groups (p&lt;0.05 will be considered statistically
      significant). SPSS software, version 20 will be used for statistical analysis.
