  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Esophageal and gastric cancers are a considerable health burden. In the past 10 years the
      5-year survival for both cancers has doubled. This is due to a number of factors including
      advances in neo adjuvant and adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy. However, physical
      fitness significantly declines as a result of neo adjuvant an adjuvant therapy. From studies
      in other cancers it is known that peri operative training improves physical fitness, yet
      there is little research into its effects in those with upper gastrointestinal cancers. The
      aim of this study is to assess the effect of a pre-and post operative training program on
      patients with upper gastrointestinal cancers on their physical fitness and consequently their
      optimism, quality of life and post operative morbidity.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The comparator in this study will be standard oncological care. There patients will receive
      the exact same care as the intervention group patients but will receive no exercise training
      program.

      The primary goal of this multi-centre randomised controlled trial are to investigate the
      effects of peri-operative exercise training programmes on physical fitness, measured with a 6
      minute walk test, in patients undergoing a major curative upper-GI resection for either
      oesophageal or gastric cancer.

      The secondary aims will look at the effect of peri-operative exercise training on patients
      quality of life, optimism and well being, post operative morbidity, nutritional status and
      blood markers of inflammation.

    <time_frame>Baseline, one week after completion of neo adjuvant treatment, one week before surgery, six weeks after surgery, twelve weeks after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The primary goal of this multi-centre randomised controlled trial is to investigate the effects of peri-operative exercise training programmes on physical fitness, defined as the distance covered in metres and centimetres during a 6 minute walk test, in patients undergoing a major curative upper-GI resection for either oesophageal or gastric cancer. To complete the Six Minute Walk Test, no warm up is permitted and participants rest in a seated position for 10 minutes prior to the test beginning. Participants walk up and down a 20m course marked by cones for 6 minutes under instruction to cover as much ground as possible. The number of laps completed is recorded. A standard set of instructions as well as encouragement is used. After 6 minutes, the participant stops and the distance covered in the final partial lap as measured and total distance covered is calculated. Change from baseline to post treatment difference between groups.</description>
