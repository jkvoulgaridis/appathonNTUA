  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the influence of n3 PUFA supplementation on the rate of muscle
      atrophy in older women undergoing 1 week of unilateral limb immobilization. Assessments in
      skeletal muscle strength and skeletal muscle volume will also me made before, after and in
      recovery from immobilization.

    <textblock>
      Biological aging is associated with the loss of skeletal muscle mass and strength resulting
      in compromised metabolic function and mobility. Throughout life, individuals will also
      experience periods of reduced physical activity/muscle disuse that independently lower muscle
      mass and strength accelerating the aging process. More importantly, older adults (especially
      older women) that experience periods of muscle disuse are unable to recover muscle mass and
      strength. The losses in muscle mass with aging and disuse are underpinned by feeding-induced
      declines in rates of muscle protein synthesis. Thus, strategies to enhance muscle protein
      synthesis could have clinical implications for those who wish to maintain metabolic health
      and function during times of muscle disuse.

      Supplementation with n3 PUFA-enriched fish oil has been shown to potentiate rates of muscle
      protein synthesis in response to simulated feeding in both younger and older adults. Fish oil
      supplementation also has been efficacious in enhancing skeletal muscle strength during a
      period of resistance exercise training. A previous study from our group demonstrated that
      younger women supplementing with n3 PUFA-enriched fish oil attenuated declines in skeletal
      muscle mass and strength during 2 weeks of immobilization. However, no study has examined the
      impact of fish oil supplementation to enhance muscle protein synthesis and offset declines in
      muscle mass/strength during a period of immobilization in older women.
