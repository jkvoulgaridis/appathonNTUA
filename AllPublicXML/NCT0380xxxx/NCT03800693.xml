  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well giving oxaliplatin over 6 hours works in treating nerve
      damage in patients with gastrointestinal cancers. Oxaliplatin can cause side effects such as
      nerve damage that may delay or reduce the dose of oxaliplatin. Giving oxaliplatin over a
      longer period of time (6 hours) may prevent or delay the development of nerve damage, which
      may keep patients on standard doses of chemotherapy longer, without having to delay
      treatment.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To determine the effect of 2 versus 6-hour oxaliplatin infusion time on the difference in
      severity of sensory neuropathy as measured by patient reported outcome (PRO) scores on the
      European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) chemotherapy-induced
      peripheral neuropathy (CIPN-20) scale at the initiation of cycle 4.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Pharmacokinetic parameters of maximum concentration (Cmax), area under the curve (AUC),
      time of maximum concentration (tmax), clearance, and half life (t1/2) of platinum
      ultra-filtrate.

      II. CIPN-20 sensory score changes over the duration of therapy as measured by a cumulative
      area-under-the curve score.

      III. Clinical outcomes including duration of therapy, oxaliplatin dose reductions, delays in
      therapy, and overall dose intensity and delivery of oxaliplatin.

      IV. Relationship between oxaliplatin Cmax, patient-reported acute neurotoxicity, and chronic
      neurotoxicity by CIPN-20 scores.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.

      2-hour infusion group: Patients receive oxaliplatin intravenously (IV) and leucovorin IV over
      2 hours on day 1. Patients also receive a lower dose of fluorouracil IV over 2-4 minutes
      followed by a higher dose IV continuous over 4-6 hours on day 1. Courses repeat every 14 days
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      6-hour infusion group: Patients receive oxaliplatin IV over 6 hours on day 1. Patients also
      receive leucovorin and fluorouracil as in the 2-hour infusion group. Courses repeat every 14
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1, 3, 6, 12, and 18 months.

    <description>The EORTC-CIPN-20 sub-scales will be computed according to the standard scoring algorithm and then transformed to a 0 to 100 scale, where high scores mean less symptom burden. The primary outcome measure of difference in sensory scores of the two groups between baseline and the initiation of cycle 4 will be the driver of the analysis.</description>
