  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are performing a trial with goals to demonstrate the feasibility of imaging
      multiple myeloma (MM) patients with 64Cu-LLP2A-positron emission tomography (PET)/magnetic
      resonance (MR). The investigators suggest that 64Cu-LLP2A will allow for an accurate
      molecular imaging of MM lesions, which will have an important impact on early stage disease
      detection and in the long term on the initiation and choice of therapy in these patients.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Feasibility of imaging MM patients with 64Cu-LLP2A-PET/MR as measured by average organ activity concentration of 64Cu-LLP2A</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 30 hours after imaging</time_frame>
    <description>-Average organ activity concentration will be measured and decay corrected by utilizing regions of interest (ROIs) drawn around all organs visible on 64Cu-LLP2A images. Activity organ residence times will be calculated by numerical or analytical integration of the time-activity curves. Uptake/clearance functional fits of mono or bi-exponential functions will be performed and analytical integration, accounted for physical delay, will be performed. The calculated residence times will be used with the program OLINDA/EXM for 64Cu and using the adult human (male/femal) model to calculate the individual organ radiation dose, the whole-body dose, and the effective dose</description>

    <description>Overall PET image quality will be graded visually (using 4-point scale with 1 being the worst and poor quality, not acceptable for diagnostic interpretation and 4 being good image quality, similar to routine clinical studies).
The images will be assessed by independent observers (a nuclear medicine expert in evaluating PET images using novel radiotracers, and a MR radiologist expert in evaluating MR images
The images will then be correlated to MRI (and biopsy if available) to assess whether the lesions identified on 64Cu-LLP2A correspond to myeloma lesions</description>

It is expected that approximately 1-2 presentations at national meetings
Early phase I evaluation of 64Cu-LLP2A for imaging multiple myeloma will generate imaging, safety and dosimetry data from PET/CT and MR studies of 64Cu-LLP2A. Serum markers such as M-protein, plasma cell density and immunohistochemistry will be correlated with imaging, in order to understand the interaction of 64Cu-LLP2A with VLA-4 in vivo.
