  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nab-paclitaxel and carboplatin showed better treatment response compared with cremophor-based
      paclitaxel and carboplatin as first-line therapy in advanced non-small cell lung cancer,
      especially for squamous cell cancer. This study is conducted to evaluate the efficacy and
      safety of nab-paclitaxel, carboplatin and concurrent radiotherapy in patients with local
      advanced inoperable squamous cell lung cancer.

      This study was conducted to explore the efficacy and safety of concurrent concurrent
      nab-paclitaxel, carboplatin and thoracic radiotherapy in inoperable local advanced squamous
      cell lung cancer. Patients will be given nab-paclitaxel weekly at a dose of 40mg/m2, in
      combination with carboplatin (AUC 2) weekly during concurrent chemoradiotherapy. Thoracic
      radiation was administered at a dose of 60-66 Gy/30-33 fractions, both 3 dimensional
      conformal and intensity modulated radiation therapy are allowed.
