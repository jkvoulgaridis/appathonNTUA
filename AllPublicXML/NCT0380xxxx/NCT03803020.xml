  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Coronary chronic total occlusions (CTOs) are defined as an occluded coronary vessel with TIMI
      defined as an occluded coronary vessel with TIMI (Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction)
      grade flow 0 and an estimated duration of at least 3 months. They are frequently encountered
      in patients undergoing coronary angiography. The application of contemporary techniques and
      the use of advanced dedicated equipment lead to high procedural success and low adverse
      events rates in experienced centers. Fractional flow reserve (FFR) is a validated tool to
      assess physiological severity of coronary artery disease and have a prognostic role after
      percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). SPECT (Single-Photon Emission Computed Tomography)
      is the golden standard for detection of myocardial ischemia. Recanalization of a CTO leads to
      a number of anatomical and pathophysiological changes to the coronary circulation. These
      include anatomical and functional collateral vessels regression and significant lumen
      enlargement because of recovery of blood flow and restoration of vasomotor tone. The effect
      of PCI on CTO is unknown. The aim of this study was to assess the functional result of CTO
      PCI by measuring FFR and D SPECT before and immediately post-CTO PCI and at short-term
      follow-up.
