  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to examine whether multiple spaced sessions of intermittent theta-burst
      transcranial magnetic stimulation (iTBS) induce anti-depressant responses and reduce opiate
      cravings in adults with opiate use disorder (OUD). Additionally, we hope to identify whether
      the effectiveness of iTBS is related to changes in functional connectivity between particular
      brain areas.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study aims to investigate the effectiveness of aiTBS applied to either the
      L-DLPFC or the ACC for reducing SI in individuals with OUD and identify neural functional
      connectivity changes underlying treatment response. 30 individuals with OUD who endorse
      suicidal ideation will be recruited. The accelerated iTBS treatment will involve 10 daily
      sessions of iTBS. Stimulation will be delivered to either the ACC or the L-DLPFC for 5
      consecutive days. Suicidal ideation, depressive symptoms and opiate misuse will be measured
      before and after the 5-day stimulation course. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
      scans will also be carried out before and after stimulation to examine aiTBS-induced changes
      in neural functional connectivity. Changes in suicidal ideation, depressive symptoms and
      opiate misuse will be measured using both clinician-rated and self-report assessments.
