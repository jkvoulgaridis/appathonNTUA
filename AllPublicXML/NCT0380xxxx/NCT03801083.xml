  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2 study to evaluate the efficacy, using objective response rate, of a
      non-myeloablative lymphodepleting preparative regimen followed by infusion of autologous
      Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes (TIL) and high-dose aldesleukin in patients with locally
      advanced, recurrent, or metastatic biliary tract cancer. These are low-incidence cancers
      carry a poor prognosis. Participants will include patients with biliary tract cancers (BTC),
      including cholangiocarcinoma (both intrahepatic and extrahepatic) and gallbladder cancer, who
      are and are physically able to tolerate non-myeloablative chemotherapy and high-dose
      aldesleukin.

      This Phase 2 study will be conducted in conjunction with companion protocol (Cell Harvest and
      Preparation to Support Adoptive Cell Therapy Clinical Protocols and Pre-Clinical Studies) as
      described below:

      Cell Preparation:

      Patients with evaluable locally advanced, recurrent, or metastatic biliary tract cancers who
      have lesions that can be resected or biopsied with minimum morbidity will undergo resection
      or biopsy of tumor. Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes (TIL) will be obtained while enrolled on
      the companion protocol Cell Harvest and Preparation to Support Adoptive Cell Therapy Clinical
      Protocols and Pre-Clinical Studies. Separate tumor procurement(s) may be performed under the
      companion protocol to obtain TIL if initial tumor procurement(s) could not successfully
      generate TIL. The TIL will be grown and expanded for this trial according to standard
      operating procedures submitted in the IND. The TIL will be assessed for potency by
      interferon-gamma release.

      Treatment Phase:

      Once cells exceed the potency requirement and are projected to exceed the minimum number
      specified in the COA, the patient will be registered on this study and receive the lymphocyte
      depleting preparative regimen consisting of fludarabine and cyclophosphamide, followed by
      infusion of up to 2x1011 lymphocytes (minimum of 1x109 cells) and administration of high-dose
      intravenous aldesleukin. It is anticipated that TIL that meet the COA will not be achievable
      in approximately 20% of patients who undergo resection. These patients may undergo a second
      resection to grow TIL, if another suitable lesion exists. Approximately 6 weeks (+/- 2 weeks)
      after TIL administration, patients will undergo a complete tumor evaluation and evaluation of
      toxicity and immunologic parameters. Patients will receive one course of treatment. The start
      date of the course will be the start date of the chemotherapy; the end date will be the day
      of the first post-treatment evaluation. Patients may undergo a second treatment. Patients
      will receive no other experimental agents while on this protocol.

    <intervention_model_description>The Phase 2 study will follow the Simon's optimal two-stage design. Fifteen patients will be included in the first stage; if there are 1 or fewer patients responding to therapy the trial will be terminated. If at least 2 responses were observed, expansion into Stage 2 to a total of 47 patients will occur. If at least 6 patients respond to therapy, the study therapy would be considered to have met its primary study goal.</intervention_model_description>

             ampullary carcinoma).

          -  Patients with locally advanced disease should be unresectable by conventional surgical
             approaches.

          -  Patients with distant metastatic spread must be refractory to approved standard

          -  Patients with 3 or fewer brain metastases that are less than 1 cm in diameter and
             asymptomatic are eligible. Lesions that have been treated with stereotactic
             radiosurgery must be clinically stable for 1 month after treatment for the patient to
             be eligible. Patients with surgically resected brain metastases are eligible.

          -  Greater than or equal to 18 years of age and less than or equal to age 75

          -  Able to understand and sign the Informed Consent Document

               -  Seronegative for HIV antibody. (The experimental treatment being evaluated in
                  this protocol depends on an intact immune system. Patients who are HIV
                  seropositive can have decreased immune-competence and thus be less responsive to
                  the experimental treatment and more susceptible to its toxicities.)

               -  Seronegative for hepatitis B antigen, and seronegative for hepatitis C antibody.
                  If hepatitis C antibody test is positive, then patient must be tested for the
                  presence of antigen by RT-PCR and be HCV RNA negative.

          -  Women of child-bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test because of the
             potentially dangerous effects of the treatment on the fetus.

                  must have a total bilirubin less than 3.0 mg/dl.

          -  More than four weeks must have elapsed since any prior systemic therapy at the time
             the patient receives the preparative regimen, and patients' toxicities must have
             recovered to a clinically manageable level (except for toxicities such as alopecia or
             vitiligo). (Note: Patients may have undergone minor surgical procedures within the
             past 3 weeks, as long as all toxicities have recovered to grade 1 or less)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Women of child-bearing potential who are pregnant or breastfeeding because of the
             potentially dangerous effects of the treatment on the fetus or infant.

             Disease).

          -  Concurrent opportunistic infections (The experimental treatment being evaluated in
             this protocol depends on an intact immune system. Patients who have decreased immune
             competence may be less responsive to the experimental treatment and more susceptible
             to its toxicities).

          -  Active systemic infections (e.g.: requiring anti-infective treatment), coagulation
             disorders or any other active major medical illnesses.
