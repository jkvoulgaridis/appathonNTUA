  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Idiopathic bronchiectasis may be a manifestation of genetic diseases such as cystic fibrosis,
      primary ciliary dyskinesia, etc. Diagnosis of these rare genetic diseases is crucial not only
      because some of the rare diseases developed already effective treatment options, but also the
      detection of syndrome enables us to detect other organ damages before the deterioration of
      them.

      Several diagnostic tools have been developed; however, the genetic panel has limited
      screening efficacy due to the genetic heterogeneity of diseases. Even more, especially in
      Korea, the incidence of idiopathic bronchiectasis caused by the genetic disease is rare, most
      clinics have limited to assess specialized diagnostic tools such as the specialized genetic
      panels, sweat chloride test, and the electromagnetic detection tools for ciliary movement.

      Whole genome sequencing may be an excellent solution to identify the neglected genetic
      diseases causing idiopathic bronchiectasis and explore the heterogeneity of disease-causing
      variants in Korean patients.
