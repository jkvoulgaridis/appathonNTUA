  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is a common genetic disorder, characterized by the
      formation of cysts in the kidneys, causing gradual renal function-loss. Previous studies have
      shown that, reduced glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and renal plasma flow (RPF) play a role
      in the progression of renal disease in ADPKD. Tolvaptan is a vasopressin 2 antagonist, which
      seems to reduce the growth of total kidney volume (TKV) and the decline in e-GFR in ADPKD.
      The mechanism is not fully understood and could, at least partly, be caused by stimulation of
      the renal blood flow. The purpose of this trial is to investigate if tolvaptan´s improve
      renal blood flow and glomerular filtration in ADPKD, in a randomized, cross-over,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled study.

      The aim is to measure the acute effects of tolvaptan on:

        1. Renal hemodynamics (RPF, GFR, filtration fraction ((FF)) and renovascular resistance
           ((RVR))

        2. Blood pressure (central blood pressure ((cBP)) and brachial blood pressure bBP)

        3. Several vasoactive hormones (plasma renin ((PRC)), plasma angiotensin II ((p-Ang-II)),
           plasma aldosterone ((p-Aldo)), plasma vasopressin ((p-AVP))

      in patients with ADPKD.
