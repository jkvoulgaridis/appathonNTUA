      To explore the effects of combined traditional Chinese and Western medicine( Chinese

      Our research hypothesis：1. Medically assisted Acupuncture in schizophrenia can improve
      negative symptoms；2. Drug assisted Acupuncture Therapy has better cognitive function in
      schizophrenic patients than single drug；3. Schizophrene with acupuncture have fewer and
      lighter adverse reactions。This study was carried out only in Shanghai Mental Health Center.
      It was a parallel randomized study.Schizophrene with negative symptoms were treated with
      atypical antipsychotic drug amisulpride, but still remained negative symptoms. Using the
      mature Chinese medicine therapy acupuncture auxiliary treatment, using the more reliable
      clinical evaluation method (the grader blind method: The raters were not sure which patients
      were the study group or the control group), compared with the single drug treatment, To
      observe the changes of negative symptoms and cognitive function, and the incidence of adverse
      reactions of acupuncture therapy, to explore the &quot;new&quot; auxiliary means for the treatment of
      negative symptoms, to guide clinical individualization and accurate medical treatment.
