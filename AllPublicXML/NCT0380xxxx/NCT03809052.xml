  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, first-in-human study in
      which the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of orally administered GB1211 will be
      evaluated in healthy adult subjects and adult subjects with indication of suspected
      Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and liver fibrosis.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to obtain safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic data when GB1211 is
      administered orally as single doses and as multiple doses to healthy subjects. In addition, a
      third part has been included to obtain safety and tolerability data when GB1211 is
      administered orally as multiple doses to subjects with suspected Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis
      (NASH) and liver fibrosis. The study will consist of 3 parts: A single ascending dose (SAD)
      phase (Part A) enrolling a total of 5 cohorts of healthy subjects; a multiple ascending dose
      (MAD) phase (Part B) enrolling 2 cohorts of healthy subjects; and a Part C MAD phase,
      enrolling 1 cohort of subjects with suspected NASH and liver fibrosis. One cohort of Part A
      will receive GB1211 under both fasted and fed conditions to investigate the effect of food.
