  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Urinary tract infection (UTI) is the most common serious bacterial infection among infants.
      Suprapubic aspiration and bladder catheterization are considered as the gold standard by the
      American Academy of Pediatrics for the diagnosis, yet it is painful and invasive. In
      contrast, the bladder stimulation technique has been shown to be a quick and non-invasive
      approach to collect urine in young infants. Actually, the investigators don't have data on
      bacterial contamination rates for clean-catch midstream urine collections using this
      technique

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Urinary tract infection (UTI) is common in infants and needs to be diagnosed quickly. The
      risk for urinary tract infection before the age of 2 years is about 1-4% in boys and 3-8% in
      girls. A delay in diagnosis exposes to severe complications. In infants, the symptoms are not
      specific. A good urinalysis quality is therefore necessary for the diagnosis of UTI.
      Different techniques exist to collect urine samples in these children who do not control
      their urination yet: supra pubic aspiration, catheterization, urine collection bag and clean
      catch urine. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends supra pubic aspiration (1-9
      % bacterial contamination) and urinary catheterization (8-14 % contamination) for collecting
      urine but these techniques are invasive and painful. The sterile bag is a non-invasive method
      of urine collection, with a high bacterial contamination rates (26-62%) leading to
      unnecessary antibiotic treatment. Finally, clean catch urine is an accepted urine sample to
      diagnose UTI according to the recommendations (13-27 % of bacterial contamination) but this
      method is only possible for potty-trained children. Recent studies (Herreros et al, Altuntas
      et al, Tran et al.) have shown that bladder stimulation, which consists of pubic tapping and
      lumbar massage, would be a new, effective, non-invasive and safe method of collecting urine
      in infants.

      Bladder stimulation may be performed by a nurse or a physician. The steps of the bladder
      stimulation technique are as follows: (a) cleaning the genital area with warm water and soap
      b) bladder stimulation technique, requires the presence of 3 people: infants will be held
      under their armpits by a parent over the bed, with legs dangling in males and hips flexed in
      females. The nurse or technician will then alternate between bladder stimulation maneuvers:
      gentle tapping in the suprapubic area at a frequency of 100 taps per minute for 30 seconds
      followed by lumbar paravertebral massage maneuvers for 30 seconds. These two stimulation
      maneuvers will be repeated until micturition begins, or for a maximum of of 3 minutes.

      However, the investigators do not have data on the bacterial contamination rate for urine
      sample using this new technique. the investigators hypothesize that the bladder stimulation
      is a technique for obtaining urine with a contamination rate equivalent to those obtained by
      bladder catheterization, in the diagnosis of febrile urinary tract infection in infants under
      6 months of age.
