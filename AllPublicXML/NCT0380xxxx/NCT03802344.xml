  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial is a randomized, investigator-blind, multicentre, vehicle- and
      comparator-controlled, parallel-group trial with the purpose of evaluating the efficacy,
      safety and convenience of the MC2-01 cream.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The MC2-01 Cream is designed for optimal patient satisfaction - it quickly absorbs into the
      skin leaving it nicely moisturized allowing patients to move on in daily routines. In this
      trial, the MC2-01 cream will be compared to a marketed product CAL/BDP combination and
      vehicle. The purpose of the trial is to compare the clinical efficacy, safety, and
      convenience of this cream to the marketed product. The trial will include a 8-week treatment
      period.

    <measure>Physicians Global Assessment (PGA)</measure>
    <time_frame>8 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>PGA measures the investigator's impression of the disease by assessing the psoriasis lesions on the subject's skin and rating it, using a defined, 5-point, static scale (0 = clear, 1 = almost clear, 2 = mild, 3 = moderate or 4 = severe). Two individual assessments will be made for the body and the scalp. The PGA will represent the average lesion severity at the time of the evaluation</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Psoriasis Treatment Convenience Scale (PTCS)</measure>
    <time_frame>8 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>PTCS measures the impact and convenience of the treatment. The scale consists of 6 disease-specific questions, witch individually will be rated on a 1-10 points scale where a score of 1 represents the lowest satisfactory response with the treatment and 10 represents the highest satisfactory response. All questions are related to the functionality of the treatment (how easy it is to use and how the skin feels upon use)</description>
