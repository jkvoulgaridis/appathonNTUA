        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  A signed and dated informed consent document indicating that the patient (or a legally

             following stroke risk factors: prior stoke or transient ischaemic attack; age &gt;75;
             hypertension; diabetes mellitus; symptomatic heart failure (NYHA class &gt;II); or for
             prevention of venous thromboembolic events (VTE) in adult patients who have undergone
             elective hip or knee replacement surgery.

          -  Subjects who are willing and able to comply with all scheduled visits.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have received apixaban in a clinical trial.
