    <textblock>
      Recent neuroimaging literature on neuropathy suggests that chronic pain is characterized by
      learning-related and memory-related plastic changes of the central nervous system (CNS) with
      concomitant maladaptive changes in body perception. In particular, it is well accepted that
      learning-induced functional and structural brain changes involve, in addition to sensorimotor
      cortex, also limbic and frontal areas that mediate the transition from acute to chronic pain,
      resulting in pathological processing of body image, impaired multisensory integration and
      faulty feedback from various interoceptive processes. Interestingly, these alterations share
      many similarities with brain changes in emotional disorders and the specificity for pain
      needs to be determined. Moreover, the diagnosis and management of neuropathic pain syndromes
      remains a major clinical challenge, and this failure is partly attributed to our inability to
      identify functional brain changes that not only contribute to these syndromes, but also
      expose the patient to psychological burden that might lead to drug abuse. Although opioids
      are currently used frequently as first line therapy to alleviate pain caused by the various
      forms of neuropathies, recent reports indicate that long-term opioid therapy does not improve
      functional status but rather is associated with a higher risk of depression as well as
      subsequent opioid dependency and overdose. Thus, in order to improve therapeutic
      interventions in this patient group, it is imperative to develop a mechanistic model of
      central processes that could both explain and predict longitudinal changes associated with
      neuropathic pain syndromes. The identification of the correct sources of pain sensation (i.e.
      the contribution of central rather than peripheral factors to pain chronicity) is of
      paramount importance since the clinical course and patient management is likely to differ
      depending on the exact underlying cause.

      The goal is to relate non-invasive brain imaging data to clinical parameters in order to
      develop a mechanistic model of CNS adaptive processes that are produced by a patient-specific
      disease state. The investigators believe that such a model will have significant predictive
      value and might provide added value for subsequent patient management. To achieve the stated
      objectives, the following Specific Aim will be tested:

      Aim 1. To assess regional brain changes in patients with polyneuropathies associated with a
      mild thermal pain challenge and to relate these changes to clinical measures of neuropathy.

      Hypothesis 1A. Regional changes in brain glucose metabolism (as measured using FDG PET/CT
      imaging) associated with thermal pain will differ between patients with polyneuropathy and a
      group of age-matched controls. Specifically, patients with neuropathy will show a
      significantly higher increase in glucose metabolism in the medial pain system (affective
      dimension - brainstem, amygdala, insula) following thermal pain as compared to the control
      group, indicating increased sensitivity of the interoceptive neural control system for
      peripheral pain stimulation in patients.

      Hypothesis 1B. In patients with neuropathy, regional changes in brain glucose metabolism
      associated with thermal pain in the medial pain system (affective dimension - brainstem,
      amygdala, insula) will be inversely related to clinical measures of neuropathic disease state
      (as measured using quantitative sensory testing, nerve conduction study and standardized pain
      scale assessment). In contrast, glucose metabolic changes in the lateral pain system
      (discriminatory dimension - thalamus, area S1) will be directly related to clinical measures.
      The extent of changes in the medial versus lateral system will also be correlated with the
      types of polyneuropathies, including idiopathic painful sensory neuropathy, chronic
      inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) and Charcot-Marie-Tooth type-1A (CMT1A, the
      most common type of inherited peripheral nerve disease).

      Hypothesis 1C. The increase in functional connectivity (as assessed using fMRI following an
      oscillatory thermal pain paradigm) will differ between neuropathic patients and controls.
      Specifically, functional connectivity between the medial pain system (brainstem, amygdala,
      insula) and the cognitive pain system (VLPFC and FP) will be significantly higher in the
      patient group as compared to the controls, indicating increased inhibition of the
      interoceptive brain network by the executive control system. Moreover, functional
      connectivity between the medial and cognitive pain systems will be directly related with
      clinical measures.

    <description>To apply a sensory challenge that can be applied over longer periods required for PET imaging and that is also compatible with high magnetic fields during MRI scanning, we will use a well-established thermal challenge of the lower extremity. To apply mildly painful heat to the patient, the right leg (from the foot up to the knee) will be wrapped in a blanket that incorporates a network of small-diameter plastic tubing through which hot water (45 - 55 oC) is circulated from a temperature-controlled reservoir.</description>
