  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will include patients suffering from chronic myeloid leukemia (CP-CML), who were
      treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI, a substance that blocks the action of enzymes)
      in a previous therapy but which has not been effective. Patients will be treated with
      Ponatinib 30 mg in in this study. The aim of the study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy
      of Ponatinib as a second line treatment in patients failing or not tolerating first line
      therapy with any other approved TKIs. It is expected that Ponatinib, due to its efficacy, may
      be more effective as second line therapy than other approved TKIs and lead to improved
      overall survival. The effect will be determined by the molecular response rate (MMR) as the
      primary objective after 12 months of treatment. The safety of the drug will be evaluated on
      the basis if routine medical and laboratory examinations.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite significant progress in the treatment of patients with chronic phase CML, there is
      still need to further optimize therapy to reach the goal of disease eradication for almost
      all patients. In case of imatinib failure, dasatinib and nilotinib are effective treatment
      options after an individualized treatment selection. Although MMR rates of around 30% after 2
      years of therapy are a significant achievement, options that may improve response rates in
      depth are still desirable. Ponatinib is a third generation TKI with very high anti-clonal
      activity in all CML phases. Moreover, it also eradicates most of the known and problematic
      mutations and only very few (compound) mutations may induce ponatinib-resistance.

      Based on its favourable target spectrum, it is expected that Ponatinib may be more effective
      than 2nd line dasatinib or nilotinib in achieving early (i.e., at 6 months) cytogenetic and
      molecular responses in patients after inappropriate response to imatinib, and more effective
      as 2nd line treatment after failure of initial treatment with dasatinib or nilotinib than a
      cross-over between the 2nd generation TKIs. The basic hypothesis underlying therapeutic
      programs in CML is to be able to achieve meaningful and long-lasting suppression of the
      Philadelphia chromosome and breakpoint cluster region-abelson fusion gen (BCR-ABL). Complete
      cytogenetic responses have been associated with improved survival in CML, while major
      molecular responses are associated with improved event-free survival.
