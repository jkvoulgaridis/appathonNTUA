    <textblock>
      This is a single-blind randomized controlled trial, aiming to evaluate the effects of vaginal
      seeding on body mass index as well as allergy risk for cesarean-delivered infants. It will be
      conducted in Liuyang city of China, and the targeted sample size is 106. All the eligible
      pregnant women will be randomly assigned to either the intervention or control group, and
      their babies of the participants will be followed up to 24 months of age.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Many studies have suggested that caesarean-delivered children are at higher risks of
      developing metabolic and allergic diseases like obesity and asthma, possibly because newborns
      born by caesarean section were lack of exposure to maternal vaginal flora. It is needed to
      explore a simple, convenient, and safe intervention strategy to reduce caesarean-related
      risks. In a recent non-randomized study, the authors found that exposure of
      caesarean-delivered newborns to maternal vaginal fluid at birth (i.e., vaginal seeding) could
      partially restore the microbiota of them at 30 days after births, but the long-term health
      consequences of restoring the microbiota of caesarean-delivered infants remain unclear.

      In this randomized study, the investigators aim to examine whether the changes in newborns'
      microbiota will persist to 24 month of age, and whether vaginal seeding will have any effects
      on body mass index and allergy risk from birth to 24 months of age. the investigators will
      enroll a total of 106 pregnant women, and the participants' infants will be followed up at 0
      (before hospital discharge), 6, 12, 18 and 24 months. At each follow-up visit, a
      questionnaire survey including information on feeding, medication, and allergic status will
      be conducted, infants' height and weight will be measured, and feces will be collected. At
      18-month-old visit, infants' venous blood will be also collected for the assay of
      multiallergen. The primary outcomes were body mass index and allergy risk index. The
      secondary outcomes included the microbiota profile, allergic symptoms and diseases,
      overweight/obesity, and adverse effects.

    <description>Swabbing infants born by C-section with a gauze incubated in the maternal vagina about an hour before the C-section. The gauze will be extracted prior to the C-section, kept in a sterile container in an incubator (37 ℃), and taken out from the incubator immediately before the swabbing. The infant will be swabbed with the gauze, starting from the lips, followed by the face, thorax, arms, legs, genitals and anal region, and finally the back. The swabbing will take around 15-20 seconds.</description>
