  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to gain insight in patients' experiences regarding do not
      resuscitate conversations and decisions. A multicentre flash mob investigation will be
      conducted in which data will be obtained over the course of two weeks using electronic
      questionnaires that patients will fill out. General demographic data and a brief quality of
      life assessment (EQ-5D) will be collected. Whether a DNR converstation has taken place will
      be noted, along with patients' experiences with this conversation. Lastly the patient will be
      asked about his/her expectations of survival after cardiopulmonary resuscitation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: In-hospital cardiac arrest, associated with a survival to discharge of 15.0%,
      results in a good neurologic discharge in 9.1% - 30.0% of patients. Therefore it is
      recommended to engage in advanced care planning with patients, to discuss do-not-resuscitate
      (DNR) directives. In current knowledge, there are no published data about the prevalence of
      these DNR orders and associated factors in hospitalized patients in the Netherlands. Also,
      the conversation about DNR are sometimes perceived as awkward or untimely by patients.

      Objective: The primary goal is to estimate prevalence DNR order in Dutch hospitals. A
      secondary goal is to assess what geographical, patient and disease factors are associated
      with DNR status. Furthermore patient experience in the conversation leading to DNR-orders is
      of interest.

      Study design: A cross-sectional point prevalence study, in 10 participating hospitals of the
      ROUTiNE project.

      Study population: Patients who plan to be admitted for more than 24 hours to the
      participating hospitals, aged 18 or older, who are responsive and conscious.

      Main study parameters/endpoints: The prevalence of DNR orders, expressed as number per 1000
      beds.

      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group
      relatedness: There is no risk. Only one ten-minute interview per participant. Therefore the
      benefit of this study (as described in the objectives) outweigh the potential risks.

    <description>EQ-5D (Euroqol): EQ-5D-5L is a standardized, participant-rated instrument for use as a measure of health outcomes. The EQ 5D-5L includes 2 components: the EQ-5D-5L descriptive system and the visual analogue scale (VAS). The EQ-5D-5L descriptive system provides a profile of the participant's health state in 5 dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression). For each dimension, the participant is instructed to choose one of 5 levels that best describes their health on that day: &quot;no problem&quot; (1), &quot;slight&quot; (2), &quot;moderate&quot; (3), &quot;severe&quot; (4), or &quot;unable/extreme&quot; (5). The VAS is the participant's rating of their health on a scale of 0 &quot;worst health you can imagine&quot; to 100 &quot;best health you can imagine&quot;.</description>

        The base population consists of all adult patients admitted to all the participating
        hospitals. These consist of one academic centre and 10 general hospitals. The sampling is
        based on non-probability as it does not represent the entire population (i.e. inhabitants
        of the Netherlands), however it is based on probability sampling when the population is
        solely patients admitted to hospital.
