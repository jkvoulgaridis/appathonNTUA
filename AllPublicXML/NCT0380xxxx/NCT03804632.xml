      A prospective observational multi center study to assess the level of asthma control at
      Primary Care Setting; government health clinics (Klinik Kesihatan) in Malaysia. The specific
      objective of the study is to assess, in real-life clinical practice in Malaysia, the level of
      asthma control and the potential risk factors for uncontrolled disease in asthma patients
      treated at government health clinics.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite the availability of GINA global guideline on asthma management which is widely
      referred by health care providers in Malaysia, the control of asthma is still a critical
      challenge. According to National Health and Morbidity Survey 2011, the prevalence of asthma
      in Malaysia is at 6.3%. Based on self-rated health status, 5.5% of patients were reported to
      be in good health whereas 9.9% reported poor health status although medications such as
      inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and long-acting beta agonists (LABA) are widely available for
      effective asthma management. There is limited data to assess the level of asthma control at
      the Primary Care Setting in Malaysia which includes current clinical manifestation and future
      risk of exacerbation. Given the lack of data on Asthma control level, the awareness on the
      current disease control level will assist to properly characterise the patients based on GINA
      control level thus leading to appropriate diagnosis and treatment. The specific objective of
      the study is to assess, in real-life clinical practice in Malaysia, the level of GINA-defined
      asthma control and the potential risk factors for uncontrolled disease in asthma patients.

    <description>Asthma control is evaluated by patients' self-completion of the Asthma Control Test (ACT). The ACT is a reliable, valid tool that helps physicians identify patients with uncontrolled asthma in a clinical setting. The questionnaire assesses the frequency of asthma symptoms and patients' own perception of asthma control during the previous 4 weeks. Based on the sum of scores, complete asthma control (25 points), well-controlled asthma (20-24 points) or no asthma control (â‰¤19 points) is revealed.</description>

    <measure>Adherence level in patients with inhalers</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 8 months</time_frame>
    <description>Adherence level measured by Malaysia Medication Adherence Scale (MALMAS)
The first item of the MALMAS has five responses: (1) All the time, (2) Often, (3) Sometimes, (4) Rarely and (5) Never.
The remaining seven items have a dichotomous response of &quot;Yes&quot; or &quot;No&quot;. The responses in the MALMAS were scored based on the MMAS-8 where the total score ranged from 0 to 8. Both instruments categorized medication adherence based on the total scores obtained: low adherence (total score&lt;6), medium adherence (6 to &lt; 8) and high adherence (total score = 8)</description>
