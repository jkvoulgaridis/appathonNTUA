  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Overactive bladder syndrome (OAB) has a great negative impact on health-related quality of
      life. In literatures, few studies reported the comparisons of health related quality of life
      between OAB-wet and OAB-dry female patients. Thus, our aim is to compare the clinical
      variables and health-related quality of life between OAB-wet and OAB-dry women.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Between July 2009 and January 2018, all women with OAB visiting a medical center for
      evaluation were reviewed. The classification of OAB-wet or OAB-dry is based on the record of
      the three-day bladder diary of each patient. The diagnosis of OAB in each patient was based
      on the presence of at least one episode of urgency in her three-day bladder diary and with
      the absence of stress urinary incontinence. The presence of at least one episode of urgency
      associated incontinence was defined to be OAB-wet, otherwise, OAB-dry. Besides, only female
      OAB patients with available King's Health Questionnaire (KHQ) data were reviewed in this
      study.
