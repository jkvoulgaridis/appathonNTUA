  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Induction of labor is a frequently planned obstetric procedure. Induction for women with an
      unfavorable cervix (bishop score &lt;6) increases the risk of cesarean section. This risk may be
      reduced by ripening or softening the cervix before the induction of labor. This protocol
      outlines a randomized trial of 200 women evaluating the placement and use of Cervidil to the
      post vaginal fornix to soften the cervix in preparation for induction.

      This trial is looking at inpatient vs outpatient pre-induction cervical ripening using
      Cervidil and the effects on (1) maternal and newborn outcomes including time of admission to
      delivery, (2) system healthcare cost, (3) cost to patient, and (4) patient satisfaction.

      The investigators hypothesize when compared to patients admitted to the hospital for cervical
      ripening:

        1. From the time of admission, patients in the outpatient cervical ripening arm will
           progress to complete cervical dilation in less time.

        2. The total overall cost of care for the encounter will be reduced for the group in the
           outpatient cervical ripening arm.

        3. Patients in the outpatient cervical ripening arm will have more overall satisfaction.
