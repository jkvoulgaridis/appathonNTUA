  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Antibody mediated rejection (AMR) post transplant contributes to poor long term outcomes
      after lung transplantation. Additionally, high antibodies detected pre transplant in
      candidates limit donor availability for lung transplant. This proposal would include
      belatacept in a multi-therapy regimen. Open label study with two patient cohorts for safety
      and efficacy of belatacept in a multi-modal protocol. The two patient cohorts are an AMR
      post-transplant cohort and pre-transplant desensitization cohort. A total of 10 patients will
      be enrolled.The primary objection is drug tolerability and secondary objectives are antibody
      measurements and allograft function.

      Antibody mediated rejection (AMR) post transplant contributes to poor long term outcomes
      after lung transplantation. Additionally, high antibodies detected pre transplant in
      candidates limit donor availability for lung transplant. Multimodal therapies with rituximab,
      intravenous immunoglobulin, plasmapheresis and proteasome inhibitors have not significantly
      altered the antibodies in these patients. Belatacept targets the T and B cell interaction
      such that it represents a novel therapeutic strategy. This proposal would include belatacept
      in a multi-therapy regimen.

      This is an open label study with two patient cohorts for safety and efficacy of belatacept in
      a multi-modal protocol. The two patient cohorts are an AMR post-transplant cohort and
      pre-transplant desensitization cohort. A total of 10 patients will be enrolled.The primary
      objection is drug tolerability and secondary objectives are antibody measurements and
      allograft function.
