  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background and purpose: Spasticity, a common impairment after stroke, has a profound negative
      impact on patients' functional activities. Botulinum toxin A (BoNT-A) injection is effective
      in reducing spasticity. However, the optimal training program post BoNT-A injection remains
      uncertain. Constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT) is the most investigated intervention
      with promising effects for improving upper extremity (UE) function and increasing use
      frequency of the affected limb in ADL. The CIMT has strict inclusion criteria, which might
      not be suitable for a majority of patients who have moderate to severe spasticity. Therefore
      the aims of this study are to determine the clinical and kinematic benefits and compare the
      effect of Robotic mCIMT with conventional upper extremity rehabilitation training in patient
      with spastic hemiplegia post BoNT-A injection.

      Methods: Investigators conducted a power analysis based on the findings of previous research.
      Investigators took Wolf Motor Function Test -Functional Ability Scale into account, with an
      overall effect size of 0.79, a power set at 0.80, and a two-sided type I error of 0.05. The
      sample size calculation resulted in 27 participants per group, allowing for a 20% dropout
      rate, total 64 patients will be recruited. Those patients will receive BoNT-A injection and
      then be randomly assigned to either Robotic mCIMT group (1 hour unilateral robotic therapy,
      followed by 30 minutes of functional practice of affected UE using shaping technique, 3/week
      for 8 weeks and restraint of the unaffected limb at home for 2 hrs per day ) or control group
      (conventional upper extremity rehabilitation training 1.5 hours per session, 3/week for 8
      weeks and home exercise 2 hrs per day).

      Body function and structures outcome measures, such as Fugl-Meyer Assessment, Actigraph ;
      activity and participation measures, such as Wolf Motor Function Test, Motor Activity Log,
      will be assessed before, after intervention, and 3 months post-intervention. Investigators
      will also monitor the kinematic data of InMotion 3.0 robot across the whole course of Robotic
      mCIMT to see how the Robotic mCIMT following BoNT-A injection impacts motor learning process
      of the participants.

      Analysis: To evaluate the treatment effects of the outcome measures, 2 groups (Robotic mCIMT
      or control) * 3 times (before intervention, after intervention, and 3 months after
      intervention) repeated-measure ANOVA will be used.

      Conclusion: This study will be the first study to compare the Robotic mCIMT and conventional
      upper extremity rehabilitation training post BoNT-A injection. The results will provide
      clinicians with the appropriate program post BoNT-A injection to improve upper limb functions
      for patients with hemiplegic spastic stroke.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline at 1.5 months</time_frame>
    <description>The upper-extremity (UE) subscale of the FMA will be used to assess neuromusculoskeletal and movement related functions. It consists of 33 upper extremity items for the reflexes and movement of shoulder, elbow, forearm, wrist, hand, and coordination/speed. They are scored on a 3-point ordinal scale (0-cannot perform, 1-performs partially, 2-performs fully)(Fugl Meyer et al., 1975). Higher score indicates better motor function of UE, and the maximum score is 66. Satisfactory psychometric properties of the FMA have been demonstrated(Platz et al., 2005)</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Modified Ashworth Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline at 1.5 months</time_frame>
    <description>Spasticity of skeletal muscle in upper extremity will be evaluated by using the MAS scale (Bohannon &amp; Smith, 1987).It uses a 6-point scale to score the average resistance to passive movement for each join with higher score indicating higher spasticity. The MAS has shown good reliability and validity (Pandyan et al., 1999).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Actigraph</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline at 1.5 months</time_frame>
    <description>The amount of the impaired arm movement will be assessed by the activity monitors (i.e. accelerometers)(Schasfort, Busmann, Martens, &amp; Stam, 2006; Uswatte, Giuliani, et al., 2006; Uswatte et al., 2000). Accelerometers, objectively recording the amount of activity in free-living conditions and estimating energy expenditure, have been applied to measure the amount of affected arm use over time. In addition, accelerometers were also used to provide a measure of sleep latency and efficiency in this project. The participants were required to comply with wearing the accelerometer on each arm for 3 consecutive days. The accelerometers used in this project will be wireless plastic units about the size and weight of a large wrist watch. The participants will wear them proximal to the wrist on terrycloth bands. The compliance of wearing accelerometers was approximately 76% of waking time (Schasfort et al., 2006).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline at 1.5 months</time_frame>
    <description>The WMFT is a quantitative measure of upper extremity motor ability through timed and functional tasks (Uswatte, Taub, Stuss, Winocur, &amp; Robertson, 1999). The WMFT includes 17 tasks (15 function-based and 2 strength-based). Performances were timed and rated by using a 6-point ordinal scale. The WMFT has good interrater reliability and criterion validity in patients with UE hemiparesis (D. M. Morris, Uswatte, Crago, Cook, &amp; Taub, 2001) .</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Motor Activity Log (MAL)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline at 1.5 months</time_frame>
    <description>The MAL is a semi-structured interview to rate how well [quality of movement scale (QOM)] and how much [amount of use scale (AOU)] they use their affected upper extremity in 30 daily activities using a 6-point scale (Uswatte, Taub, Morris, Light, &amp; Thompson, 2006). Higher scores represent better performance. The MAL has established reliability, validity, and responsiveness in patients with stroke (Uswatte, Taub, et al., 2006; Uswatte et al., 2005; Van der Lee, Beckerman, Knol, De Vet, &amp; Bouter, 2004) . The MAL will be used to measure daily use of the affected upper limb in daily life in this project.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Nottingham Extended Activities of Daily Living Scale (NEADL)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline at 1.5 months</time_frame>
    <description>The NEADL is a measure of the requirement for help in performing instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) for patients with stroke(Nouri &amp; Lincoln, 1987). The NEADL has 22 items divided into 4 areas of daily life: mobility, kitchen, domestic, and leisure activities. Participants need to choose the level of the independence (not at all, with help, on your own with difficulty, on your own). The reliability, validity, and responsiveness of the NEADL have well-established in patients with stroke.(Gladman, Lincoln, &amp; Adams, 1993; Gompertz, Pound, &amp; Ebrahim, 1994; Nouri &amp; Lincoln, 1987).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Goal attainment scale (GAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline at 1.5 months</time_frame>
    <description>The GAS is a useful measure of participants' individual goals that could be achieved in the course of intervention(Turner-Stokes, 2009). In the first session, the therapist will discuss with the participants and their families to define the goals. Each goal will be rated on a 5-point scale ranging from -2 to +2 in the last session. The higher score represents better performance. The GAS enables the data to be placed on a quantitative measurement scale and can be helpful for qualitative interpretation (Turner-Stokes, 2009). Evidence of validity and responsiveness for the GAS was reported in previous studies(Rockwood, Stolee, &amp; FoxP, 1993).</description>

    <description>i.Robotic repetitive task-specific training followed by task-oriented practice: during each session, participants first receive 60 minutes of repetitive RT with the InMotion 3.0 robot (Interactive Motion Technologies Inc., Watertown, MA), followed by 30 minutes of functional practice using shaping technique.
ii.Restraint of the unaffected limb: Patients will wear a mitt to restrict the unaffected hand during training at clinic for 0.5 hours of functional practice each session, 3 sessions per week for 8 weeks.
iii. Transfer package: The transfer package aims at transferring the therapy gains to the participant's real world by use of a set of behavioral techniques. This is intended to have the participant responsible for adhering to the treatment requirements and encourage active engagement in the functional practice outside of the clinic setting. The participants will be given appropriated home assignment practicing daily activities outside of the clinic.</description>
