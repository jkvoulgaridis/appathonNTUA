      ADVM-043-03 is a long-term follow-up study of subjects in the prior ADVM 043-01 gene therapy
      clinical study (ADVANCE) for the treatment of Alpha-1 Antitrypsin (A1AT) deficiency.

      ADVM-043-03 is a long-term follow-up safety study of subjects in the ADVM 043 01 gene therapy
      clinical study (ADVANCE) delivering ADVM-043 for treatment of Alpha-1 Antitrypsin (A1AT)
      deficiency. Subjects will roll over after 12 months in the ADVANCE study into this study for
      continued safety monitoring. ADVM-043-03 is a multi-site observational study, without
      administration of investigational product, evaluating the long-term safety of ADVM-043
      administered in a prior study. Subjects who received ADVM-043 will be followed for up to 3
      years post-treatment
