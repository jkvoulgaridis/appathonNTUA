  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Asian populations have a lower rate of high-risk gene mutations of venous thrombosis, which
      means a reasonable perioperative anticoagulant management after hip or knee arthroplasty for
      Caucasian populations may be too excessive for Asians. So, individual patient risk
      assessment, rather than a &quot;blanket policy&quot;, is considered the best thromboembolism
      prophylaxis for Asians.The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness and safety
      of selective thromboembolism prophylaxis compared with conventional thromboembolism
      prophylaxis by risk stratification with thromboelastography (TEG) after joint arthroplasty
      for Asian populations.

      Asian patients who underwent hip or knee arthroplasty in Guangdong General Hospital from
      August 2016 to August 2017 were randomly divided into selective anticoagulation group (SAG)
      and conventional anticoagulation group (CAG). SAG used anticoagulant when TEG indicated
      hypercoagulability while CAP used anticoagulant until one month after surgery regularly. Data
      including patients' basic information, postoperative complications, perioperative clotting
      index, intraoperative blood loss, perioperative TEG, volume of drainage, and blood
      transfusion were evaluated.

    <description>Selective anticoagulation group used anticoagulant when thromboelastogram（TEG） indicated hypercoagulability.
TEG was performed 1 day before the surgery, 1 day after the surgery, 3 days after the surgery, and 5 days after the surgery.
The dosage regimen of anticoagulant was hypodermic injection 0.4 ml low molecular weight heparin per day for 5 days and oral administration of 10 mg Rivaroxaban until one month after the surgery.</description>

    <description>Selective anticoagulation group used anticoagulant once thromboelastography indicated hypercoagulable state. Conventional anticoagulation group used anticoagulant until one month after surgery routinely. The main difference was that the experimental group did not use anticoagulation if the thromboelastography indicated that the blood coagulation status was normal while the control group use anticoagulation routinely.</description>
