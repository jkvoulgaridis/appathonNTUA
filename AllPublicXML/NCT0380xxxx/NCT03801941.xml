  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to evaluate the reduction of pain by wearing the ATLAS Medical Device
      in standardized daily activities for patients with Chronic Low Back Pain.

      This is an intervention al non blinded study with a crossover design comparing pain evaluated
      with an Analogue Visual Scale with and without the ATLAS device during 5 standardized daily
      activities.

      This study aims at assessing pain release by wearing a new medical device (ATLAS) in patients
      affected by chronic low back pain.

      Population: patients with chronic low back pain admitted for a 4 weeks rehabilitation
      program.

      Intervention: active rehabilitation and wearing the ATLAS device 60 min per day. The ATLAS
      study is carried out during the 5 first days of the rehabilitation program.

      Primary outcome: Pain intensity evaluation with a 100 mm Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) during 5
      standardized activities (the most intensive pain during the 5 activities is recorded), with
      and without wearing the ATLAS device.

      Secondary outcome measures: percentage of patients reporting pain decrease of at least 20 mm
      on the 100 mm VAS during the 5 standardized activities with the ATLAs device compared without
      wearing the device. Percentage of relieved patients (percentage of patient reporting pain
      intensity less than 30 mm on the 100 mm VAS with wearing the device). Pain intensity
      evaluated with the 100 mm VAS before and after 60 min of wearing the ATLAS device.

      Randomization: two groups (i.e. group A and B). Primary outcome is evaluated at day 4 and 5,
      with a crossover design (Group A: pain is evaluated during activities with the device at day
      4 and without the device at day 5. Group B: pain is evaluated during activities without the
      device at day 4 and with the device at day 5).
