  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to test whether participation of low-income patients with
      health-harming legal needs (HHLNs) in a medical legal partnership (MLP) results in improved
      mental health, improved quality of life, reduced utilization, and increased resolution of
      HHLNs.
