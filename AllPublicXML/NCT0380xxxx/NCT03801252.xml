  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity increases the risk of pregnancy complications, including among others puerperal
      infections and cesarean delivery, and risk rises with increasing body mass index (BMI). Class
      III obesity is an indication for delivery by 39 weeks, and these patients have a high rate of
      labor induction. In nulliparous women from the general population (obese and non-obese),
      labor induction at 39 weeks (compared to expectant management) is associated with less
      morbidity and a lower cesarean rate. Antibiotic prophylaxis, standard before cesarean
      delivery, is associated with less post-cesarean infection if azithromycin is added to the
      standard cefazolin. In this placebo-controlled pilot trial, investigators will estimate the
      parameters necessary to calculate the sample size for a planned multicenter clinical trial of
      prophylactic antibiotics administered at the start of labor inductions of morbidly obese
      nulliparous women at term.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Investigators will enroll consenting women delivering at The Children's Hospital at OU
      Medical Center who meet enrollment criteria. Flyers will be distributed to providers to give
      to women who may be eligible for the study at prenatal visits, so that they may review the
      information prior to presenting for their induction of labor. Labor induction may be a
      scheduled procedure. However, many inductions occur in an unscheduled fashion due to medical
      or obstetric indications. Therefore, it is difficult to predict which women will ultimately
      require labor induction and at what gestational age they will require it, so it is not
      feasible to approach and consent all women during a clinic visit prior to labor induction.
      Distribution of flyers will allow patients to have information about the study prior to
      presenting for labor induction. Furthermore, unlike women in spontaneous labor, women being
      consented just prior to a labor induction are not vulnerable in the same way as one might
      consider a patient in labor, since they will not have the distraction and discomfort of
      uterine contractions that are presenting in laboring patients.
