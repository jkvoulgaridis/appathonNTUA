  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label, parallel-group, randomized controlled trial that will be
      conducted across mainland China. This trial will test the primary hypothesis of whether an
      intensive treatment strategy (a systolic blood pressure target of &lt;120 mmHg) is more
      effective than a standard treatment strategy (a systolic blood pressure target of &lt;140 mmHg)
      in reducing the risk of major cardiovascular disease (non-fatal stroke, non-fatal myocardial
      infarction, treated or hospitalized heart failure, and cardiovascular deaths) over a
      follow-up period of up to 5 years among patients with a history of diabetes and elevated
      systolic blood pressure. The secondary hypotheses are to compare the intensive blood pressure
      treatment strategy with the standard treatment strategy on dementia and cognitive function,
      individual components of the primary hypothesis, all-cause mortality, kidney outcomes,
      quality of life, and injurious falls, et al.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The trial will recruit 12,702 patients from approximately 200 hospitals within the China
      Diabetes Clinical Research Network. Eligible criteria include men and women aged ≥50 years;
      type 2 diabetes mellitus; elevated systolic blood pressure; and a history of clinical
      cardiovascular disease or increased risk for cardiovascular disease. Main exclusion criteria
      include known secondary cause of hypertension, symptomatic heart failure, end-stage renal
      disease, and other serious illness. The proposed trial has 90% statistical power to detect a
      20% reduction (hazard ratio of 0.80) in major cardiovascular disease between intensive and
      standard treatment groups at a 2-sided significance level of 0.05.

      To achieve the proposed study objectives, the following specific aims will be accomplished:

        1. Recruit 12,702 study participants who meet the eligibility criteria and randomly assign
           6,351 to the intensive blood pressure treatment and 6,351 to the standard blood pressure
           treatment groups;

        2. Achieve and maintain two-level targets of systolic blood pressure (&lt;120 mmHg vs. &lt;140
           mmHg) with a mean systolic blood pressure difference of ≥15 mmHg;

        3. Employ a study-wide strategy to encourage standard of care for all participants for the
           treatment of type 2 diabetes and dyslipidemia other than blood pressure;

        4. Obtain clinical data on study outcomes for up to 60 months of follow-up among all trial
           participants;

        5. Perform strict quality control procedures for intervention and data collection;

        6. Conduct data analysis according to the intention-to-treat principle; and

        7. Disseminate the study findings to influence clinical practice and clinical guidelines.

      Findings from this trial will provide evidence as to whether intensive blood pressure
      management to achieve a systolic blood pressure target of &lt;120 mmHg has additional benefits
      over standard management of systolic blood pressure &lt;140 mmHg. These findings will help in
      the development of clinical guidelines for blood pressure management among patients with type
      2 diabetes and will have important clinical impact.
