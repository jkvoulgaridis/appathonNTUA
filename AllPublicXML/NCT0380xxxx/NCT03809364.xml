  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to collect quantitative data related to developing and testing a
      couple-based intervention (CBI) for HIV-positive women's medication adherence in the region
      of Kwazulu-Natal, South Africa. The CBI, called START (Supporting Treatment for
      Anti-Retroviral Therapy) Together, will be a manualized intervention focused on women's ART
      adherence and enhancing the couple's communication and problem-solving behavior. The
      preliminary efficacy of the CBI on HIV-positive women's ART adherence, men's HIV testing, and
      HIV-positive men's linkage to care will be compared to a control condition of referrals to
      usual HIV care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      South Africa (SA) has one of the highest global HIV burdens with clear gender disparities.
      For men, 57% of HIV-related deaths occur among persons who have never sought HIV care. Women,
      in comparison, have high rates of HIV testing and are linked to care through antenatal
      services, but only 45% are virally suppressed on antiretroviral therapy (ART). Thus, tailored
      interventions for HIV are needed. In order to end the AIDS epidemic, the ambitious &quot;90-90-90&quot;
      goal was developed by UNAIDS to test, treat, and maintain medication adherence for 73% of
      HIV-positive individuals. Separate gender-specific interventions have been developed along
      the HIV care cascade to treat the different needs of men and women. However, no study to date
      has used one intervention to concurrently meet the unique HIV-related needs for women and
      men. Couple-based interventions (CBIs) can achieve this goal. CBIs are more efficacious than
      interventions delivered to individuals in enhancing a number of HIV protective behaviors. HIV
      is also primarily transmitted in the context of stable heterosexual relationships in
      sub-Saharan Africa; about 50% of new infections occur in serodiscordant relationships, making
      the use of a CBI especially relevant. The purpose of this study is to strengthen the HIV care
      cascade in SA by developing a CBI that concurrently addresses the needs of women and men to
      meet the &quot;90-90-90&quot; goal. This study will be conducted in the province of KwaZulu-Natal, SA.
      HIV-positive women who are in a heterosexual relationship and non-adherent to ART will be
      recruited to participate in the study with their male partners. Twenty couples will be
      recruited and randomized to either receive the START Together program or to the control
      condition and followed for 10 weeks thereafter.
