  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-dose with three incremental
      doses, Phase 1 study to evaluate the tolerance and pharmacokinetics of suramin sodium for
      injection in Chinese healthy adults.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 36 subjects are divided into three dosage groups: 10mg/kg, 15mg/kg and 20mg/kg, in
      which 20mg/kg is the conventional dosage per international pharmacopoeias for established
      indications of suramin sodium. Each dose group contains 12 subjects. By randomization, 10 of
      them receive suramin sodium while 2 of them receive placebo (0.9% sodium chloride injection）.
      The trial will start from the low dose (10mg/kg) group, followed by the middle dose (15mg/kg)
      and high dose (20mg/kg) groups, only after the safety in the previous dose group has been
      demonstrated.

      All subjects in each dose group will be un-blinded after blood/urine collection and safety
      evaluation on Day 28. After that, blood and urine samples on suramin-dosing subjects will
      continue to collect on Days 56、84、112 and 140.

      Subjects receiving placebo will complete the study on Day 28 if no AE is observed, or follow
      up till the adverse event (AE) return to normal or stabilize if AE is detected.

      Blood and urine samples will be tested by a validated LC/MS method for pharmacokinetic study.
