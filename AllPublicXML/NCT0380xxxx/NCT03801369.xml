  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II study assesses the efficacy of the combination of olaparib and durvalumab in
      the treatment of patients with metastatic triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). Olaparib may
      stop growth of tumors cells by inhibiting some of the enzymes (ADP ribose polymerase [PARP])
      needed for cell growth. Durvalumab, a monoclonal antibody, inhibits the growth and spread of
      tumors by stimulating the patient's antitumor immune response. Giving olaparib and durvalumab
      together may provide an effective method to treat patients with metastatic triple negative
      breast cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Assess overall response to treatment.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess participant benefit from treatment. II. Determine the time to disease progression
      following response to study therapy.

      III. Determine time to first disease progression or death of participants enrolled on the
      study.

      IV. Determine survival of participants enrolled on the study. V. Assess safety and
      tolerability of the proposed therapy.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Examine response rates depending on tumor characteristics. II. Identify predictive
      biomarkers of sensitivity to therapy. III. Identify emerging mechanism of resistance to
      therapy. IV. Determine changes in tumor cells induced by PARP inhibitors.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, single-arm phase II study of olaparib and durvalumab.

      Patients with biopsy proven TNBC will undergo a pre-treatment biopsy, after which they will
      receive a 28 days induction treatment of olaparib (oral, twice a day). At the 2 week mark,
      patients will then undergo a repeat on-treatment biopsy. Beginning cycle 2, durvalumab will
      be administered (intravenously [IV] over 1 hr) every 4 weeks, in addition to olaparib.
      Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 13 cycles in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients deriving clinical benefit from treatment may, at the
      investigator's discretion and in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity,
      may continue on therapy beyond the planned 13 cycles.

      At the completion of all on-study procedures, patients will be considered off-treatment and
      will be followed every 6 months for disease and survival outcomes up to 1 year. Patients will
      be asked to submit an optional tumor biopsy in the event of disease progression.

    <time_frame>Up to 3 months post treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Will be assessed by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version (v) 5.0. Incidence will be determined for participants with triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) that received at least one dose of olaparib and/or durvalumab. The 95% confidence interval will be reported with the point estimate of toxicity rate.</description>

    <time_frame>Up to 6 months post treatment</time_frame>
    <description>An estimate of CBR will be measured and reported with 95% exact confidence interval. Participants who achieve a CR, Pr, or stable disease (SD) for at least 6 months on the current protocol will be qualified as deriving benefit from therapy, and will count towards the CBR measurement.</description>

    <measure>Progression-free survival (PFS) for olaparib in combination with durvalumab</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 1 year post treatment</time_frame>
    <description>PFS is defined as the time from first treatment with olaparib (i.e., cycle 1 day 1) to the first of either recurrence or relapse (anywhere in the body), or death at time of last follow-up at 12-months. The estimated distribution of the PFS will be plotted using Kaplan Meier curves and reported with median survival and 95% confidence intervals if available.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall survival (OS) olaparib in combination with durvalumab</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 1 year post treatment</time_frame>
    <description>OS is defined as the time from first treatment with olaparib (i.e., day 1) to the date of death or last follow-up at 12 months. The estimated distribution of the OS will be plotted using Kaplan Meier curves and reported with median survival and 95% confidence intervals if available.</description>

    <measure>Duration of response (DOR) for olaparib in combination with durvalumab</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 months post treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The duration of overall response is measured from the time measurement criteria are met for CR or Pr (whichever is first recorded) until the first date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started. The duration of overall CR is measured from the time measurement criteria are first met for CR until the first date that progressive disease is objectively documented. If a participant dies, irrespective of cause, without documentation of recurrent or progressive disease beforehand, then the date of death will be used to denote the response end date.</description>
