  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Marijuana use, for both recreational and therapeutic purposes, is becoming increasingly
      common as states remove restrictions on use. The increased use raises new concern about the
      safety of this drug, including its ability to impair basic cognitive and psychomotor tasks,
      and whether the users are aware of their impairment. We propose to design a simple
      performance test that users can use in the field, using a cell phone, to assess their level
      of impairment relative to their own drug-free state. In this preliminary study, we will
      compare participants' simple task performance after a known dose of
      delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), or placebo, administered under double-blind conditions.
      In our app the participants will be asked to gauge their own perceived level of impairment
      (as determined by self-ratings and judgments of impairment) as well as their actual
      impairment (as gauged by the app), providing important feedback and training about their
      ability to detect impairment.

    <measure>Simple Reaction Time</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed two hour post intervention at peak effects</time_frame>
    <description>In this reaction time task, the user is asked to shake the device in response to a visual clue on the device's screen. The user makes three attempts, in which he or she must shake or move the device with an acceleration that is greater than the value of the thresholdAcceleration property within the given time. The task finishes when the user successfully completes the attempts as instructed in the task. Data collected by this task is in the form of ORKReactionTimeResult objects. Each of these objects contain a timestamp representing the delivery of the stimulus and an ORKFileResult object that references the motion data collected during an attempt.</description>

    <description>THC (MarinolÂ® [dronabinol]; Solvay Pharmaceuticals) will be orally administered in doses of 7.5 mg and 15 mg, in opaque capsules with dextrose filler. Placebo capsules contain only dextrose. These doses of THC are known to produce performance impairments as well as subjective intoxication (Broyd et al, 2016; Hartman and Huestis, 2013).</description>
