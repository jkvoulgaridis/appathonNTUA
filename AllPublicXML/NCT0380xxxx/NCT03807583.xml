  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to compare intradialytic plasma kinetics of amino acids after
      administration per os of Renoral or intravenous administration of amino acids in patients
      with end-stage renal disease treated with hemodialysis maintenance.

BUN: Blood urea nitrogen is one of the main renal function parameters (mmol/L).
ID Refers to the interdialytic period in hours.
ID BUN rise refers to the registered change in blood urea nitrogen during the interdialytic period.
The two nPCR formulas used are:
nPCR Anuric = 0.22 + (0.864 x (ID BUN rise in mg/dL) / (ID hours)) nPCR Total = nPCR Anuric + (Urine urea nitrogen in g x 150) / (ID hours x Weight in kg)</description>
