  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple Myeloma (MM) is often associated with progression, temporary response to therapy and
      a high relapse rate over time resulting in a poor long-term prognosis. Because MM is
      classified as an incurable disease, therapeutic resistance is of great interest. However,
      knowledge about the biological mechanisms underlying resistance associated with MM therapies
      and about associated predictors remains poor. The MYRACLE cohort, a multicenter prospective
      cohort of patients with MM, is set up to address this limitation.

    <textblock>
      The MYRACLE cohort study aims at including all patients (&gt;18 years old) who are diagnosed
      with MM in any stage of the disease and treated in specialized oncology centers in 2 public
      hospitals in Northwestern France. Any such patient providing a signed informed consent is
      included. All subjects are followed up until refusal to participate in the study, emigration
      or death. The MYRACLE follow-up is continuous and collects data on socio-economic status,
      medical status, MM therapies and associated events (resistance, side effects). Participants
      also complete standardized quality of life (QOL) questionnaires. In addition, participants
      are asked to donate blood samples that will support ex vivo analysis of expression and
      functional assays required to uncover predictive biomarkers and companion diagnostics. If
      diagnostic biopsies are performed during the course of the disease, extracted biological
      samples are kept in a dedicated biobank.

        The study population corresponds to multiple myeloma patients managed in the hematology
        departments of the University Hospital of Nantes and the CHD of La Roche sur Yon.

        Recruitment of the hematology departments of the University Hospital of Nantes and CHD of
        La Roche sur Yon makes it possible to envisage an annual recruitment of 60 new myeloma
        diagnoses, and an annual number of 80 relapses. These data are estimated from the number of
        files submitted to the Multidisciplinary Collaborative Meeting (RPN) and the annual
        inclusion number in clinical trials. This number represents a cohort of about 140
        inclusions per year. The average number of visits can be estimated at 1.5 / year per
        patient.
