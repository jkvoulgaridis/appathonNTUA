  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Parents of children with cystic fibrosis (CF) experience high levels of stress and problems.
      Family empowerment interventions provide important support for many patients with CF and
      their families. However,there is a lack of research exploring the effects of such empowerment
      programs on coping, and Problem Solving among parents, and Quality of Life in Children with
      CF.

      The present study aimed to assess the effect of a family empowerment program-based nursing
      intervention on parents coping with stress and problem solving, and quality of life children
      with CF.

      Parents of children with cystic fibrosis (CF) experience high levels of stress and problems.
      Family empowerment interventions provide important support for many patients with CF and
      their families. However,there is a lack of research exploring the effects of such empowerment
      programs on coping, and Problem Solving among parents, and Quality of Life in Children with
      CF. The present study aimed to assess the effect of a family empowerment program-based
      nursing intervention on parents coping with stress and problem solving, and quality of life
      children with CF.

      A single-blinded, parallel group pretest and posttest design randomized controlled trial was
      used.

      Data were collected over 5 months (January 2017-May 2017) from 48 participants in a medical
      faculty hospital. They were randomly assigned to the experimental (n = 24) and control (n =
      24) groups. Nursing interventions applied to the experimental group for ten weeks with the
      intent of strengthening families consist of; providing individualized training and booklet
      concerning disease management and providing phone calls and consultancy services for the
      purpose of reinforcing the training and increasing the motivation. A routine polyclinic
      follow-up was applied to the control group. Problem Solving Inventory (PSI), Scale of Ways of
      Coping with Stress (SWCS), and The Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised scale (CFQ-R) were
      used reliable and valid instruments. The data were evaluated using the Wilcoxon Signed Ranks
      test in evaluating dependent groups and the Mann-Whitney U test in independent groups.

    <masking_description>Blindness in the study was done by data collectors and statisticians. The data were collected by the nurse who did not know who is in the experiment and control group.
To reduce selection bias and to control the variables that may have an effect on outcome variables, random assignment was made to the experimental and the control group by a statistician who did not know the names and characteristics of the parents of and children with CF. The analysis of the data coded according to the groups was made by a statistician. After the statistical analyses were completed and the research report was written, the researcher explained the coding for the experimental and control group.</masking_description>

    <measure>Child and parents information form</measure>
    <time_frame>3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The form was developed to define baseline characteristics and was based on previous literature. The questionnaire included questions regarding the sociodemographic characteristics of the participants, such as age, gender, educational level, income, duration of treatment and diagnosis.</description>

    <measure>Problem Solving Inventory (PSI)</measure>
    <time_frame>10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Problem Solving Inventory (PSI) was measured using the 35-item Problem Solving Inventory Scale (Heppner &amp; Petersen, 1982). PSI; is a 35-item measure with a six-point Likert scale that assesses an individual's perceptions of his or her problem-solving styles, rather than actual problem-solving skills. Higher scores indicate an individual's assessment of oneself as a relatively ineffective problem solver. The PSI has a total score derived from three scales. The three subscales are: (a) Problem-Solving Confidence (PSC, 11 items); (b) ApproachAvoidance Style (AAS, 16 items); and (c) Personal Control (PC, 5 items). The PSC refers to an individual's belief and trust in one's own problem-solving ability. The AAS is defined as a general tendency to approach or avoid a wide range of problem-solving activities. The PC refers to individual's belief that one is in control of his or her own behaviors and emotions while solving problems.</description>

    <measure>Scale of Ways of Coping with Stress (SWCS)</measure>
    <time_frame>10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The SWCS was developed by Folkman and Lazarus in 1980 (Folkman &amp; Lazarus 1980). The Turkish adaptation and validity study of SWCS was conducted by Şahin and Durak in 1995 (Şahin &amp; Durak 1995). The SWCS is a 4-point Likert-type scale ranging from 1 (Not appropriate) to 4 (Very appropriate). In the Turkish adaptation and validity study of the SWCS, factor analysis, comparisons of measurement-correlating validity and counter groups and validity for the SWCS were conducted and Cronbach's alpha reliability coefficients of the subscales were found between 0.45 and 0.80. The scale consisted of two groups; one was the effective coping ways (ECWs), which contained the optimistic approach, self-confident approach, and seeking social support, and the other group was the ineffective coping ways (ICWs), which included the hopelessness and submissive approaches.</description>

    <measure>The Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised (CFQ-R)</measure>
    <time_frame>10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised (CFQ-R) is a CF-specific health-related quality of life (HRQOL) questionnaire (Quiitner et al. in 2005). The CFQ-R is a 4-point Likert-type scale ranging from 1 to 4. Higher scores indicate better HRQOL</description>
