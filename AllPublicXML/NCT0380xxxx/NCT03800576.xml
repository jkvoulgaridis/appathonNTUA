  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Genetic polymorphism and numerous clinical factors could influence tacrolimus
      pharmacokinetics, which led to large inter-and intra-individual variability.Since its narrow
      therapeutic range,predicting therapeutic outcome and individualized dosage remains to be a
      challenge. The study`s objective is to identify the genetic and clinical factors that can
      influence clinical outcome in liver transplant.

    <textblock>
      A great number of studies had found significant correlation between tacrolimus
      pharmacokinetics and gene polymorphism. However, previous studies on the correlation between
      genetic factors and clinical outcome were controversial. Furthermore, most studies focused on
      single genetic polymorphism and clinical outcome, and very limited studies took multiple
      genetic factors and clinical factors into account.

      This is a retrospective study. Eligible patients were those who had signed informed consent
      for genetic study in previous research projects ( IRB approval number：201512005RINC and
      201612023RIND ). The present study will collect laboratory data, concurrent medications, and
      therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) data. Patient survival, graft survival, acute rejection and
      tacrolimus-associated adverse events will be assessed.

nephrotoxicity：decreased renal function estimated by glomerular filtration rate(GFR) using MDRD 4-Variable Equation
Post-transplant diabetes mellitus：defined by diagnosis and the use of antihyperglycemic agents, laboratory data including blood sugar(mg/dL) and hemoglobin A1c (percentage)
hypertension：defined by diagnosis and the use of antihypertensive agents, laboratory data including blood pressure(mmHg)
infection：defined by diagnosis of infection and the use of antiinfective agents
Hyperlipidemia：defined by diagnosis and the use of lipid-lowering agents, laboratory data including LDL (mg/dL), HDL (mg/dL) and total cholesterol (mg/dL)
malignancy：incidence of cancer</description>
