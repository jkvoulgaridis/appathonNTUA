  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Career decision-making difficulties are frequent problems for adolescents. Regular
      intervention or prevention programs mainly provide information for the students about
      themselves, about the world of work, about their interests and preferences etc. Rational
      emotive behavioral therapy (REBT), a form of Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) provides help
      for adolescents to efficiently cope with emotional problems (e.g., psychological distress)
      related to the career decision-making process. The present study aims to investigate the
      efficiency of an REBT career intervention program implemented in a school setting. School
      settings are appropriate to deliver group intervention for students. Classes from Romanian
      public high-schools will be randomized in either intervention or treatment as usual groups.

      The intervention will be group based, delivered in 8 sessions, over 8 weeks. Each of the
      eight modules aimed a different component: Psychoeducation, Information about self and world
      of work, Steps of career decision-making, Problem solving. Additionally, for the REBT groups:
      Relationship between cognitive distortions/irrational beliefs and emotions, Cognitive
      restructuring, Exposure/behavioral activation and emotional problem solving, Maintenance of
      gaining. Homework would be given at every session. REBT intervention programs delivered in
      school settings represent ecological modalities to target vulnerable groups. Adolescents will
      complete assessments at four time points: T1 (baseline), T2 (post-intervention), T3 (3 months
      follow-up) and T4 (6 months follow-up).
