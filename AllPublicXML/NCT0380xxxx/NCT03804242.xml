  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One in three Black boys born today in the United States will be incarcerated at some point in
      their lifetime, compared to one in 17 White boys. Black males are more likely to be arrested,
      convicted, and given unfair sentences. Black youth comprise of 16% of the Nation's public
      schools, but account for 32% of suspended students. For over 30 years, research has
      consistently highlighted the disproportionately severe disciplinary practices used with Black
      male students.Consistent research demonstrates that students who are suspended or expelled
      tend to drop out of school and/or become incarcerated in a juvenile detention center. Black
      students may relate their racial-ethnic identity, such as their understanding of their race
      and ethnicity, to academic success. Moreover, their attitudes may result from the expectation
      of their teachers. It is imperative that advocates devoted to positive youth development
      intervene to this issue negatively affecting the well-being of Black youth. Under the
      mentorship of Caitlin Sayegh, Ph.D., postdoctoral fellow Tierra Ellis, Ph.D., has developed a
      9-session group intervention called Black Youth M.A.T.T.E.R. (BYM), which aims to debunk
      mental health stigma, help children shift their cognitive distortions about education, and
      normalize their experiences through group activities, while introducing them to advocacy and
      self-empowerment. This intervention may decrease mental health symptoms, increase motivation
      to approach goal-oriented outcomes, and reverse internalized beliefs and attitudes which may
      foster more positive perceptions related to school.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study is a randomized control trial mixed-methods pilot study of BYM. We aim to
      finalize the intervention protocol, assess feasibility and acceptability of the intervention,
      and evaluate the potential impact of BYM on pilot participants. The mixed-methods research
      design approach will be used within a single study for the collection, analyzing, and merging
      of qualitative and quantitative data. The purpose of a convergent parallel mixed methods
      research design is to simultaneously collect qualitative and quantitative data for a more
      comprehensive analysis.

      Research Questions: (1) What do Black adolescents and other community stakeholders perceive
      as the most effective approaches for the BYM project? (2) What are BYM participants'
      perceptions of the intervention? (3) Is there a decrease in mental health symptoms (e.g.,
      depression, anxiety, trauma) for BYM participants? (3) Is there an increase in resiliency for
      BYM participants? (4) Is there an increase in positive attitudes toward seeking mental health
      treatment for BYM participants? (5) Is there a difference in motivation to approach
      goal-oriented outcomes for BYM participants? (6) Is there an increase in perceived positive
      self-concept for BYM participants? (7) Is there a decrease in risk behaviors for BYM
      participants? Intervention Description: The session topics are as follows: (1) Debunking the
      Stigma of Mental Health in the Black Community, (2) School to Prison Pipeline, (3)
      Achievement Gap, (4) Cultural Barrier that Black Students Experience with Teachers, (5)
      Trauma 101, (6) Trauma 102, (7) Actions of Today, Blueprints for Tomorrow: Youth Organizing
      to Transform Education film, (8) My Voice Will Be Heard (Part I), and (9) My Voice Will Be
      Heard (Part II). The intervention will be conducted in 2-hour weekly group sessions.
