  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Evaluate the use of brief serial real time continuous monitoring (RT-CGM) as a behavior
      modification tool in obese patients with prediabetes and diabetes. After receiving RT-CGM,
      nutrition and exercise education, participants will be able to monitor their blood sugar in
      real time for 2 sessions . Education on how to interpret CGM in the setting of food choices
      and exercise coupled with nutrition and exercise information should lead to improved weight
      and other nutritional and exercise changes.

    <description>CGM is a way to measure glucose levels in real-time. A tiny electrode called a glucose sensor is inserted under the skin to measure glucose levels in tissue fluid. A small plastic piece of tube remains inserted in the skin. It is connected to a transmitter that sits on top of the skin. It is approved for use on the abdomen for 10 days. It either records the sugars downloaded in the clinic (blinded part of the study) or it sends the information via wireless radio frequency to a monitoring/ display device or to a cellular phone so participants can see data. DEXCOM G6 is FDA approved for use in patients with diabetes and will be used in accordance with instructions as approved for diabetes.</description>
