  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, we will evaluate the incidence of hepatitis B virus reactivation within the
      first 6 months of treatment with rituximab, standard chemotherapy and TAF in patients with
      diffuse Large B‑Cell Lymphoma/Chronic Lymphoid Leukemia HBsAg-positive.

    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multicenter, interventional, single arm, evaluating the incidence of
      hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation within the first 6 months treatment period in HBsAg
      positive patients treated for DLBCL/Chronic Lymphoid Leukemia with Rituximab, standard
      chemotherapy, and TAF.

      Approximate duration of the recruitment period based on the number of patients available The
      duration of the recruitment period has been estimated at 12 months.

      Patients will receive Rituximab+Chemotherapy+TAF for 6 months, followed by TAF as monotherapy
      for further 12 months. All subjects will receive TAF 1-3 weeks before Rituximab+Chemotherapy
      and withdrawn 12 months after the completion of chemotherapy. Then patients will be also
      observed for further12 months
