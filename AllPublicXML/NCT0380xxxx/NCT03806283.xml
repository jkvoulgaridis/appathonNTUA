  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will collect omental tissue (research surgical excision) and placental
      tissue (standard of care clinical delivery) from both preeclamptic and non-preeclamptic women
      during their c-section and use these samples to study the blood vessels, specifically the
      expression/activation of the AT2R.

      Trial Design: The study is a comparison of two cohorts, those with and without preeclampsia
      during pregnancy. The study team plans to investigate role of AT2 in modulation of vascular
      function/dysfunction using vessels isolated from the omental biopsies by examining for the
      evidence of fetal vascular dysfunction mediated by decreased expression of AT2 in
      preeclampsia using vessels isolated from the placentas.

      Study Population: The study will include pregnant women. The pregnant women will participate
      in the omental tissue collection, placenta collection, and the medical record review.

      The study is expects a maximum enrollment of 70 pregnant women. This is because 32 omental
      biopsies and 32 placentas are required to meet proposed statistical considerations. Subjects
      have the option of providing just one or both of the specimens. There is a possibility as few
      as 32 subjects could be enrolled and a maximum of 64 subjects could be enrolled to meet this
      requirement. There is an additional 6 subjects enrollment built into the enrollment number to
      allow for replacement of subjects based on lack of clinical data in some subjects, failure of
      tissue viability and hence experiments.

      This required enrollment (32) is divided into two cohorts based on the diagnosis of
      preeclampsia: 16 of each type of specimen in which the woman was diagnosed with preeclampsia
      during her pregnancy, and 16 of each type of specimen in which the woman was not diagnosed
      with preeclampsia during her pregnancy. Additionally, each cohort of 16 will be divided into
      two groups based on gender of the fetus, 8 male fetuses and 8 female fetuses

    <measure>Quantify the vascular AT2R expression and vascular function in placental and omental vascular arteries in both preeclamptic and controlled pregnancies.</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The researchers will measure the amount and distribution of vascular angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) and AT2R during normal human pregnancy and in preeclampsia. The researchers will assess if AT2R expression varies with severity of preeclampsia. Based on pilot data, the researchers expect decreased AT2R and increased AT1R protein levels in preeclamptic vs normotensive vessels.</description>

    <measure>To test if ex-vivo treatment of AT2R agonists reverses the endothelial dysfunction and improves vasoconstriction in the preeclamptic vessels.</measure>

    <description>The researchers will quantify vascular AT2R expression and vascular function in placental and omental arteries of preeclamptic vs normal pregnant women. Vascular function studies will also test if ex vivo treatment with AT2R agonist reverses endothelial dysfunction and vasoconstriction in preeclamptic vessels.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>To test AT2R mediated mechanisms on endothelial derived hyperpolarizing factor, nitric oxide and prostacyclin pathway of vascular relaxation to examine AT2's role in vaso-relaxation and AT2R mediated vasoconstrictor pathway will be defined.</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>To test the AT2R-mediated mechanisms, endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor (EDHF), nitric oxide, and prostacyclin (PGI2) pathways of vascular relaxation and AT1R-mediated vasoconstrictor pathways will be determined. Also, the expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase, its activity state, and signaling components of EDHF and PGI2 pathways, as well as nitrate/nitrite and PGI2 production and changes in membrane potential, will be measured</description>

    <description>The surgeon and clinical care team will conduct the c-section to deliver the baby and the placenta as clinically indicated. During the closing procedures, the surgeon will indicate a time for a participating Ob/Gyn physician on the study team to collect the omental bio-specimen. Omentum is frequently excised or removed for clinical reasons during surgical procedures. Omentum has small blood vessels within it that have been used for evaluation of vascular functional changes in research. The investigators wish to isolate one to three vessels of 5 to 7 cm length. The surgeon will then close and the clinical care team will resume their standard of care activities.</description>
