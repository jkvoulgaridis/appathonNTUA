  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if there is a difference in intra-abdominal
      pressure which surgeons use during surgery and post-surgery pain in men who undergo robotic
      prostate surgery with deep neuromuscular blockade (NMB), compared with moderate NMB.

    <description>Difference in levels of postoperative pain in participants under a moderate vs deep Neuromuscular Blockade technique during robotic prostatectomy using the Visual Analog Scale (VAS). The VAS is a psychometric response scale which can be used in recovery rooms to assist in the assessment of pain. It is a measurement instrument for subjective characteristics or attitudes that cannot be directly measured. The VAS scale ranges from 0-10. For pain intensity, the scale is anchored by ―no pain (score of 0) and ―pain as bad as it could be or ―worst imaginable pain (score of 10).</description>
