  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cervical cancer is the major cause of cancer deaths among women in Nepal. Screening is one of
      the most effective tools for early diagnosis, prevention and treatment. However, skilled
      health professionals and tools available for cervical cancer screening are limited in low and
      middle-income countries (LMICs) including Nepal. The World Health Organization (WHO) and
      Alliance for Cervical Cancer Prevention (ACCP) recommends that countries, areas, or
      institutions seeking to initiate or strengthen cervical cancer screening programs should
      consider introducing or expanding Visual Inspection with Acetic acid (VIA) until more
      appropriate and affordable HPV-based tests become available. 'National Guideline for Cervical
      Cancer Screening and Prevention in Nepal, 2010' includes VIA as a screening method for
      cervical cancer. Current studies reveal Nepalese women participation for cervical cancer
      screening is low. Thus, there is a need for appropriate, cost-effective and sustainable
      interventions to increase VIA screening uptake at the primary health care level across Nepal.

      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of a Female Community Health
      Volunteer (FCHV)s led community based educational intervention through home visits increasing
      cervical cancer screening uptake. The primary outcome of the study is to increase the
      cervical cancer-screening uptake in the intervention group. This will be the first
      community-based cluster randomized trial designed to mobilize FCHVs for increasing cervical
      cancer screening uptake in Nepal.
