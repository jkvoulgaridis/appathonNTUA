  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Matrix metallopeptidase-9 (MMP-9) expression was compared in healthy and inflamed pulp and
      the outcome of coronal pulpotomy in teeth with symptomatic pulpitis was assessed. After
      procedure blood samples were examined using Elisa kit.

      Introduction: Widely used diagnostic tests do not provide information to distinguish the pulp
      inflammation stage while improvement of materials, techniques and vital pulp therapy have
      received a wider acceptance in symptomatic pulpitis treatment. The aim of this clinical study
      was to compare MMP-9 expression in healthy and inflamed pulp and to assess the short-term
      outcome of coronal pulpotomy in mature permanent teeth with symptomatic pulpitis.

      Methods: Patients diagnosed with symptomatic pulpitis were included in this clinical study.
      Coronal pulpotomy was performed using calcium-silicate based material and blood samples were
      taken. Initial and postoperative pain was recorded by Heft-Parker visual analog scale at 24
      hours and 72 hours after the procedure. In control group teeth with healthy pulp were used.
      During follow-up visits after three and six-months, patients were examined clinically and
      radiographically. The ELISA kit was used to determine the levels of MMP-9 in inflamed and
      healthy coronal pulp tissue.

    <measure>MMP-9 amount measurement using ELISA kit</measure>
    <time_frame>All samples were measured in one time (during 12 hours)</time_frame>
    <description>The MMP-9 amount in the pulp blood samples was measured using the MMP-9 Human ELISA Kit. The measurement procedure was followed according to the manufacturer's instructions. The anti-MMP-9 polyclonal antibody was pre-coated on 96-well plates. Blood samples and a biotin-conjugated antibody were added to the wells supplemented with Avidin-Biotin-Peroxidase Complex and 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine in a mildly acidic buffer. A blue-colored product was produced and turned to yellow after an acidic stop solution was added. The intensity of the color yellow was proportional to the MMP-9 amount bound on the plate. The optical density absorbance was measured spectrophotometrically at 450nm in a microplate reader and the concentration of MMP-9 was calculated. For the expression of MMP-9 concentrations in the samples, a standard curve was used.</description>

    <description>Patients with clinically healthy third molar or premolar teeth with indications for extraction; no clinical signs of pulpitis, no caries, no indications for the replacement of an old filling that is 1 mm from the pulp space as determined on the radiograph; a normal response to the cold test, and no apical radiolucency on the radiograph. For teeth of this group coronal pulpotomy was applied.</description>

    <description>Patients with symptomatic pulpitis resulting from caries; tooth pain defined as sharp, dull, localized or diffuse; pain at night; a symptomatic tooth with a positive response to the cold test and lingering pain; intermittent or continuous episodes of spontaneous pain (with no external stimulus) that could last from a few minutes up to a few hours; no apical radiolucency on the radiograph. For teeth of this group coronal pulpotomy was applied.</description>

    <intervention_name>Coronal pulpotomy</intervention_name>
    <description>Coronal pulpotomy was performed with a sterile high-speed round bur under water coolant. Pulp vitality was confirmed by the presence of bleeding pulp tissue from all of the canal orifices. Hemostasis was achieved through the application of a pellet moistened with 2.5% NaOCl for two minutes and was repeated as needed. Calcium-silicate based material was prepared ac-cording to the manufacturer's instructions and gently placed over the pulp to fill the entire cavity.</description>
