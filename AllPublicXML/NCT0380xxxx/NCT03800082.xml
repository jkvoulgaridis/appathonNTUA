    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this program of research is to develop and systematically evaluate an
      integrated smartphone and web-based intervention (HEARTPA♀N) to provide evidence-informed
      symptom triage and self-management support to reduce pain and increase health-related quality
      of life (HRQoL) in women with cardiac pain. The investigators will use the individual and
      family self-management theory, mobile device functionality and the pervasive information
      architecture of mHealth interventions, and follow the sequential phased approach recommended
      by the Medical Research Council (MRC) to develop HEARTPA♀N. Funding was received from the
      Canadian Institutes of Health Research to develop the HEARTPA♀N architecture and conduct
      usability testing (Phase 2, current proposal) to ensure it is easy to use, efficient and
      satisfying to operate. In Phase 3 (current proposal), feasibility in terms of implementation
      (accrual rates, acceptability and level of engagement) and initial estimation of
      effectiveness outcomes (estimates of magnitude of effect) will be evaluated in a pilot
      randomized controlled trial (RCT). The Phase 3 pilot study will enable the investigators to
      refine the prototype, inform the methodology, and calculate the sample size for a larger
      multi-site RCT (Phase 4, future work).

      Phase 3 (Study 3): Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial of the HEARTPA♀N Intervention.

      The HEARTPA♀N intervention is the first of its kind; there are no previous trials of the
      efficacy of such an intervention to decrease pain and improve HRQoL in women with cardiac
      pain. The investigators will undertake a process and preliminary effect evaluation of the
      HEARTPA♀N intervention for women with cardiac pain, as guided by the MRC framework. The
      primary objective is to determine the feasibility of implementing an RCT of the HEARTPA♀N
      intervention. A process evaluation will be conducted to examine: 1) the feasibility of
      randomization, recruitment and retention, 2) acceptability and barriers to implementing the
      intervention (including the symptom triage algorithms), and 3) the extent of engagement with
      the intervention. The investigators will also undertake a preliminary efficacy evaluation of
      the primary outcomes. Based on the investigator's theorized mechanism of change, they
      hypothesize that the HEARTPA♀N intervention will reduce pain and improve HRQoL (primary
      outcomes). The investigators will assess the variability and sensitivity to change for both
      outcomes. Prior to conducting a full scale RCT of a complex intervention, such as HEARTPA♀N,
      the MRC recommends that a pilot trial be performed. Results from this pilot trial will inform
      the success of a future RCT in three ways: 1) help determine sample size calculation for the
      full-scale trial, 2) test procedures (recruitment, randomization, follow-up), which will make
      up the design of the full-scale trial, and 3) test feasibility of implementing the
      intervention, particularly by estimating rates of recruitment and retention. HEARTPA♀N triage
      algorithms and self-management interventions will be developed using a strong theoretical
      framework, informed by needs assessments and a comprehensive integrated mixed methods
      systematic review, with preliminary acceptability and usability testing by end-users. The
      investigators anticipate minimal risk to safety but will track adverse events using the
      Adverse Event Form.

    <measure>Feasibility (recruitment, retention, engagement)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>A process evaluation will be used to assess the feasibility of the implementation of the intervention. The PC will track any issues or difficulties encountered during trial implementation, such as problems using the app. Engagement will be assessed using Google Analytics, which will track patterns of app and website usage. Engagement with the app diary will be defined as 100% with daily entries for 3 months. Engagement with goal setting will be defined as 100% when 12 goals are identified over the 3-month period. Criteria for implementation success: recruitment rates &gt; 70%, retention &gt; 85%, minimal technical difficulties reported by &lt; 10%, engagement &gt; 80%, and minimal missed responses. Prevalence of refusal, retention, engagement and technical difficulties reported will be calculated with their 95% confidence intervals.</description>

    <description>The investigators will also assess acceptability and satisfaction in all participants in the intervention group using a modified Acceptability e-Scale (AES). The modified AES includes 9 items, each with a 5-point Likert response. Higher scores represent better acceptability/satisfaction. Responses are summed and averaged. Criteria for implementation success: AES mean summary score &gt; 4.</description>

    <measure>Pain (Brief Pain Inventory)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>A preliminary efficacy evaluation will also be undertaken focusing on the outcomes of pain. Pain will be measured using the Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form (BPI-SF), which rates pain severity and the degree to which pain interferes with mood, sleep, and other physical activities such as work, social activity and relations with others. We will investigate the variability and sensitivity to change for pain (T2-T1). We will calculate the number of participants who report clinically meaningful decreases in pain, which has been defined for the BPI-SF as a two-point difference in worst pain. Variability will be estimated using the mean/median scores and standard deviation, in each group separately, at pre and post-test.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Health-related quality of life (HRQOL)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>A preliminary efficacy evaluation will also be undertaken focusing on the outcomes of HRQOL. HRQOL will be measured using the SF-36v2TM, which contains 36 items and yields a score for each of the 8 domains of health: physical functioning, role limitations due to physical health (role-physical), bodily pain, general health perceptions, vitality, social functioning, role limitations due to emotional problems (role emotional), and mental health. We will investigate the variability and sensitivity to change for HRQOL (T2-T1). Sensitivity to change will be assessed by determining the number of participants who had a clinically meaningful increase in HRQOL: ≥ 15 points in physical functioning, general health and mental health; ≥ 16.7 in role emotional functioning; ≥ 18.5 points in role physical functioning and vitality; ≥ 20 points in bodily pain; and ≥ 25 points in social functioning.</description>

Participants will be encouraged to log-in to the pain diary app daily (via automated alerts) over the 3-month period to complete pain diary entries and develop and track their goals related to their pain, activities, sleep, emotions and medications. Participants will be directed to the PC for technical problems.</description>
