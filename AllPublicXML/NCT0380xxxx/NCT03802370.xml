  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Following tooth loss, a considerable reduction in hard- and soft-tissue volume can be
      expected (Tan WL, et al., 2012), (AraujoMG, et al., 2015). In the anterior maxilla, tissue
      loss can make future implant restorations more challenging and less predictable in terms of
      achieving and maintaining favorable soft-tissue-emergence profiles. Even with careful implant
      planning and placement, marginal gingival recession of 0.5-1 mm has been a common finding
      with single-tooth implants (Nisapakultorn K, et al., 2010), (Suphanantachat S, et al., 2012).
      This is partly attributed to bone remodeling after implant surgery, and occurs regardless of
      implant-placement protocol used (Hof M, et al., 2015).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The dome technique addresses the placement of the CT, as it is layered over the implant and
      takes the shape of an inverted dome. The advantage of the dome CT technique is that it allows
      for both buccal and coronal augmentation of local soft tissue, while maximizing blood supply
      to the area by using tunneling-technique principles. It enhances and augments the
      peri-implant tissue foundation for a favorable facial and interproximal restorative emergence
      profile. As this technique does not involve raising an independent buccal flap, the gingival
      tissue of the adjacent teeth is not compromised, and thus the risk of recession and formation
      of black triangles on the adjacent teeth is minimized.
