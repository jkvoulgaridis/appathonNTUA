      The yearly incidence of soft-tissue sarcomas (STS) in the USA is roughly 11,280 cases, and
      metastatic STS have a median overall survival of about 12 months. Sarcomas of the soft tissue
      are a heterogeneous group of malignant tumors of mesenchymal origin that originate in
      connective tissue. Local control with wide surgical resection with or without adjuvant
      radiation has a success rate of close to 90%. However, approximately 40% to 50% of patients
      with a large (&gt;5 cm), deep, high-grade soft-tissue sarcoma eventually develop distant
      metastases, primarily in the lung. Therefore, overall survival of metastatic STS remained
      still poor, less than 1 year. Olaratumab, an inhibitor of platelet-derived growth factor
      receptor alpha, was approved for the treatment of patients with metastatic sarcoma when
      combined with the standard chemotherapy, doxorubicin. Beside the improved overall survival,
      outstanding safety of olaratumab in combined with cytotoxic chemotherapy is also worth
      further investigation. Therefore, current clinical trials with various targeted agents are
      ongoing add on the doxorubicin monotherapy.

      Investigator planned to conduct the phase I/II trial of durvalumab in combination with
      standard chemotherapy, doxorubicin and olaratumab for metastatic/recurred sofe tissue
      sarcoma.

      The yearly incidence of soft-tissue sarcomas (STS) in the USA is roughly 11,280 cases, and
      metastatic STS have a median overall survival of about 12 months. Sarcomas of the soft tissue
      are a heterogeneous group of malignant tumors of mesenchymal origin that originate in
      connective tissue. Local control with wide surgical resection with or without adjuvant
      radiation has a success rate of close to 90%. However, approximately 40% to 50% of patients
      with a large (&gt;5 cm), deep, high-grade soft-tissue sarcoma (STS) eventually develop distant
      metastases, primarily in the lung. Therefore, overall survival (OS) of metastatic STS
      remained still poor, less than 1 year. Olaratumab, an inhibitor of platelet-derived growth
      factor receptor alpha, was approved for the treatment of patients with metastatic sarcoma
      when combined with the standard chemotherapy, doxorubicin. Beside the improved OS,
      outstanding safety of olaratumab in combined with cytotoxic chemotherapy is also worth
      further investigation. Therefore, current clinical trials with various targeted agents are
      ongoing add on the doxorubicin monotherapy.

      Recently, Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and PDGF receptor (PDGFR) signalling plays a
      significant part in mesenchymal biology, including mesenchymal stem cell differentiation,
      growth, and angiogenesis. Based on the background, PDGFR inhibitor, olaratumab with
      doxorubicin demonstrated significantly improved overall survival compared to doxorubicin
      monotherapy and approved as standard treatment in STS.

      Durvalumab (MEDI4736) is a human monoclonal antibody that inhibits binding of PD-L1. For this
      orphan tumor, STS, PD-L1 may be a promising strategy and favorable toxicity may warrant
      further combination. For this orphan tumor, STS, PD-L1 targeting may be a promising strategy
      and favorable toxicity may warrant further combination. Regarding anti-PD-L1 treatment in
      STS, in phase I trial with human monoclonal antibody to PD-L1, MPDL3280A, one heavily treated
      synovial sarcoma patients demonstrated partial responses. In recent phase II study of
      pembrolizumab, PD-1 inhibitor in advanced STS among the 40 STS cases (17.5%) had responses (1
      complete response and 6 partial response). Based on the study, pembrolizumab monotherapy was
      approved for previously treated STS in Korea.

      Furthermore, targeting PDGFRα by olaratumab is hypothesized to alter the tumor
      microenvironment and may lead to a more pronounced activity of PD-1 targeting in STS.
      Therefore, various clinical trials are ongoing immune checkpoint inhibitor with PDGFR
      inhibitors [axitinib for renal cell carcinoma (RCC), pazopanib for RCC and STS, Sorafenib for
      RCC, and liver cancer, sunitinib for RCC, gastrointestinal stromal tumor, and pancreatic
      cancer]. Among them, pembrolizumab and olaratumab combination is ongoing for soft tissue
      sarcoma.
