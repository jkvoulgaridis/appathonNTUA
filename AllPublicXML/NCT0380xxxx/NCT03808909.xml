  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will determine the feasibility of offering expanded continuous labor support by
      trauma- and addiction-trained medical paraprofessionals (i.e. doulas) at no cost to pregnant
      women receiving care for substance use disorders (SUD). The long-term goal of this
      transdisciplinary multilevel intervention is ultimately to reduce a major existing behavioral
      health disparity in the state. This cross-campus multi-disciplinary collaboration, is in
      partnership with Young Women United (a research and policy organization in NM) and doulas of
      the UNM Birth Companion Program. Through this partnership, women receiving combined OB/SUD
      treatment at the Milagro Program at UNMHSC will be offered expanded doula services.
