    <textblock>
      Improving spoken language outcomes for children with hearing loss has important public health
      implications. This is a randomized clinical trial of 96 children with hearing loss that
      examines the effects of a parent-implemented early communication intervention on
      prelinguistic and spoken language outcomes.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      While children with hearing loss (HL) are experiencing greater gains in spoken language than
      ever before, considerable variability exists and many children with HL continue to have
      poorer language skills than their hearing peers. Critical to reducing this variability is the
      identification of: (a) effective early communication interventions for children with HL and
      (b) child and parent characteristics that influence intervention outcomes (moderators and
      mediators). However, to date, only the pilot study for this proposed study has directly
      examined the effects of an early communication intervention for children with HL within the
      context of a randomized clinical trial. The overarching goals of the proposed study are to:
      (a) evaluate the effects of teaching parents to use communication support strategies on child
      communication outcomes and (b) examine parent and child characteristics that moderate and
      mediate intervention outcomes. The central hypothesis is that systematic parent training will
      result in greater parental use of communication support strategies, greater child
      pre-symbolic communicative acts, and greater child spoken language outcomes. The specific
      aims include: (a) comparing parent use of communication support strategies and child
      pre-symbolic communicative acts between intervention and control groups during and
      immediately following intervention (from 12 to 18 months of age), (b) examining parent
      (identification of child communication) and child (sensitivity to social contingency;
      attention to speech) moderators of intervention outcomes; (c) comparing parent use of
      communication support strategies and child spoken language outcomes between intervention and
      control groups after intervention (from 18 and 36 months of age); and (d) examining parent
      (use of communication support strategies) and child (pre-symbolic communicative acts)
      mediators of intervention outcomes. The proposed study will enroll 96 children with mild to
      profound bilateral hearing loss. Children will enroll in the study around 12 months of age
      and will be randomly assigned to either a parent-implemented communication intervention
      (PICT) or a control group. Children in both groups will be assessed: (a) at 12 months of age
      (immediately before intervention), (b) at 18 months of age (immediately after intervention),
      and (c) at 36 months of age (18 months after the end of intervention). Children in the
      intervention group will receive weekly, 1-hour intervention sessions for 6-months that: (a)
      are delivered during an important prelinguistic period of language development, (b)
      incorporate visual, interactive, responsive, and linguistically stimulating communication
      support strategies that are associated with stronger language skills in children with HL, and
      (c) include systematic parent training found to be effective in teaching parents to use
      communication support skills in children with language delays. The proposed research is
      significant because effective early communication intervention is likely to reduce persistent
      language delays in children with HL, thereby advancing the field of childhood hearing loss,
      where there is a striking paucity of rigorous communication intervention research.

    <time_frame>Change in monthly samples between pre and post when the child is 12 to 18 months (during intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>Caregiver use of communication support strategies is measured from a 10-minute caregiver-child interaction in which the dyad plays using a standard set of toys. This interaction will be video recorded and coded for their use of communication support strategies to yield the following variables: percentage of adult communication that is within the child's line of sight, percentage of adult communication that is paired with a gesture in the child's line of sight, percentage of child communication that is followed by a contingent response, percentage of adult communication that is in response to child communication, percentage of adult communication that contains a child linguistic target, and percentage of child communication to which the adult imitates and adds a word. These variables will be combined using confirmatory factor analysis to create a single latent variable.</description>

    <measure>Total Scaled Score on the Communication and Symbolic Behavior Scales - Developmental Profile</measure>
    <time_frame>Post (immediately after intervention when the child is 18 months)</time_frame>
    <description>The child is presented with 6 different activities (wind-up toy, balloon, bubbles, jar, books, play) designed to elicit child communication. The interaction is video recorded and then scored for 20 items across 7 communication scales (emotion and eye gaze, communication, gestures, sounds, words, understanding, and object use). An overall total scaled score is calculated based on the raw score and the child's age (min = 65; max = 135). Higher scores indicate better skills.</description>

    <description>Caregiver use of communication support strategies will be measured from a 10-minute caregiver-child interaction in which the caregiver plays with the child using a standard set of toys. This interaction will be coded for their use of communication support strategies to yield the following variables: percentage of intervals in which the adult is communicating within the child's line of sight, percentage of adult communication that is paired with a gesture in the child's line of sight, percentage of intervals in which the adult's play is related to the child, percentage of child non-verbal actions that are imitated, percentage of child communication that is followed by a contingent response, percentage of adult communication that is in response to child communication, percentage of adult communication that contains a child linguistic target, percentage of child communication to which the adult imitates and adds a word.

    <description>Total number of spoken words will be collected using two measures that will be combined used confirmatory factory analysis. Total Number of Words Said from the MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventory: Words and Sentences and the total number of different spoken word roots from a 20-minute language sample in which an assessor plays with the child following a standardized protocol.</description>

    <description>The child is presented with different receptive tasks, such as following simple directions and pointing to pictures, until the child provides an incorrect response to six consecutive items. A total standard score is calculated based on the raw score and the child's age (min = 50; max = 150). Higher score indicate better outcomes.</description>
