  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To compare the efficacy and safety of FE 999049 (follitropin delta) and its personalized
      dosing algorithm in controlled ovarian stimulation for in vitro fertilization
      (IVF)/intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) using a long gonadotropin-releasing hormone
      (GnRH) agonist protocol versus a short GnRH antagonist protocol.
