      The purpose of the study is to compare the effectiveness and safety profile of ExPress
      implantation versus partial deep sclerectomy combined with ExPress implantation with
      simultaneously phacoemulsification.

      Mermoud et all (1) proposed a modification of the classical surgical technique: combined deep
      sclerectomy (DS) with ExPress device implantation. The goal of this modification was to
      enhance hypotensive effect of well known procedure, and also to simplify non-penetrating
      surgery, which is a procedure with a long learning curve. Mermoud's idea provides the
      possibility of avoiding complications related to dissection of the filtering bleb and gives
      hope for achieve of better results in comparison to the classical procedure. Thanks to this,
      the surgical procedure could be performed earlier, even in the case of glaucoma with low
      intraocular pressure (IOP), where vascular factors are largely responsible for the
      progression of neuropathy. To demonstrate the potential of both types of procedures with the
      application of the ExPress implant, the authors decided to conduct a prospective, randomized
      study with a 2-year observation period concerning the efficacy, safety and stability of
      effects achieved.

    <description>The conjunctiva is dissected with the base in the limbus. Superficial flap is dissected with the based in the limbus. Phacoemulsification is performed through a corneal incision 2.75 mm from the temple using the phaco-chop technique. Deep scleral is dissected just below the trabeculo-Descemet membrane. The seton is implanted in the anterior chamber at the height of Schlemm's Canal.</description>
