      Closed-loop system systems that are shown to alleviate the burden of carbohydrate counting
      without degrading glucose control are still lacking. In this proposal, the investigators aim
      to develop a novel, fully-automated, triple-hormone, closed-loop system that delivers
      insulin, pramlintide, and glucagon that controls postprandial glucose levels without any
      input from the user.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Meal carbohydrate content is the main determinant of prandial insulin needs, and
      consequently, accurate carbohydrate counting is recommended for type 1 diabetes. Advances in
      glucose sensors have motivated the development of the closed-loop system to automatically
      regulate glucose levels in individuals with type 1 diabetes. In the closed-loop system, a
      dosing algorithm adjusts the pump insulin infusion rate based on continuous glucose sensor
      readings.

      Closed-loop system systems that are shown to alleviate the burden of carbohydrate counting
      without degrading glucose control are still lacking. In this proposal, the investigators aim
      to develop a novel, fully-automated, triple-hormone, closed-loop system that delivers
      insulin, pramlintide, and glucagon that controls postprandial glucose levels without any
      input from the user. Thus, the three hormones' role in the postprandial state will be as
      follows:

        1. Insulin: to reduce plasma glucose levels. Insulin delivery needs to be aggressive to
           counter-act fast increase in post-meal glucose levels.

        2. Glucagon: to reduce the risk late postprandial hypoglycemia to the aggressive insulin
           delivery.

        3. Pramlintide: to slow gastric emptying and aim insulin in efficiently controlling
           postprandial glucose levels.

      The aim of this study is to assess a fully automated, triple-hormone, closed-loop system that
      delivers insulin, pramlintide, and glucagon to control glucose levels without degrading
      overall glycemic control compared to an insulin-alone closed-loop system with
      carbohydrate-matched boluses.

      The investigators hypothesize that the triple-hormone closed-loop system will alleviate
      carbohydrate-counting burden (fully reactive system) without degrading glucose control
      compared to the insulin-alone closed-loop system.

    <description>Fast-acting insulin, glucaon, and pramlintide will be delivered using three separate infusion pumps. The pumps' infusion rates will then be changed manually based on the computer-generated recommendation. The computer-generated recommendations are based on a dosing algorithm. With no-meal announcement or carbohydrate counting, the triple-hormone closed-loop system will be fully reactive, and insulin, pramlintide and glucagon dosages will be based solely on sensor readings</description>

    <description>Fast-acting insulin will be delivered by a subcutaneous insulin infusion pump based on an algorithm that automatically adjusts insulin rates based on a dosing algorithm. The carbohydrate content for every ingested meal will be entered into the algorithm to calculate the insulin prandial bolus based on each participant's insulin-to-carbohydrate ratio. The carbohydrate content will be entered at the onset of the meal.

    <description>Subjects will be admitted at the research facility at 19:00. Each 27-hour intervention visit includes 3 standardized meals (8:00, 12:00, and 17:00), an evening snack (22:00) and an overnight stay. The glucose level as measured by the real time sensor will be entered manually into the computer every 10 minutes. The infusion rate of either insulin alone or insulin, pramlintide and glucagon will be changed manually based on the computer generated recommendation. The computer generated recommendations are based on a predictive algorithm.</description>
