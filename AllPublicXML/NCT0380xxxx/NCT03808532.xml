  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic, relapsing inflammatory skin disorder associated with a
      decreased ability of the skin to function as an efficient immunological barrier. The disease
      is now two to three times more prevalent in children than it was just four decades ago. It is
      manifested by eczematous skin lesions associated with severe itch, leading to a significant
      impairment in quality of life. Of additional importance, AD oftentimes progresses to allergic
      rhinitis and/or asthma, a process referred to as the &quot;atopic march.&quot; Recent reports have
      indicated that daily application of moisturizing creams on neonates and infants can prevent
      the occurrence of AD and subsequently food allergies. This is postulated to be the outcome of
      restoring the barrier integrity of the skin through the daily application of moisturizer.

          2. Average forearm TEWL reading of &gt;8.50 g/m2

          3. Mothers must be aged &gt;18 years

          4. Parents' ability to complete questionnaire(s) at defined times throughout study

             14 days

          3. Neonate has an existing widespread skin condition that would make the detection and/or
             assessment of eczema difficult

          4. Neonate has been administered oral or parenteral antibiotics from birth until study
             enrollment

          5. Neonate has a serious health issue which, at parent or investigator discretion, would
             make it difficult for the neonate or parents to take part in the trial

          6. Any conditions which precludes the daily application of moisturizing lotion

          7. Any other reason that, in the opinion of the investigator, prevents the subject from
             participating in the study or compromise the patient safety
