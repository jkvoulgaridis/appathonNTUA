  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational study that aims to determine the effectiveness of a tetravalent
      dengue vaccine (CYD-TDV) when given through a community-based immunization program against
      hospitalized and /or severe virologically confirmed dengue.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a matched case-control study. Cases will be children who are admitted with a clinical
      suspicion of dengue at the study hospitals and were eligible to have received the dengue
      vaccine during the mass immunization. The outcome of interest is hospitalized and/or severe
      virologically-confirmed dengue and the exposure is receipt of the dengue vaccine. Each case
      will be matched to two controls who were also eligible to have received the dengue vaccine
      and lives in the same area as the case. Cases and controls will be matched by age and sex.

      Any leftover sera will be used for future studies and stored at UPM-NIH for fifteen (15)
      years after the end of this study. Future studies using the sera will undergo appropriate
      ethical reviews as required. After this period, specimens will be destroyed according to
      local guidelines. Additional consent will be obtained from the parent for storage and future
      use of these samples. Only the Principal Investigator and designated study personnel will
      have access to these specimens.
