      repeatability for each parameter and correlate them with a Standard Automatic Perimetry (SAP)
      parameters.

    <textblock>
      Standard Automatic Perimetry (SAP) is the gold standard test for the evaluation of different
      diseases of the visual pathway like glaucoma. Its main goal is to measure the differential
      light sensitivity at several locations of the central and peripheral field of vision.
      Nevertheless, the accuracy of the current device is limited by several factors like the
      inherent inconsistency of the psychophysical test, stressful examinations and frequency of
      testing among others.

      Several devices have been developed since the advent of the Octopus Perimeter3-5 and the
      Humphrey Field Analyzer (HFA), in an effort to improve early detection of glaucoma.

      The main goal of this study is to evaluate the repeatability of a novel psychophysical
      platform that takes advantage of a Head Mounted Device (HMD) with eye tracking capabilities.
      Other objectives of this study include the development of an initial reference database and
      the evaluation of its correlation with HFA parameters.
