  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, single-arm, non-randomized, non-blinded study designed to characterize
      the locations of His Bundle (HB) pacing that results in correction of electrical dyssynchrony
      and to characterize morphology and activation time of local intracardiac electrogram (IEGM)
      with an electro-anatomical mapping system during a device implant procedure and secondarily
      to assess the efficacy of HB pacing or HB plus LV pacing (when indicated) in correction of
      electrical dyssynchrony in heart failure patients with left bundle branch block.

    <description>During the device implant procedure, a VisionWire coronary guidewire will also be placed into a branch of coronary sinus (CS), targeting a lateral branch. This guidewire could be used for collecting local left ventricle (LV) activation time (Q-LV) or pacing the LV. This guidewire could also be used to deliver a LV lead at physician's discretion. This procedure might be part of the standard-of-care at the participating centers.</description>

             indications

          2. An ECG with a wide QRS complex (&gt;130 ms)

          3. ECG morphology of typical complete LBBB,

          4. Patients have heart failure with NYHA Class II-IV symptoms,

          9. Female subjects of child-bearing potential are required to have a negative pregnancy
             test done within 7 days prior to the implant procedure per site standard test. Female
             patients of childbearing potential should be instructed to use safe contraception
             (e.g., intrauterine devices, hormonal contraceptives: contraceptive pills, implants,
             transdermal patches hormonal vaginal devices, injections with prolonged release.)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients have non-specific intraventricular conduction delay or right bundle branch
             block

          2. Previously implanted cardiac devices with three or more permanent leads

          3. History of aortic valve repair or replacement

          4. History of tricuspid valve replacement

          5. Pregnant or nursing subjects and those who plan pregnancy during the clinical
             investigation follow-up period.

          6. Recent (&lt; 3 months) myocardial infarction, ablation, electrolyte imbalance, or any
             condition within the last 90 days that would contraindicate for pacemaker or CRT
             implant in the opinion of the investigator

          7. Presence of other anatomic or comorbid conditions, or other medical, social, or
             psychological conditions that, in the investigator's opinion, could limit the
             subject's ability to participate in the clinical investigation or to comply with
             follow-up requirements, or impact the scientific soundness of the clinical
             investigation results.
