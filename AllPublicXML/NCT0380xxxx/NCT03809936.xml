  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To date, several studies have focused on the use of transcranial direct current
      stimulation(tDCS) in patients with impaired consciousness.However,its therapeutic effects
      have been variously documented.So,in this study ,investigators explore the effects of tDCS.

      Background:tDCS was supposed as an experimental approach to disorders of consciousness
      treatment. Its therapeutic effects have been variously documented.

      Objective: The study aimed to investigate the reactivity of electroencephalography (EEG) and
      the clinical response of patients with disorders of consciousness and explore the
      neuromodulatory effects of highfrequency tDCS in DOC.

      Method:In this double-blind, randomized controlled trial,real or sham tDCS were applied to
      the left dorsolateral prefrontal (DLPF) cortex of participants with disorders of
      consciousness for two weeeks. Evaluations were blindly performed at baseline, immediately
      after the end of the 14-days treatment and 1 week later with the JFK Coma Recovery
      Scale-Revised (CRS-R) scale and EEG.

    <intervention_model_description>Using a sham-controlled randomized double-blind design, 20 patients were randomly assigned to either a real or sham stimulation group. Each intervention week included 10 daily sessions of 20-minute therapy with either anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (2 mA, 20 minutes; experimental group) or sham transcranial direct current stimulation (control group) over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC).</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The CRS-R is a tool used to characterise the level of consciousness.The CRS-R is a tool used to characterize the level of consciousness and to monitor neurobehavioural recovery in DOC. The scale consists of 23 hierarchically arranged items that comprise six subscales addressing the auditory, visual, motor, oromotor/verbal, communication and arousal processes. The lowest item on each subscale represents reflexive activity whereas the highest item represents cognitively mediated behaviors.</description>

    <description>delta (1-4 Hz), theta (4-8 Hz), alpha (8-12 Hz) and beta (12-30 Hz).an increase of delta and theta activity usually reflects encephalopathy and/or structural lesions, interpreted as poor outcome predictor of DOC .The power of α and β is related to the chance of recovery.</description>

    <description>Direct current was applied by a battery-driven constant current stimulator using saline-soaked surface sponge electrodes (7 3 5 cm) with the anode positioned over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (F3 according to the 10-20 international system for EEG placement) and the cathode placed over the right supraorbital region. During real tDCS, the current was increased to 2 mA from the onset of stimulation and applied for 20 minutes.</description>
