  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study aims to investigate the effects of combined physical-cognitive training on
      cognitive function as well as peripheral BDNF level and mitochondrial function of individuals
      with MCI. It is hypothesized that: 1) the combined physical-cognitive training program will
      be superior to the physical and cognitive training program alone; and 2) the degree of
      cognitive improvement will be positively correlated with the improvement of plasma BDNF and
      mitochondrial function.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recent research suggests that the benefits of combined physical-cognitive training may be
      greater than either physical or cognitive training alone. Nevertheless, this synergistic
      effect has been demonstrated mainly in cognitively intact older adults. Studies examining the
      effects of combined physical-cognitive training in older adults with MCI are scarce and show
      mixed results. Moreover, few studies have determined the effects of the combined training on
      peripheral brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and mitochondrial function. Thus, the
      present study aims to investigate the effects of combined physical-cognitive training on
      cognitive function as well as peripheral BDNF level and mitochondrial function of individuals
      with MCI. The present study will provide insight into the interplay among the training
      program, peripheral BDNF concentration, mitochondrial function, and cognitive function.
      Importantly, the findings will have clinical implication regarding the training program that
      is feasible and effective in improving cognitive function of older adults with MCI which
      ultimately will have great impact on public health as this population is at high risk of
      progression to AD.

    <description>Fall risk will be assessed using the physiological profile assessment. The test consists of five sensorimotor and balance measures including visual contrast sensitivity, proprioception, quadriceps muscle strength, hand reaction time, and postural sway. The five PPA components are weighted to compute a composite z-score distribution with high scores indicating increased fall risk.</description>
