  <brief_summary>

      This study will evaluate the safety of oral administration of EcoActive to patients with
      inactive Crohn's disease and how it affects the levels of AIEC in stool.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if EcoActive is safe and effective in people with
      Crohn's disease. EcoActive is a collection of bacteriophages. Bacteriophages (or phages) are
      viruses that infect only bacteria. The phages in EcoActive infect a specific type of bacteria
      called Adherent Invasive Escherichia coli (AIEC).

      The cause of Crohn's disease is poorly understood. However, the presence of AIEC in the
      intestines is associated with worsening inflammation in this disease. Inflammation is the
      presence of redness, irritation, and ulcers in the intestines. By using phages that only
      infect and kill this specific type of bacteria (AIEC), it is the hope this can be used to
      improve the course of Crohn's disease. The phages would only target the AIEC, without
      affecting the natural, often helpful, bacteria of the intestines. EcoActive may also lessen
      the use of antibiotics to control symptoms. When antibiotics are used, they can have major
      effects on the rest of the bacteria in the intestines. Also, repeated use can cause
      intestinal bacteria to become resistant to antibiotics. Reduced use of antibiotics would
      limit both of these risks.
