      The aim of this study was to develop and assess the effectiveness of a Polish version of

      The translation into Polish followed standardized procedures. Women aged between 18-75 years
      were included into the study. All patients were recruited from women attending the Outpatient
      Clinic of the 2nd Gynecology Department of the Medical University in Lublin. SUI was observed
      in 290 cases; OAB in 283 patients and 249 had MUI (confirmed by medical history, and
      urodynamic investigation). All patients completed the Polish version of the OABSS on two
      separate visits: Week 0 and Week 2 and additionally UDI-6, IIQ-7 during visit- Week 2.
