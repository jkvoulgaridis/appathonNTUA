  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this proposed study is to assess the use of a new feature of the Control-IQ
      system, MyTDI.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This trial aims to demonstrate the safety and feasibility of using MyTDI to determine insulin
      parameters on the Closed Loop Control (CLC) Artificial Pancreas (AP) system t:slim X2 with
      Control-IQ technology for use both at ski camp and at home in adolescent patients with type 1
      diabetes.

      Once deemed eligible, participants and their parent(s) will be trained on the use of the
      Tandem t:slim X2 insulin pump with Control-IQ technology and the study Dexcom G6 system.
      Participants will then use the this study equipment with their home insulin parameters at
      home for at home for 5 days. Participants will then come to the ski resort to participate in
      a 72-hour ski admission. Upon arrival, each participant will be randomized to either the
      using the Control-IQ system with their usual insulin parameters during the ski study and the
      at-home 5 days at home study or using the MyTDI insulin parameters during the ski study and
      the at-home 5 days at home study. Study duration for each participant will require 5 study
      visits over about 2 weeks.

Prior to participating in the 72-hour ski admission, participants will be randomized 1:1 to the use of Control-IQ or the Control-IQ with MyTDI. Participants randomized to Control-IQ with MyTDI, participants will be adjusted as noted below during the ski admission and will then continue these parameters for 5 additional days at home:
A single basal rate equal to total daily insulin (TDI)/48 will be implemented across the whole day
A single correction factor (CF) of 1650/TDI will be implemented across the whole day
Carbohydrate ratios (CR) will be set at:
00:00-04:00 CR=450/TDI
04:00-11:00 CR=360/TDI
11:00-00:00 CR=450/TDI TDI will be set at the internal Control-IQ estimation total daily dose; if not available, total daily dose over the last 5 days will be used.</description>

          -  Current use of oral glucocorticoids, beta-blockers or other medications, which in the
             judgement of the investigator, would be a contraindication to participation in the
             study.

          -  History of ongoing renal disease (other than microalbuminuria).

          -  Subjects requiring intermediate or long-acting insulin (such as NPH, Detemir, or
             Glargine).

          -  Pregnancy

          -  Presence of a febrile illness within 24 hours of the Ski Admission
