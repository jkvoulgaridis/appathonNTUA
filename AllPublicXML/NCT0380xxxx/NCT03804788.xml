      This project aims to evaluate improvement of insomnia as a mechanism of improvement in
      alcohol use outcomes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      More than half of returning Veterans who screen positive for hazardous drinking report
      clinically significant symptoms of insomnia. In turn, insomnia symptoms have been associated
      with increased risk of alcohol-related problems, perhaps due to insomnia-related impairments
      in executive functioning, negative emotionality, and craving. The proposed project aims to
      examine improvements in insomnia as a mechanism for improvement in alcohol use among
      heavy-drinking Veterans with insomnia. Forty-four returning Veterans who report heavy
      drinking (â‰¥4/5 drinks per occasion for women/men) and have insomnia based on DSM-5 and
      research diagnostic criteria will participate in a randomized pilot trial. Participants will
      be randomly assigned to receive personalized normative alcohol feedback in the context of one
      of two treatment conditions: CBT-I (n = 22) or a sleep hygiene education control (SH; n =
      22). Outcomes will be assessed at the end of the active intervention period (6 weeks),
      mid-treatment (after 3 sessions), and at 3 months post-intervention. Outcomes of interest
      include insomnia severity, total wake time, sleep quality, drinking quantity/frequency,
      alcohol-related consequences, executive functioning, negative affect, emotion regulation,
      craving for alcohol, and use of alcohol as a sleep aid.

PI Miller and study therapists will be blinded to assessment outcomes, and assessment RAs will be blinded to participant condition. All participants will be told that they are receiving treatment for insomnia in order to blind them to condition assignment (sleep hygiene will be described as &quot;brief&quot; insomnia treatment, and CBT-I will be described as the &quot;most intense&quot; treatment).</masking_description>

    <description>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I). Participants assigned to the CBT-I condition will attend 1-hour individual sessions of CBT-I once a week for five weeks. A sixth week of treatment will be included - and scheduled for the same date as the post-treatment assessment - if the participant and research team agree that it would be beneficial (e.g., if a participant has difficulty grasping cognitive therapy concepts). Consistent with clinical guidelines (Schutte-Rodin, Broch, Buysse, Dorsey, &amp; Sateia, 2008), treatment will include stimulus control (e.g., limit use of bed to sleep or sexual activity, get out of bed if lying awake for more than 20 minutes), sleep restriction (limit time in bed to amount of time spent sleeping on a typical night), sleep hygiene (e.g., avoid exercise within 2 hours of bedtime, create cool and dark sleep environment), relaxation training, and cognitive restructuring.</description>

This is the only intervention that participants assigned to the Sleep Hygiene condition will receive and is consistent with what may be expected as standard care in a doctor's visit with a primary care physician.</description>
