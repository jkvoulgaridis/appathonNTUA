      Post-authorisation / after Conformité Européene (CE) marking Coroflex® ISAR NEO is a drug
      eluting stent system which is an improved version of the predecessor device Coroflex® ISAR
      which was extensively studied in the ISAR 2000 Registry. The rationale of this observational,
      post-market, single-armed study is to confirm the safety and efficacy of Coroflex® ISAR NEO,
      also as part of the manufacturer's post-market surveillance obligations in particular for the
      re-certification of the device.

MI is defined as a new event documented with elevated cardiac enzymes during the follow-up. Elevated enzyme levels during the hospital stay are not considered as a new event.</description>

        The investigator of each study site has the responsibility of screening all potential
        patients and selecting those who fulfil the inclusion criteria of this study protocol.
        Therefore, at each site a study with similar inclusion criteria cannot be conducted while
        the recruitment of this study is in progress.

        Screening will be performed during the physical examination to verify the &quot;patient related
        enrolment criteria&quot;. The second part of the screening procedure will be completed during
        the diagnostic angiography to verify that the target lesion fulfils all &quot;lesion related
        enrolment criteria&quot;.

          -  Surgery shortly after myocardial infarction with indications of thrombus or poor
             coronary flow behavior
