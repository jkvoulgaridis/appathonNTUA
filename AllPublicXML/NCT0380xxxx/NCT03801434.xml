    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well ruxolitinib works in treating patients with
      hypereosinophilic syndrome or primary eosinophilic disorders. Ruxolitinib may stop the growth
      of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the overall hematologic response rate to ruxolitinib in patients with
      hypereosinophilic syndrome and primary eosinophilic disorders.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine safety profile of ruxolitinib in patients with hypereosinophilic syndrome and
      primary eosinophilic disorders.

      II. To determine the proportion of patients on corticosteroids who are able to become
      corticosteroid-independent and/or reduce the dose by &gt;= 50%.

      III. To evaluate the duration of response (DoR). IV. To evaluate the time-to-response (TTR).
      V. To evaluate progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the ability of ruxolitinib to elicit morphologic and cytogenetic/molecular
      remissions in patients with baseline clonal abnormalities.

      II. To assess whether hematologic responses correlate with certain types of mutations on
      myeloid mutation panel testing and/or by flow immunophenotyping of T-cells in patients with
      lymphocyte-variant hypereosinophilia.

      III. To determine whether improvement in organ damage is observed in patients with baseline
      organ dysfunction.

      IV. To determine whether improvement in symptoms is observed based on a modified
      Myeloproliferative Neoplasm Symptom Assessment Form (MPN-SAF).

      V. To evaluate biologic correlates of response including ribonucleic acid (RNA) sequencing
      (RNAseq) and JAK-STAT activation status (JAK2 and/or STAT3 phosphorylation) of eosinophils
      from whole blood and/or marrow.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive ruxolitinib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28. Treatment repeats
      for up to 6 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 4-6 weeks and every 6 months
      for up to 3 years.

    <measure>Overall response rate (ORR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>ORR is the sum of complete response (CR) plus complete response with incomplete platelet recovery (CRp) plus partial response (PR). Complete response, with platelet incomplete platelet recovery (CRp) is defined as a response that meets CR criteria but platelet count remains below 100 x 10^9/L. This outcome will be reported as a number.
Complete response (CR) = normalization of white blood cell (WBC) count; absolute eosinophil count in blood; and % eosinophils in blood, without increased blasts or eosinophils in bone marrow, and with a non-palpable spleen and/ or normal spleen size by imaging.
Partial response (PR) is defined as ≥ 50% reduction (if above normal range) in all the following: total WBC count; absolute eosinophil count in blood; % eosinophils in blood; % eosinophils and myeloblasts in bone marrow; in addition to spleen size reduction of ≥ 50% by palpation and/ or ≥35% by imaging (if increased at baseline).</description>
