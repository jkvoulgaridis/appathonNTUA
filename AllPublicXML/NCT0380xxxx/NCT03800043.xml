      This study evaluates the social impact of children's dental perception from children with or
      without caries experience. For this, children and their parents are shown pictures of child
      faces with healthy teeth, decayed teeth and teeth after dental treatment.

      Appearance and abnormalities in the face influences the life of children: attractive children
      get estimated as more competent and find friends easier than those with a less attractive
      appearance. Therefore this study aimes to evaluate the social impact of children's dental
      perception from children with or without own caries experience (and their parents). Both
      groups (with/without caries experience) are shown pictures of children with different dental
      status (healthy teeth, decayed teeth and teeth after dental treatment) and asked to complete
      established questionnaires.The division into the groups is based on photos of the children
      with visible teeth.

      The results should be evaluated descriptively and graphically. Also the comparison between
      the answers of both groups for the three different dental status is planned.
