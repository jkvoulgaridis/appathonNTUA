  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall aim of this pilot study is to evaluate the feasibility of a study protocol for a
      future stepped wedge cluster randomized clinical trial (c-RCT) that will investigate the
      effects of an innovative KT intervention on 1) walking capacity and independence in ADL in
      patients undergoing rehabilitation after stroke (patient outcomes); and 2) clinicians'
      practice (i.e. use of 4 evidence-based stroke rehabilitation interventions: motor
      imagery/mental practice, rhythmic auditory stimulation gait therapy, task oriented training
      including fitness and mobility exercises and aerobic training) (provider outcome) aimed at
      improving walking capacity. The specific objectives are: 1) To evaluate the feasibility
      (effectiveness of clinician recruitment strategies, extent of losses to follow-up across
      sites, and data analysis plans) of the study protocol in terms of methodology (stepped wedge
      design is an innovative methodology); 2) To estimate intervention effect sizes on study
      outcomes (patient and clinician); 3) To evaluate the secondary outcome (clinicians' use of
      the 4 interventions) with regard to reliability and validity.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Walking capacity is the major priority for patients after stroke. Strong research evidence
      shows that walking capacity can be improved by rehabilitation interventions such as motor
      imagery, rhythmic auditory cueing, task-oriented training and aerobic exercise. Despite
      strong evidence for the effectiveness of these interventions on walking capacity, many
      clinicians (occupational therapists (OTs) and physical therapists (PTs)) do not use these in
      their practice. This knowledge translation (KT) pilot study aims to support evidence-based
      practice amongst rehabilitation clinicians working in stroke rehabilitation and collect data
      to inform a future larger clinical trial that will investigate if having repeated exposure to
      an innovative KT intervention will: increase clinicians' use of four targeted rehabilitation
      interventions (listed above) and positively affect walking capacity and independence in daily
      activities in patients after stroke. The investigators will recruit 2-3 OTs and 2-3 PTs per
      site from 6 major inpatient stroke rehabilitation centres across Canada to participate in a
      KT intervention consisting of an interactive and readily accessible web-based platform to
      deliver evidence-based knowledge on 4 rehabilitation interventions targeting walking
      capacity. This will be done via email in short online educational capsules including
      strategies for implementing the interventions and tools to promote reflection on current and
      future practice. They will then ask clinicians for feedback on: 1) the value of the knowledge
      delivered via email; 2) their perceptions about the success of using the guidelines with
      specific stroke patients; 3) the barriers they experienced when using the platform; and 4)
      the actual benefits for their patients. Through this innovative KT intervention, clinicians
      will have an opportunity to reflect upon and subsequently modify their practice to include
      evidence-based interventions known to improve walking capacity and functional independence.

    <intervention_model_description>This is a pilot stepped-wedge c-RCT. Data collection will take place over 16 weeks at 6 sites. Patient chart data (Functional Independence Measure (FIM), Functional Ambulation Category (FAC), 6-Minute-Walk-Test) will be collected weekly at all sites. Weeks 1-12: Participants at sites 1-6 will submit a weekly Calculation of Indicators (COI). Weeks 1-12: Sites 1 and 2 will receive 4 weekly online intervention packages and submit Information Assessment Method (IAM) and COI questionnaires for 12 weeks. Weeks 5-12: Sites 3 and 4 will receive 4 weekly online intervention packages and submit IAM and COI questionnaires for 8 weeks. Weeks 9-12: Sites 5 and 6 will receive 4 weekly online intervention packages and submit IAM and COI questionnaires for a total of 4 weeks. The longest exposure to the intervention will be 3 months and the minimum will be 1 month as per stepped-wedge c-RCT design. All participants will complete a My Guideline Implementation Barometer (MGIB) questionnaire at month 4.</intervention_model_description>
