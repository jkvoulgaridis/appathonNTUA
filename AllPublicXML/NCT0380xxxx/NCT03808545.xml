  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the leading cause of irreversible neurological disability among
      young women and the second leading cause of disability among young men in the U.S.
      Cardiometabolic risk factors including obesity and hyperlipidemia are common among people
      with MS, and these risk factors are associated with severity and frequency of MS relapses and
      disease progression. People with MS often experience symptoms of pain, fatigue, and
      depression, which make adhering to a healthy lifestyle difficult, as evidenced by the high
      rates of unhealthy behaviors including poor diet and physical inactivity among this group.
      Physical activity has reduced symptoms of MS and improved metabolic risk profiles, but little
      research has focused on the role of a dietary intervention combined with physical activity in
      this group. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to test the efficacy of a combined diet
      and physical activity intervention for reducing cardiometabolic risks and MS symptoms when
      compared to a physical activity intervention alone.
