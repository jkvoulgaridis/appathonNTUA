  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Eating disorders are severe mental illnesses, mainly affecting adolescent- and young adult
      women. The prognoses for eating disorders are relatively poor, and a large part of patients
      with these illnesses do not benefit from available conventional therapies. After decades of
      research into the causes of eating disorders, there is now compelling evidence for specific
      neuropsychological difficulties in patients affected by eating disorders. These
      neuropsychological difficulties are characterized by cognitive and behavioral rigidity (poor
      set-shifting abilities), as well as difficulties related to central coherence, planning and
      impulse control. Surprisingly, few therapies specifically target these difficulties, and they
      are rarely incorporated into treatment. Cognitive Remediation Therapy has shown promising
      results as an adjunctive therapeutic intervention for patients with anorexia Nervosa. The
      primary aim of this randomized controlled trial is thus to investigate the effect of
      Cognitive Remediation Therapy on neuropsychological function, symptoms of eating disorders
      and general mental health, quality of life and motor activity in women with both eating
      disorders (transdiagnostic) and these specific cognitive difficulties.

    <description>Executive function according to the self-report questionnaire the Behaviour Rating Inventory of Executive Function, Adult (BRIEF-A). This questionnaire consist of 75 items on which the patient`s symptoms are rated on a 3-point Likert scale. The questionnaire provides a Global Executive Composite score (range 75-225) and two index scores: the Behavioral Regulation Index (range 30-90) and the Metacognitive Index (range 40-120) in addition to nine subscales: Inhibit (range 8-24), Shift (range 6-18), Emotional control (range 10-30), Self-monitor (range 6-18), Initiate (range 8-24), Working memory (range 8-24), Plan/organize (range 10-30), Task monitor (range 6-18) and Organization of materials (range 8-24).

    <description>Eating disorder behaviors (binge eating and inappropriate weight compensatory behaviors) and attitudinal features of eating disorders over the previous 28 days is measured by the Eating Disorder Examination (EDE-Q), v. 16.0. The EDE-Q includes 22-attitudinal items that are each rated using seven-point forced-choice format. The items are grouped into four clinically-derived subscales each consisting of five to eight items: Dietary restraint, Eating concern, Weight concern, and Shape concern. The score of each subscale is calculated as the average of item scores within the subscale and yields a range of 0-6. The global score is calculated as the average of the four subscale scores (range 0-6). Higher scores indicates greater pathology.</description>

    <description>Health related quality of life (HRQOL) was measured according to the Medical Outcomes Short-Form 36-Item Health Survey (SF-36v2). This questionnaire consist of 36 items on which the patient`s responses are rated on a 3-point (item 3), 5-point (item 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10 and 11) or 6-point scale (item 7). The items are organized into eight domains: Physical Functioning (PF; 10 items), Role- Physical (4 items), Bodily Pain (BP; 2 items), General Health (GH; 5 items), Vitality (VT; 4 items), Social Functioning (SF; 2 items), Role- Emotional (3 items), and Mental Health (5 items).

    <description>Nine individual transdiagnostic CRT sessions will be delivered once per week, each session lasting approximately 45 minutes. Building on previously published CRT manuals for anorexia nervosa and obesity, a transdiagnostic CRT manual developed for this project will be used during the course of CRT treatment. The manual comprises an introduction to CRT for eating disorders, and a detailed nine-session structure incorporating cognitive and behavioral tasks in the following domains; (1) planning-impulsivity, (2) flexibility-rigidity and (3) central coherence-attention to details. A certain set of guiding questions will accompany each task with the aim of stimulating metacognition (i.e. thinking about thinking).</description>

    <description>According to Norwegian guidelines established by the Norwegian Directorate of Health, the patients are likely to receive treatment focusing directly on the ED symptomatology, i.e normalization of weight in the case of underweight, reduction of binging and purging and normalization of other ED related thoughts and behaviors. Since both in-patients, patients in day treatment and out-patients will be included in the study, the number of hours with therapeutic interventions will vary. Records of the participants` received number of therapeutic hours will be logged weekly during the intervention for participants in both arms of the study.</description>
