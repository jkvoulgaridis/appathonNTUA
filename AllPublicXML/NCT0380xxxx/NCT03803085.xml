      The aim for the study is to use the function WeRun in the application WeChat to encourage
      physical activity and social engagement among community dwelling older adults and their
      family members and friends. The specific aims are to test the effectiveness of a competition
      intervention for increasing regular daily physical activity among community dwelling older
      adults, and to examine the potential effectiveness of WeChat in cultivating social engagement
      and well-being among community dwelling older adults.

      The aim for the study is to use the function WeRun in the application WeChat to encourage
      physical activity and social engagement among community dwelling older adults and their
      family members and friends. The investigators will ask participants in the activity
      competition group to use the WeRun function in WeChat to track their daily walking steps and
      to compete with their group members for 4 weeks. To encourage social engagement among their
      group members, the daily walking steps will be calculated and the participant who has the
      highest step count in the group will be indicated each day.Those in the control group will
      only use the WeRun function in WeChat to track their own walking steps.

      The investigators expect that the participants in the activity competition group will walk
      more often and report more social activities than those in the control group, who will not
      compete with their peers in daily walking. To test these predictions, daily walking steps and
      the total walking steps per week will be obtained and compared across groups. The nature and
      the extent of change will be analyzed over the four weeks. Exercise self-efficacy will be
      measured using a measure based on Bandura's model. Social engagement will be measured using
      the short Lubben Social Network Scale, a self report measure of social engagement on a
      12-item scale, and physical activity will be measured using International Physical Activity
      Questionnaire (IPAQ), a self-report measure of physical activity on a 12-item scale.

    <intervention_model_description>Both conditions will use the WeChat App for use on a smartphone. The control group will have the WeRun program to count their own steps. The experimental condition will have the WeRun to compete with each other in addition to counting their own steps.
The participants will be randomly assigned into 3 different panels, with 20 participants in each panel. Participants in each panel will be randomly assigned into two conditions with 10 participants in each condition.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ), a self-report measure of physical activity on a 12-item scale. The total score will be summed within each physical activity domain to estimate the total time spent in occupational, transport, household, and leisure related physical activity, as well as total time reported sitting per week. The total score ranges from 0 to the highest number of time (hours) that the participants can spent on physical activity. A higher score means higher level of physical activity.</description>

    <description>This scale is a self-report of exercise self-efficacy. Total score is calculated by summing the responses to each question. This scale has a range of total scores from 0-90. A higher score indicates higher self-efficacy for exercise.</description>
