      This is an open, single-arm multicentre study to confirm the efficacy and safety of a
      commercially available Remo-Wax ear drops containing allantoin for dissolving and removing
      impacted earwax. Subjects that qualify for enrollment and provide informed consent wil be
      treated with topical earwax softening product.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Written informed consent obtained.

          2. Male or female patients over 1 year old who have cerumen impaction.

          3. Presence of excessive or impacted cerumen [excessive or impacted cerumen is identified
             as causing partial (&gt; 50%) or complete occlusion of at least one ear canal when
             attempting to visualize the tympanic membrane.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Hypersensitivity to any product ingredient(s) or history of anaphylactic/anaphylactoid
             reactions.

          2. History of tympanic membrane perforation, tympanostomy tubes, or otitis externa in the
             previous 6 months.

          3. External ear infection.

          4. Middle ear infection

          5. Past ear surgery.

          6. Otorrhea.

          7. Temporal bone neoplasm.

          8. Presence of known or suspected mastoiditis.

          9. Presence of a condition or abnormality that in the opinion of the Investigator would
             compromise the safety of the patient or the quality of the data (e.g. ear eczema or
             seborrhoea, ear canal stenosis, exostoses).

         10. Deafness in the contralateral ear (single sided deafness).

         11. Use of any ototopical drug or cerumen-removal product (with the exception of water or
             physiologic saline) during the preceding 3 days.

         12. Use of hearing aids.

         13. Participation in another drug study within 60 days prior to the start of the present
             study.

         14. Predictable poor compliance or inability to communicate well with the investigator.
