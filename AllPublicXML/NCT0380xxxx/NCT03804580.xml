      This is a phase II, single-arm study to assess the safety and efficacy of osimertinib (80 mg,
      orally, once daily) as first-line therapy in patients with EGFR mutation-positive, locally
      advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who have not previously treated
      with an epidermal growth factor tyrosine kinase inhibitor agent.

      Subjects will have to provide a biopsy sample (fresh or archival) for molecular testing at
      inclusion. If feasible, a biopsy will also be sampled when partial response is achieved and
      at the time of disease progression on osimertinib. Liquid biopsies will be sampled throughout
      the treatment period.

      Subjects should continue on study treatment until RECIST 1.1-defined progression or until a
      treatment criterion is met. There is no maximum duration of treatment as subjects may
      continue to receive investigational product beyond RECIST1.1-defined progression as long as
      they are continuing to show clinical benefit, as judged by the investigator.

             analysis.

          6. Patients with untreated, mild or moderately symptomatic and measurable brain
             metastases are eligible, but will be allocated to cohort A (see excl. point 6).

             to cohort B.

          7. At least one lesion, not previously irradiated and not chosen for biopsy during the
             study screening period, that can be accurately measured at baseline according to

          8. Females should be using adequate contraceptive measures, should not be breast feeding
             and must have a negative pregnancy test prior to start of dosing if of child-bearing

             the following criteria at screening:

               -  Post-menopausal defined as aged more than 50 years and amenorrhoeic for at least
                  12 months following cessation of all exogenous hormonal treatments

               -  Women under 50 years old would be considered postmenopausal if they have been
                  amenorrhoeic for 12 months or more following cessation of exogenous hormonal
                  treatments and with Luteinizing Hormone (LH) and Follicle-Stimulating Hormone

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Previous systemic treatment against metastatic NSCLC.

          2. Major surgery within 4 weeks of inclusion

          3. Radiotherapy treatment to more than 30% of the bone marrow or with a wide field of
             radiation within 4 weeks of inclusion

          4. Subjects currently receiving (or unable to stop using) potent inducers of CYP3A4.
             Patients must stop using CYP3A4 inducers at least 3 weeks prior to treatment with
             osimertinib (see appendix A).

          5. Subjects with spinal cord compression unless they have completed definitive therapy,
             are not on steroids and have had a stable neurological status for at least 2 weeks
             after completion of definitive therapy and steroids.

          6. Any evidence of severe or uncontrolled systemic diseases, including uncontrolled
             hypertension and active bleeding diatheses, which in the investigator's opinion makes
             it undesirable for the patient to participate in the trial or which would jeopardise
             compliance with the protocol, or active infection including hepatitis B, hepatitis C
             and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Screening for chronic conditions is not
             required.

             entry.

          8. Refractory nausea and vomiting, chronic gastrointestinal diseases, inability to
             swallow the formulated product or previous significant bowel resection that would
             preclude adequate absorption of osimertinib.

          9. Exclude based on any of the following cardiac criteria:

               -  Mean resting corrected QT interval (QTc) &gt; 470 msec obtained from 3
                  electrocardiograms (ECGs), using the screening clinic ECG machine derived QTc
                  value

                  resting ECG e.g. complete left bundle branch block, third degree heart block and
                  second degree heart block

               -  Any factors that increase the risk of QTc prolongation or risk of arrhythmic
                  events such as heart failure, hypokalaemia, congenital long QT syndrome, family
                  history of long QT syndrome or unexplained sudden death under 40 years of age in

             staff at the study site).

         18. Judgment by the investigator that the subject should not participate in the study if
             the subject is unlikely to comply with study procedures, restrictions and
             requirements.
