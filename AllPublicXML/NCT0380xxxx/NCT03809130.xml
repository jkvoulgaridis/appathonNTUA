    <textblock>
      This trial studies how well Untire application intervention works in reducing cancer-related
      fatigue in cancer patients and survivors.The Untire application focuses on themes that have
      been identified as causing or contributing to cancer-related fatigue. It may provide
      information and tips to improve lifestyle, give exercises for body and mind to increase
      energy levels, offer weekly reports to measure progress, and offer access to an online
      support community.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the effectiveness of an online multidisciplinary psychological training program
      delivered via a smartphone-based application (the Untire app) in reducing patient-reported
      fatigue in cancer patients and survivors.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the dose-response association between use of the Untire app and reduction in
      patient-reported fatigue severity.

      II. To explore whether changes in positive and negative affect, depressive symptoms interact
      with the effects of the Untire app on fatigue severity.

      III. To explore the predictive value of genetic markers (single-nucleotide polymorphisms) and
      personality characteristics for effectiveness of the Untire app in reducing patient-reported
      fatigue.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients use Untire application intervention after baseline up to 6 months.

      ARM II: Patients use Untire application intervention after 3 months up to 6 months.

    <description>The effect of the intervention on fatigue will be analyzed with a generalized linear model, including CIS-20 sum score at T1 as the dependent variable, CIS-20 sum score at T0 as covariate, and group (intervention versus wait-list control) as independent variable.</description>

    <description>Change in fatigue between T0 and T1 for the intervention group and between T1 and T2 for the wait-list control group will be entered as dependent variable in multiple regression models, with group allocation as covariate. Separate models will be computed including the different app-usage metrics assessed between T0 -T1 for the intervention group and T1-T2 for the control group as independent variable. These models will additionally be calculated for change in fatigue and use of the app between T0 and T2, for patients in the intervention arm only.</description>
