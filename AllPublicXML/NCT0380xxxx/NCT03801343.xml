      Skin moisturizing and elasticizing efficacy of an amino acid food supplement
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Primary end point of this study was to evaluate the moisturizing and elasticizing activity of
      &quot;Nutrakos®&quot; Amino Acid Food Supplement, both photoexposed and not photoexposed on skin areas
      (forearm volar and dorsal surface) by non-invasive instrumental measurements; the product
      will be tested for 1 month by female subjects, aged 35-70 years with skin photoaging. An
      additional aim of this study was to evaluate the product tolerance both by investigator and
      volunteers.

    <description>Skin electrical capacitance value was measured mono-laterally on the right or left forearm (volar and dorsal surface) with Corneometer CM825 (Courage - Khazaka, Köln, Germany). The measure of the skin capacitance properties is an indirect expression of its hydration level.</description>
