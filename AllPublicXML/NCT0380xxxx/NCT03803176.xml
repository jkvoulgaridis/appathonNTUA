      Tissue Plasminogen Activator and Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor Type-1 Gene Expression will
      be evaluated clinically and histopathologically through Hematoxylin and eosin as well as by
      quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction in the gingival tissues of
      chronic periodontitis in an attempt to investigate whether the expression of these proteins
      could be involved in the disease pathogenesis or not, and to assess as well if their
      expression will be affected by the applied surgical periodontal treatment.

      30 subjects were enrolled in this study and divided into: Group I (Control Group): 10
      periodontally healthy volunteers, Group II (Chronic Periodontitis Group): 20 patients
      suffering severe CP and Group III (Treated Group): 20 patients who were scheduled for OFD.
      Gingival samples were collected from all subjects at baseline and at 3 months after OFD from
      the CP patients. Then, Hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) stained slides were examined and gene
      expression levels of t-PA and PAI-1 were measured in the gingiva through quantitative reverse
      transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).

    <description>Patients with severe Chronic Periodontitis having a pocket depth (PD) of ≥5 mm and a clinical attachment level (CAL) ≥5 mm. Open flap debridement (surgical periodontal therapy) will be carried out for these patients after scaling &amp; root planing.</description>

    <intervention_name>Open Flap Debridement</intervention_name>
    <description>Full thickness flaps are elevated to fully expose the periodontaldefects. Defects are then fully debrided and the roots are carefully planned. Flaps are repositioned and sutured to obtain primary closure of the interdental space. This will be done for chronic periodontitis patients</description>
