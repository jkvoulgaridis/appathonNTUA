      This study aims to assess the associations of maternal food timing with glucose levels during
      pregnancy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A novel line of research has emerged, suggesting that synchronizing the timing of food intake
      with body's circadian rhythms or day-night cycle has metabolic implications. Eating at the
      inappropriate time can disrupt circadian system which might induce metabolic perturbations,
      including glucose abnormalities. Recent evidence showed that circadian timing of eating was
      associated with glucose regulation in pregnant women. However, little is known about
      night-eating pattern during pregnancy, particularly the influence of nocturnal snacking on
      glycaemic control.

      This cross-sectional study aims to recruit 400 pregnant women at 18-21 weeks' gestation. The
      investigators will assess maternal dietary intake, monitor 24-hour activity-rest pattern and
      light-dark exposure, and measure glucose and insulin profiles during the second trimester of
      pregnancy. Maternal socio-demographic status, lifestyle characteristics, health conditions
      and pregnancy outcomes will be asked through interview or retrieved from medical notes.

      This study allows understanding the importance of circadian eating pattern, which is a
      modifiable behavior, in glycaemic control during pregnancy, and help to provide evidence for
      developing nutritional guidelines which can ameliorate metabolic health for mothers.
