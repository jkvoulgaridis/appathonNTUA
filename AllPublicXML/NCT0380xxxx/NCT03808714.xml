  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our preliminary data shows that 39.9% of AA men between 19 and 30 years of age who resided in
      rural Alabama smoke cigarettes. Although it has been well established that a combination of
      pharmacotherapy and advice-oriented counseling and/or cognitive behavioral interventions are
      efficacious in promoting smoking cessation across diverse populations, these evidence-based
      treatments for tobacco dependence have not proven to be effective/efficacious (or even
      accessible) among some subpopulations suffering disproportionally from tobacco-related
      morbidity and mortality. The overall goal of this feasibility study is to make adaptations to
      these evidence-based approaches, and develop, implement, and examine the feasibility and
      scalability of a theory-based, culturally relevant smoking cessation intervention for young
      adult AA men in rural Alabama who smoke cigarettes. Our formative assessments point to a
      cognitive-behavioral intervention delivered by a trained Community Health Worker with the
      support from an &quot;expert&quot; physician who can deliver the pharmacological component via Skype
      through an integrated approach. The proposed study will address the next three steps in this
      process: development of the intervention, pretesting, and feasibility. First, we will develop
      the intervention with input from a Community Advisory Committee, followed by an iterative
      process by which the target audience will be exposed to materials and messages to provide
      feedback (pretesting). Once all intervention components are finalized, we will recruit
      participants, randomly assign them to intervention/control groups, pilot test, and evaluate
      the intervention. The comparison group will be the Alabama Tobacco Quitline with 8 weeks of
      Nicotine Replacement Therapy to be consistent with the pharmacological approach proposed for
      the intervention. The primary outcome will be 7-day point prevalence abstinence (defined as
      no cigarettes in the past 7 days and verified through measurement of exhaled carbon monoxide
      levels) at 6-month follow-up. We will also conduct detailed treatment fidelity and
      scalability assessments (acceptability, feasibility, potential reach and adoption, alignment
      with the strategic context) to inform a full-scale efficacy trial.

      Despite smoking fewer cigarettes daily, African American (AA) men suffer higher morbidity and
      mortality associated with tobacco-related disorders than whites. Our preliminary data shows
      that 39.9% of AA men between 19 and 30 years of age who resided in rural Alabama smoke
      cigarettes. Although it has been well established that a combination of pharmacotherapy and
      advice-oriented counseling and/or cognitive behavioral interventions are efficacious in
      promoting smoking cessation across diverse populations, these evidence-based treatments for
      tobacco dependence have not proven to be effective/efficacious (or even accessible) among
      some subpopulations suffering disproportionally from tobacco-related morbidity and mortality.
