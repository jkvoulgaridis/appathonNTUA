    <description>In general, it is recommended using 9-10 Gy x 3 or 10 Gy x 5 fractions given every other day. Physicians should try to give the highest BED whenever possible while respecting normal tissue tolerance. All lesions are recommended to receive a biologically effective dose (BED) of 60 Gy or higher (BED10≥70), assuming α/β ratio of 10 and using the linear-quadratic model: BED = nd x [1 + d/(α/β)] where n is number of fractions and d is dose per fraction. Sometimes BED ≥80 Gy is preferred, with lower doses ≥50 Gy allowed at the discretion of the treating physician for concerns about normal tissue toxicity.</description>

             Positron Emission Tomography Response Criteria in Solid Tumors (PERCIST) documented
             progression in up to 5 individual lesions

        Using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Criteria as a guide:

          1. At least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of the lesion, taking
             as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the last imaging OR

          2. The appearance of one or more new lesions OR

             a. If the clinical scenario deem that other forms of local therapy may be more
             suitable for the metastatic disease, such as surgical resection and interventional
             radiology-guided ablation, patients would be able to undergo other forms of local
             therapy with discussion with the PI

             therapy with discussion with the PI.

          -  For patients with brain metastases and oligoprogression elsewhere where stereotactic
             radiation to the brain is warranted, the brain lesions can be treated prior to

          -  Any symptomatic metastatic sites requiring prompt palliative radiation (e.g. cord
             compression) can also be treated with standard of care radiation prior to
