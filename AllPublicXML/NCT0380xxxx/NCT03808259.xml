    <measure>Part 1: Change from Baseline in Clinician-Administered Dissociative States Scale (CADSS) Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>CADSS is an instrument for the measurement of present-state dissociative symptoms and will be administered to assess treatment-emergent dissociative symptoms. CADSS consists of 23 subjective items, divided into 3 components: depersonalization (items 3 to 7, 20, and 23), derealization (items 1, 2, 8 to 13, 16 to 19, and 21) and amnesia (items 14, 15, and 22). The participants responses are coded on a 5-point scale (from 0=not at all to 4=extremely). The total score is sum of the 23 items and range from 0 to 92 - best is 0 and worst is 92.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Part 1: Change from Baseline in Continuous Paired Associate Learning Test (cPALT) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>The cPALT will be used to assess whether drug will improve performance of complex cognitive tasks. CPAL assesses Visual episodic memory (associate learning) cognitive domain. In this task, participants must learn a series of associations between a set of difficult to verbalize patterns (amoeba) and locations. In participants, 14 pattern/location associations must be learned. In the presentation phase of the task the pattern appears at the location and the participant is required to acknowledge that they have seen the pattern by touching the location at which it appears. Patterns are presented in random order. In the learning phase of the task, participants must place each of the 14 patterns in their correct locations. They must do this in 10 rounds. The outcome is number of errors made in correctly placing each of the four patterns in their location four times (Lower score = better performance).</description>
