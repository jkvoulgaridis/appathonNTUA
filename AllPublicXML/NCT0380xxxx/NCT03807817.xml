    <measure>State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, State Version (STAI-S)</measure>
    <time_frame>5 minutes before alcohol administration, and 5 minutes after alcohol administration.</time_frame>
    <description>The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, State Version (STAI-S) is a 20-item self-report questionnaire which assesses state (i.e., current) anxiety. Participants are asked to rate the frequency with which they experience a variety of anxiety symptoms (e.g., &quot;I feel nervous and restless&quot;) on a 4-point scale (1 = almost never to 4 = almost always). Total scores (range = 20-80) are computed by summing individual item scores; higher scores indicate higher state anxiety.
The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, State Version (STAI-S) will be used to measure manifest anxiety among participants 5 minutes before, and 5 minutes after, the alcohol administration. We will specifically measure changes in manifest anxiety from pre- to post-alcohol administration by subtracting the participant's score on the STAI-S after the alcohol administration from the participant's score on the STAI-S before the alcohol administration.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Alcohol Urge Questionnaire (AUQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>5 minutes before alcohol administration, and 5 minutes after alcohol administration.</time_frame>
    <description>Urge to drink will be measured using the internally consistent, reliable, and well-validated Alcohol Urge Questionnaire (AUQ), an 8-item measure of state (current) urge to drink alcohol. Items are rated on a 7-point scale from 1 = &quot;strongly disagree&quot; to 7 = &quot;strongly agree.&quot; A total score is computed by adding responses to each of the items. Higher scores indicate a stronger urge to drink.
The Alcohol Urge Questionnaire (AUQ) will be used to measure urge to drink among participants at 5 minutes before, and 5 minutes after, the alcohol administration. We will specifically measure changes in urge to drink from pre- to post-alcohol administration by subtracting the participant's score on the AUQ post-alcohol administration from the participant's score on the AUQ pre-alcohol administration.</description>

    <measure>Amount of alcohol consumed in &quot;standard drinks&quot; (0.6 oz. ethanol equivalents, 12 oz. U.S. domestic beer, 5 oz. 12% alcohol table wine, 1.5 oz. 80-proof hard liquor)</measure>
    <time_frame>5 minutes after participating in the stressor task.</time_frame>
    <description>Amount of alcohol consumed in &quot;standard drinks&quot; (0.6 oz. ethanol equivalents, 12 oz. U.S. domestic beer, 5 oz. 12% alcohol table wine, 1.5 oz. 80-proof hard liquor) will be estimated for each participant.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Kulis, Marsiglia &amp; Nieri's (2009) Substance Use Attitudes/Expectancies Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>5 minutes before alcohol administration.</time_frame>
    <description>We will examine participants' Substance Use Attitudes and Expectancies 5 minutes before the intervention using Kulis, Marsiglia &amp; Nieri's (2009) Substance Use Attitudes/Expectancies Scale. The scale contains 12 items, rated from 1 = &quot;definitely no&quot; to 4 = &quot;definitely yes.&quot; Total scores are computed by averaging responses across items. Higher scores indicate more frequent pro-drug attitudes.</description>
