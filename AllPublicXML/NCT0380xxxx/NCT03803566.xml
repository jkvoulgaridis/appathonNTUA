  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the clinical trial is to evaluate the mediating influence of force control
      on the pegboard times of adults (50-89 years) who are stratified into groups of faster and
      slower pegboard times. The hypothesis is that practice of either a pegboard test or a
      force-control task will reduce pegboard times, but the decrease will be greater and less
      similar after the two practice interventions for the slower group of participants. The
      outcomes are expected to demonstrate that force control is a modifiable mediator of pegboard
      times for this cohort, but the effect will be stronger for the group with faster pegboard
      times.

      The study will involve a randomized, cross-over design with a one-week washout between arms.
      The two arms (3 weeks each) will comprise practice of the grooved pegboard test and practice
      of steady contractions while lifting and lowering light loads with a hand muscle.
      Randomization into practice order will be accomplished with a block approach (block size = 4)
      for each of the two groups. The outcome assessors will be blinded to practice order. The
      outcomes will comprise three tests of manual dexterity and the measurement of force control
      during submaximal contractions. The outcomes will be obtained before and after the six
      sessions in each practice arm.
