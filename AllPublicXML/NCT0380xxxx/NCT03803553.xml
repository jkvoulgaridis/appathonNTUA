    <textblock>
      This research study is comparing two standard of care treatment options based on blood test
      results for participants who have metastatic colorectal cancer.

      The names of the potential treatments involved in this study are:

        -  Active surveillance

        -  FOLFIRI treatment

        -  Nivolumab treatment

        -  Encorafenib/Binimetinib/Cetuximab treatment

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has approved FOLFIRI, comprised of
      Irinotecan, Leucovorin, and 5-Fluorouracil, as a treatment option for metastatic colorectal
      cancer in the Stage IV setting.

        -  After diagnosis and surgical removal of tumors, individuals with metastatic colorectal
           cancer commonly receive what is called adjuvant chemotherapy treatment, commonly
           utilizing treatment plans called FOLFOX, CAPOX, or therapy with 5-Fluorouracil.

        -  If all the cancer is not killed, the investigators may be able to detect tumor in the
           blood called circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA). This is genetic material unique to
           metastatic colorectal cancer that may be present in the blood stream, and it can be
           identified through a ctDNA blood test. If ctDNA is present in the blood stream, it is
           commonly called micro-metastatic disease (meaning disease that can't be seen detected by
           CT scans but may be there in the blood). Cancer researchers believe that ctDNA in the
           blood stream may be an indicator that cancer is more likely to recur.

        -  After initial adjuvant chemotherapy, it is standard for individuals to begin active
           surveillance, where they do not receive further treatment but instead undergo frequent
           tumor imaging scans to see if their cancer is stable, growing, or coming back. The
           investigators plan to see if additional therapy, where FOLFIRI (comprised of Irinotecan,
           Leucovorin, and 5-Fluorouracil) is administered can decrease recurrence. Typically,
           FOLFIRI is given when the disease is visibly recurrent.

             -  In addition, the investigators plan to include study groups of adjuvant nivolumab
                treatment and adjuvant Encorafenib/Binimetinib/Cetuximab treatment to see if these
                treatments can decrease recurrence. The FDA has not approved either of these as a
                treatment options for metastatic colorectal cancer in the Stage IV setting.

             -  Patients who have a greater than normal number of genetic markers called
                microsatellites are called MSI-H. Because tumor cells with these features tend to
                have more genetic mutations than tumor cells without them, they are more likely to
                be recognized by the immune system. Nivolumab is an anti-PD-1 antibody. It works by
                attaching to and blocking a molecule called PD-1. PD-1 is a protein that is present
                on different types of cells in your immune system and controls parts of your immune
                system by shutting it down. Antibodies that block PD-1 can potentially prevent PD-1
                from shutting down the immune system, thus potentially allowing immune cells to
                recognize and destroy cancer cells.

             -  Encorafenib in combination with binimetinib and cetuximab is one of the first
                effective regimens to target the BRAF V600E-mutation in colorectal cancer. When
                this mutation is present, it switches on pathway called the MAPK pathway which
                stimulates cell division and leads to uncontrolled cell growth. Encorafenib,
                binimetinib and cetuximab target different parts of this important signaling
                pathway in tumor cells with this mutation and slows down their growth and
                communication

      However, in this research study, the investigators are

        -  determining whether there are differences in cancer recurrence in ctDNA positive
           participants treated with additional therapy versus put on active surveillance.

        -  determining whether there are differences in health in ctDNA positive participants
           treated with additional therapy versus put on active surveillance.

        -  examining whether patients who undergo further therapy experience changes in the ctDNA
           levels.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants must have histologically confirmed resected Stage III adenocarcinoma of
             colorectal. Any T [Tx, T1, T2, T3, or T4-], N1-2MO; including NC.

          -  Patient must have completed resected disease. In patients with tumor adherent to
             adjacent structures, en block RO resection must be documented.

          -  Entire tumor must be in the colon (rectal involvement is excluded).

          -  Patients must have completed standard adjuvant chemotherapy per the discretion of the
             treating physician. Standard therapy includes FOLFOX, CAPOX, or therapy with 5FU
             analog alone will be permitted if it constitutes appropriate standard therapy in the
             opinion of the treating physician.

          -  Patients must not have received prior neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

          -  Age ≥18 years.

             (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of HCG).

          -  The effects on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason and because
             5FU, Capecitabine, Oxaliplatin, Irinotecan, Leucovorin, Nivolumab, and cetuximab are
             known to be teratogenic, females of child-bearing potential (FOCBP) and males must be
             willing to abstain from heterosexual activity or use 2 forms of effective
             contraception (fail rate of less than 1% per year, hormonal or barrier method of birth
             control) from time of informed consent until 5 months (FOCBP) and 7 months (males)
             after the last dose of study treatment. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she
             is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform
             her treating physician immediately. Women who are not of childbearing potential, ie,
             who are postmenopausal or surgically sterile as well as azoospermic men, do not
             require contraception.

          -  Patient must have documentation of mismatch repair deficiency (dMMR). Abnormal
             immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining for dMMR (MMR protein expression (MLH1, MSH2,

             following adjuvant therapy using the CLIA certified Guardant Health LUNAR assay. ctDNA
             positive will be defined as positive based on having a tumor derived signal in the
             cfDNA that passes calling threshold (&quot;ctDNA detected&quot;).

             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.

          -  Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with
             cooperation with the requirements of the trial.

             (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive
             drugs). Replacement therapy (eg., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid
             replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a
