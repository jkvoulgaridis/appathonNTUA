  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Alcohol use disorders (AUDs) are prevalent among Veterans and result in significant physical
      and psychological burden. Among those who receive treatment for AUDs, 1 in 3 relapses to
      problematic drinking within one year of treatment. Thus, additional strategies are needed to
      enhance alcohol treatment outcomes. One promising approach involves providing concurrent
      treatment for a common complaint - difficulty falling or staying asleep. Up to 74% of
      Veterans seeking treatment for AUD report co-occurring symptoms of insomnia. Given the
      negative impact of insomnia on attention and emotion regulation, insomnia symptoms may
      decrease patients' abilities to attend to alcohol treatment and manage negative emotions that
      lead to craving and relapse. Moreover, approximately 50% of individuals with AUDs report
      using alcohol to help them sleep, making relapse more likely for those with no other tools or
      skills to help them sleep. Indeed, sleep disturbance has been identified as a risk factor for
      relapse among individuals in alcohol treatment. Thus, effective treatment of sleep problems
      may enhance alcohol treatment. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I) has been
      effective in reducing insomnia severity in individuals with AUDs; however, no investigations
      have examined the efficacy of CBT-I delivered concurrently with AUD treatment to determine
      its impact on treatment outcomes. This R21 aims to examine the feasibility, acceptability,
      and initial efficacy of a CBT-I supplement to outpatient alcohol treatment. A randomized
      pilot trial with 80 Veterans who meet diagnostic criteria for AUD and Insomnia Disorder will
      be conducted. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive Cognitive Behavioral Therapy
      for Insomnia (CBT-I) or minimal treatment (educational handout only; EDU) in addition to
      alcohol treatment as usual. Outcomes will be assessed at the end of the active intervention
      period (6 weeks) and 6 weeks post-intervention. Outcomes of interest include
      recruitment/retention rates, treatment satisfaction, insomnia severity, total wake time,
      sleep quality, use of alcohol or other drugs as a sleep aid, percentage of abstinent days,
      percentage of heavy drinking days, alcohol-related problems, attention (vigilance), working
      memory, treatment-related learning, negative affect, and emotion regulation. Analyses will
      focus on size of treatment effects. Results will inform an R01 application to examine the
      efficacy, cost-effectiveness, and potential mechanisms of CBT-I in preventing or delaying
      relapse to problematic drinking among Veterans with insomnia and AUDs. This study will
      provide initial evidence that treatment of insomnia not only improves sleep but also allows
      participants to derive greater benefit from outpatient alcohol treatment.

    <measure>Impulsivity</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to post-treatment (week 6) to follow up (week 12)</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed using the Impulsive Behaviors Scale (UPPS); UPPS is a 40-item measure of impulsivity and self-control. Participants indicate on a scale of not at all (0) to very (4) if statements such as &quot;I like to stop and think things over before I do them,&quot; &quot;When I am upset I often act without thinking,&quot; and &quot;I have a reserved and cautious attitude towards life&quot; are representative of him/her. Scoring is completed by summing items in the four subscales (e.g. sensation seeking, premeditation, perseverance, urgency). Possible total scores range from 0-48 (sensation seeking), 0-40 (premeditation), 0-32 (perseverance), and 0-40 (urgency).</description>
