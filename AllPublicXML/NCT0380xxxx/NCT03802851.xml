  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine if holmium laser enucleation of the prostate (HoLEP) for the treatment of lower
      urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) and/or urinary retention alters the treatment course for
      patients concurrently diagnosed with prostate cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose a prospective trial to investigate pre-radiation holmium laser
      enucleation (HoLEP) in men with bothersome lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) and prostate
      cancer who have elected for radiation therapy as the primary treatment modality for their
      prostate cancer. The investigators hypothesize that pre-radiation HoLEP may decrease their
      overall LUTS and may decrease their need for subsequent radiation therapy. The goal with this
      study is to better understand the overlap between prostate cancer and LUTS, as well as
      determine if primary surgical treatment for the LUTS with HoLEP can also serve as a possible
      treatment modality for concurrent prostate cancer. This information may provide further
      information to inform future standard of care practices for patients with prostate cancer.

    <description>The primary object is to determine if holmium laser enucleation of the prostate (HoLEP) improves the quality of life in patients with concurrent prostate cancer who may undergo radiation therapy as well. Quality of life will be assessed using the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC) 26. This instrument evaluates patient function and bother after prostate cancer treatment using 26 items and scored on a 0-100 scale, with higher scores indicating a better health related quality of life.</description>

    <description>Holmium laser enucleation of the prostate (HoLEP) is a surgical treatment use for men with bothersome lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) to improve their LUTS. During the procedure a thin telescope-like instrument is inserted into the urethra. The high-powered laser is then inserted through this instrument and used to carefully remove the excess prostate tissue that is causing obstruction of the urethra and contributing to the patient's lower urinary tract symptoms.</description>
