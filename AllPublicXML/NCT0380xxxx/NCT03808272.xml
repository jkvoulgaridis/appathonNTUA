        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age between 18 and 75 years old(including 18 and 75 years old)

          2. Eligible for endoscopic intervention

          3. Acceptable candidate for endoscopic transluminal pancreatic pseudocyst drainage

          4. Diagnostic as symptomatic pancreatic pseudocysts ≥ 6cm in maximum diameter and
             walled-off necrosis ≥ 6cm in maximum diameter with ≥ 70% fluid content that are
             adherent to the gastric or bowel wall

          5. Patient understands the study requirements and the treatment procedures and provides
             written Informed Consent.

          6. Patient is willing to comply with all specified follow-up evaluations, including
             willingness to undergo a pre/post CT imaging study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. &lt;18 or &gt;75 years of age

          2. pseudocysts or walled-off necrosis which require nasocystic drainage,or&lt;6cm in maximum
             diameter, or walled-off necrosis &lt; 70% fluid content

          3. The fluid collection to be drained is an immature pseudocyst

          4. The fluid collection to be drained is a cystic neoplasm

          5. The fluid collection to be drained is a pseudoaneurysm

          6. The fluid collection to be drained is a duplication cyst

          7. The fluid collection to be drained is a non-inflammatory fluid collection

          8. There is more than one pseudocyst requiring drainage

          9. Abnormal coagulation: INR &gt; 1.5 and not correctable presence of a bleeding disorder;
             platelets &lt; 50,000/mm3

         10. Altered anatomy that precludes the physician's ability to deliver the stent (decision
             on a case by case basis).

         11. Intervening gastric varices or vessels within a one centimeter radius of the needle
             (visible using endoscopy or endoscopic ultrasound)

         12. Any prior true anaphylactic reaction to contrast agents, nitinol (nickel titanium),
             silicone or any other materials contacting the patient.

         13. Female of childbearing potential with a positive pregnancy test prior to the procedure
             or intends to become pregnant during the study.

         14. Currently participating in another investigational drug of device study that has not
             completed the primary endpoint or that clinically interferes with the endpoints of
             this study.
