      Objective: To evaluate the effects of recombinant Erythropoietin (rEPO) in plasma levels of
      Fibroblast Growth Factor 23 (FGF23) in End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) patients in
      hemodialysis.

      Method: Prospective cohort of ESRD patients in HD, where patients with or without rEPO
      therapy were compared. Measurements of plasma FGF23 were performed at baseline and during the
      complete study. Demographic, clinical and laboratory data will be obtained.

      Follow-up period: 12 weeks.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Experimental data has shown that recombinant erythropoietin (rEPO) increases plasma levels of
      Fibroblast Growth Factor 23 (FGF23) in murines, both health and with acute or chronic renal
      disease. Also, observational studies indicate an association between EPO and FGF23 levels in
      patients. Until now, it has not been demonstrated whether the use of rEPO does increase
      plasma FGF23 in End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) patients in hemodialysis (a population with a
      high use of this therapy for the management of chronic anemia).

      Our objective was to evaluate whether the administration of rEPO increases plasma FGF23
      levels in ESRD patients in hemodialysis.

      We performed a prospective cohort with ESRD patients without rEPO therapy. We performed 2
      groups: patients with requirements of rEPO therapy due to anemia (Hb &lt; 10 g/dL) and patients
      without rEPO therapy (Hb &gt; 10 g/dL).

      We measured plasma FGF23 (intact and C-terminal) at baseline and during 12 weeks.

      Demographic, clinical and laboratory data was obtained. Patients treated with rEPO received
      beta-epoetin (Recormon, Roche), according to current recommendations.

      Patients were follow-up during 3 months to evaluate the effects of rEPO. Our primary outcome
      was changes in plasma intact FGF23 at 12 weeks, between both groups.

    <description>Patients with ESRD in HD, and medical indication of recombinant EPO for management of anemia (Hb &lt; 10 g/dL). Ambulatory hemodialysis 3 times per week.
Recombinant beta-epoetin (Recormon) will be used, according to current recommendations.
Clinical and laboratory data will be obtained before and during the study. The primary outcome (changes of plasma intact FGF23) will be measured during the follow-up, up to 12 weeks.</description>

    <description>Patients with ESRD and HD, without medical indication of recombinant EPO (Hb &gt; 10 g/dL). Ambulatory hemodialysis 3 times per week.
Follow-up for 3 months, similar than rEPO group. Clinical and laboratory data will be obtained before and during the study, similar periods than rEPO group.
The primary outcome (changes of plasma FGF23) will be measured every 2 week during the evaluation period.</description>
