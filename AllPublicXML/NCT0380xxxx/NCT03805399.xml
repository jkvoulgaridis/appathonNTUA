      This is a Phase Ib/II, open-label, umbrella study evaluating the efficacy and safety of
      multiple targeted treatment in patients with metastatic TNBC who had disease progression
      during or following standard treatment with chemotherapy(anthracyclines,taxanes,platinums,
      vinorelbine,capecitabine,and gemcitabine included).300-400 patients will be screened and
      eligible participants will enter different treatment arms according to their molecular
      subtype (IHC staining) and FUSCC 500+ gene panel testing results. These tests would be done
      on their rebiopsy tumor specimen. Specifically, as to TNBC molecular subtyping,FUSCC data
      identified the genomic aberrations that drive each TNBC subtype by applying an integrative
      analysis combining somatic mutation, copy number aberrations (CNAs) and gene expression
      profiles, which classified TNBC patients into four subtypes, namely luminal androgen receptor
      (LAR), immunomodulatory (IM), basal-like immune suppressed (BLIS), and mesenchymal-like
      (MES). Then, FUSCC conducted a IHC subtyping model to replace complex genomic sequencing,
      which have been validated in FUSCC cohort.FUSCC 500+ gene panel was developed combining
      public database(TCGA, METABRIC, 560WES, MSKCC-IMPACT ect.) and FUSCC private TNBC
      database.New treatment arms may be added and/or existing treatment arms may be closed during
      the course of the study on the basis of ongoing clinical efficacy and safety as well as the
      current treatments available.
