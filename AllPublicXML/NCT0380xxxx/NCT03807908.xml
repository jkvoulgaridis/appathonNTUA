  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Back pain during pregnancy is common with up to 90% of pregnant women experiencing either low
      back pain (PLBP), pelvic girdle pain (PGP) or a combination of both pains. Although pregnant
      women seek out various forms of pain relief methods such as pain medication, exercise,
      education, pelvic support belts, and chiropractic treatments, there is limited evidence with
      regards to the efficacy of these treatments. Recently manual therapists, such as
      chiropractors, have used tape in an effort to relieve pain from musculoskeletal injuries with
      varying results. In the pregnant population, there have been limited studies to date on the
      role of taping and pregnancy-related back pain and none of this research delineates the
      efficacy of tape with respect to the 3 pain patterns experienced by pregnant women.

      This study is a randomized control trial with 3 main parts associated. 1) Initial visit:
      Potential participants will be recruited from 2 antenatal clinics at the participating
      hospital. A person from the circle of care will ask if they are interested in participating
      in a study regarding pregnancy-related LBP. Participants are pre-screened by a research
      investigator, If patients meet the eligibility criteria, they will be invited to participate.
      Research personnel will explain the study in full including the rationale (per the Project
      Consent Form), visit requirement, treatment protocol and follow-up. Once consent is obtained,
      a Pre-Visit Questionnaire will be administered while they are awaiting their antenatal
      appointment. 2) Physical exam and treatment: Following their appointment, research personnel
      will walk the participant to the Obstetrical Day Unit where the chiropractor will review the
      consent and questionnaire, perform a brief physical exam to ensure proper stratification of
      pain, randomized the participant (as pre-determined by the biostatistician) and apply the
      appropriate taping protocol (intervention vs sham). 3) Follow-up: Five to 7 days later,
      research personnel will follow-up with the participant by phone and administer a
      questionnaire pertaining to their experience with the taping protocol. The total visit should
      take no more than 30 minute

    <intervention_model_description>The study will be a randomized clinical trial. As none of the current research delineates the 3 pains during pregnancy, it would be beneficial to further investigate the use of tape for LBP, PGP or combined pain during pregnancy. As such, the participants will be stratified upon pain presentation (via history and physical exam) and then randomized into either a treatment or sham protocol.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking>Single (Participant)</masking>
    <masking_description>Once consent has been obtained the senior chiropractors will review the intake questionnaire with the patients, ask any pertinent questions they may have regarding the patient's personal medical history and current pain pattern and perform a physical exam to differentiate pain patterns for each participant.
Following completion of baseline assessment and consent, participants will be stratified by their type of pain presentation and then be randomly allocated to 1 of the 2 intervention arms. Central randomization will be performed using stratified block randomization by the study biostatistician (SHJ) using SAS software*. To ensure that the allocation sequence is concealed from the researchers varying block sizes of 2, 4 and 6 will be used and the biostatistician will provide the trial coordinator with 3 series (1 for each stratum) of sequentially numbered sealed opaque envelopes containing the intervention allocations.</masking_description>

    <description>The patient will be placed into maximal flexion of the lumbar spine prior to the tape being applied. The vertical strips will be applied on either side of spine, on the erector muscle group; from the lower PSIS with and end around the twelfth rib. The third strip of tape will be applied horizontally to superior to the posterior superior iliac spines (PSIS) and extend over the 2 vertical strips of tape. The tape will be gently rubbed to activate the adhesive.
Five to 7 days later, one of the investigators will follow up with the subjects over the phone and administer a questionnaire that will assess their experience with the tape as well as the outcome measures (numeric rating scale and Oswestry Disability Index).</description>
