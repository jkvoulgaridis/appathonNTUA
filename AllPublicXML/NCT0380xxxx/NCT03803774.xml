      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of birinapant when given together
      with intensity modulated re-irradiation therapy (IMRRT) in treating patients with head and
      neck squamous cell carcinoma that has come back at or near the same place as the original
      (primary) tumor (locally recurrent). Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as birinapant, work in
      different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping
      them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. IMRRT uses thin beams of radiation of
      different intensities that are aimed at the tumor from many angles. This type of
      re-irradiation therapy reduces the damage to healthy tissue near the tumor. Giving birinapant
      with IMRRT may lower the chance of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma growing or
      spreading.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Determine the toxicities and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of birinapant concurrent with
      intensity modulated re-irradiation therapy (IMRRT).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the objective response rate of patients with locoregionally recurrent head and
      neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) treated with re-irradiation and birinapant.

      II. Determine the local-regional control, progression free survival (PFS), and overall
      survival.

      III. Determine if FADD and/or BIRC2/3 copy gain in tumor tissue or in the blood are
      associated with improved response, locoregional control (LCR), progression-free survival and
      overall survival.

      IV. Determine the feasibility of detecting effects of birinapant and re-irradiation on pilot
      pharmacodynamic markers in tumor tissue, including microwestern for decrease in drug targets
      IAP1/2; increase in apoptosis/necroptosis markers caspase 3 and MLKL.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine if mutational load detected with whole exome and ribonucleic acid
      (RNA)-sequencing of tumor tissue influences objective response rate.

      II. Determine if PD-L1, CD8 T-cell tumor infiltration, TNFalpha, and other immune related
      biomarkers in tumor tissue are associated with objective response rate.

      III. Explore the pharmacokinetics of birinapant in combination with radiotherapy in blood
      samples.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of birinapant.

      Beginning on day 1, patients undergo IMRRT 5 days a week (Monday-Friday). Patients also
      receive birinapant intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days 2 and 9 of each cycle.
      Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for up to 2 cycles in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 28 days, and at 3, 6, 9, 12,
      18, and 24 months until confirmation of disease progression.

          -  Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents

          -  Patients with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial
             because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic
             dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events

             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because birinapant may have potential for
             teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk
             for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with
             birinapant, breastfeeding should be discontinued prior to enrollment

          -  Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive patients on combination antiretroviral
             therapy are ineligible because of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with

          -  Patients requiring the use of anti-tumor necrosis factor (anti TNF) therapies, such as
             infliximab, or patients who have received treatment with anti-TNF therapies within 5

             certolizumab and adalimumab, and 16 days for etanercept)
