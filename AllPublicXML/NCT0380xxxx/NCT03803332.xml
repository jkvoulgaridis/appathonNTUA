  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare two kinds of therapy for Posttraumatic Stress
      Disorder (PTSD): exposure therapy (ET) and Interpersonal Psychotherapy (IPT). The results of
      this study will allow us to see if IPT and ET are equally effective in treating PTSD due to
      Military Sexual Trauma, with the long-term goal of making PTSD treatment effective for as
      many people as possible.
