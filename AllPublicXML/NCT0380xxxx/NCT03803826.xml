  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate the possibility of optimizing the performance of
      CRT-D in non-responding patients through utilization of cardiac strain speckle tracking
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In approximately 30% of patients, cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) fails to lead to
      any improvement of the patients' status.

      In this study, an investigation of a possible method of optimization through speckle tracking
      of cardiac strains is attempted.

      Patients not responding to Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy-Defibrillators (CRT-D) after 3
      months are randomly divided into control and intervention groups. Atrioventricular interval
      is adjusted so that E and A waves do not overlap and the interventricular interval
      subsequently optimized to yield maximum improvement of the sum of
      longitudinal+radial+circumferential strains. The left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF)
      and NYHA (New York Heart Association Classification improvement 3 months after optimization
      are evaluated and use of other strain combinations assessed.

    <description>The ineffective previously implanted CRT-D is reprogrammed under supervision of transthoracic echocardiography to:
adjust the atrioventricular interval so that E and A waves do not overlap
the interventricular interval is subsequently optimized to yield maximum improvement of the sum of longitudinal+radial+circumferential strains.
Transthoracic echocardiography is performed prior to optimization and 3 months after optimization (i.e., 3 and 6 months after the CRT implantation) and and New York Heart Association Classification (NYHA Classification; total score range 1-4) is being determined in accordance with the standard NYHA methods re-programming of the interventricular interval</description>

    <description>This intervention relates to the determination of strains and atrioventricular interval and supplies data for reprogramming the ineffective CRT-D
Transthoracic echocardiography performed to determine the left ventricular ejection fraction as an outcome measure is not considered intervention here (as it is also performed in the control group and that would cause an error cross-referencing.</description>
