  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      SIFI SpA had developed Eyestil Plus®. It is sterile eyedrops without preservatives with a
      physiological pH containing sodium hyaluronate. Its intended purpose is to moisturize,
      lubricate and protect the ocular surface and gives temporary relief to burning, irritation
      and dry eye-related discomfort, and other complaints induced, for example, by: prolonged use
      of either soft, semi rigid or rigid contact lenses; exposure to environmental factors (air
      conditioning, exposure to solar radiation, wind, smoke, pollution, severe climatic
      conditions, dust); ocular fatigue caused by studying, working, driving or prolonged exposure
      to electronic devices.

      Eyestil Plus® is CE marked but not available yet in all European countries. Considering the
      European regulatory change on medical devices - from a Directive (Directive 1993/42/EEC) to a
      Regulation (MDR 2017/745) that now requires clinical evidence of device performance and
      safety; SIFI Spa decided to implement the present clinical comparative performance study. The
      choice of Vismed Multi® as the comparator has been done since it is the current French
      standard of care treatment for patients with moderate to severe dry eyes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to demonstrate the non-inferiority of Eyestil Plus® compared to
      Vismed Multi® in terms of clinical performance as detected by a reduction of keratitis
      lesions objectified by staining tests after 1 month of treatment, in patients with moderate
      to severe dry eye syndrome with keratoconjunctivitis. Secondly, the study is aimed at
      evaluating the safety profile of the product and the patients' quality of life.

    <description>the between-group comparison of the average variation of the global fluorescein corneal and lissamine green conjunctival staining using the Oxford scale (0 to 15). This refers to the average variation between both timepoints of the Global Ocular Staining Score of the study eye (GOSS) and the comparison between both treatment groups. 0-5 cornea; 0-5 temporal conjuctiva; 0-5 nasal conjunctiva.

    <measure>secondary endpoint/clinical performance by TBUT test</measure>
    <time_frame>between Day 1 and Day 35 ±4 and Day 1 and Day 84 ±7</time_frame>
    <description>The between-group comparisons of the average variation of the time obtained at the TBUT test. This full procedure will be performed 3 times per eye and per time point. At screening and at baseline visits, the sum of these 3 times for at least one eye to be eligible must be ≤ 30 seconds.
Conventionally TBUT's measures shorter than 10 seconds can be referred to tear film instability and measures shorter than 5 seconds, usually, are undoubtable sign of dry eye. The longer it takes, the more stable the tear film. A short TBUT is a sign of poor tear film. A positive number change from baseline indicates an increase in TBUT (improvement) and a negative number change from baseline indicates a decrease in TBUT (worsening).</description>

    <time_frame>test between Day 1 and Day 84 ±7</time_frame>
    <description>The between-group comparisons of the average variation of the paper length obtained at the Schirmer test. The Schirmer test without anesthesia will be here performed to measure the rate of secretion of tears produced by the study eye over 5 minutes.The cut-off value for a severe dry eye in the first one is 6 mm. But the cut-off that will here use will be 9 mm with the following interpretation:
Normal = ≥ 10 millimeters (mm) of tears,
Dry Eye = ≤ 9 mm of tears A positive number change from baseline indicates an increase in tears (improvement) and a negative number change from baseline indicates a decrease in tears (worsening).</description>

    <measure>secondary endpoint/patient symptoms by Ocular Symptoms Disease Index (OSDI) score</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 and Day 35 ±4 and Day 1 and Day 84 ±7</time_frame>
    <description>The between-group comparisons of the average variation of Ocular Symptoms Disease Index (OSDI) score. The patient's dry eye symptoms will be assessed with the Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI). It is a validated 12-questions scale for patients that covers a broad spectrum of ocular surface symptoms, the severity of such symptoms for patients and how these symptoms affect/impact visual function over a 1-week recall period. Its scores range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating greater severity of disease.Positive result is considered when the OSDI score is ≥ 18.To be consistent with the IMD indication, patient with moderate to severe dry eye thus with an OSDI ≥ 18 will be selected. If the patient's OSDI score will be strictly below 18 at the screening or baseline visit, s/he will be considered as a screening failure.</description>

    <description>The between-group comparisons of the average variation of Dry Eye-Related Quality-of-Life (DEQS) questionnaire. It is a validated 15-item scale divided into 2 subscales related to dry eye symptoms and its influence on daily life:
The frequency is scored on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (no symptom) to 4 (highest frequency).
• The degree is scored on a 4-point Likert scale ranging from 1 to 4, a larger number indicates a greater burden.
