  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical investigation is to evaluate the accuracy of the Eversense®
      continuous Glucose Monitoring System (Eversense® 180 CGM System) measurements when compared
      with reference standard measurements up to 180 days of sensor use.

      The investigation will also evaluate safety of the Eversense® 180 CGM System usage.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Adult subjects, age ≥18 years

          2. Clinically confirmed diagnosis of diabetes mellitus for ≥1 year

          3. Subject has signed an informed consent form and is willing to comply with protocol
             requirements

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. History of unexplained severe hypoglycemia in the previous 6 months. Severe
             hypoglycemia is defined as hypoglycemia resulting in loss of consciousness or seizure

          2. History of diabetic ketoacidosis requiring emergency room visit or hospitalization in
             the previous 6 months

          3. Subjects with gastroparesis

          4. Female subjects of childbearing capacity (defined as not surgically sterile or not
             menopausal for ≥ 1 year) who are lactating or pregnant, intending to become pregnant,
             or not practicing birth control during the course of the study.

          5. A condition preventing or complicating the placement,operation, or removal of the
             Sensor or wearing of transmitter, including upper extremity deformities or skin
             condition.

          6. Symptomatic coronary artery disease; unstable angina; myocardial infarction, transient
             ischemic attack or stroke in the past 6 months; uncontrolled hypertension
             (systolic&gt;160 mm Hg or diastolic &gt;100 mm Hg at time of screening); current congestive
             heart failure; history of cardiac arrhythmia (benign PACs and PVCs allowed). Subjects
             with asymptomatic coronary artery disease (e.g. CABG, stent placement or angioplasty)
             may participate if negative stress test within 1 year prior to screening and written
             clearance from Cardiologist documented.

          7. Hematocrit &lt;30% or &gt;60%

          8. History of hepatitis B, hepatitis C, or HIV

          9. Current treatment for a seizure disorder unless written clearance by neurologist to
             participate in study

         10. History of adrenal insufficiency

         11. Currently receiving (or likely to need during the study period): immunosuppressant
             therapy; chemotherapy; anticoagulant/antithrombotic therapy (excluding aspirin);
             glucocorticoids (excluding ophthalmic or nasal). This exclusion does include the use
             of inhaled glucocorticoids and the use of topical glucocorticoids (over sensor site
             only); antibiotic for chronic infection (e.g. osteomyelitis, endocarditis)

         12. A condition requiring or likely to require magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)

         13. Known topical or local anesthetic allergy

         14. Known allergy to glucocorticoids

         15. Any condition that in the investigator's opinion would make the subject unable to
             complete the study or would make it not in the subject's best interest to participate
             in the study. Conditions include but are not limited to psychiatric conditions, known
             current or recent alcohol abuse or drug abuse by subject history, a condition that may
             increase the risk of induced hypoglycemia or risk related to repeated blood testing.
             Investigator will supply rationale for exclusion

         16. Participation in another clinical investigation (drug or device) within 2 weeks prior
             to screening or intent to participate during the study period

         17. The presence of any other active implanted device (as defined further in protocol)
