      This is a randomized, multicenter, phase II study of with nab-paclitaxel plus gemcitabine or
      gemcitabine alone for the treatment of chemotherapy-naïve patients with locally advanced or
      metastatic pancreatic cancer.

      Arm 1: Nab-paclitaxel plus gemcitabine Arm 2: Gemcitabine alone

      Arm 1:

      Nab-paclitaxel 125 mg/m2 as 30- to 40-minute infusion (maximum infusion time not to exceed 40
      minutes) once weekly for 3 weeks followed by a week of rest. plus Gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 as a
      30- to 40-minute infusion (maximum 40 minutes) once weekly for 3 weeks followed by a week of
      rest.

      OR

      Arm 2:

      Gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 as a 30- to 40-minute infusion (maximum 40 minutes) administered
      weekly for 7 weeks followed by a week of rest (8-week cycle; cycle 1 only), followed by
      cycles of weekly administration for 3 weeks (on days 1, 8, and 15) followed by one week of
      rest (4-week cycle).

      All patients will be considered for available second-line therapies or best supportive care
      on the discretion of the investigators.

EORTC QLQ-C30 scores will be calculated every four weeks following the EORTC QLQ-C30 recommendations for calculations and scoring (EORTC QLQ- C30 published manual).</description>

             currently in complete remission, or any other form of cancer from which the patient
             has been disease-free for 5 years.

          9. Lack of physical integrity of the upper gastrointestinal tract or malabsorption
             syndrome.

         10. Known, existing uncontrolled coagulopathy.

         11. Pre-existing sensory neuropathy &gt; grade 1.

         12. Major surgery within 4 weeks of the start of study treatment, without complete
             recovery.

         13. Concurrent/pre-existing use of coumadin. 14. Patients older than 76 years of age.
