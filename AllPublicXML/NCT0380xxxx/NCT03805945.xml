  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to investigate whether dexmedetomidine used in the
      perioperative period of elective cesarean section can improve maternal mood, improve
      analgesic effect, improve maternal recovery quality, and then make the breastfeeding
      better.At the same time, this experiment attempts to explore the optimal dose of
      dexmedetomidine to produce the above effect.

      After obtaining the informed consent, parturients were randomly divided into two groups
      according to the computer-generated random number table, namely, dexmedetomidine group and
      the control group.Spinal anesthesia is administered to all maternal women undergoing elective
      cesarean delivery. Immediately after the umbilicus is cut, the infusion of the experimental
      drug was started until the end of the operation, and the PCIA pump with the study medication
      is used during 2 days postoperatively.Continuous follow-up for three days after
      surgery.Follow-up personnel recorded LATCH score, VAS score, quality-of-recovery score and
      other indicators.In the 6th week after caesarean section, the outcome indicators were
      collected by electronic questionnaire and telephone follow-up.This randomized controlled
      trial is aims to prove that dexmedetomidine, used in parturient with elective cesarean
      section, can improve maternal mood and prolong the duration of breastfeeding.

    <measure>Postpartum depression at sixth week after caesarean section</measure>
    <time_frame>6th week postpartum</time_frame>
    <description>The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale(EPDS) was used to determine the presence of postpartum depression through an electronic questionnaire in the sixth week after delivery.
The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale(EPDS) consists of 10 items. According to the severity of the symptoms, each item is scored in 4 levels (0, 1, 2, 3 points) with a cumulative maximum score of 30 points.In order to reduce the rate of missed diagnosis, we refer to the previous literature and use 10 points as the diagnostic threshold for postpartum depression. A score of 10 or more is considered as postpartum depression.</description>

    <description>Self-reported exclusive breastfeeding at sixth week postpartum by telephone follow-up.If exclusive breastfeeding is discontinued, obtain the point of discontinuation.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale(HADS) score</measure>
    <time_frame>Preoperative, 1st day and 2nd day postpartum</time_frame>
    <description>Referring to the preoperative HADS score, the HADS on the second day after caesarean section were analyzed to judge the maternal emotional changes.
The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) includes two subscales of anxiety and depression, 7 questions per subscale, and 14 questions in total.Each question is divided into 4 score levels according to the severity (0, 1, 2, 3 points). The anxiety and depression subscales all use 8 points as the diagnostic threshold, and 8 or more points are considered to have anxiety or depression.
The statistical analysis of this outcome indicator is mainly to regard the scale score as a continuous variable rather than a binary variable.</description>

    <measure>VAS score after cesarean section</measure>
    <time_frame>6,12,24 and 48 hours after cesarean section</time_frame>
    <description>The basic method of Visual Analogue Scale(VAS) is to use a ruler with a length of about 10 cm, the ruler is marked with 10 scales, and the ends are &quot;0&quot; and &quot;10&quot; respectively. &quot;0&quot; indicate no pain, and &quot;10&quot; indicate unbearable pain. Ask the parturient to mark the position on the ruler that represents her pain level. Follow-up personnel record pain scores based on the location of the marker.</description>

    <measure>Quality-of-recovery score</measure>
    <time_frame>Preoperative, 1st day and 2nd day postpartum</time_frame>
    <description>Recovery quality assessment on the second day after delivery via the ObsQoR-11 scale.
The ObsQoR-11 scale focuses on the following 11 items: nausea or vomiting, shivering, dizzy, in control, comfortable, able to hold baby, mobilising alone, personal hygiene, able to feed/nurse baby, moderate pain and severe pain. According to different degrees, each item can be divided into 0-10 points.</description>
