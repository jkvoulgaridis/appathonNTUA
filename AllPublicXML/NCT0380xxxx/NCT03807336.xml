  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children with externalizing and internalizing symptoms has been linked to poor emotional
      competence, problematic understanding and regulation of emotions. A number of recent studies
      demonstrates the importance of parents' active involvement in the child's recovery process
      and support the empirical relationship between parenting style and child symptoms. Emotional
      awareness and acceptance of painful emotional experience in parents leads to reduction in how
      these emotions are experienced in response to stressors in children. This makes the parent
      less vulnerable to rumination or suppression of negative emotional experience related to the
      child. In addition, it releases parents' emotional capacity to be mentally present and
      emotionally available for their child. Although neuro-affective principles from research have
      been incorporated in the therapeutic approaches for adults, there are currently no programs
      that target these mechanisms in working with children with mental health difficulties.
      Emotion Focused Skills Training (EFST) is an easily administrated, cost efficient treatment
      program specifically directed towards the parental role in promoting change in children. In
      this randomized controlled trial, we will compare experiential process oriented EFST with a
      psycho-educational version of EFST on parents of children aged 6-13 with externalizing or
      internalizing symptoms. Parents of 236 children will receive a two days course and 6 hours of
      individually delivered treatment within a 10 weeks period, either with the experiential
      version of EFST or the psycho-educational version. Feedback regarding outcome on
      externalizing and internalizing problems will be obtained from parents and teachers at 5
      different periods: baseline, treatment completion and at 3, 6 and 9 months follow-up.
