  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study will test a laboratory test called Film-Array Gastrointestinal (GI)
      Panel. This GI Panel is a test that can identify the bacteria or viruses that may cause
      diarrhea. This test will enable the ED doctor to better understand the cause of diarrhea to
      try to determine the best treatment.

      The primary objective of this study is to determine if testing ED patients who complain of
      diarrhea will lead to more optimal use of antibiotics. Optimal use of antibiotics is defined
      as the most appropriate antibiotic to treat a specified pathogen.
