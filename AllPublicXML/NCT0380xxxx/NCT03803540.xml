  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Human microbiota is the set of microorganisms that, in a symbiotic way, coexist and develop
      in the different surfaces (skin and mucous membranes) of the human body. It is estimated that
      it is composed of approximately 10^14 bacteria and other unicellular life forms . The
      gastrointestinal (GI) tract is the organ in which the microbiota reaches its greatest
      complexity, influencing its metabolic activities in different organs and human systems.

      Human microbiota plays a role in multiple homeostatic and physiological functions including
      energy and intermediary metabolism, normal immune responses, and even appropriate bowel
      development and nervous system functioning. Given its vascular supply, the liver plays
      important roles in metabolism and immunological functions. It receives 70% of blood supply
      through the portal vein which carries all metabolic products derived from GI microbiota.

      Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common cause of chronic liver disease
      in developed countries (with an estimated prevalence around 25 - 40% of adults) and it is
      expected that the burden of disease will increase in the near future. This condition can
      progress through a spectrum of progressive liver damage to non alcoholic steatohepatitis
      (NASH), liver fibrosis, cirrhosis and liver cancer. Around 20-30% of NAFLD patients develop
      NASH, with a lower rate progressing further to fibrosis and cirrhosis. Currently, there is no
      approved pharmacological or interventional treatment for the management of this so prevalent
      disease, apart from changes in lifestyle aiming weight loss.

      The aim of the present pilot study is to assess the efficacy and safety of microbiota
      manipulation by means of Fecal Microbiota Transplantation in the treatment of patients with
      NASH.
