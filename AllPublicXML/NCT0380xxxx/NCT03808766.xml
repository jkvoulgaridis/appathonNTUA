  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the commonest solid malignancies in Hong Kong as
      well as globally. Transarterial therapy has been playing an important role in the treatment
      algorithm for patients with HCC. The primary purpose of transarterial therapy is eradication
      of the viability of the targeted tumors. The treatment outcomes have been variable among the
      various treatments, in general, there is still much room for improvement, especially for
      large size tumors. From the studies on Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), it is known
      that the treatment outcome is affected by the nature and the formulation of therapeutic
      agents that are delivered, which is related to the angioarchitecture of the tumor. Knowledge
      on the angioarchitecture of HCC is essential for the understanding of the requirements for
      effective transarterial treatment of HCC. This prospective study is aimed to study the
      angioarchitecture of HCC.

      Embolization is performed within 2 weeks before the scheduled date of partial hepatectomy.
      The purpose of the timing is two folded, it allows observation of the embolization effect to
      be differentiated among the various embolic agents, it also allows time for the patient and
      the liver to recover from the embolization.

      The patient then receives partial hepatectomy within 2 weeks unless the result of liver
      function tests shows contraindication to surgery, in which case the liver function test is
      further evaluated on a weekly basis until the findings are acceptable, and surgery is
      scheduled accordingly.
