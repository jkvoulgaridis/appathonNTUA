    <textblock>
      This is an investigator-initiated, one-armed, phase 2 clinical trial using an injectable
      fluorescent tracer to assay and evaluate measured plasma volume (mPV) and measured glomerular
      filtration rate (mGFR) in hospitalized patients with acute decompensated congestive heart
      failure (CHF).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This investigator-initiated, one-armed study is designed to evaluate the safety and function
      of the FAST PV and mGFR Technology in patients with CHF. Data from the FAST PV and mGFR
      Technology will not be evaluable by the treating physician, but will be made available to the
      study investigators and to an adjudication committee.

      Patients enrolled in the study will be administered the day 1 dose of visible fluorescent
      injectate (VFI) within 48 hours of hospital admission and the day 3 dose approximately 48
      hours after the initial dose.

      After consenting to be enrolled in the study, patients meeting the enrollment criteria will
      receive a single dose of VFI within 48 hours of admission. Blood draws (3 mL) will be
      collected pre-dose and at 15, 30, 60, and 180 minutes post-dose, which will be subsequently
      used to determine the patient's blood volume and mGFR using the FAST PV and mGFR Technology.
      Patients will be treated according to standard of care throughout the time of their
      hospitalization. A second dose of VFI will be administered 48 (+/- 5) hours after the initial
      dosing. Again, blood draws (3 mL) will be collected pre-dose and at 15, 30, 60, and 180
      minutes post-dose.

      Study-related blood samples will be obtained on days 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 to measure serum
      creatinine (days 1-5), hematocrit (days 1, 3), and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide
      (NT-pro-BNP), creatine phosphokinase (CPK), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate
      aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin total and direct, and international
      normalized ratio (INR) (days 1, 3, and 5); and will be stored for future testing of
      additional parameters in the research fields of acute decompensated heart failure and acute
      kidney injury.

      The available laboratory values from routine clinical practice will be entered in the Case
      Report Form (CRF).

      On days 1-5, the patient will be asked to complete a patient symptom assessment sheet.

      On days 1 and 3, the treating physician will be asked to complete a brief survey to provide a
      qualitative assessment of the patient's perceived intravascular volume status and renal
      function. The study physician will conduct a noninvasive clinical assessment of the patient
      on days 1-5. In addition, the study physician will record in the CRF detailed information
      regarding diuretics dosage.

      Laboratory values and assessments will be captured on each day that the VFI is administered,
      and these data will be entered into the CRF. Any adverse events (AEs) determined by the
      investigator to be related or possibly related to the VFI will be captured. Patients will
      receive a followup phone call 7 days (± 2 days) after the second dose of VFI was
      administered, and a second followup call 30 days after the second dose of VFI was
      administered. This second phone call will serve as the end-of-study followup call. Any AEs
      determined by the investigator to be related or possibly related to the VFI will be captured
      during the followup calls and will be followed to resolution. Additionally, in-person
      followup visits may be scheduled as determined by the investigator. During days 1-5, during
      followup phone calls or study visits, and through information assessed within the hospital
      computer system or obtained from treating physicians or relatives, the following study
      outcomes will be recorded: mortality, length of hospital stay, readmission for heart failure,
      episodes of acute kidney injury, requirement of fluid resuscitation, episodes of symptomatic
      hypotension, and successful reduction of body weight.

      Upon conclusion of the study, the recorded clinical data will be provided to an independent
      data adjudication committee (DAC) in a pseudonymized fashion. The DAC will be asked to review
      the available data at the time of the first dosing, and the measured GFR and PV data for the
      first dosing day will be provided. The DAC will then be asked to fill out a survey asking
      whether the mGFR and PV data would have influenced their treatment decision, and if so,
      indicate what they would have done differently.

      Following the evaluation of mGFR and PV data at the time of the initial VFI dose, the mGFR
      and PV data determined from the second VFI dosing point will be provided to the DAC. The DAC
      will then be asked to fill out a separate survey asking how the actual measured PV and GFR
      differ from the clinical assessments, whether the mGFR and PV data would influence their
      treatment decision, and if so, indicate what they would have done differently.

      After all assessments have been completed, the DAC will review the results of their analyses
      and compile a summary report on the secondary endpoints as well as their assessment of the
      overall impact of the PV and mGFR on clinical decision making.
