  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Laparoscopic gastrectomy has fewer infectious complications compared to open surgery.
      Recently, the incidence of postoperative infectious complications was greatly reduced due to
      the development of surgical techniques and improvement of prevention and control of surgical
      infection. Previous multicenter, phase II study (KSWEET-01) revealed that the incidence of
      infectious complications of laparoscopic gastrectomy without prophylactic antibiotics was not
      significantly higher than previously reported data.

      Therefore, this study aim to prove the safety of totally laparoscopic distal gastrectomy
      without prophylactic antibiotics, specially reference to the postoperative infectious
      complications.

      The purpose of this study was to investigate the non-inferiority of incidence of infectious
      complications in the experimental group that did not use prophylactic antibiotics compared to
      the control group using prophylactic antibiotics.

      The primary endpoint is the incidence of surgical site infections within 30 days after
      surgery and the difference limit of the non-inferiority of the experimental group is assumed
      to be - 0.05 (5%). Assuming that the incidence of postoperative infectious complications in
      the control group is 5% and the incidence of infectious complications in the experimental
      group is assumed to be about 8%. It is assumed that the significant level is 5% and the power
      is at least 80%.

      According to the above method, a total of 260 patients (130 patients in each group) are
      needed when 117 patients are needed in each group and about 10% of drop rates and protocol
      violence are considered.
