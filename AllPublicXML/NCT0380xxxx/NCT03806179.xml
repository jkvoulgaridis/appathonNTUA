  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a Phase 1b, open-label, single arm dose escalation study of Betalutin followed
      by rituximab in patients with previously treated follicular lymphoma. The purpose of this
      study is to characterise the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and
      preliminary anti-tumour activity of Betalutin in combination with rituximab.
