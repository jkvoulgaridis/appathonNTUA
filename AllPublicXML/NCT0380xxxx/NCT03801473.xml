      The aim of this study is to compare conventional neurorehabilitation with robot-assisted gait
      training program in terms of fatigue, anxiety, depression and quality of life.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gait disturbances are common in Multiple Sclerosis (MS) patients. Nowadays, gait training
      with robot assisted technology is used for rehabilitation. In several studies conventional
      rehabilitation was compared with robot assisted rehabilitation program, and they found no
      superior effects of robot assisted walking program. In this study we aimed to compare these
      modalities in terms of fatigue, anxiety and quality of life.

    <description>The MSQOL-54 is a multidimensional health-related quality of life measure that combines both generic and MS-specific items. This 54-item instrument generates 12 subscales along with two summary scores, and two additional single-item measures. The subscales are: physical function, role limitations-physical, role limitations-emotional, pain, emotional well-being, energy, health perceptions, social function, cognitive function, health distress, overall quality of life, and sexual function. The summary scores are the physical health composite summary and the mental health composite summary. The single item measures are satisfaction with sexual function and change in health.</description>
