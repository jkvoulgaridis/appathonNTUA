  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The yearly incidence of soft-tissue sarcomas(STS) in the USA is roughly 11,280 cases, and
      metastatic STS have a median overall survival of about 12 months. After the standard 1st line
      chemotherapy with doxorubicin, the only a few treatment option is available. Recently,
      pemetrexed, a novel multitargeted antifolate, has shown modest activity as a single agent
      lung cancer and mesothelioma. In patients with refractory STS, pemetrexed is well tolerated
      and moderately effective. Based on the background, investigators planned to conduct the phase
      II trial of pemetrexed in combination with cisplatin for metastatic/recurred soft-tissue
      sarcomas.

    <description>Patients with metastatic sarcoma who underwent one chemotherapy regimens are treated with the combination of pemetrexed and cisplatin, and the treatment is repeated until the disease progression. pemetrexed 500 mg / m2 (day 1) and cisplatin 75 mg / m2 (day 1) are intravenously injected. 21 days is one cycle, and it is carried out by co-administration up to 6 cycles. After 7 cycles, intravenous injection of pemetrexed alone at intervals of 3 weeks until disease progression.</description>
