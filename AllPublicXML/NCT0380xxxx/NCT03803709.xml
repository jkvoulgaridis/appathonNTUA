  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The alcohol problem affects 7.5% of the population in Europe and represents a major public
      health problem. Alcoholism is also a major cause of undernutrition. Diet is a major factor
      influencing the composition of the intestinal microbiota and previous studies, carried out at
      Saint-Luc clinics and catholic university of Louvain, show that alcoholic patients suffer
      from dysbiosis, that is a significant alteration of the gut microbiota. The investigator's
      preliminary studies, carried out at the Integrated Unit of Hepatology of Saint-Luc Clinics,
      have shown that alcohol represents more than 40% of total caloric intake in alcohol-dependent
      patients. In addition, alcoholic patients have an insufficient intake of dietary fiber, that
      is to say a contribution lower than the Belgian nutritional recommendations. Indeed, the
      Conseil Supérieur de la Santé recommends a total amount of dietary fiber equal to or greater
      than 25 grams per day to ensure correct intestinal function. Fructan-type dietary fiber
      (inulin and fructo-oligosaccharides) is found naturally in many fruits and vegetables
      (Jerusalem artichokes, asparagus, artichokes, onions, garlic, chicory roots, bananas). They
      are neither absorbed nor digested by human enzymes but fermented selectively by intestinal
      bacteria.

      A good digestive tolerance to dietary fiber supplementation has been observed in healthy
      subjects as well as in obese patients, in previous studies conducted at catholic university
      of Louvain and Saint-Luc clinics. However, a nutritional rebalance via fiber supplementation
      and digestive fiber tolerance have never been tested in an alcohol-dependent population.

      The primary objectives of this academic research project in nutrition, carried out in
      alcohol-dependent patients, are as follows:

        1. restore a nutritional balance as recommended by the Conseil Supérieur de la Santé via a
           dietary fiber intake

        2. to study digestive tolerance to fibers

        3. to study the intestinal and psychological well-being related to a fiber intake

      Depending on the results obtained during the achievement of the primary objectives, the
      biological samples (blood, stool) collected during the study will be used to analyze the
      composition of the intestinal microbiota and the plasma markers associated with intestinal
      function.

    <description>This tool is based on the one adapted to alcoholic patients at Saint Luc Hospital. It consists of two parts to allow cross-checking of data (redundancy) and to measure separate information:
General: it is implemented a Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) in order to investigate the general diet profile.
Daily: it resumes the sequencing of a full day which allows to verify the information previously obtained as well as to precisely identify the moments of consumption of alcoholic and non-alcoholic inputs.
This 7-day recall will be carried out at two times: week T1 for reminder of the week before hospitalization then T2 for reminder of the week back home. In this last case, this anamnesis will be done by interview, but also on the basis of the diary filled by the patient in T2, in order to optimize the accuracy of the data.</description>

    <description>This questionnaire makes it possible to further investigate the patient's diet before the episode of alcoholism in his adult and child life. The aim is to assess whether it is closer to a healthy diet (Mediterranean diet or dash diet) or a Western diet type. It is based on the recall technique and performed by a qualified dietician.</description>
