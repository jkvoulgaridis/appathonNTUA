  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Assisted reproductive techniques (ART) is very framed in France by principles initially
      stated by the french CECOS Federation of (Centre d'Etude et de Conservation des Oeufs et du
      Sperme) and then included in the bioethic law. Since 1973, more than 50 000 births have been
      achieved through sperm donation, and the investigators have little knowledge of what
      information parents pass on to their children about how they have conceived. However, it is
      accepted that the secrecy about the use of donated gametes has negative consequences.

      The investigators propose an original project never initiated in France, to evaluate at the
      national level the disclosure to the people conceived using donated gametes, thanks to an
      interdisciplinary research crossing medical approach (biology, psychology) and social
      sciences (anthropology, sociology). It uses a quantitave and qualitative approach relying on
      one hand on online questionnaires and on the other hand on semi-structured interviews, aimed
      at parent who have used ART with donated gametes and people conceived using donated gametes.
      This dual approach will outline broad trends in sharing information about the use of donated
      gametes, explore in depth the motivation of parental choices for information, and better
      understand the family and biographical dynamics associated with information sharing or its
      absence. Moreover, this project will lead to evaluate the way in which the parents received
      the messages of the professionnals involved in ART with donation gametes, in terms of
      disclosure to offspring.

      The conclusions will highlight the most important elements that will be useful to the
      professionnals involved in gamete donation to help them improve their practices upstream,
      during, and after the completion of the ART with gamete donation.

    <description>An internet platform dedicated to the anonymous survey will be set up by the communication department and the digital System Department of the promoter Public assistance hospitals in Marseille.
A first questionnaire will be for the parents, the second questionnaire will be for people born through a donation. They will include closed questions, drop-down menus and rare open questions. The succession of questions will be studied in order to check the consistency of the answers. Replies to the questionnaires can be extracted anonymously.
The interviews will seek to collect data on the modalities, conditions and effects of the circulation (or retention) of information on the use of donation, throughout the lives of individuals and families, in a cross-analysis of Viewpoints of parents and people born of Don.
A cross-analysis of quantitative and qualitative data will be carried out.</description>

    <description>An internet platform dedicated to the anonymous survey will be set up by the communication department and the digital System Department of the promoter Public assistance hospitals in Marseille, the data Processing manager. It would deplore anonymous questionnaires accessible from a dedicated web page. People will therefore respond to a national survey on the basis of volunteering and anonymity.
Interviews, lasting one to two hours, will be fully transcribed and processed anonymously.
The interviews will seek to collect data on the modalities, conditions and effects of the circulation (or retention) of information on the use of donation, throughout the lives of individuals and families, in a cross-analysis of Viewpoints of parents and people born of donation.</description>
