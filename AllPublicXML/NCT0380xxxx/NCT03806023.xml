    <textblock>
      Most individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI) have residual nerve circuits. The
      investigators aim to strengthen those circuits to improve motor recovery after injury. To do
      this, the investigators are attempting to pair electrical and magnetic stimulation with
      physical training targeted toward the connections between nerve circuits. Past studies by
      other groups have shown that synapse strength can be improved temporarily after a short
      period of paired stimulation between the brain (motor cortex) and the peripheral nerves
      serving target muscles - in other words, &quot;Fire Together, Wire Together&quot;.

      The brain's intention to move a muscle can be read by recording surface electrical activity
      over target muscles (electromyography or EMG). In animal models of SCI, scientists have
      successfully used target muscle EMG to trigger spinal cord electrical stimulation pulses
      while the animals perform physical exercises. Using the body's own signals to trigger nerve
      stimulation is called &quot;closed-loop stimulation&quot;. This might be an optimal method to
      coordinate brain and nerve activity, especially with the clinical advantage of being possible
      to combine with physical exercise training. However, whether EMG-triggered closed loop
      stimulation has the same amount of effect when applied non-invasively in humans is still
      unknown.

      This proposed study is a proof-of-principle to demonstrate the potential of non-invasive
      closed-loop stimulation in humans with incomplete cervical SCI. We will test different
      combinations of triggered and non-triggered electrical and magnetic stimulation, and record
      the short-term effects on nerve transmission and skilled function of hand muscles. This pilot
      study will be a foundation for future studies combining EMG-triggered stimulation with
      long-term physical exercise training.

    <textblock>
      In both animal models and humans with spinal cord injury (SCI), synaptic efficacy between
      corticospinal axons and spinal motor neurons has improved temporarily after a short period of
      paired stimulation between motor cortex and spinal or peripheral sites. In a demonstration of
      closed-loop stimulation in SCI rats, target muscle electromyography (EMG) signals were used
      to trigger spinal cord electrical stimulation while performing physical retraining. Results
      showed that EMG-triggered stimulation plus physical retraining led to greater motor recovery
      than non-triggered stimulation or physical training alone. However, these studies used
      invasive direct spinal cord stimulation in rodent models. Whether this approach can work
      non-invasively in humans remains unknown.

      Twenty participants (10 able bodied and 10 SCI subjects) will be recruited. Each subject will
      undergo five different 20-minute interventions. Stimulation will be delivered at the motor
      cortex via transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), the median nerve, or both. Stimulation
      will occur either while the subject is passively at rest or triggered by reaching endogenous
      EMG threshold during a pinch task. Outcomes will be measured at baseline and every 20 minutes
      for one hour after the intervention.

      The investigators hypothesize that for at least 20 minutes after stimulation, one session of
      EMG-triggered stimulation will significantly improve motor evoked potential amplitude,
      increase cortical silent period duration, and decrease time required to complete a pegboard
      task compared with one session of passively delivered stimulation. The investigators further
      hypothesize that EMG triggered median nerve stimulation alone will provide equal or greater
      benefits as EMG triggered TMS or EMG-triggered paired stimulation.

      Hypothesis 1: One session of EMG-triggered stimulation will significantly improve motor
      evoked potential (MEP) amplitude, increase cortical silent period duration of APB, and
      decrease time required to complete a manual pegboard task compared with one session of
      passively delivered stimulation or one session of voluntary contraction alone for at least 20
      minutes post-stimulation.

      Hypothesis 2: EMG-triggered PNS alone will result in equal or greater effects than EMG
      triggered TMS or TMS+PNS paired stimulation. This would indicate that EMG triggered PNS might
      be used as a potential intervention to add during physical training, a setting in which TMS
      is difficult to apply.
