  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to find out if administration of stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) given after
      Nivolumab will improve overall response rate/anti-tumor activity in patients with metastatic
      breast cancer with brain metastases.

    <time_frame>Up to 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Neurologic dose limiting toxicities will be defined as: Symptomatic radionecrosis, &gt;/= Grade 3 headache, &gt;/= Grade 3 memory impairment, New onset &gt;/= grade 3 seizures.
3 participants will be enrolled with an 8 week safety observation period. If no patients develop unacceptable neurologic toxicity attributable to SRS, the study will proceed. If 1 patient develops unacceptable neurologic toxicity among the first 3, an additional 3 patients will be enrolled to determine the rate of unacceptable toxicity with 6 patients. If no more patients develop unacceptable neurologic toxicities among the first 6 patients, the study will proceed with a dose expansion of 6 patients.
If 2 or more patients develop unacceptable neurologic toxicity among the first 3 or 6 patients, the dose of radiation therapy will be adjusted. If excessive toxicities are noted with radiation dose level -1, treatment will proceed with nivolumab alone.</description>

    <description>Patients will receive single session SRS to intact brain metastases and post-operative cavities.
A linear accelerator (LINAC)-based frameless delivery system will be used to deliver the stereotactic radiation. The lesion will be defined using gadolinium enhanced MRI with 1 mm slices for treatment planning purposes prior to the delivery of radiation. The MRI image will be co-registered and fused with CT imaging. Doses will be prescribed to ensure coverage of at least 95% of the planning target volume (PTV) with the prescription dose. Treatments will be delivered using dynamic conformal arcs or intensity modulated radiotherapy.</description>
