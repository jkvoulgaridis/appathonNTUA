  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Photobiomodulation therapy (PBMT) has recently been used to alleviate postexercise muscle
      fatigue and enhance muscle recovery, demonstrating positive results. A previous study by the
      investigator's research group demonstrated the optimal dose and the optimal output power (100
      mW) for an infrared wavelength (810 nm). However, the effects of optimized PBMT on
      performance and post-exercise recovery in high-level soccer players, to date have not been
      evaluated.

      The present research project aims to evaluate the effects of PBMT (using low-level laser
      therapy) applied before a progressive running test on functional, muscle damage, inflammatory
      and oxidative stress markers in high-level soccer players.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To achieve the proposed objective it will perform a randomized, crossover triple-blinded,
      placebo-controlled trial, with high-level soccer players as volunteers.

      Twenty-two volunteers will be randomly allocated to two intervention groups: active or
      placebo PBMT before a progressive running test (ergospirometry test).

      The blood samples for biochemical analysis will be obtained before and after a progressive
      running test, and another outcomes (functional) will be obtained during the test.

      The data will be collected by a blind assessor. The statistical analysis will follow the
      intention-to-treat principles and data on functional analysis will be analyzed using the
      paired and two-tailed t-student test. Data on biochemical analysis will be analyzed using
      two-way ANOVA, followed by Bonferroni post hoc test.

      The investigators will analyze: functional aspects (rates of oxygen uptake -VO2max (absolute
      and relative), aerobic and anaerobic threshold and time until exhaustion), muscle damage
      (creatine-kinase -CK and lactate dehydrogenase -LDH), inflammatory markers (IL-1β, IL-6 and
      TNF-α) and oxidative stress markers (Thiobarbituric acid -TBARS, catalase - CAT,
      superoxidedismutase - SOD and carbonylated proteins).

    <masking_description>The mode of intervention (active or placebo photobiomodulation) will be coded by an independent researcher. The randomization schedule will contain only codes (not the actual intervention). The output from the laser device is exactly the same from either the active or the placebo interventions. These features will guarantee that participants, therapists and outcomes assessor will be blinded to the treatment arms.</masking_description>

    <description>The PBMT will be performed using the dose of 10J per diode, previously determined by a previous study and power output of 100 mW per diode, also previously determined. PBMT will be performed at nine different sites of the knee extensor muscles, six different sites of the knee flexor muscles and two different sites of the plantar flex muscles. As the cluster will be 5 diodes and 17 different sites will be irradiated, a total of 85 points will be irradiated in each lower limb, a total of 850 J of energy. The active PBMT will be performed before a progressive running test.</description>

To ensure blinding, the device emitted the same sound regardless of the programmed mode (active or placebo PBMT). The placebo PBMT will be performed before a progressive running test.</description>
