  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of 3
      different dose levels of ASP3772 in comparison to the active comparator Prevnar 13速 (PCV13)
      in adults 18 to 64 years of age in Stage 1. Stage 2 will evaluate the safety, tolerability,
      and immunogenicity of 3 different dose levels of ASP3772 in comparison to the active
      comparator PCV13 in elderly 65 to 85 years of age. In addition, Stage 2 will evaluate the
      immunogenicity of 3 different dose levels of ASP3772 relative to the response seen following
      administration of Pneumovax速 23 (PPSV23) for the serotypes not included in PCV13.

      The study population will consist of 3 different groups: Group 1 - Stage 1 PCV13 na誰ve
      participants randomized within 3 sequential cohorts to ASP3772 or PCV13; Group 2 - Stage 2
      PCV13 na誰ve participants randomized within 3 sequential cohorts to ASP3772 or PCV13; and
      Group 3 - Stage 2 participants previously vaccinated with PCV13 that will receive PPSV23.
