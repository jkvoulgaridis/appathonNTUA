  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In France, nearly 3% of children are conceived by the technique of Assisted Reproductive
      Medicine, of which nearly 70% by in vitro fertilization (IVF). The rates of clinical
      pregnancy by oocyte retrieval or embryo transfer have not changed much. The use of
      mono-embryo transfer reduces the risk of multiple pregnancies and associated obstetric
      complications. The choice of embryo to transfer or freeze is a key element in improving the
      chances of success of IVF. It is usually based on conventional morphological criteria
      (reference method) that are punctual, qualitative and subjective. However, embryo morphology
      at early stages has little predictive value for obtaining a late-stage embryo and its chances
      of implantation. The recent use of time-lapse technology during embryonic culture makes it
      possible to associate morphological criteria with continuous monitoring of the kinetics of
      embryonic development. The choice of the embryo to be transferred is then made according to
      morphokinetic criteria (conventional morphological criteria to which are added the data of
      the kinetics of embryonic development).

      Two recent retrospective studies give contradictory results, the first shows higher birth
      rates in the group of embryos selected according to conventional morphological criteria, the
      second concludes that morphokinetic analysis is superior. Morphokinetic criteria would also
      be more objective and reproducible. However, the use of morphokinetic parameters remains
      controversial in the literature.
