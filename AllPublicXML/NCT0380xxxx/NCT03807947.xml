      The aim of this prospective, randomized study is to compare TRA vs TFA for superselective
      embolization of HCC using bland microparticles performed by multiple operators.

      In particular, main objectives are to compare:

        1. the success rates of TRA and TFA including crossing over events between techniques

        2. the inter-operator outcomes in terms of time to complete the vascular access and the
           vessel catheterization

        3. access-related adverse events

        4. patient preference and reported discomfort

      Hepatic arterial chemoembolization is a safe, proven, and effective technique for the
      treatment of a number of malignancies, including primary and secondary tumors [1, 2]. This
      endovascular treatment is performed via femoral artery access in most cases. In the last
      decades, the transradial approach (TRA) has emerged as a valid alternative to the
      transfemoral approach (TFA), and it is commonly used in coronary angioplasty as well as stent
      placement. In particular, shorter monitoring time after the procedure, earlier ambulation,
      shorter hospital stay and less discomfort associated with potentially reduced bleeding risks
      make TRA an attractive alternative to TFA.

      To date, only one study exists comparing TRA vs TFA in liver embolizations [3]. However, it
      is non-randomized and reports only the outcomes of one operator performing lobar embolization
      for multiple liver malignancies.

      The aim of this prospective, randomized study is to compare TRA vs TFA for superselective
      embolization of HCC using bland microparticles performed by multiple operators.

      In particular, main objectives are to compare:

        1. the success rates of TRA and TFA including crossing over events between techniques

        2. the inter-operator outcomes in terms of time to complete the vascular access and the
           vessel catheterization

        3. access-related adverse events

        4. patient preference and reported discomfort
