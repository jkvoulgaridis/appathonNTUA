  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      Research studies have shown that genetic changes and family history may increase a man s risk
      for prostate cancer. Researchers want to follow the prostate health of men who have specific
      genetic changes associated with prostate cancer to help them learn more about which men are
      at higher risk for prostate cancer.

      Objectives:

      To study men with specific genetic changes and determine who is at higher risk for getting
      prostate cancer. To study if certain genetic changes and family history can be used to help
      prevent or treat prostate cancer.

      Eligibility:

      Persons assigned male at birth ages 30-75 who have one or more specific genetic changes but
      without prostate cancer.

      Design:

        -  This study does not perform genetic testing. All participants must have documented
           genetic changes and able to provide a copy of the report.

        -  Before enrollment, participants will provide a copy of documented genetic changes and go
           through a telephone interview to determine eligibility for the study.

        -  On enrollment, participants will have medical and family history review, medication
           review, physical exam, blood collection for clinical and research testing, and MRI
           (magnetic resonance imaging) of the prostate.

        -  Every year, participants will repeat the physical exam, medical history, family history,
           medication review, routine blood tests, including PSA and testosterone.

        -  Every 2 years, participants will repeat all the above plus prostate MRI and blood tests
           for research.

        -  If, at any time, the physical exam, blood tests or MRI are abnormal, participants may be
           asked to do a biopsy.

        -  If the biopsy results in prostate cancer, participants will be given counseling on next
           steps, general treatment recommendations, and then followed with a phone call each year.

        -  Participants may ask to speak with a genetic counselor.

      Background:

        -  Prostate cancer is the most common malignancy and the second leading cause of
           cancer-related deaths in American men.

        -  Prostate cancer has substantial inherited predisposition and certain genetic variants
           that are associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer.

        -  An evolving approach to prostate cancer screening is to target populations at risk of
           developing prostate cancer based on their genetic predisposition.

      Objective:

      -To follow the natural history of men with known germline variants or likely pathogenic
      variants in genes that put them at risk for developing prostate cancer.

      Eligibility:

        -  Persons assigned male at birth who are between ages 30-75 years old.

        -  Documented germline pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in prostate cancer-related
           risk gene: BRCA 1 and 2, DNA Mismatch Repair (MMR) genes associated with Lynch syndrome
           (MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2, and EPCAM), HOXB13, ATM, NBN, TP53, CHEK2, PALB2, RAD51D,
           BRIP1, or FANCA.

        -  Must be able and willing to provide informed consent.

      Design:

        -  Up to 500 subjects will be enrolled.

        -  Participants will undergo sampling of blood for prostate-specific antigen. Based on
           these results and age, patients will be considered for biopsy and/or continued
           monitoring if feasible upon clinical discretion.

        -  Participants will undergo a baseline MRI evaluation with follow-up scans every 2 years
           as clinically indicated.

        -  Following initial evaluation, participants will be followed as clinically indicated,
           usually at 12 month intervals, to determine their PSA level, prostate cancer treatment
           (if relevant) and/or disease/survival status until death.
