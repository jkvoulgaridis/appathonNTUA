  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with motor neurone disease (MND) typically experience relentless motor decline and
      die within three years of symptom onset from respiratory muscle weakness. There are currently
      no effective therapies and the discovery of novel therapies is hampered by the lack of a
      sensitive disease biomarker. Consequently, there is a huge drive to discover novel
      biomarkers, which can reliably track disease progression over time. These can then be
      incorporated into clinical drug trials to expedite effective drug discovery.

      Muscle fasciculations represent the hyperexcitability of diseased motor neurons and are
      almost universally present from the early stages of MND. The investigators predict that the
      site, frequency and shape of fasciculations might provide a sensitive measure of disease
      progression in an individual.

      In order to calibrate this technique, the investigators will conduct a 12-month longitudinal
      study, recruiting 24 patients from the King's College Hospital Motor Nerve Clinic, comprising
      a mixture of patients with MND and those with benign fasciculation syndrome. Patients in this
      latter group have fasciculations but do not develop weakness and have normal lifespans. They
      are therefore an optimal control group. At each visit, the investigators will take resting
      HDSEMG recordings from all four limbs and perform standard clinical measures of disease
      progression. The investigators will also monitor the decline in motor unit number using a
      newly validated neurophysiological technique, called Motor Unit Number Index (MUNIX).
