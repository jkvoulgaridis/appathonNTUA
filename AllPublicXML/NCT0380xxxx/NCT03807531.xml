    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the performance and safety of the Temporary Spur
      Stent System (TSS). The TSS is intended for use in conjunction with a commercially available
      drug coated balloon in the infrapopliteal arteries for the treatment of de novo or restenotic
      lesions.

      This study is a prospective, non-randomized, multicenter, single arm trial, with sites in New
      Zealand, Germany, and Switzerland.

      At least two and no more than 10 sites are expected to participate, with 100 subjects
      enrolled (no more than 40 at a single site).

      The study follow up will take place over a period of 365 days. A vessel recoil substudy will
      be included for a select group of subjects.

      The purpose of this clinical study is to evaluate the performance and safety of the Temporary
      Spur Stent System (TSS) for subjects with infrapopliteal arterial disease.

      The Temporary Spur Stent System is intended for use in conjunction with a commercially
      available drug coated balloon in the infrapopliteal arteries for the treatment of de novo or
      restenotic lesions.

      The TSS has been developed to provide another treatment option for patients with Peripheral
      Arterial Disease (PAD), and Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI).

      Up to 100 subjects will be treated with the Temporary Spur Stent System in conjunction with
      an approved Drug Coated Balloon (DCB). No less than 1 subject and no more than 40 subjects
      will be enrolled at a single site.

      A vessel recoil substudy is included in the trial. The purpose of this study is to evaluate
      vessel recoil in a select group of subjects (no more than 10 per site, up to 35 subjects in
      total). This will be conducted by obtaining measurements using Optical Coherence Tomography
      (OCT), Intravascular Ultrasound (IVUS), or Quantitative Vascular Analysis (QVA) of the target
      vessel during the index procedure.

      The statistical analysis for this trial will use as a comparator a performance goal derived
      from a meta-analysis of infrapopliteal balloon angioplasty. Descriptive statistics may be
      used to describe other data points.

      Subjects will be asked to participate in a baseline evaluation visit, the index procedure, a
      30 day follow up visit, a 90 day follow up visit, a 180 day follow up visit, and a 365 day
      follow up visit. The baseline evaluation and index procedure visits may be combined. At each
      follow up visit, the subject will undergo a physical exam with wound evaluation (if
      applicable) including pictures, a medication history and compliance review, Ankle Brachial
      and Toe Brachial Indices (ABI and TBI), a duplex ultrasound of the treated limb, review of
      symptoms, and Adverse Events (AE) assessment. Subjects may choose to withdraw from the study
      at any time, for any reason. If subjects choose to withdraw, they will be asked to undergo an
      unscheduled study visit consisting of the aforementioned procedures.

    <description>The second secondary efficacy measurement is decrease in Rutherford class score at 3, 6 and 12 months. Rutherford score is a classification system for patients with peripheral vascular disease.
Categories are numbered from 0 to 6, with 0 being asymptomatic, and 6 being major tissue loss, functional foot no longer salvageable. Higher values are therefore considered a worse outcome.
Rutherford class zero: No symptoms; Rutherford class 1: Mild Claudication (minimal leg pain with ambulation) symptoms; Rutherford Class 2: Moderate Claudication (moderate leg pain with ambulation); Rutherford Class 3: Severe claudication (severe leg pain with ambulation); Rutherford Class 4: Ischemic Rest pain (leg pain at rest); Rutherford Class 5: Minor tissue loss (nonhealing ulcer, focal gangrene, diffuse pedal ischemia); Rutherford class 6: Major tissue loss (extending above the transmetatarsal TM level, functional foot no longer salvageable.</description>

    <description>The third secondary efficacy endpoint is wound healing for subjects with Rutherford class 5 at 6 and 12 months, as assessed by the investigator using WIfI score and descriptive characteristics, including change in wound size measured by any decrease in wound surface area.
The WIfI classification scoring system is a grading system using a composite score of wound (W), ischemia (I), and foot infection (fi). These three different categories are graded from 0 to 3 with 0 being the best and 3 being the worst.
The total score will be provided (clinical stage 1-5), which is used to estimate the risk for major amputation at one year. Patients with a score of 1 are considered low risk, and patients with a score of 5 are considered high risk (foot not salvageable). Therefore, higher values are considered a worse outcome.
The composite score is calculated by adding up the score from each category.</description>

          6. Target lesion must meet lesion-specific criteria in pre-screening by angiography
             (pre-screening with CTA, MRA or selective angiography may be performed prior to the
             index procedure)

          7. Target vessel(s) reconstitutes(s) at or above the medial malleolus, with the target
             treated segment extending no more than 10 mm beyond the medial malleolus.

             Note: If the anterior tibial or posterior tibial arteries are treated, there must be
             inline flow to the foot.

             If the peroneal artery is treated, there must be at least one collateral supplying the
             foot.

          8. Target lesion must begin no higher than the tibioperoneal trifurcation (popliteal
             arteries excluded).

          9. Target vessel reference diameter is measured to be between 2.0 mm to 4.5 mm in
             diameter, assessed by one of the following methods after successful completion of
             guidewire crossing of the lesion site:

               1. Intravascular Ultrasound (IVUS)

               2. Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT)

               3. Quantitative Vascular Angiography (QVA).

         10. Lesion length must be &gt; 30 mm and &lt; 150 mm.

         11. Only one limb may be enrolled per subject. Up to two vessels may be treated per
             subject; if required, a second modality may be used for treatment in the non-target
             infrapopliteal vessel. Any treatment of the non-index vessel must be performed prior
             to the use of the investigative device and only one artery may be treated with the
             investigative device

         12. The total treated segment is defined as the total length of artery treated with the
             investigational device. Target treatment length is &lt;240 mm with a maximum segment of
             150 mm separated by 30 mm of healthy tissue between treated lesions.

         13. Successful pre-dilatation of the target lesion as outlined in the procedure
             instructions, defined as resulting in stenosis &lt;50%, without resulting flow limiting
             dissection (Type D or greater), thrombus, or aneurysm by angiography prior to the
             insertion of the investigative device.

         14. Iliac, SFA and popliteal inflow lesions can be treated using standard angioplasty
             and/or an approved stent (no atherectomy) during the index procedure or &gt;30 days
             prior. Inflow lesions treated intraprocedure must be treated first, prior to
             consideration of treatment of infrapopliteal lesions. If pre-screening with
             angiography, CTA, MRA, or ultrasound has been performed &lt;365 days prior to the
             procedure, intra-procedure angiography of the aorto-iliac vasculature is not required,
             however, the infrainguinal inflow must still be imaged using angiography during the
             index procedure. Inflow lesions must have a healthy vessel segment of &gt;30 mm between
             the study lesion and the treated segment, defined as less than 50% stenosis without
             aneurysmal segments.

             index procedure.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject unwilling or unlikely to comply with the appropriate follow up time for the
             duration of the study in the opinion of the investigator.
