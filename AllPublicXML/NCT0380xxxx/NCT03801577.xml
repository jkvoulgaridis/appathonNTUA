  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study measures the steatosis in patients With fatty livers as determined by CAP score
      from a fibroscan assessment. The study attempts to determine the effect of using the Medical
      Food Hepaxa in a Clinical setting Close to real-world use.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects With fatty liver are given Hepaxa for 6 months. Fibroscan CAP measurements are taken
      at 3 monthly intervals. Subjects consent to Collection of data from approximately 6 months
      prior to use of Hepaxa. Patients unresponsive to life style recommendations given as standard
      practice will be enrolled.
