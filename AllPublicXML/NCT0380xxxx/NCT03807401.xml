  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Unilateral neglect is a neuropsychological disorder reflected by a disturbance in the spatial
      exploration and distribution of directed attention affecting the contralateral part of space
      and body relatively to the brain lesion. The chronic aspect of this pathology leads to a poor
      progression following rehabilitation and a decreased independence of patients in daily life.
      Thus, it is necessary to set up efficient and long lasting therapies for unilateral neglect
      patients to improve their daily quality of life. Prismatic adaptation is now a classical
      method which allows patients to improve their neglect through corrective pointing movements
      in response to a lateral displacement of the visual field. A large and growing body of
      literature has investigated prismatic adaptation as a very promising rehabilitation method,
      improving both visuomotor and cognitive features of unilateral neglect. However, its effects
      are somehow irregular and clinical applications of this method are still limited. The
      necessity for patients to come to the hospital to take advantage of prismatic adaption
      sessions draws some limitations about our knowledge concerning 1) the temporal dynamic of
      prism adaptation effects on a long-term basis and 2) the optimal duration of treatment (most
      of the time constrained by the hospitalization duration) and its therapeutical effects on a
      very long-term basis. Moreover, a large number of patients also suffer from motor deficits
      which reduce the possibility to optimize the prismatic adaptation session.

      Thus, the aim of this project is to develop and validate others modalities of prismatic
      adaptation which can be applied at home and for a longer duration. These modalities should
      allow the investigator to get insights about the temporal dynamic of prismatic adaptation on
      the cognitive system. First, the investigator will investigate the effects of a prismatic
      adaptation modality using virtual reality to reproduce the lateral displacement induced by
      the prismatic goggles. He will also investigate prismatic adaptation induced by motor
      imagery, i.e. with mental representations of pointing movements without concomitant motor
      execution. This project could enhance the fundamental knowledge and enable to design new
      modalities of therapeutical use of prismatic adaptation (virtual or imaged) so as to allow a
      home-based treatment and follow-up. Thus, the aim of this project is to demonstrate the
      implication of similar mechanisms through different modalities (virtual and imaged compared
      to classical application) and the feasibility of these new modalities of healthy subjects.
      Thereafter, the aim will be to use knowledge acquired during this project to set up clinical
      trials to test for the efficiency of these modalities on a long-term basis in a pathological
      population.
