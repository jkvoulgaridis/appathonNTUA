  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This post-market follow-up study investigates improvement in clinical and radiological
      outcome after reversed total shoulder arthroplasty with the patient-specific Glenius Glenoid
      Reconstruction system
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Glenius glenoid implant is a solution for patients who need a reversed glenoid
      reconstruction (primary or revision) because of a severely damaged glenoid associated with
      severe bone loss. In these cases, standard reconstruction of the glenoid is not possible
      because of the lack of body support of the glenoid rim or columns.

      The Glenius implant is custom-made prothesis: during pre-operative planning, the implant is
      designed based on a detailed 3D CT analysis of the defect with special reference to bone
      quality and the anatomy of the bone deficient glenoid. Optimized screw fixation trajectories
      are defined for each individual patient, which accommodate screws that are positioned and
      angled towards the best bone stock available in the glenoid/coracoid/scapula with each
      specific patient. The surgeon provides feedback on the the design and orientation of the
      implant needed to achieve the optimal inclination of the head and the position &amp; offset of
      the joint's centre of rotation.

      Because Glenius is a relatively new product and only for use in specific and complex cases of
      severy glenoid erosion, follow-up data on the clinical and radiological outcome are scarce.
      With this study we aim to collect long-term clinical and radiological follow-up data for
      patients treated with Glenius in a uniform, standardized way.

    <description>The Constant-Murley score is a clinical outcome scale composed of a number of individual parameters, defining the level of pain, the ability to carry out the normal daily activities of the patient, mobility and strength of the arm. The scores range from 0 (worst clinical outcome) to 100 (best clinical outcome).</description>

    <description>The SST is a function scale with 12 items, used to assess improvement in shoulder function after treatment interventions and to check the patient's ability to tolerate or perform 12 activities of daily living. The scores range from 0 (worst functional outcome) to 100 (best functional outcome).</description>

    <description>The OSS is a 12-item patient-reported outcome specifically designed and developed for assessing outcomes of shoulder surgery e.g. for assessing the impact on patients' quality of life of degenerative conditions such as arthritis and rotator cuff problems. The score ranges from 0 (no pain or functional impairement) to 60 (worst pain and functional impairement).</description>

    <description>EQ-5D is a standardized patient-reported outcome for measuring generic health status. The questionnaire has two components: a health state description measured in terms of five dimensions (5D); mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. and a general evaluation of their overall health status using the visual analogue scale (EQ-VAS).</description>
