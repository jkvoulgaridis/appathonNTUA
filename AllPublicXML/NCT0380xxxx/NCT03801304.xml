  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The majority of patients diagnosed with advanced NSCLC are treated with platinum-doublet
      chemotherapy regimens, except those harboring specific oncogenic drivers such as epidermal
      growth-factor-receptor (EGFR) mutations or anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearrangements.
      In the second-line setting, response rates remain low and median survival rarely exceeds 10
      months.

      Over the past few years, several checkpoint inhibitors targeting programmed cell death
      protein-1 (PD1) or its ligand (PDL1) used as second-line therapies generated evidence of
      improving survival and, more recently, as first-line NSCLC treatment.

      Although pembrolizumab (anti-PD1) was recently approved as first-line treatment for patients
      with at least 50% of their NSCLC cells expressing PDL1, many patients are still not
      benefiting from this first-line agent.

      For patients with relapsed NSCLC, atezolizumab (anti-PDL1) prolonged survival compared to
      docetaxel in the phase II POPLAR and phase III OAK trials. Novel concepts of synergic action
      between immunotherapy and chemotherapy have emerged recently. However, those types of
      treatments are given for different durations: chemotherapy is allowed for only a short period
      (rarely exceeding 6 cycles), while anti-PDL1 can be continued for several months until loss
      of its clinical benefit.

      Metronomic chemotherapy is defined as low-dose and frequent chemotherapy administration,
      without prolonged drug-free breaks. Metronomic administration of oral vinorelbine has been
      tested against breast cancer and advanced refractory NSCLC. The combination could have
      immunostimulatory effects: induction of immunogenic cancer-cell death, enhancement of antigen
      presentation through dendritic cell modulation, increased cancer-cell immunogenicity,
      preferential depletion of regulatory T cells, modulation of myeloid-derived suppressor cells,
      enhancement of the cytotoxic activity of immune-effector cells.

    <description>The scale EuroQol 5 dimensions (EDQ5) is used to evaluate the quality of life. The EQ-5D scale is a standardised measure of health status to provide a simple, generic measure of health for clinical and economic appraisal, whih is divided by the EQ-5D descriptive system (mobility, self care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression) and the EQ Visual Analogue scale (EQ VAS). Each dimension has 5 levels (no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, and extreme problems).</description>

    <description>The EORTC QLQ-C30 is a questionnaire with 30 questions developed to assess the quality of life of cancer patients. An essential aspect of the &quot;modular&quot; approach to QOL assessment adopted by the EORTC Quality of Life Group is the development of modules specific to tumour site, treatment modality, or a QOL dimension, to be administered in addition to the core questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30).</description>
