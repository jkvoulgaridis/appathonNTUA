  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sarcomas are rare cancers with a high risk of metastatic progression and a major pejorative
      factor with respect to patient survival. The estimation of the metastatic risk of sarcomas is
      very complex given the histological heterogeneity of this entity. It is therefore essential
      that, at diagnosis, a reliable evaluation of this metastatic potential be made, in order to
      adapt the therapeutic strategy as well as possible.

      It has recently been discovered that sarcomas secrete many exosomes that appear to play an
      important role in tumorogenesis, growth, tumor progression and the onset of metastases. They
      contain many proteins and nucleic acids (DNA, RNA, microRNA), reflecting the characteristics
      of the tumor. It has been shown that the amount of exosomes can be correlated with the grade
      of malignancy of the tumor. Present in the blood, exosomes offer the possibility of
      non-invasively analyzing the molecular information of the cancer cell. As a result, the study
      of serum exosomes derived from sarcomas has a high potential as a liquid biopsy to evaluate
      cancer pathogenesis, progression, and treatment efficacy.

      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate in patients with sarcomas that exosomes can be
      used to monitor their disease and be used as a predictor of the risk of recurrence.

      The main objective of this pilot study is to quantify exosomes and analyze their protein and
      RNA content in patients with sarcoma with disease:

        -  localized before and after treatment with surgery,

        -  metastatic before and after treatment with 1st line chemotherapy.

      The secondary objectives are:

        1. Determine whether the initial exosome concentration and the protein and RNA profile they
           contain vary with the localized or metastatic stage of the disease.

        2. Determine if the exosome concentration as well as the protein and RNA profile they
           contain varies after treatment.

        3. Determine if the initial exosome concentration (at T0) is associated with a response to
           treatment.

        4. Determine whether the change in exosome concentration before and after treatment is
           associated with a response to treatment.

        5. Identify a protein marker or RNA associated with a treatment response (marker present at
           T0 or occurring during follow-up).
