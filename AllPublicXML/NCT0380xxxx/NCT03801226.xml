  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The following pilot study will be undertaken to determine the effects of use of a zero-sodium
      peritoneal dialysate solution (10% dextrose in sterile water) on sodium removal as compared
      to a standard peritoneal dialysis solution.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      While heart failure (HF) is generally regarded as the inability of the heart to pump
      sufficient blood, on a population level, volume overload is the primary driver of morbidity
      and hospitalization. The signs and symptoms of volume overload are driven by water
      accumulation, which is initially driven by sodium retention. This overall goal of this study
      is to investigate the ability to remove sodium through use of a zero-sodium solution in
      peritoneal dialysis.

    <measure>Comparison of total sodium removed compared to baseline</measure>
