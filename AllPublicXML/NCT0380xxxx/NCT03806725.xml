    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the safety of iodinated contrast medium administered to liver transplant
      candidates with decreased renal function undergoing coronary CT angiography. Incidence of
      post-contrast acute kidney injury in liver transplant candidates with decreased renal
      function and normal renal function will be compared.

    <textblock>
      Low osmolar non-ionic contrast medium (LOCM) is routinely used for contrast-enhanced computed
      tomography (CT) including coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA).

      This study evaluates the effect of LOCM on liver transplant candidates with normal and
      decreased renal function undergoing CCTA. Incidence of post-contrast acute kidney injury
      (PC-AKI) will be compared between the two groups before and after contrast medium exposure.

      LOCM is a potential cause of PC-AKI, especially in vulnerable population with decreased renal
      function. According to the American College of Radiology (ACR) manual on contrast media,
      however, many published studies on PC-AKI in the past have been heavily contaminated by bias
      and conflation. More recent studies do not confirm a high risk of contrast induced
      nephropathy.

      End stage liver disease patients with normal renal function do not seem to be at a higher
      risk of developing PC-AKI. Only limited data reporting a low incidence of PC-AKI after
      contrast-enhanced CT in patients with liver cirrhosis and concomitant decreased renal
      function exists. Proof of low PC-AKI in this specific population would allow to redirect
      patients from invasive catheterization to CCTA as their cardiac clearance before
      transplantation. This study will prospectively investigate the incidence of PC-AKI in this
      specific at-risk population.
