      ambrisentan in patients with Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multi-center, open-label, exploratory study with patients followed for
      a period of one year. The treatment duration period in this study begins at the initiation of
      ambrisentan plus riociguat and will continue for 12 months. Patients will come to clinic for
      a visit at month 4 and 12. Assessments will include Right Heart Catheterization, 6 Minute
      walk test, cardiac MRI, questionnaires and nt-Pro-BNP.
