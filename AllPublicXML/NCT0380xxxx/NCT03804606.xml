    <textblock>
      Out-of-hospital care of complex diseases, such as heart failure, is transitioning from an
      individual patient-doctor relationship to population health management strategies. As an
      example, at our institution, medication therapy management (MTM) pharmacists are being
      deployed to patients with heart failure with the intent of improving patient outcomes
      (through proper medication management and adherence) while reducing cost (e.g., keeping these
      patients out of the hospital). The success of such strategies will be dependent on the
      ability to effectively direct scarce resources to deliver appropriate/needed care to
      patients. In this prospective, pragmatic randomized and matched controlled study, the
      investigators hypothesize that the combination of accurate, data-driven benefit models and
      MTM pharmacist intervention in patients with heart failure will result in reduced 1-year
      mortality and hospital admissions. Using our extensive historical electronic health record
      data, the investigators have developed a machine learning model that, for individual patients
      with heart failure, predicts risk and benefit (that is, reduction in risk) associated with
      closing specific &quot;care gaps&quot;. These care gaps represent standard evidence-based treatments
      that may be missing for an individual patient, such as beta blockers or flu shots. The
      investigators will use this model to define three cohorts to be studied: 1) a high risk/high
      benefit group to be referred for MTM pharmacist intervention, 2) a high risk/high benefit
      group to continue with existing standard of care (not necessarily involving MTM pharmacy),
      and 3) a high risk/low benefit group to be referred for MTM pharmacist intervention.
      Comparison of groups 1 and 2 (for which assignment is randomized) will evaluate the
      effectiveness of the MTM pharmacy intervention, while comparison of groups 1 and 3 will
      evaluate the accuracy of the benefit model prediction and importance of appropriate patient
      selection for treatment. The primary study outcomes will be mortality and number of hospital
      admissions during 1-year follow-up following study enrollment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Heart failure is a highly prevalent, complex disease associated with significant morbidity
      and cost. For example, Geisinger manages over 900 heart failure admissions per year, with
      each admission costing an estimated $10,000-$12,000. As payment models continue to shift from
      fee-for-service to value-based, significant investments are occurring in care team resources
      to help manage populations of patients with heart failure. These care team resources have
      demonstrated effectiveness. For example, internal Geisinger metrics indicate that
      interventions led by clinical pharmacists aimed at poorly controlled type II diabetics have
      resulted in a sustained median 1% (absolute) drop in hemoglobin hemoglobin a1C (glycated
      hemoglobin). In this new environment, intelligent deployment of limited resources is critical
      to drive quality and contain costs.

      In heart failure, current risk prediction have demonstrated poor prognostic abilities and
      present a barrier to &quot;precision delivery&quot; of care team resources. Currently approaches are
      limited due to not fully utilizing rich, highly granular objective data such as imaging,
      laboratory values, and vital signs, and therefore are not optimized to accurately predict
      outcomes. The investigators have generated a machine learning model to predict both 1-year
      survival and heart failure hospitalization within 6 months of echocardiography. This model
      utilized 169 input variables including clinical data, imaging measures, and 18 care gap
      variables. Our results showed not only that the machine learning model had far superior
      accuracy to predict the morbidity endpoints compared to current approaches utilizing billing
      code data, but also that care gap variables were important for predicting 1-year survival.
      Moreover, the investigators showed that closing four of the care gap variables (flu
      vaccination, evidence-based beta blocker treatment, ACE (angiotensin-converting-enzyme)
      inhibitor/ARB (angiotensin receptor blockers) treatment, and control of diabetic a1C (i.e.,
      values &quot;in goal)) resulted in a predicted improvement in 1-year survival of ~1200 (out of
      ~11,000) patients. This study therefore aims to apply this machine learning approach to
      direct care team resources in a clinical setting to evaluate its impact on patient survival
      and healthcare utilization.
