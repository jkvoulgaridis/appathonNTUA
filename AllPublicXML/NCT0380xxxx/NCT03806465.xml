  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an evaluation of feasibility, safety and impact of the RTS,S/AS01 vaccine
      introduction, implemented in a pilot programme by Ministries of Health using an expanded
      schedule of their routine EPI contacts in moderate to high malaria transmission settings in
      Ghana, Kenya and Malawi. The Ministries of Health in Ghana, Kenya and Malawi plan to
      introduce the malaria vaccine, sub nationally.

      This provides an opportunity in each country to evaluate the following :

        1. To evaluate the programmatic feasibility to deliver a 4 dose schedule;

        2. To collect information on a larger scale on the safety of the malaria vaccine with focus
           on cerebral malaria and meningitis;

        3. To evaluate the impact of the malaria vaccine on all cause mortality.

    <textblock>
      An evaluation of the pilot implementation of RTS,S/AS01 through routine health systems in
      moderate to high malaria transmission settings in Ghana, Kenya and Malawi. in the context of
      the new vaccine introduction, the Ministries of Health in the three countries will introduce
      the malaria vaccine (RTS,S/AS01) in a phased fashion (with some areas introducing the malaria
      vaccine first and the latter half, after the evaluation period) building on the national
      immunization programmes which routinely deliver vaccines and expanding the schedule of their
      routine EPI contacts.

      The evaluation of the pilot implementation will run for a total of about 46 months in each
      country. This will focus on the three main primary objectives of feasibility, safety and
      impact. The pilot implementation assumes that a total of 46-60 clusters will be identified
      per country, evenly split between implementation and comparison areas, with each cluster
      contributing approximately 4,000 children per year to the evaluation of RTS,S/AS01. Hence a
      total of approximately 120,000 children will receive the RTS,S vaccine in each country in
      each year. Evaluation data will be collected in the following ways.

      COMMUNITY BASED MORTALITY SURVEILLANCE

      Community based mortality surveillance will be established across the pilot evaluation areas
      to enable the evaluation of the impact of the malaria vaccine on all-cause mortality. This
      will use a network of Village Reporters (VR) to document all deaths among children aged up to
      48 months in the implementation and comparison areas. Once the death is notified, a
      standardized, WHO-approved Verbal Autopsy (VA) will be performed, according to WHO guidelines
      and locally acceptable practices. The VA will focus is on confirming death, age and
      vaccination status. The total number of clusters per country is expected to range from 46-60.
      Assuming 4,000 children born per cluster per year, 30 months of vaccination and a total
      follow-up of 44 months, each cluster will contribute 23,134 person years at risk (pyar),
      allowing for 1% mortality in the first month of life, and 0.08% mortality for every month
      after the first month. This equates to a mortality risk of 22.2 per 1000 for children aged 5
      to 36 months. A mortality risk of 21 per 1,000 equates to a rate, over 2.5 years, of 8.489455
      per 1,000 pyar. Based on a minimum mortality rate of 8.5 per 1000 pyar, 23 clusters in each
      arm, each with an annual birth cohort of approximately 4,000 subjects, would have 80% power
      to detect, at the 5% significance level, a decrease of at least 10% in overall mortality in
      each country.

      With this mortality risk, the pilot evaluation it is estimated to have approximately 80%
      power to detect an interaction between gender and treatment of 1.15 (i.e an increased risk of
      mortality in girls of 1.035), compared with the 1.9-fold increase in risk among girls
      receiving RTS,S/AS01 in the RTS,S Phase 3 trial.

      FEASIBILITY (CROSS SECTIONAL HOUSEHOLD) SURVEYS)

      Three household surveys will be conducted to evaluate the programmatic feasibility to deliver
      a 4 dose schedule at baseline (before vaccination starts), 18 months and 30 months after
      start of vaccination.

      A sample size of 100 houses per cluster will estimate the cluster-specific coverage of
      RTS,S/AS01 to within 10% (ie 95% CI from 40 to 60%) using a conservative estimate of 50%
      coverage and a high response rate above 95% in each cluster. Assuming a design effect of 1.5
      between clusters, the overall precision in RTS,S/AS01 and coverage estimates of other
      vaccines over the pilot programme's implementation and comparison areas will be 2% (ie 95%CI
      48% to 52%) in each country. This will result in 15,800 (6,600 in Ghana, 4,600 each in Kenya
      and Malawi) households included in the surveys. The second household survey may be powered to
      generate coverage estimates in each arm, rather than in each cluster, to within ±2% of the
      true value.

      SENTINEL HOSPITAL SURVEILLANCE

      Four to eight sentinel hospitals will be identified in each country to collect information on
      a larger scale on the safety of the malaria vaccine in children aged less than 5 years
      admitted with a focus on cases of cerebral malaria and meningitis. The catchment area of each
      hospital (approximately a cluster) is expected to have an annual birth cohort of, and provide
      services for, approximately 4,000 children in the MVPE. Hence a total catchment area of
      48,000 children in implementation areas and another 48,000 children in comparison areas will
      contribute to the hospital-based evaluation of safety across the programme (three countries,
      Ghana, Kenya and Malawi). This is expected to provide 80% power to detect a 1.7-fold increase
      in risk of cerebral malaria and 2.6-fold increase in risk of meningitis. Children admitted to
      the sentinel hospitals in this age group will be assessed for severe malaria and meningitis
      using a standardised surveillance approach.
