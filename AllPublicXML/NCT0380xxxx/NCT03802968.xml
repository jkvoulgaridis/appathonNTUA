      Perioperative lung-protective strategies had been advocated in one-lung ventilation but
      normal respiratory functions were yet impacted during videoassisted thoracoscopic(VATS)
      surgery. The primary aim of this study was to investigate respiratory complications after
      OLVby using bedside lung ultrasonography combine with diaphragmatic ultrasonography.

      Perioperative lung-protective strategies had been advocated in One-lung Ventilation(OLV) of
      videoassisted thoracoscopic(VATS) surgery but normal respiratory functions were yet impacted
      during general anesthesia, mechanical ventilation, loss of respiratory muscle tone and
      intrathoracic surgery. Lung ultrasonography has been confirmed to be a available tool for
      rapid confirming atelectasis, pleural effusion , pneumonia and pneumothorax. Diaphragmatic
      excursion were well correlated with vital capacity by lung function testing and diaphragmatic
      ultrasound imaging was demonstrated accurately to identify atrophy and impaired contractility
      or motion of the diaphragm.The primary aim of this present study was to investigate
      respiratory complications after OLV in the postoperative period by using bedside lung
      ultrasonography.The secondary aim was to evaluate the variation of lung ventilation during
      thoracoscopic surgery through lung ultrasonography combine with diaphragm ultrasound and
      assess the accuracy of ultrasound to confirm proper endobronchial intubation.

        Patients scheduled for elective thoracoscopic surgery of OLV and over 18 years of age were
        included in the present study if they screened for the inclusion criteria. Patients were
        excluded if there were noncooperate from schizophrenia or delirium, a body mass index(BMI)
        higher than 40 kg/m2, a history of respiratory infection, chronic obstructive pulmonary
        disease(COPD), Chronic Heart Disease(CHD). Those received brachial plexus nerve block or
        general anesthesia within 2 weeks before surgery were also excluded. Former thoracic
        procedures (e.g.,thoracotomy, thoracoscopy or thoracic drain) were either criterions for
        exclusion.
