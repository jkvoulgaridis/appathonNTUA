    <textblock>
      This study investigates the safety and tolerability of Nintedanib in patients with
      bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) following allogeneic hematopoietic cell
      transplantation. All study patients with BOS will be treated with the study drug Nintedanib
      (300 mg/day) as an add-on therapy to their basic immunosuppressive treatment over a 12-months
      treatment period.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT) is an established treatment option
      for several malignant and non-malignant disorders. An important limitation of long-term
      survival after HCT is chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGvHD). The manifestation of cGvHD
      in the lungs, bronchiolitis obliterans (BO - if proven by lung biopsy) or bronchiolitis
      obliterans syndrome (BOS - clinical diagnosis), has a reported incidence between 5 and 20%.
      Despite different treatment approaches, prognosis of BO remains poor, with an overall 3-year
      mortality of up to 65%. Nintedanib is an orally available indolinone derivate that
      competitively binds to the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptors, fibroblast
      growth factor (FGF) receptors, and platelet derived growth factor (PDGF) receptors. The
      anti-fibrotic activities of Nintedanib may impact the progressive course of fibrotic lung
      diseases like BO. This study investigates the safety and tolerability of Nintedanib in
      patients with bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome following allogeneic hematopoietic cell
      transplantation.

    <description>The following describes a single-breath nitrogen test: A subject takes a breath of 100% oxygen and exhales through a one-way valve measuring nitrogen content and volume. A plot of the nitrogen concentration (as a % of total gas) vs. expired volume is obtained by increasing the nitrogen concentration from zero to the percentage of nitrogen in the alveoli. The nitrogen concentration is initially zero because the subject is exhaling the dead space oxygen they just breathed in (does not participate in alveolar exchange), and climbs as alveolar air mixes with the dead space air. The dead space can be determined from this curve by drawing a vertical line down the curve such that the areas below the curve (left of the line) and above the curve (right of the line) are equal</description>
