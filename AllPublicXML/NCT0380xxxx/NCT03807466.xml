  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a high rate of inappropriate antibiotic use in long-term care (LTC) facilities, with
      both unnecessary initiation and prolongation of treatments. Although there are challenges to
      rational antibiotic use in LTC, the variability in antibiotic initiation and use of prolonged
      treatment durations is driven by prescriber tendencies rather than resident characteristics.
      Audit-and-feedback is a well-established intervention to improve professional practices, and
      is ideally suited for use to improve antibiotic prescribing tendencies in LTC. The literature
      is saturated with trials indicating benefit of audit-and-feedback, but is in dire need of
      studies to identify methods to improve the impact of this technique. Health Quality Ontario
      (HQO), a key partner in the FIRST AID-LTC research program, is already providing
      audit-and-feedback for other inappropriate prescribing practices in LTC, and has identified
      antibiotic prescribing as a priority focus.

      Overarching Goals

      The overarching goals of FIRST AID - LTC are two-fold:

        1. Improve rational antibiotic prescribing by physicians to minimize harms among LTC
           residents.

        2. Advance the science of audit-and-feedback to improve physician prescribing practices.

      Specific Aims

      To improve rational antibiotic prescribing in LTC:

        1. by decreasing unnecessary initiation of antibiotic treatments among Ontario LTC
           residents, as well as the variability in initiation rates across LTC prescribers.

        2. by decreasing unnecessary prolonged duration of antibiotic treatments among Ontario LTC
           residents, as well as the variability in prolonged duration treatment use across LTC
           prescribers.

      To advance audit-and-feedback implementation science:

      1. by evaluating whether a dynamic audit-and-feedback report highlighting antibiotic
      prescribing can lead to greater reductions in antibiotic use, than a static paginated report

      Anticipated Contributions to Health-Related Knowledge

      Although the literature is inundated with trials examining the impact of audit-and-feedback
      compared to usual care, there is a need for studies to improve audit-and-feedback delivery.
      FIRST AID-LTC will test optimal delivery and peer comparison techniques for
      audit-and-feedback. The knowledge learned can be extrapolated to antibiotic interventions in
      LTC in other provinces across Canada, as well more broadly to inappropriate medication
      prescribing practices in LTC.

      Anticipated Contributions to Health Care, Health Systems and Health Outcomes

      FIRST AID-LTC will lead to immediate reductions in excess antibiotic use in Ontario LTC
      facilities, which in turn should result in substantial reductions in direct drug costs, as
      well as downstream complications of allergy, organ toxicity, C. difficile infections and
      antimicrobial resistance. With easy transferability to other Canadian provinces, the
      improvements in cost-savings and patient outcomes could be massive in scope.

        To Identify an LTC Resident

        Inclusion Criteria:

        An individual having a minimum of 2 records on separate days within the quarter meeting any
        combination of the following criteria:

          -  a record for a non-emergency long-term care inpatient services OR

          -  an Ontario Drug Benefits record administered in long-term care

        Index date = The analysis will be anchored on the most recent of either of the records
        above within a given quarter or their date of death (whichever date is earliest)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Non-Ontario resident at index date

          -  Invalid age (age&lt;19 or age&gt;115) at index date

          -  Missing or invalid sex or date of birth at index date

          -  Death date is &gt;7 days before index date

          -  If the individual does not live in a nursing home or home for the aged

          -  Cannot be linked to a Most Responsible Physician (MRP) (see methodology below)

        To Identify the Most Responsible Physician (MRP) Using Virtual Rostering

        For each patient in the above resident cohort, the study team will retrieve all records
        from health care providers in the 6 month period preceding the index date (180 days),
        keeping only records from physicians who have a specialty of 1) general practice, 2)
        community medicine or 3) geriatrics.

        Steps for MRP assignment:

        Step 1) The study team will first select physicians with the highest count of records for
        the monthly management of a nursing home or home for the aged. This is completed for as
        many residents as possible.

        Step 2) If there were no monthly management fee records as described above then the
        physician with highest count of non-emergency long-term care inpatient services records for
        each patient will be selected. This step is only applied to residents who could not be
        matched to a physician by Step 1. **Physician must have seen the patient one or more times
        in 90 days prior to and including index date to be considered MRP. This criteria is applied
        to ensure the physician has seen the resident within the reporting quarter.

        Step 3) Some patients will virtually roster to physicians in Enrollment groups, some will
        virtually roster to physicians that are not in a group. For these, the study team will
        recode enrollment program type to 'NOR' (not otherwise rostered) - these are likely fee for
        service physicians.
