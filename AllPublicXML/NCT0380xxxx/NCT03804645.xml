  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      AZD9977 is an oral, selective mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) modulator. AZD9977 is a partial
      antagonist and partial agonist in reporter gene assays and has a different interaction
      pattern with the MR compared to eplerenone.

      This study will assess the pharmacokinetics (PK) of four different Formulations of AZD9977
      (Part A) and influence of food and lower dose of a selected formulation (Part B) in healthy
      male subjects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will be a randomized, open-label, single-centre crossover study in healthy male
      subjects. The study is divided into 2 parts, Part A and Part B. The subjects will participate
      in both Part A and Part B.

      Part A will be a 4-way cross-over study comparing the PK of AZD9977 as a reference capsule
      and 2 different capsule formulations and a tablet formulation under fasting conditions.

        -  Treatment A: Reference, AZD9977 capsule

        -  Treatment B: AZD9977 HDL capsule

        -  Treatment C: AZD9977 ODL capsule

        -  Treatment D: AZD9977 tablet In Part B, based on the interim results in Part A, 1 of the
           formulations will be selected and evaluated at the 300 mg dose level under fed
           conditions. The same formulation will also be evaluated under fasting conditions at a
           lower dose level (50 mg). The first dose tested in Part B will be the 50 mg (fasted)
           dose, followed by the 300 mg (fed) dose.

      In Part A, subjects will be resident from 1 day before dosing (Day -1 of Treatment Period 1)
      with AZD9977 until 48 hours post-final-dose (Day 3 of Treatment Period 4). Subjects will
      return to the unit for Part B at least 48 hours (and up to 5 weeks) after completion of Part
      A.

      In Part B, subjects will be resident from 1 day before dosing (Day -1 of Treatment Period 1)
      with AZD9977 until 48 hours post-final-dose (Day 3 of Treatment Period 2).

      Subjects will return to the unit for a final study visit 5-7 days post-last-dose for a Follow
      up Visit.

      Each subject will be involved in the study for approximately 12 weeks (including
      approximately 4 to 5 weeks for the interim analysis).

      Twelve subjects will initially be randomized to ensure at least 8 and 6 evaluable subjects at
      the end of the last treatment period for Part A and Part B respectively.

             standardized Food and Drug Administration (FDA) breakfast.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. History of any clinically significant disease or disorder which, in the opinion of the
             principal investigator (PI), may either put the volunteer at risk because of
             participation in the study, or influence the results or the volunteer's ability to
             participate in the study.

          2. History or presence of gastrointestinal, hepatic or renal disease, or any other
             condition known to interfere with absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion
             of drugs.

          3. Any clinically significant illness, medical/surgical procedure, or trauma within 4
             weeks of the first administration of IMP.

          4. Any clinically significant abnormalities in clinical chemistry, hematology, or
             urinalysis results, as judged by the PI, including:

             4.1. Serum potassium &gt; 5.0 mmol/L.

          5. Any clinically significant abnormal findings in vital signs, as judged by the PI,
             including:

             5.1. Systolic BP &lt; 90 mmHg or &gt; 140 mmHg. 5.2. Diastolic BP &lt; 50 mmHg or &gt; 90 mmHg.
             5.3. Pulse rate &lt; 45 or &gt; 90 beats per minute.

          6. Any clinically significant abnormalities on 12-lead echocardiogram (ECG), as judged by
             the PI.

          7. Any positive result on screening for serum hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis C
             antibody, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody.

          8. Known or suspected history of drug abuse in the 12 months prior to screening, as
             judged by the PI.

          9. Has received another new chemical entity (defined as a compound which has not been
             approved for marketing) within 3 months of the first administration of AZD9977 in this
             study. The period of exclusion begins 3 months after the final dose or one month after
             the last visit whichever is the longest. Note: subjects consented and screened, but
             not randomized in this study or a previous Phase 1 study, are not excluded.

         10. Plasma donation within 1 month of screening or any blood donation/loss more than 500
             mL during the 3 months prior to screening.

             judged by the PI or history of hypersensitivity to drugs with a similar chemical
             structure or class to AZD9977.

         12. Current smokers or those who have smoked or used nicotine products (including e
             cigarettes) within the 3 months prior to screening.

             the first administration of AZD9977 or longer if the medication has a long half life.

         16. Known or suspected history of alcohol or drug abuse or excessive intake of alcohol in
             the 12 months prior to screening as judged by the PI.

         17. Involvement of any AstraZeneca, PAREXEL or study site employee or their close

             any ongoing or recent (i.e., during the screening period) minor medical complaints
             that may interfere with the interpretation of study data or are considered unlikely to
             comply with study procedures, restrictions, and requirements.

         20. Vulnerable subjects, e.g., kept in detention, protected adults under guardianship,
             trusteeship, or committed to an institution by governmental or juridical order.
