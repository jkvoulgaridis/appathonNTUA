    <textblock>
      This study plans to analyze the digestive flora structure of the group of patients with
      pancreatic cancer。The investigators compared the microflora of pancreatic cancer with other
      pancreatic diseases and healthy people，in order to obtatin the information of microbial
      community difference among the different groups。Finally，the investigators hope to identify
      the potential biomarker and pathogenic mechanisms that causes the onset and progression of
      pancreatic diseases.

      First, all the participants provided written informed consent for participating in the study.
      And the collecting procedures have no intervention or impact on treatment measures.

      Second,the samples are collected, including the stools, the peripheral blood,and other
      digestive secretions. If the participants had surgical indications and received surgical
      treatment, the surgical resections of tissue are also collected.

      Third, the participants were basically divided into three groups，cases with pancreatic
      cancer, cases with other pancreatic diseases, and health volunteers.

      Then, the investigators compare the microflora , its metabolites or effects among the
      different groups in their stool, digestive secretions, peripheral blood, pancreatic tissues
      and so on, and hope to identify the potential biomarker and pathogenic mechanisms that causes
      the onset and progression of pancreatic diseases.
