  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of the proposed study is to evaluate the effects of an 8-week aerobic
      exercise program on cognition and determine the relationship between cognitive improvements
      and Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) neuroplasticity. The investigators will also
      explore the effect modification of BDNF levels and BDNF allelic status, and APOE4 status on
      cognitive response after exercise.

  <detailed_description>

      The investigators will quantify cognitive improvements following moderate to high intensity
      aerobic exercise intervention (participant will choose between treadmill, elliptical or
      stationary bike). Each participant will engage in 60 minute daily sessions delivered 3
      times/week for 8 consecutive weeks (a total of 24 sessions). The investigators will determine
      the relationship between cognitive improvements and TMS neuroplasticity. The cognitive
      domains explored will be: 1) Visuomotor processing speed and cognitive flexibility/task
      switching; 2) Response inhibition, mental flexibility, and attentional control; 3) Attention
      and working memory; 4) List Learning and Memory; and 5) Semantic Verbal Fluency. The
      investigators will also explore the effect modification of BDNF levels and BDNF allelic
      status, and APOE4 status on cognitive response after exercise.

             Rating (CDR) score of 0)

          -  low activity level (individuals who do not engage in regular exercise, or currently
             exercise once a week or less)
