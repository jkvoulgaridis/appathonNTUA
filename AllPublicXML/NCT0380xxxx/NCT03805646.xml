  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      After being admitted to and then discharged from a hospital in Cameroon for having
      experienced an injury, there is no established way for the health system to check in on how
      the discharged person is doing. The investigators have developed a set of questions with the
      hope that asking these questions--over the phone--to those who have been discharged from the
      hospital will allow them to determine which post-discharge patients would benefit from
      further care. The investigators believe that asking these questions over the phone is a good
      way of determining which post-discharge trauma patients would benefit from further care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Broadly, this study aims to answer three questions. (1) Is it feasible to call discharged
      trauma patients on their mobile phones to check up on them? (2) Can a defined set of
      questions help determine which discharged trauma patients require further medical care (and
      which discharged trauma patients do not require further medical care)? (3) Will checking in
      on discharged trauma patients reduce their experience of disability and economic
      consequences?

      If an individual was a trauma patient who was admitted at and then discharged from one of the
      study's partner hospitals in Cameroon, the discharged individual (hereafter referred to as
      &quot;the participant') will be receiving phone calls from one of the study's research assistants
      at the following post-discharge timepoints: 2 weeks, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months. Whether
      the research assistant administers the defined set of questions developed by the study's
      investigators (see question 2, above) will depend on when the participant was discharged from
      the hospital. Regardless, all participants will be asked other important questions about the
      injury and any associated disabilities and economic consequences.

    <intervention_model_description>None of the interventional study model categories aptly describe the study. The step-wedge design of the study means each site has historical controls; the only thing determining whether an individual receives the intervention or not is time (that is, whether the hospital site s/he was admitted to happens to be in the pre-intervention/baseline data collection phase or the intervention phase).</intervention_model_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Proportion of Successful Contacts</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months after enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>The number of successful contacts will be divided by the total number of contacts. A &quot;successful&quot; contact is a phone call during which the research assistant has completed administered the questionnaire(s) planned for that phone call.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Number of Attempts Required to Achieve a Successful Contact</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months after enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>This will be calculated by averaging the number of call attempts made until a research assistant is able to successfully administer the questionnaire(s) planned for that phone call.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Cost Associated with Personnel Time</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months after enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>This measure will be calculated by averaging how much it costs to pay the research assistant for the time s/he spends making the required phone calls.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Cost Associated with Telephone Time</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months after enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>This measure will be calculated by averaging how much the telephone company charges for making the required phone calls.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Telephone Triage Tool Administration Time</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day after administration of the telephone triage tool (i.e. about 2 weeks after enrollment)</time_frame>
    <description>This measure will be calculated based on how much time it takes to administer the telephone triage tool.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Physician Assessment of Whether a Patient Would Benefit from Further Services</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately after the physician administers the physical exam (i.e. about 3 weeks after enrollment)</time_frame>
    <description>This is a binary measure. After a physician examines a participant, s/he will determine whether s/he thinks the participant would benefit from further services (including additional follow-up care, and/or diagnostic or therapeutic interventions).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Acceptability Score of Mobile Phones as a Follow-up Tool</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks after enrollment and 6 months after enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>This is a numerical measure that represents the sum of the positive responses that participants give to each question that assesses the acceptability of mobile phones as a follow-up tool. The scale for the acceptability score of mobile phones as a follow-up tool ranges from 0 to 6, where 0 means the participant's responses indicate the participant believes mobile phones are definitely not an acceptable follow-up tool and 6 means the participant's responses indicate the participant believes mobile phones are definitely an acceptable follow-up tool.</description>

    <measure>Mean Glasgow Outcomes Scale-Extended (GOSE) Disability Level</measure>
    <time_frame>After the final participant undergoes the 6-month telephone follow-up protocol (i.e. about 28 months after enrollment of the first participant)</time_frame>
    <description>The average GOSE disability level that participants in the study report. For each participant, GOSE disability level will be determined using the augmented GOSE (aGOSE) instrument, which assesses factors like the participant's independence inside and outside the home, work, social and leisure activities, family and friendship, etc. Each time after administration of the aGOSE instrument, the participant's GOSE disability level will be calculated. The aGOSE instrument will be administered at the 2-week, 1-month, 3-month, and 6-month post-discharge timepoints.</description>
