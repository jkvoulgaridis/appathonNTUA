      This study divide patients into two groups, one will be given propofol midazolam and
      fentanyl; another group was given propofol with midazolam without fentanyl; to observe two
      groups of patients blood pressure, body movement, and propofol dosage , and the difference in
      operator satisfaction, and how many people need to give fentanyl again; and two groups of
      patients after the operation of the reaction, if there are dizziness, nausea, and other
      adverse reactions; finally, the differences of these two schemes in different populations
      were analyzed, and the rationalization and individualized medication will be put forward.
