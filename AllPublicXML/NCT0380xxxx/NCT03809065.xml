  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Deliberate hypotension is used to provide bloodless field during endoscopic sinus surgery;
      however, hypotension might impair perfusion of vital organs. The aim of this work is to
      compare the impact of nitroglycerin and labetalol on peripheral perfusion when used for
      induction of deliberate hypotension

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hypotensive anesthesia is associated with the risk of reduced tissue perfusion. The usual
      target mean arterial pressure during deliberate hypotension is 50- 65 mmHg; however, the
      status of peripheral perfusion under this target is not well investigated. Nitroglycerin and
      Labetalol are commonly used drugs to achieve deliberate hypotension. Nitroglycerin is a
      direct vasodilator and its main action is through venodilation, while labetalol combines a
      selective α1 and non selective beta-adrenergic blocking activity. Both drugs were previously
      compared during deliberate hypotension with regard to surgical field quality and blood loss.
      No study to date compared the effects of both drugs on peripheral perfusion when used for
      induction of deliberate hypotension. The Peripheral Perfusion Index (PPI) is the ratio
      between pulsatile and non-pulsatile components of peripheral circulation. Measurement of PPI
      is based on analysis of the pulse oximetry signal. PPI showed increasing popularity as a non
      invasive monitor of peripheral perfusion. Serum lactate is another frequently used marker of
      global tissue perfusion.The aim of this study is to compare the influence of nitroglycerin
      and labetalol on tissue perfusion when used for induction of deliberate hypotension during
      FESS operations. Tissue perfusion will be evaluated using PPI and serum lactate as markers of
      peripheral and global tissue perfusion respectively.

    <measure>Surgical field score (SFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>from beginning of surgery till the end of the procedure.</time_frame>
    <description>SFS ranges from 0 to 5 as follows: 0: No bleeding, 1: Slight bleeding-no suctioning of blood required, 2: Slight bleeding-occasional suctioning required. Surgical field not threatened. 3: Slight bleeding-frequent suctioning required. Bleeding threatens surgical field a few seconds after suction is removed, 4: Moderate bleeding-frequent suctioning required. Bleeding threatens surgical field directly after suction is removed, 5: Severe bleeding-constant suctioning required. Bleeding appears faster that can be removed by suction. Surgical field severely threatened and surgery not possible.
Adequate surgical field is defined as SFS &lt;3</description>
