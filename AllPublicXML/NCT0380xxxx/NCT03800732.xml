      This study aimed to verify the influence of night work and food intake during the night shift
      on the eating behavior of fixed night workers the next day.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Night work causes restriction of sleep time and circadian misalignment and, therefore, have
      been associated with nutritional and metabolic impairments. The objective of the present
      study is to verify the influence of night work and food intake in this period on the behavior
      of the following day. The workers selected by criteria and inclusion and exclusion will be
      evaluated at the baseline: anthropometric parameters, food consumption and perception,
      duration of food consumption, sleep habits and chronobiological pattern (sleep monitoring by
      actigraphy, chronotype, social jet lag), parameters biochemical (blood count, lipidogram,
      C-reactive protein, cortisol, glucose, insulin).Subsequently, 30 workers will integrate a
      randomized and controlled crossover clinical study with three randomly established
      interventions: (1) two nights of work without meals during the shift; (2) two nights of work
      with a meal during the shift; (3) two nights sleep. Participants will go to the laboratory
      the morning after the second night of each condition to offer a test meal ad libitum, which
      will consist of foods of various compositions and food groups. Preprandial metabolic
      assessments will be conducted (ghrelin, GLP-1 - glucagon-like peptide 1, PYY-peptide YY). The
      following postprandial evaluations will be carried out and in the 24 hours following the
      experiment: food choices (record of all foods) and food perceptions (hunger, appetite,
      satiety and eating). It is expected to determine how nocturnal versus nocturnal work, and
      nocturnal fasting versus nocturnal fasting affect the next day's food choices.
