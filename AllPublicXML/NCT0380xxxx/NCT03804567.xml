      Research question: Is there any evidence to suggest that the oldpain2go® intervention merits
      scientific investigation?

      Aims:

        1. To collect data to:

             1. give an indication of the potential effect size, of any effects, from the
                oldpain2go® intervention, in people with persistent low back pain.

             2. to explore the eligibility criteria, recruitment methods and materials proposed
                here, for potential use in a future Feasibility study, of the oldpain2go®
                intervention.

        2. To compare demographic characteristics, medical history and outcome measure data of:

             1. people for whom Oldpain2go® is indicated (at the Oldpain2go® screening session),
                with those for whom it is not,

             2. people for whom the Oldpain2go® intervention works, after one treatment, with those
                for whom it does not, and

             3. people for whom the Oldpain2go® intervention works, after one, or two, treatments,
                with those for whom it does not work after two treatments.
