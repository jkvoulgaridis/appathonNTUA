      Randomized (1:1 ratio) study of subcutaneous (SC) versus intravenous (IV) fluid rehydration
      in mildly to moderately dehydrated pediatric patients.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized (1:1 ratio), open-label, parallel group, multicenter,
      multi-national, study of SC versus IV fluid rehydration in mildly to moderately dehydrated
      pediatric patients treated in the Emergency Department (ED), inpatient pediatric unit, and/or
      outpatient urgent care facility. It is expected that up to 186 patients, in order to achieve
      148 evaluable patients, will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive isotonic fluid
      rehydration by either SC administration with hylenex (150 Units) or IV without hylenex.

The term &quot;anatomical site&quot; was designated as: 1) the back; 2) left thigh; 3) right thigh; 4) abdomen; or 5) chest. The label for hylenex indicated precautionary wording recommending an upper limit on the volume of fluid (200 mL) administered subcutaneously to infants less than 3 years of age. In October 2008, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) removed this wording from the label, thus negating the need for these data and associated analyses. The protocol was amended to reflect this label change; thus, this analysis was not conducted.</description>

          -  Any medical condition likely to interfere with the patient's ability to fully complete
             all protocol-specified interventions, the ability to undergo all protocol-specified

             required for treatment of dehydration.

The term &quot;anatomical site&quot; was designated as: 1) the back; 2) left thigh; 3) right thigh; 4) abdomen; or 5) chest. The label for hylenex indicated precautionary wording recommending an upper limit on the volume of fluid (200 mL) administered subcutaneously to infants less than 3 years of age. In October 2008, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) removed this wording from the label, thus negating the need for these data and associated analyses. The protocol was amended to reflect this label change; thus, this analysis was not conducted.</description>

        <description>Hydration status was assessed clinically using the Gorelick 10-item scale: general condition, quality of radial pulse, quality of respiration, skin elasticity, eyes, tears, mucous membranes, urine output, heart rate, and capillary refill time at the fingertip. Scores ranged from 0 (less severe impairment) to 10 (more severe impairment). Change from Baseline was calculated as the post-Baseline value minus the Baseline value.</description>

        <description>A global assessment of overall satisfaction with the rehydration therapy by healthcare provider was performed at the end of SC or IV fluid rehydration utilizing a simple questionnaire. There were separate questionnaires for the two types of rehydration (SC and IV). Question 1: Was the participant successfully hydrated using the randomized route of administration?; Question 2: Overall, was the procedure of fluid infusion easy to perform?; Question 3: Were there any unacceptable side effects from the therapy?; Question 4: Would you consider using this hydration therapy for this indication in the future?</description>
