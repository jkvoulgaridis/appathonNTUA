  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic inflammatory disease which often has
      debilitating and potentially life-threatening consequences. The cause of SLE is unknown and
      current therapies lack specificity and carry significant side-effects. We previously
      discovered the depletion of glutathione in lymphocytes of patients with SLE and associated
      this metabolic change with the elevation of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential.

      This study will titrate to tolerance during an initial 3 month open label period and then
      subjects will be randomized to one of 2 arms.

      It was determined by statistical analysis that each group must have 105 subjects. All
      subjects will be enrolled and evaluated for tolerance of NAC between dosages of 2.4 g/day and
      4.8 g/day for 3 months. After A 3-month open-label dose-titration phase, SLE subjects will be
      randomized into 2 groups of 105 subjects either to continue the tolerated dosage of NAC or
      switched to equal number of placebo capsules. There will be up to seven study visits per SLE
      subject, including the screening and wash out visits. Visits 2-6 will be scheduled three
      months apart. The study will last 13 months with the wash-out visit. Each subject will donate
      approximately 100 ml of blood for biomarker studies at each visit. Healthy control subjects
      will donate blood at the same time. They will be matched to the SLE subjects by gender, age
      within 10 years, and ethnicity. Their blood will be used as reference for biomarker assays.

      There is a consent form required to participate in the phase II study.

      Subjects will take NAC in a dose range of 2.4 g/day to 4.8 g/day which will be titrated to
      tolerance during an initial 3-month open label period. After the 3-month open label period,
      patients in each arm will continue taking equal numbers of capsules representing a dosage
      that has been titrated to tolerance. As an example, the patients tolerating 2.4 g/day, or 4
      capsules containing 600 mg of NAC, after 3 months will be randomized to take 4 NAC or 4
      placebo (2.4 g/day dextrose) capsules twice daily for the 9 subsequent months.

      The primary outcome variable will be the response (yes/no) in the SLE Respinder Index or SRI
      at Month 12 (reduction ≥ 4 points in SELENA-SLEDAI score and therefore also called SRI-4; no
      new BILAG A organ domain score and no more than 1 new BILAG B organ domain score; and no
      worsening in Physician's Global Assessment (PGA) score) by ≥ 0.3 points versus baseline). A
      positive response will also require no treatment failure, defined as the need for
      non-protocol treatment, i.e., new or increased immunosuppressives or antimalarials; increased
      or parenteral corticosteroids; or premature discontinuation from study treatment.
      Corticosteroids can be tapered off at the investigator's discretion, based on disease
      activity. Four weeks after randomization, once tapered, corticosteroids can only be increased
      again to the dosage preceding the last taper step; any larger increase will be deemed a
      treatment failure. In addition, any increase in corticosteroid dosage during the last 3
      months of the trial will result in declaration of treatment failure.

      We will monitor tolerance and safety, and assess SLEDAI, BILAG, FAS, PROMIS, ASRS, prednisone
      use, liver and bone marrow function as secondary outcomes.
