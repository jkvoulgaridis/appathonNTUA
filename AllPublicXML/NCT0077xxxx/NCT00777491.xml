      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as fluorouracil, cisplatin, and gemcitabine, work
      in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by
      stopping them from dividing. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells.
      Giving chemotherapy together with radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying two different chemotherapy and radiation
      therapy regimens to see how they work in treating patients with stage II or stage III bladder
      cancer that was removed by surgery.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To estimate the rate of distant metastasis at 3 years in patients who have undergone
           transurethral resection of the bladder tumor for stage II or III muscle-invasive bladder
           cancer treated with chemoradiotherapy comprising fluorouracil, cisplatin, and
           radiotherapy vs gemcitabine hydrochloride and radiotherapy followed by selective bladder
           preservation and adjuvant chemotherapy comprising gemcitabine hydrochloride and
           cisplatin.

      Secondary

        -  To estimate the treatment completion rate in these patients.

        -  To estimate acute and late grade toxicities (≥ grade 3 genitourinary, gastrointestinal,
           and hematologic toxicities) of these regimens in these patients.

        -  To estimate the efficacy of these regimens, in terms of achieving complete response of
           the primary tumor, in these patients.

        -  To estimate the efficacy of these regimens, in terms of preserving the native,
           tumor-free bladder 5 years after completion of therapy, in these patients.

        -  To estimate the value of tumor histopathologic, molecular genetic, DNA content,
           metabolomic, and proteomic parameters as possible significant prognostic factors for
           initial tumor response and recurrence-free survival.

        -  To analyze for American Urological Association (AUA) Symptom scores at baseline and at 3
           years from patients on both arms.

        -  To find potentially predictive biomarkers for cystectomy-free survival.

        -  To find potentially predictive biomarkers for acute and late toxicities.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to tumor stage (T2 vs
      T3-4a). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

    <measure>Percentage of Patients With Grade 3 or Higher Genitourinary, Gastrointestinal, or Hematologic Adverse Events</measure>
    <time_frame>From start of treatment to 180 days after the end of treatment. Treatment could last up to 40 weeks depending on arm, tumor response, and allowed time ranges.</time_frame>
    <description>Highest grade adverse event (AE) per subject was counted. Adverse events were graded using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v3.0. Grade refers to the severity of the AE. The CTCAE v3.0 assigns Grades 1 through 5 with unique clinical descriptions of severity for each AE based on this general guideline: Grade 1 Mild, Grade 2 Moderate, Grade 3 Severe, Grade 4 Life-threatening or disabling, Grade 5 Death related to AE. All adverse events are counted, regardless of reported relationship to protocol treatment.</description>

    <measure>Change in American Urological Association Symptom Index (AUASI) Score at 3 Years</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>The AUASI is a validated 7-item measure used to assess urinary symptoms. A higher score indicates more severe symptoms for the individual questions and overall total. Six questions ask about frequency of symptoms over the past month with possible responses: 0= Not at all; 1 = Less than 1 time in 5; 2 = less than half the time, 3 = About half the time, 4 = More than half the time, 5 = Almost always. An additional question asks the number of times one gets up to urinate after going to bed, with response indicating the exact number of times ranging from 0 to 5. The total score is the sum of the questions and ranges from 0 to 35. Change is calculated as 3-year score - baseline score such that a negative change indicates improvement.</description>

      <textblock>
        Inclusion criteria:

          1. Pathologically (histologically or cytologically) proven diagnosis of primary carcinoma
             of the bladder (transitional cell cancer) within 8 weeks of registration. Operable
             patients whose tumors are primary carcinomas of the bladder and exhibit histologic
             evidence of muscularis propria invasion and are American Joint Committee on Cancer
             (AJCC) clinical stages T2-T4a, Nx or N0, M0 (Appendix IV) without hydronephrosis;
             patients who have involvement of the prostatic urethra with transitional cell cancer
             (TCC) that was visibly completely resected and no evidence of stromal invasion of the
             prostate remain eligible. T2a, T2b, T3a, T3b ―substages‖ are not usually able to be
             determined with clinical (TURBT) staging.

          2. If radiologic evaluation of a lymph node is interpreted as &quot;positive&quot;, this must be

               -  8.4 Hemoglobin (hgb) ≥ 10.0 mg/dl (Note: The use of transfusion or other
                  intervention to achieve Hgb ≥ 10.0 g/dl is acceptable.);

          9. Serum creatinine of 1.5 mg% or less; serum bilirubin of 2.0 mg% or less; creatinine
             clearance of 60 ml/min or greater no more than 4 weeks prior to registration; Note:
             Calculated creatinine clearance is permissible. If the creatinine clearance is &gt; 60
             ml/min, then a serum creatinine of up to 1.8 mg% is allowable at the discretion of the
             study chair;

         10. Serum pregnancy test for female patients of childbearing potential, ≤ 72 hours prior
             to study entry; women of childbearing potential and male participants must practice
             adequate contraception.

         11. Patient must be able to provide study-specific informed consent prior to study entry.

        Exclusion criteria:

          1. Evidence of tumor-related hydronephrosis

          2. Evidence of distant metastases or histologically or cytologically proven lymph node
             metastases

          3. Previous systemic chemotherapy (for any cancer) or pelvic radiation therapy

          4. A prior or concurrent malignancy of any other site or histology unless the patient has
             been disease-free for ≥ 5 years except for non-melanoma skin cancer and/or stage T1a
             prostate cancer or carcinoma in situ of the uterine cervix

          5. Patients judged not to be candidates for radical cystectomy; patients with pN+ or T4b
             disease are considered to have unresectable disease

          6. Patients receiving any drugs that have potential nephrotoxicity or ototoxicity (such
             as an aminoglycoside)

          7. Severe, active co-morbidity, defined as follows:

               -  7.1 Unstable angina and/or congestive heart failure requiring hospitalization
                  within the last 6 months;

               -  7.2 Transmural myocardial infarction within the last 6 months;

               -  7.3 Acute bacterial or fungal infection requiring intravenous antibiotics at the
                  time of registration;

               -  7.4 Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease exacerbation or other respiratory
                  illness requiring hospitalization or precluding study therapy at the time of
                  registration;

               -  7.5 Hepatic insufficiency resulting in clinical jaundice and/or coagulation
                  defects; note, however, that laboratory tests for liver function and coagulation
                  parameters are not required for entry into this protocol.

               -  7.6 Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) based upon current Center for
                  Disease Control (CDC) definition; note, however, that HIV testing is not required
                  for entry into this protocol. The need to exclude patients with AIDS from this
                  protocol is necessary because the treatments involved in this protocol may be
                  significantly immunosuppressive. Protocol-specific requirements may also exclude
                  immuno-compromised patients.

          8. Pregnancy or women of childbearing potential and men who are sexually active and not
             willing/able to use medically acceptable forms of contraception; this exclusion is
             necessary because the treatment involved in this study may be significantly
             teratogenic.

          9. Prior allergic reaction to the study drug(s) involved in this protocol

          <description>Within 8 weeks following pre-study transurethral resection (TUR) patients receive 2.5 weeks of induction chemoradiotherapy (induction 5-fluorouracil, induction cisplatin, induction BID [twice daily] radiation therapy). Consolidation chemoradiotherapy begins 7-14 days following post-induction chemoradiotherapy endoscopic response evaluation. Patients achieving a complete response receive 1.5 weeks of consolidation chemoradiotherapy (consolidation 5-fluorouracil, consolidation cisplatin, consolidation BID radiation therapy). Patients without a complete response undergo radical cystectomy. Outpatient adjuvant chemotherapy (adjuvant gemcitabine, adjuvant cisplatin) begins 4-5 weeks following the post-consolidation endoscopic evaluation or 8-12 weeks following radical cystectomy, and continues for 12 weeks.</description>

            <groups_desc>The confidence interval of the rate was calculated by Clopper-Pearson’s exact binomial confidence intervals methods with one-sided type I error of 0.1. The study required 32 analyzable patients in each arm, which would warrant a 10% chance of observing a percentage of patients without distant metastasis by 3 years of less than 75% if the true rate was 86%. With the actual number of evaluable patients, the study instead warrants a 13-14% chance.</groups_desc>

        <title>Change in American Urological Association Symptom Index (AUASI) Score at 3 Years</title>
        <description>The AUASI is a validated 7-item measure used to assess urinary symptoms. A higher score indicates more severe symptoms for the individual questions and overall total. Six questions ask about frequency of symptoms over the past month with possible responses: 0= Not at all; 1 = Less than 1 time in 5; 2 = less than half the time, 3 = About half the time, 4 = More than half the time, 5 = Almost always. An additional question asks the number of times one gets up to urinate after going to bed, with response indicating the exact number of times ranging from 0 to 5. The total score is the sum of the questions and ranges from 0 to 35. Change is calculated as 3-year score - baseline score such that a negative change indicates improvement.</description>
