      The purpose of this study is to determine if a medication therapy management program designed
      to reconcile a patient's medications and identify and resolve drug related problems can
      reduce adverse drug events and other measures of safety and improve patient satisfaction.

      This study will be a multicenter, prospective, randomized study of usual care (Arm 1; control
      group) compared with usual care plus medication reconciliation by patient interview and a
      drug related problem assessment (Arm 2; Basic MTM) and usual care plus medication
      reconciliation by patient interview with additional information obtained from the patient
      chart and drug related problem assessment (Arm 3; Enhance MTM). Approximately 600 patients
      will be enrolled in this study, 200 in each study arm. Two hundred potential subjects will be
      recruited at each of the three participating sites: the UIC Medical Center, Baylor Health
      Care System, and Duke Primary Care Research Consortium. For inclusion in the study, patients
      must be at least 65 years old, primarily uses English for written and oral communication,
      have 3 or more comorbid conditions from a list of conditions (see table 1 of protocol), have
      two or more physician office visits at one or more affiliated clinics in the past year, have
      received 8 or more different chronic prescription medications over the six months prior to
      the enrollment period, have a telephone line and agree to maintain if for at least 6 months,
      and have a situation placing him/her at risk for a drug related problem (see protocol for
      list). Subjects unable to demonstrate comprehension of the informed consent, with a terminal
      condition, or those enrolled in an MTM program where medication reconciliation and/or
      assessment of drug related problems has occurred in the previous 12 months will be excluded
      from enrolling in the study.

      Patients in the control group will participate in the baseline study visit, will continue to
      have access to the regular scheduled physician clinic visit and their prescription filled at
      the UIC pharmacy, and will participate in the telephone survey after the sixth month of the
      study. Patients in the Arms 2 and 3 intervention groups will participate in the baseline
      visit, will be asked to participate in two clinic visits with an MTM clinician, and will be
      asked to answer two telephone surveys (at 3 months and at 6 months after enrollment).
