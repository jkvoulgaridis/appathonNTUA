    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, two part (Part A and Part B) clinical study of CMP-001 administered
      intratumorally (IT) and subcutaneously (SC) in combination with atezolizumab with or without
      radiation therapy in participants with NSCLC.

    <textblock>
      This study will be conducted in two parts, run sequentially: Part A of the study will
      evaluate the safety and preliminary signs of efficacy for the combination of CMP-001 and
      atezolizumab. Part B of the study will evaluate the addition of radiation therapy to the
      combination of CMP-001 and atezolizumab.

      Each part of the study will follow a Simon 2-stage Optimal Design approach. Part A and Part B
      of the study will commence with a safety run in of 5 participants treated with the
      combination treatment (CMP-001 and atezolizumab in Part A; and CMP-001, atezolizumab and
      radiation therapy in Part B). After the first 5 participants have passed a safety
      dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) observation period of 30 days and upon approval from the Safety
      Review Committee (SRC), both parts of the study will continue with enrollment of an
      additional 7 participants in each part to complete Stage 1 of respective parts. If an
      acceptable safety profile is established and at least 2 responders out of 12 evaluable
      participants (that is, complete and partial responders based on Response Evaluation Criteria
      in Solid Tumors [RECIST] version 1.1 [v1.1] or RECIST v1.1 for immune-based therapeutics
      [iRECIST] criteria) in Stage 1), the study will enroll an additional 23 evaluable
      participants in Stage 2 of each part. A maximum of 35 evaluable participants will be enrolled
      in each Part A and Part B.

      Participants enrolled in Part A with documented progression per RECIST v1.1 on the
      combination of CMP-001 and atezolizumab have the option to receive radiation therapy add-on
      treatment after documented disease progression per computed tomography (CT)/magnetic
      resonance imaging (MRI) or positron emission tomography (PET) scan. The total number of
      participants enrolled into the Part A optional radiation therapy add-on may not exceed the
      total number of participants enrolled in Part A. Enrollment of participants in Part A
      optional radiation therapy add-on will not affect enrollment in Part B of the study as these
      participants will be evaluated separately.

      Participants will continue treatment with CMP-001 in combination with atezolizumab as long as
      they do not experience unacceptable toxicities and when, according to the Investigator,
      continued treatment is in the participant's best interest.

          -  Received investigational therapy (that is, small molecule or biologic) within 30 days
             prior to the start of CMP-001 dosing on Week 1 Day 1. However, if an investigational
             therapy has a short half-life, a reduced wash out period may be acceptable with
             Sponsor approval. Acceptable washout periods for non-investigational therapy include:

               1. 3-14 days from prior tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) depending on half-life.

               2. 3 weeks from prior chemotherapy.

               3. 1 week for prior palliative radiation therapy, or 2 weeks if prior brain

                  (anti-CTLA-4) antibody within 30 days prior to the start of CMP-001.

               5. 14 days for prior PD-1 therapy.

          -  Known infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV) or
             hepatitis C virus (HCV). If there is no known or documented history of HIV, HBV or
             HCV, the site is not required to do additional testing for these values at Screening.

          -  Developed autoimmune disorders of Grade 4 while on prior immunotherapy. Participants
             who developed autoimmune disorders, of Grade &lt;=3 may enroll if the disorder has
             resolved to Grade &lt;=1 and the participant has been off systemic steroids at doses
             greater than (&gt;) 10 milligrams per day (mg/day), for the treatment of the autoimmune
             disorder, for at least 2 weeks.

          -  Require systemic pharmacologic doses of corticosteroids greater than the equivalent of
             10 mg/day prednisone; topical, ophthalmologic and inhalational steroids are permitted.
             Participants who have a history of adrenal insufficiency and are receiving greater
             than 10 mg/day prednisone may be eligible but only after Sponsor consultations.
             Participants who are currently receiving steroids at a dose of &lt;=10 mg/day do not need
             to discontinue steroids prior to enrollment.

               1. The metastases have been treated by surgery and/or radiotherapy.

               2. The participant is off corticosteroids of &gt;10 mg/day prednisone or equivalent.

               3. The participant is neurologically stable for at least 2 weeks prior to Screening.

               4. Brain MRI completed within 6 weeks of Screening (required for all participants).

          -  Any concurrent uncontrolled illness, including mental illness or substance abuse,
             which in the opinion of the Investigator, would make the participant unable to
             cooperate or participate in the trial.

          -  Severe uncontrolled cardiac disease within 6 months of screening, including but not
             limited to uncontrolled hypertension; unstable angina; myocardial infarction (MI) or

             pharmacotherapy, surgery or conventional radiotherapy for treatment of malignant
             tumor). Limited field single dose radiotherapy for pain palliation would be allowed at
             any time during the course of treatment.

          -  Women of childbearing potential who are unable or unwilling to use an acceptable
             method of contraception.

          -  Requires continuous anti-coagulation or anti-platelet therapy that cannot be safely
             interrupted to allow for IT injection and/or history of coagulopathy.

          -  History of another malignancy except for:

               1. Malignancy treated with curative intent and with no known active disease &gt;5 years
                  prior to the start of CMP-001 dosing on Week 1 Day 1 and of low potential risk
                  for recurrence.

               2. Adequately treated non-melanoma skin cancer or lentigo maligna without evidence
                  of disease.

               3. Adequately treated carcinoma in situ without evidence of disease (for example,
                  cervical cancer in situ), superficial bladder cancer, squamous cell carcinoma of
                  the skin, basal cell carcinoma of the skin.
