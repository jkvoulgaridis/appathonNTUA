  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, pilot RCT study, aiming to compare intensive dosage and regular dosage
      of PD for AKI patients with indications for dialysis.

      Aims of the study are to:

      Examine the feasibility of the study, which aims to determine the efficacy and safety of
      intensive PD dose for AKI patients as compared to regular PD dose.

      Establish the appropriate workflow for PD treatment for AKI patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI) is rapidly increasing worldwide, which partly due
      to greater recognition of AKI, more exposure to various nephrotoxins and an ageing population
      with increased burden of non-infectious chronic disease. Intermittent hemodialysis (IHD) or
      continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) (i.e. venous-venous HD or hemofiltration) are the
      most-commonly modalities applied for acute kidney injury (AKI) patients in both developed and
      developing countries. By contrast, the use of peritoneal dialysis (PD) has been rare. There
      are no consensus on the ideal dosage and target of adequacy for PD in AKI. Therefore, we are
      to perform a multicenter, pilot RCT study, aiming to compare intensive dosage and regular
      dosage of PD for AKI patients with indications for dialysis. If successful, this strategy is
      expected to enhance the remedy rate of AKF patients, especially in developing
      regions/countries.

    <description>Within the first month since PD initiates, PD prescription will be adjusted to achieve the minimum target of 3.5. It's anticipated to prescribe the dosage with automatic PD (APD) or manual PD as 24-36L/day of dialysate, 1.5-2L/exchange, and 16 cycles. Anyway, it depends on the characteristics of the patients, including residual renal function, peritoneal memberane properties. The Kt/V goal will be compromised by clinical assessment for the patient, which means PD will not induce additional treatment, such as fluid infusion.</description>
