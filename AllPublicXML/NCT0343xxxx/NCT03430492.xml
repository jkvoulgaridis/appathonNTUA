      This study aims to define the association between psychological resilience and biomolecular
      signatures in cancer patients and to relate psychological resilience to prognosis, as this
      could potentially open up a novel avenue of therapeutic interventions, medical as well as
      psychosocial.

      Individual patients differ in psychological response when receiving a cancer diagnosis. Given
      the same disease burden some patients master the situation well and others do experience a
      great deal of stress, depression and lowered quality of life. A patient's mental resistance
      after acquiring a threat, like a cancer diagnosis, called psychological resilience, is known
      to impact the outcome of the disease. Patients with high psychological resilience are likely
      to experience less stress reactions, and a better adaptation and management of the life
      threat and the demanding therapeutic interventions. How this phenomenon of mastering
      difficult situations is reflected also in bio-molecular processes is not much studied and how
      these have an impact on the cancer prognosis and the effectiveness of treatment is today not
      fully understood. However, there is evidence that expressing the emotions evoked is an
      important part of fighting cancer.

      Our hypothesis is that patients displaying a high psychological resilience, according to a
      standardized method &quot;The Connor-Davidson resilience scale&quot; i.e. low stress reactions, low
      hopelessness and low fatigue, also present a specific pattern of biomolecular signatures in
      blood, represented by its epigenome, microRNA and proteomic patterns.

      This project specifically aims to investigate if breast cancer patient´s psychological
      resilience can be coupled to bio-molecular parameters, using advanced &quot;omics&quot; and as a
      secondary aim, if it relates to prognosis and quality of life one year after diagnosis.

        SCAN-B Resilience is, as a part of the SCAN-B program, a prospective breast cancer study
        with established infrastructure for enrollment and follow-ups for patient. The study
        population is newly diagnosed breast cancer patients enrolled in SCAN-B at the hospitals in
        Karlskrona, Helsingborg, Växjö and Halmstad.

        The INCA register (a information network for cancer care) includes almost 100% of all women
        diagnosed with breast cancer. Based on comparison with cancer registrations in INCA for
        2011-2012, 85 % of all new breast cancer diagnosed women are included in SCAN-B. In April
        2017 83% of patients included in SCAN-B were also enrolled in SCAN-B Resilience why a
        majority (70%) of women diagnosed with breast cancer are enrolled in this study
