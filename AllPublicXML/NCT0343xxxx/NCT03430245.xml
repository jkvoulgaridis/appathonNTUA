      Prospective, one-arm, baseline-controlled pilot study for the evaluation of the VelaShape III
      combined with UltraShape Power treatment for non-invasive circumference reduction to the
      thighs.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eligible subjects will receive 3 bi-weekly treatments to the thighs at 2-week intervals, with
      the VelaShape III and UltraShape Power devices according to the study protocol.

      Each subject will return for 3 follow up visits: four weeks (4wk FU), 8 weeks (8wk FU) and 12
      weeks (12wk FU) after the last treatment (Tx.3), for total expected study duration of 16
      weeks.

    <description>The thighs circumference change (at midline) after combined treatment with VelaShape III and UltraShape Power treatments compared to baseline.
The changed of thighs circumference was calculated at 2, 4, 8 and 12 weeks after baseline (which are second treatment , third treatment, 4 and 8 week follow-up visits, respectively).
Negative change represent reduction in thigh circumference.</description>
