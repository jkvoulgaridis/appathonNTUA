  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial studies how well a home-based neurofeedback program works in treating participants
      with chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (nerve damage that affects motor function).
      Neurofeedback training is a type of therapy that uses an electroencephalograph and a computer
      software program to measure brain wave activity. It may help teach participants how to change
      their own brain waves to lower their perception of pain symptoms and improve overall quality
      of life.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Examine the feasibility of using a home-based neurofeedback system and dry
      electroencephalography (EEG) cap to treat chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Estimate the effects of home-based neurofeedback (HBNF) on symptoms of (CIPN) versus a
      wait list (WL) control group in cancer patients.

      II. Estimate the effects of home-based neurofeedback (HBNF), versus WL, on the cortical and
      subcortical brain regions associated with CIPN.

      III. Estimate the effects of a HBNF on other aspects of pain, cancer-related symptoms,
      quality of life (QOL), and mental health.

      OUTLINE: Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.

      GROUP I: Participants complete at least neurofeedback training sessions over 30 minutes 2
      times a week for up to 5 weeks.

      GROUP II: Participants receive standard of care.

      After completion of study, participants are followed up at 1 week for Group I and 6 weeks for
      Group II.
