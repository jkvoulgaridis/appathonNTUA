  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of the study is to observe the adherence and health seeking behavior of
      patients with Head and Neck cancer (HNC) certified to obtain medically certified cannabis as
      part of their supportive care regimen undergoing treatment with definitive or adjuvant
      concurrent chemoradiation (CRT).

    <description>Patient dosing options will be stratified into three groups defined as standard, frail/elderly (age &gt; 65 or ECOG 2), and cannabis-experienced (&gt; weekly use of cannabis in the past year outside of NYC Medical Marijuana program). NYC specified cannabis formulation options are defined by THC:CBD ratio as 1:1, low THC:high CBD, high THC:low CBD, and high THC:high CBD.</description>

  <biospec_descr>

      Blood (less than 10 mL in an EDTA tube), urine (less than 15 mL), and oral swab samples will
      be collected from patients at baseline, once during weeks 1-2, once during week 5-6, and at
      the time of post-treatment follow-up appointments. These collections are included in the
      Study Calendar (section 4.6). Blood tests are routinely performed on a weekly basis for
      patients receiving systemic therapy and we will make all attempts to coordinate biospecimen
      collection for study purposes with biospecimen collection for standard clinical care in order
      to minimize patient inconvenience.

      Each specimen will be analyzed in the Stable Isotope &amp; Metabolomics Core Facility of the
      Diabetes Research Center under the direction of Dr. Irwin Kurland. We will test each sample
      for over 150 metabolites that are involved in pathways such as the urea cycle, fatty acid
      metabolism, and spermidine and spermine metabolism.
