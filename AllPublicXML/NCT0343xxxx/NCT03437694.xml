  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a clinical trial. The purpose of this clinical trial is to see if study participants
      have better health outcomes if their pharmacist has access to their medical records. The
      study will take place primarily in Fort Worth and Dallas, Texas. The trial will enroll adult,
      African-Americans with HIV. Study participants must also have either diabetes, high blood
      pressure or they may have both. Study participants will agree to have their medical records
      from all of their health providers released to UNTHSC. UNTHSC will provide the study
      pharmacist the medical records for half of the participants. Using the medical records, the
      study pharmacist will provide 'enhanced' patient counseling services to half of the
      participants. This enhanced service is called 'medication optimization'. For half of the
      participants that the study pharmacist does not see the medical records, they will receive
      usual and customary patient counseling. Not seeing the medical records is considered standard
      of care. In both groups, the counseling frequency will be based on the participant's needs
      but the study pharmacist will contact every participant to check on them at least every 90
      days. These visits will happen for 2 years. The two groups will be compared to see if those
      participants having medical information supported medication optimization have better health
      than those getting routine, the standard of care medication optimization.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study examines HIV medication optimization (HIV-MOI) in a prospective, randomized (1:1
      HIV-MOI: standard of care), clinical trial, comparing disease-specific clinical and
      humanistic outcomes in up to 200 adult African-Americans with HIV (1:1 men: women) and either
      diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM) and/or hypertension (HTN). Data will be collected from
      individual participants for a 2 year period. Once properly screened, consented and enrolled,
      medical records from participant's medical provider(s) will be obtained. Upon receipt of the
      medical records, research team personnel (working closely with the project biostatistician)
      will provide medical information only for those participants randomized to receive HIV-MOI to
      the study pharmacist. The study pharmacist then assesses the information to determine the
      clinical effectiveness and appropriateness of the current medical plan's medications. Upon
      completion, the study pharmacist will develop a prioritized medication problem list, create a
      plan, discuss/collaborate with the medical provider/healthcare team member as needed and then
      conduct the initial HIV-MOI visit with the patient. At the initial visit, an individualized
      care plan would be finalized with study participant input. Also at the initial HIV-MOI visit,
      the patient should receive an accurate (and reconciled with medical providers) personal
      medication record (PMR). Participants should also receive an individualized care plan called
      a medication action plan (MAP). The MAP can include non-pharmacological instructions and
      education. This may be guided in part by qualitative survey data obtained as part of the
      study visit. Follow-up visits will occur (ideally) not less than quarterly. Follow-up visits
      may occur face-to-face or using telecommunication methods.

      The study pharmacist will only be provided the medical information for the intervention
      group. Standard of care for pharmacists is not having access to medical information when
      providing HIV-MOI. Extracted data and study obtained data will be entered into the study
      database for analyses.
