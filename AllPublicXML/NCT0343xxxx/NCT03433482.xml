  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      MenACWY (Menveo) is a GSK vaccine intended for protection against disease caused by
      meningococcal bacteria groups A, C, W and Y in infants, children and adults, licensed in more
      than 60 countries.

      The purpose of this study is to compare the immunogenicity of the currently licensed MenACWY
      vaccine with the investigational MenACWY liquid vaccine aged for different lengths of time by
      storage at 2-8ºC.

    <masking_description>Data will be collected in an observer-blind manner. By observer-blind, it is meant that during the course of the study, the vaccine recipient and those responsible for the evaluation of any study endpoint (e.g. safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity) will all be unaware of which vaccine was administered. To do so, vaccine preparation and administration will be done by authorized medical personnel who will not participate in any of the study clinical evaluations.</masking_description>

    <description>The percentages of subjects with a ≥ 4-fold rise in post-vaccination hSBA (at Day 29 compared to Day 1) and associated 2-sided 95% Clopper-Pearson CIs are computed by group and N. meningitidis serogroups A, C, W and Y. A 4-fold rise in the hSBA titers is defined as:
for individuals, whose pre-vaccination titers are &lt; the LOD (limit of detection), the post-vaccination titers must be ≥ 4-fold the LOD or ≥ the LLOQ (lower limit of quantitation) whichever is greater;
for individuals whose pre-vaccination titers are ≥ the LOD and ≤ the LLOQ, the post-vaccination titers must be at least four times the LLOQ;
for individuals whose pre-vaccination titers are &gt; the LLOQ, the post-vaccination titers must be at least four times the pre-vaccination titer.</description>

    <description>For each study group the percentages of subjects with hSBA titer ≥8 and ≥LLOQ* and associated two-sided 95% Clopper-Pearson CIs are computed by the N. meningitidis serogroups A, C, W and Y on Day 1 and Day 29. Differences in percentages and associated 95% CIs between study groups are calculated using the Miettinen and Nurminen score method
