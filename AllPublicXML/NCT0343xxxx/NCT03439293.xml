      The regimen being tested in this study is the combination of ixazomib, daratumumab, and
      dexamethasone. This study will look at the efficacy and safety of IDd in people who have
      RRMM.

      The study will enroll approximately 60 Participants. Participants will be assigned to the
      treatment group:

      â€¢ Ixazomib 4.0 mg + Daratumumab 16.0 mg/kg + Dexamethasone 20 mg

      All participants will be asked to take Ixazomib on Days 1, 8 and 15 of each 28-day cycle plus
      Daratumumab on Days 1, 8, 15 and 22 of each 28-day cycle for Cycles 1 and 2, on Days 1 and 15
      of each 28-day cycle for Cycles 3 through 6 and on Day 1 of each 28-day cycle for Cycle 7 and
      beyond plus Dexamethasone orally on Days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, 16, 22 and 23 of each 28-day cycle.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in the United States, Czech Republic, France,
      Poland, Greece and the Netherlands. The overall time to participate in this study is 5 years.
      Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic, and every 12 weeks after PD until death
      or termination of the study by the sponsor.

             expertise in managing HBV for guidance regarding stopping daratumumab, starting HBV

    <ipd_description>Takeda makes patient-level, de-identified data sets and associated documents available after applicable marketing approvals and commercial availability have been received, an opportunity for the primary publication of the research has been allowed, and other criteria have been met as set forth in Takeda's Data Sharing Policy (see www.TakedaClinicalTrials.com/Approach for details). To obtain access, researchers must submit a legitimate academic research proposal for adjudication by an independent review panel, who will review the scientific merit of the research and the requestor's qualifications and conflict of interest that can result in potential bias. Once approved, qualified researchers who sign a data sharing agreement are provided access to these data in a secure research environment.</ipd_description>
