  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical study is designed to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, safety and efficacy of
      ligelizumab in children from 12 to &lt;18 years of age, with chronic spontaneous urticaria.

      The study will generate data to be analyzed in a separate modelling and simulation study with
      the objective of i) estimating the relative potency of ligelizumab in adolescent patients
      compared with adults and ii) proposing a posology for the future treatment of adolescent
      patients.

      The patient population will be treated with ligelizumab as an add-on therapy to approved
      doses of H1- antihistamines following the guideline on treatment of CSU .

      The study consists of 3 distinct study periods: Screening period (up to 4 weeks) Treat
      period: Day 1 patients are randomized into one of the three treatment arms in 1:2:1 fashion
      to ligelizumab high dose q4w vs. ligelizumab low dose q4w vs. placebo. During the 24 weeks of
      treatment, doses are administered on Day 1 then 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20 weeks after
      randomization. Subjects randomized to placebo will receive placebo on Day 1, Weeks 4 and 8;
      thereafter they will receive ligelizumab (high dose) at Weeks 12, 16 and 20 such that the
      same number of patients will, by the end of the study, receive the high dose as the low dose.
      Safety is assessed every 4 weeks; efficacy is primarily assessed using daily itch and hives
      scores summed into the weekly UAS7. The treatment period (24 weeks) is followed by a
      follow-up period of 16 weeks to a maximum of Week 40.

    <measure>Change in the Urticaria Activity Score (UAS7) between baseline and Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The primary endpoint will be change in Urticaria Activity Score over seven days (UAS7) from baseline to Week 24.
The UAS7 is the sum of urticaria activity scores over a seven day period. The possible range of the weekly UAS7 score is 0-42. Complete UAS7 response is defined as UAS7=0. The UAS7 is the sum of the Hive Severity Score over seven days (HSS7) and the Itch Severity Score over seven days (ISS7) . The Hive Severity Score has a scale of 0 (none) to 3 (intense/severe). Complete hives response is defined as HSS7=0. The Itch Severity Score has a scale of 0 (None) to 3 (Severe (difficult to tolerate)). Complete itch response is defined as ISS7=0.</description>
