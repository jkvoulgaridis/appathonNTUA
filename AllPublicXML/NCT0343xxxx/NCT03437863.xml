  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Self-management of chronic illness can be highly demanding and people need to mobilize their
      personal strengths in order to live well with their condition. A mobile application was
      designed in collaboration with people with chronic illness and health care providers with the
      aims to support awareness of patients' strengths and patient-provider dialogues that include
      strengths. The aim of the present study is to evaluate with mixed methods the perceived
      usefulness and usability of the application and potential effects of the application on
      patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this pre-post design pilot study participants will be recruited from self-management
      courses for people with rheumatic diseases. Before using the application participants will be
      asked to report their strengths in a written format. After using the mobile application to
      reflect on their strengths the participants will be interviewed about their experience of
      using the application and on the task of reflecting on their strengths. They will also be
      asked to fill out a questionnaire on perceived usefulness and user-friendliness. Before and
      after using the application the participants fill out questionnaires on emotions (Positive
      and Negative Affective Scale) and self-efficacy (The Arthritis Self-efficacy Scale). All
      interviews will be audio-taped and analyzed with a qualitative approach. Descriptive analysis
      will be applied for quantitative data.

    <measure>The Positive and Negative Affect Schedule.</measure>
    <time_frame>Within a week after using the application</time_frame>
    <description>This scale measures positive and negative affect with two subscales (positive affect and negative affect). Positive affect subscale scores can range from 10-50, with higher scores representing higher levels of positive affect. Negative affect subscale scores can range from 10-50, with lower scores representing lower levels of negative affect.</description>

    <measure>The Arthritis Self-efficacy Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Within a week after using the application</time_frame>
    <description>This scale measures self-efficacy with two subscales with 5 response options. The &quot;pain&quot; subscale has 5 items and a score range from 0 to 20. The &quot;other symptoms&quot; subscale has 6 items and a score range from 0 to 24. Higher scores equal higher levels of self-efficacy.</description>

    <description>Participants recruited from a self-management course are asked to use (single time) a mobile application to support reflection of personal strengths. The participant borrows an Ipad and uses the application to 1) reflect and identify their strengths by reviewing a list of examples, 2) define personal goals, and 3) link strengths to goals.</description>
