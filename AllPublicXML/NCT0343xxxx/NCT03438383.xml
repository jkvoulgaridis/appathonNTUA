      The effect of biphasic positive airway pressure (Bi-PAP) at individualized pressures on the
      postoperative pulmonary recovery of morbidly obese patients (MOP) undergoing open bariatric
      surgery (OBS) and possible placebo device-related effects (sham-Bi-PAP) were investigated.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the present study the effect of Bi-PAP on the postoperative respiratory function and
      related complications of MOP undergoing OBS through a randomized sham-controlled design was
      investigated. Bi-PAP was applied at individualized pressures in order to optimize respiratory
      support and sham Bi-PAP was also used in order to neutralize possible placebo device related
      effect and researcher related bias.

      The investigators hypothesized that the use of Bi-PAP at individualized pressures in MOP
      undergoing OBS, ameliorates postoperative respiratory function as well as diminishes related
      pulmonary complications, postoperative pain and duration of hospitalization. Primary
      endpoints were the difference in pre- and postoperative measurements of certain pulmonary
      function parameters (forced expiratory volume at one second (FEV1), forced vital capacity
      (FVC), peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) and oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry (SpO2) and
      the incidence of certain pulmonary complications postoperatively (hypoxemia, atelectasis,
      lower respiratory tract infections). Secondary endpoints were postoperative pain and days of
      hospitalization.

    <description>Sham Bi-PAP was applied through nasal mask for 3 days postoperatively. Sham Bi-PAP was created by introducing a &quot;hole&quot; at the connection of the mask with the spiral tube of Bi-PAP. With this modality, also used on previous studies, the applied pressure by sham Bi-PAP was constant and equal to 2 centimeter of water (cm H2O).</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Τhis prospective randomized single-blinded study with a control group was conducted in a tertiary urban Greek hospital. Subjects recruitment was performed at the respective departments of obesity surgery where subjects underwent surgery, also belonging to tertiary hospitals.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Exclusion criteria included cardiovascular and pulmonary disease not related to obesity status, and chronic renal disease. From the 48 patients initially enrolled in the study, 1 was excluded from the participant flow because of recent onset of cardiovascular disease. 47 patients were assigned to the study groups.</pre_assignment_details>

          <title>Sham Bi-PAP</title>
          <description>Sham Bi-PAP was applied through nasal mask for 3 days postoperatively. Sham Bi-PAP was created by introducing a “hole” at the connection of the mask with the spiral tube of Bi-PAP. With this modality, also used on previous studies, the applied pressure by sham Bi-PAP was constant and equal to 2 centimeters of water (cm H2O).
Sham Bi-PAP: Sham Bi-PAP was created by introducing a “hole” at the connection of the mask with the spiral tube of the conventional Bi-PAP system. By doing so, the applied pressure by sham Bi-PAP was constant and equal to 2 cm H2O.</description>

          <title>Bi-PAP</title>
          <description>Bi-PAP through nasal mask, at individualized IPAP/EPAP pressures, was applied for 3 days postoperatively. IPAP and EPAP in the Bi-PAP system were individualized for each patient in accordance with accepted values of oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry (SpO2), PaCO2, and patient synchronization and tolerability with the device.Individualized setting of pressures in patient group was applied gradually starting with 12/4 cm H2O (IPAP/EPAP) and up to 18/10 (IPAP/EPAP) with consecutive increases of 2 cm H2O.
Bi-PAP: The Bi-PAP system combines inspiratory support-IPAP (inspiratory positive airway pressure) with expiratory support-EPAP (expiratory positive airway pressure) and has been used, with good results, in a number of different clinical conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), respiratory failure due to neuromuscular disease, cardiogenic pulmonary edema and immediately post-operatively with pro-phylactic purpose.</description>

Sham Bi-PAP was created by introducing a “hole” at the connection of the mask with the spiral tube of Bi-PAP. With this modality, also used on previous studies, the applied pressure by sham Bi-PAP was constant and equal to 2 cm H2O.

            <description>Bi-PAP through nasal mask, at individualized IPAP/EPAP pressures, was applied for 3 days postoperatively. IPAP and EPAP in the Bi-PAP system were individualized for each patient in accordance with accepted values of SpO2, PaCO2, and patient synchronization and tolerability with the device.Individualized setting of pressures in patient group was applied gradually starting with 12/4 cm H2O (IPAP/EPAP) and up to 18/10 (IPAP/EPAP) with consecutive increases of 2 cm H2O.
Bi-PAP: The Bi-PAP system combines inspiratory support-IPAP (inspiratory positive airway pressure) with expiratory support-EPAP (expiratory positive airway pressure) and has been used, with good results, in a number of different clinical conditions such as COPD, respiratory failure due to neuromuscular disease, cardiogenic pulmonary edema and immediately post-operatively with pro-phylactic purpose.</description>

            <description>Sham Bi-PAP was applied through nasal mask for 3 days postoperatively. Sham Bi-PAP was created by introducing a “hole” at the connection of the mask with the spiral tube of Bi-PAP. With this modality, also used on previous studies, the applied pressure by sham Bi-PAP was constant and equal to 2 cm H2O.

            <description>Bi-PAP through nasal mask, at individualized IPAP/EPAP pressures, was applied for 3 days postoperatively. IPAP and EPAP in the Bi-PAP system were individualized for each patient in accordance with accepted values of SpO2, PaCO2, and patient synchronization and tolerability with the device.Individualized setting of pressures in patient group was applied gradually starting with 12/4 cm H2O (IPAP/EPAP) and up to 18/10 (IPAP/EPAP) with consecutive increases of 2 cm H2O.
Bi-PAP: The Bi-PAP system combines inspiratory support-IPAP (inspiratory positive airway pressure) with expiratory support-EPAP (expiratory positive airway pressure) and has been used, with good results, in a number of different clinical conditions such as COPD, respiratory failure due to neuromuscular disease, cardiogenic pulmonary edema and immediately post-operatively with pro-phylactic purpose.</description>

IPAP and EPAP in the Bi-PAP system were individualized for each patient in accordance with accepted values of SpO2, PaCO2, and patient synchronization and tolerability with the device.Individualized setting of pressures in patient group was applied gradually starting with 12/4 cm H2O (IPAP/EPAP) and up to 18/10 (IPAP/EPAP) with consecutive increases of 2 cm H2O.
Bi-PAP: The Bi-PAP system combines inspiratory support-IPAP (inspiratory positive airway pressure) with expiratory support-EPAP (expiratory positive airway pressure) and has been used, with good results, in a number of different clinical conditions such as COPD, respiratory failure due to neuromuscular disease, cardiogenic pulmonary edema and immediately post-operatively with pro-phylactic purpose.</description>

          <description>Bi-PAP through nasal mask, at individualized IPAP/EPAP pressures, was applied for 3 days postoperatively. IPAP and EPAP in the Bi-PAP system were individualized for each patient in accordance with accepted values of SpO2, PaCO2, and patient synchronization and tolerability with the device.Individualized setting of pressures in patient group was applied gradually starting with 12/4 cm H2O (IPAP/EPAP) and up to 18/10 (IPAP/EPAP) with consecutive increases of 2 cm H2O.
Bi-PAP: The Bi-PAP system combines inspiratory support-IPAP (inspiratory positive airway pressure) with expiratory support-EPAP (expiratory positive airway pressure) and has been used, with good results, in a number of different clinical conditions such as COPD, respiratory failure due to neuromuscular disease, cardiogenic pulmonary edema and immediately post-operatively with pro-phylactic purpose.</description>
