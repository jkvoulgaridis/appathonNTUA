  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm, multi-site, single-dose, Phase 1/2 study to assess ST-400 in 6 subjects
      with transfusion-dependent β-thalassemia (TDT) who are ≥18 and ≤40 years of age. ST-400 is a
      type of investigational therapy that consists of gene edited cells. ST-400 is composed of the
      patient's own blood stem cells which are genetically modified in the laboratory using
      Sangamo's zinc finger nuclease (ZFN) technology to disrupt a precise and specific sequence of
      the enhancer of the BCL11A gene (which normally suppresses fetal hemoglobin production in
      erythrocytes). This process is intended to boost fetal hemoglobin (HbF), which can substitute
      for reduced or absent adult (defective) hemoglobin. ST-400 is then infused back into the
      patient after receiving conditioning chemotherapy to make room for the new cells in the bone
      marrow, with the aim of producing new erythrocytes with increased amounts of HbF. The primary
      objective is to understand safety and tolerability of ST-400, and secondary objectives are to
      assess the effects on HbF levels and transfusion requirements.

      Once consented, study participants will progress through the following stages:

        -  Screening: in-person visit at the study site to confirm eligibility for proceeding

        -  Collection: autologous (self) blood stem cells are harvested at the study site, also
           known as apheresis

        -  Manufacturing of ST-400: no study participant activities expected

        -  Infusion: conditioning chemotherapy, followed by infusion of ST-400, occurs at the study
           site

        -  Follow-up: follow up at the study site to monitor for safety and effectiveness of the
           study
