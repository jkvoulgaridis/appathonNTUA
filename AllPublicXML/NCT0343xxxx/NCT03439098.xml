  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to demonstrate the cognitive enhancement effect and safety of
      Fermented Codonopsis lanceolata, using the cognitive and clinical indicators (e.g. memory,
      attention, and psychomotor speed) and the latest brain imaging methods for healthy adults
      suffering subjective cognitive impairment.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in standardized scores on a neuropsychological test battery</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 4th week, 8th week</time_frame>
    <description>A composite z-scores were calculated from the scores of the neuropsychological test battery on attention and working memory. The test battery included Letter-number sequencing, Digit span (forward), and tasks from the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) including the Match-to-Sample Visual Search, Reaction Rime, Rapid Visual Information Processing, and Stop Signal tasks.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in scores of the Subjective Memory Complaints Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 4th week, 8th week</time_frame>
    <description>The Subjective Memory Complaints Questionnaire (SMCQ) contains 14 items and consists of two domains: global memory function and everyday memory function. The response to each item is rated as &quot;yes&quot; (1 point) or &quot;no&quot; (0 point). The total score ranges from 0 to 14 points, and higher points indicate larger degrees of subjective memory complaints.</description>
