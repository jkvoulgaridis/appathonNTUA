  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Value-based healthcare is heavily dependent on the accurate measurement of patient outcomes,
      both immediately after treatment and at long-term intervals. Patient reported outcomes (PROs)
      are often the central component of any quality improvement process as they are patient
      centered, reflect the ultimate objective of the intervention and are endorsed by many
      professional societies as the preferred physician performance metric. Although high response
      rates are critical to producing reliable data to support value-based payment models, quality
      improvement, and stakeholder transparency - especially in arthroscopy in which patients often
      fare well over time and may be less likely to continue with follow-up - response rates to
      outcome surveys after initial recovery from treatment are consistently below 50%. Monetary
      incentives offer only minor improvements in response rates against large increases in already
      rising costs. Individually tailored social incentives - as grounded in current behavioral
      economic practice - offer a potential cost-effective solution to this problem in Sports
      Medicine and arthroscopy.

      The investigators predict that well-constructed, personal social incentives will increase
      response rates for long-term follow-up of episodic care compared to control. The
      investigators predict these rates will vary depending on the patient demographics and other
      characteristics.
