  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multicenter, Phase 1/2 study to determine the safety and efficacy of
      JCARH125, a CAR T-cell product that targets B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA), in adult
      subjects with relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma. The study will include a Phase 1
      part to determine the recommended dose of JCARH125 in subjects with relapsed and/or
      refractory multiple myeloma, followed by a Phase 2 part to further evaluate the safety and
      efficacy of JCARH125 at the recommended dose. The safety and tolerability of JCARH125 in
      subjects who receive prophylactic treatment with anakinra will be evaluated in a separate
      Phase 1 cohort. The antitumor activity of JCARH125 in subjects who have been previously
      treated with BCMA-directed therapy will be evaluated in separate Phase 2a cohorts.
