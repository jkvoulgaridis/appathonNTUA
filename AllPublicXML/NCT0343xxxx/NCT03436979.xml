        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient with POP-Q C point greater than (-) 1 cm.

          2. Patients who have previously had a partial hysterectomy in which the cervix is intact
             may be included in this study.

          3. Non-pregnant female (female of child bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy
             test).

          4. Patient understands the nature and potential hazards of the procedure and provides
             written informed consent prior to any study specific assessments.

          5. Patient is able to complete written questionnaires.

          6. Patient is willing and able to comply with the specified study requirements and
             follow-up assessments, and can be contacted by telephone.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Known diagnosis of reproductive tract abnormalities.

          2. Prior pelvic radiation therapy, any malignancy or active pelvic inflammatory disease.

          3. Known history of severe Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID).

          4. Prior total hysterectomy.

          5. Prior pelvic prolapse surgery using synthetic mesh.

          6. Pathological PAP in the past year.

          7. Moderate or severe bacterial cervicitis.

          8. Moderate or severe pelvic pain (&gt; 3 on VAS).

          9. Severe morbid obesity (BMI &gt;45).

         10. Temperature &gt; 38°C (oral or equivalent), sepsis, or active infection requiring IV
             anti-microbial treatment.

         11. Significant cognitive impairment.

         12. Active malignancy other than non-melanoma skin cancer.

         13. Planned surgery (more than a minor one) in the next 30 days.

         14. Patient has a known hypersensitivity to device materials (Nickel, suture material).

         15. Moribund patient or patient with severe or deteriorating damage in critical body
             systems.

         16. Any condition that in the judgment of the investigators would interfere with the
             subject's ability to provide informed consent, comply with study instructions, place
             the subject at increased risk, or which might confound interpretation of study
             results.

         17. Concurrent enrollment in another device or drug trial that has not completed the
             primary endpoint or clinically interferes with the current study endpoints.
