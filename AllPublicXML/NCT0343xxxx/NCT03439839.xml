    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of LNP023 in patients with PNH,
      showing signs of active hemolysis despite treatment with SoC (defined as an antibody with
      anti C5 activity).

    <textblock>
      LNP023 is a novel oral small molecular weight compound, that inhibits alternative complement
      pathway (AP). Blockade of the AP with oral LNP023 has the potential to prevent both intra -
      and extravascular hemolysis.

      This study includes a screening period of up to 68 days, a baseline visit, up to
      approximately 3 years of treatment with LNP023 administered in addition to SoC, and an End of
      Study (EoS) visit 2 weeks after last LNP023 administration.

      The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of LNP023 in patients with PNH,
      showing signs of active hemolysis despite treatment with SoC (defined as an antibody with
      anti C5 activity).

             acceptable).

             All other screening pre-SoC LDH values have to be &gt; 1x upper limit of normal range
             (for pre-SoC samples collected at the same day as SoC administration).

             advanced cardiac disease (NYHA class IV), severe pulmonary arterial hypertension (WHO
             class IV), unstable thrombotic event not amenable to active treatment as judged by the
             investigator both at screening and at baseline (unless baseline was skipped)

         11. Any medical condition deemed likely to interfere with the patient's participation in
             the study, or likely to cause serious adverse events during the study

         12. Female patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding, or intending to conceive during the
             course of the study

         13. Women of child-bearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of
             becoming pregnant, unless they are using highly effective methods of contraception
             from first dosing with LNP023 until EOS.
