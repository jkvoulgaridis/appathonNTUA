  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II, randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled study to examine whether
      cariprazine (1.5 or 3 mg/d) 1) alters brain and/or behavioral responses to probes of reward
      and inhibition and 2) decreases cocaine use in individuals with cocaine use disorder.
      Subjects will be tested as inpatients during fMRI sessions. After the 2-week
      inpatient/medication induction phase, study medication will continue for 8 outpatient weeks,
      during which time cocaine use will be tracked. Subjects will be monitored during a 4-wk
      followup phase thereafter.

    <description>Cariprazine Groups (1.5 or 3mg/d): Cariprazine (VRAYLAR) capsules will be administered orally, once per day. Subjects in the 1.5mg group will receive 1 VRAYLAR capsule containing 1.5 mg cariprazine each day that study drug is administered. Subjects in the 3 mg group will be gradually titrated up to full dose: they will receive 1 VRAYLAR capsule containing 1.5mg cariprazine on the first and second days that study drug is administered and will receive 1 VRAYLAR capsule containing 3mg cariprazine each day for the rest of the medication period. The study medication period begins during the inpatient/induction phase and ends on the last day of outpatient treatment week 8 (approx. 10 weeks total). All VRAYLAR capsules will be over-encapsulated by the University of Pennsylvania Investigational Drug Services (IDS).</description>
