  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In France The prevalence of Pregnancy Loss after 12 weeks of gestation is around 3%. This
      situation is probably associated to a risk of post-traumatic stress disorder.

      As a part of the medical staff midwives are often confronted with this situation, however
      they can have difficulties to identify short and long term effects of a post-traumatic stress
      disorders.

      The purpose of the present study is to estimate and analyze the prevalence of short-term (1
      month) post-traumatic stress disorder in women with pregnancy loss after 12 weeks of
      gestation.The symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder will be tracked using the Impact of
      Event Scale-revisited and the Peritraumatic Dissociative Experiences Questionnaires.The
      diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder will also be clinically confirmed by a
      psychiatrist during a specific consultation.

    <measure>Assessment of short-term post-traumatic stress disorder in women with fetal loss after 12 weeks of gestation with IES-R scale recorded at 30 days after fetal loss.</measure>
    <time_frame>Telephone interviews are planned 30 days after fetal loss</time_frame>
    <description>Assessment of the Impact of Events Scale-Revised (IES-R) score wil be performed by telephone interview by the principal investigator of the present study.
IES-R scale has been validated in 1997 (Weiss and Mar) and then validated in French in 2003 (Brunet and St Hilaire). This scale assesses the semi-retarded and retarded consequences of traumatic events. It consists in a 22 items questionnaire measuring symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), just after traumatic event and after a while. It is based on three main PTSD's elements: avoidance symptoms (items 8, 11, 12, 13, 17, 22), intrusion symptoms (items 1, 3, 5, 6, 9, 16) and hyperarousal (items 2, 4, 10, 14, 15, 18, 21).The patient has to respond using Likert's scale.
score interpretations: 24-32: those with scores this high who do not have full PTSD will have partial PTSD. &gt;33 this represents the best cutoff for a probable diagnosis of PTSD</description>
