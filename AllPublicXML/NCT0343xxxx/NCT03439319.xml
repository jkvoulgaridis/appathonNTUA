      A two-arm, parallel group, multicentre, single-blind, randomized controlled trial comparing
      electrical neuromodulation delivered by MyndMove® therapy to intensive upper-limb
      conventional therapy in the treatment of patients with moderate to severe motor impairment to
      their arms and hands from an incomplete, traumatic spinal cord injury.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          5. From an inpatient or outpatient care setting

          6. Able to understand and follow instructions

          7. Able to tolerate being in a seated position for a least one hour required to deliver
             upper limb therapy

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Previous history of any other neuromuscular disorder or conditions that may affect
             motor response

          2. Upper extremity injury or condition prior to SCI that limits the function of the hand

             injections in the upper extremity during the study treatment and follow up period

         17. Females who are pregnant or planning to become pregnant in the duration of the trial

         18. Regional disorder of the upper extremities such as fracture, dislocation, or joint
