  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical trial is to study of the molecular features of postmenopausal
      women with hormone receptor-positive (HR+) HER2-negative advanced breast cancer on first-line
      treatment with ribociclib and letrozole and, in patients with a PIK3CA mutation, on
      second-line treatment with alpelisib plus fulvestrant

      The main purpose of this local, multicenter study is to investigate genetic and gene
      expression alterations in tumor prior to and following progression on ribociclib, during core
      phase and then prior to and following progression on alpelisib and thus identify patterns of
      mutations, how they evolve, and their association with CDK4/6 inhibition and outcomes such as
      sustained response or early progression. The study also aims to evaluate pharmacogenomics and
      its association with adverse events (frequency and severity), drug-drug interactions and
      clinical outcomes.

      Finally, the study will also generate additional long-term safety and efficacy data in this
      specific Italian population.

             before alpelisib + fulvestrant.

          -  Patient has PIK3CA mutation as determined in tumor tissue and/or plasma by a Novartis
             designated laboratory. Results of tissue samples obtained during the core phase

        EXTENSION PHASE Exclusion criteria:

          -  Patient has received prior treatment with any PI3K inhibitors.

          -  Patient is concurrently using other anti-cancer therapy. Ribociclib and letrozole used
             in the core phase must be discontinued at least 7 days prior to day one of the
             extension study treatment.

        All drugs with overlapping toxicities must be discontinued within 7 days and AE resolved to
        NCI CTCAE v4.03 Grade ≤1 prior to study treatment. Exception to this criterion: patients
        with any grade of alopecia are allowed to enter the study.
