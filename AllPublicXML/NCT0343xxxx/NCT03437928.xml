  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the study is to address the unmet need of TRD patients by identifying brain
      networks critical for treating depression and to use next generation precision DBS with
      steering capability to engage these targeted networks. The study's goal will be achieved
      through 3 specific aims:

        1. Demonstrate device capability to selectively and predictably engage distinct brain
           networks

        2. Delineate depression-relevant networks and demonstrate behavioral changes with
           network-targeted stimulation

        3. Demonstrate that chronic DBS using steered, individualized targeting is feasible and
           safe for reducing depressive symptoms

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Treatment-resistant depression (TRD) is a major worldwide burden. Major depression has a
      lifetime prevalence of ~15% across developed countries. Up to a third of patients fail to
      respond adequately to evidence-based treatments, including pharmacological, behavioral, and
      electroconvulsive therapy. The investigators employ an innovative approach, including
      subacute invasive neurophysiological monitoring with which they aim to gain insight into the
      networks underlying depression symptomatology, confirm the ability to predict the effects of
      precision DBS on network activity, and harmonize these insights to implement network-guided
      DBS for TRD.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Men and women (non-pregnant) between ages 22 and 70;

          2. DSM-5 diagnosis (assessed by Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5 Axis I disorders
             SCID-5) of major depression disorder (MDD) as the primary diagnosis. A current major
             depressive episode (MDE), recurrent or single episode with first episode before age
             60, secondary to nonpsychotic unipolar major depressive disorder;

          3. Chronic illness with current MDE ≥24 months duration and/or recurrent illness with at
             least a total of 2 lifetime episodes (including current episode &gt;12 months);

          4. Treatment resistance (defined by criteria on the Antidepressant Treatment History Form
             ATHF): Failure (i.e. persistence of the major depressive episode) to respond to a
             minimum of four adequate depression treatments from at least two different treatment
             categories (e.g. SSRIs, SNRIs, TCAs, other antidepressants, lithium-addition,
             irreversible MAOIs, antidepressant augmentation with an atypical antipsychotic
             medication);

          5. Previous trial of Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT) (lifetime): either did not respond,
             relapsed, poorly tolerated or refused. If refused, will discuss reasons and ensure
             subject understands relative risks of ECT versus DBS. We will try to enrich sample
             with patients who had previously shown response to ECT (or another intervention) that
             was partial or un-sustained;

          6. A prior trial of ketamine will not be required because it is not FDA approved and
             durable responses have not been demonstrated, nevertheless, subjects will be informed
             about this possible off-label option;

          7. Symptom severity for Screening: Hamilton Depression Rating Scale-17 item (HDRS17) ≥20;

          8. The HDRS17 must remain greater than or equal to 20 on two separate assessments (at
             initial screening and 1 week before surgery), over a 1-month period;

          9. Symptom severity for Outcome: Montgomery Asberg Rating Scale (MADRS) ≥27 to be met at
             assessment one-week pre-op;

         10. Lifetime exposure to minimal 6 weeks of psychotherapy without sustained response;

         11. Normal brain MRI within 3 months of surgery;

         12. Stable antidepressant medication regimen for the month preceding surgery;

         13. Modified mini-mental state examination (MMSE) score ≥ 24;

         14. Normal thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) level within 12 months of study entry;

         15. Other medical conditions must be stable for at least 6 months;

         16. Able and willing to give informed consent and agree to attend regular clinic visits
             for at least 12 months following surgery;

         17. Able to have a treating psychiatrist or close relative present for discussions about
             the study and co-sign informed consent;

         18. Willingness to sign Treatment Contract

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. DSM-5 Axis I Disorders: any lifetime history of psychotic disorder (e.g.,
             schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder);

          5. Urine drug test positive for illicit drugs;

          6. Current substantial suicidal risk as defined by a plan or clear immediate intent for
             self-harm, or made a suicide attempt within the last year; or as identified as C-SSRS;

          7. Neurological/Medical condition that makes the patient, in the opinion of the surgeon,
             a poor surgical candidate (e.g., progressive neurodegenerative disorder, significant
             cardiopulmonary disorder, need for chronic anticoagulation);

          8. Any history of seizure disorder or hemorrhagic stroke;

          9. Any medical contraindication to surgery such as infection;
