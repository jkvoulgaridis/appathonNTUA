    <textblock>
      Phase II trial in which participants with recurrent glioblastoma will receive a combination
      of tumor treating fields(portable device), nivolumab with or without ipilimumab.

      The NovoTTF200A (OptuneTM) device is worn continuously for a goal of 75% or more of the time,
      ranging from at least 18 hours daily uninterrupted or 22 hours daily with 2-3 days off
      monthly. Therapy is planned for approximately 24 months.

      Infusions with nivolumab will start within 1 week of study start. Ipilimumab will either
      start with the second nivolumab infusion or at after tumor progression. Nivolumab is infused
      intravenously at 240 mg once every 2 weeks with or without ipilimumab for a maximum of 24
      months. Ipilimumab is dosed at 1 mg/kg once every 6 weeks for a maximum of 4 doses (24
      weeks). Infusions will continue until maximum doses are completed or there is confirmed tumor
      progression, intolerable adverse effects or withdrawal of consent.

    <intervention_model_description>This is an open-label, phase II trial with two parallel arms, two-stage design and appropriate stopping rules for poor efficacy. Arm A will enroll participants without prior PD1/PDL1 checkpoint inhibitor, while Arm B will enroll participants with prior PD1/PDL1 checkpoint inhibitor. The investigator expect to enroll at least 30 (15 in each Arm) and a maximum of 60 (30 in each Arm) evaluable subjects. All subjects will receive TTFields therapy plus nivolumab infusions for a maximum of 24 months, plus/minus concurrent ipilimumab for a maximum of 4 doses.</intervention_model_description>
