      This phase II trial studies how well deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) plasmid-encoding
      interleukin-12/human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA plasmids therapeutic vaccine INO-3112 and
      durvalumab work in treating patients with human papillomavirus associated cancers that have
      come back or spread to other places in the body. Vaccines made from a gene-modified virus may
      help the body build an effective immune response to kill tumor cells. Immunotherapy with
      monoclonal antibodies, such as durvalumab, may help the body's immune system attack the
      cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving DNA
      plasmid-encoding interleukin-12/HPV DNA plasmids therapeutic vaccine INO-3112 and durvalumab
      may work better in treating patients with human papillomavirus associated cancers.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the anti-tumor activity of DNA plasmid-encoding interleukin-12/HPV DNA
      plasmids therapeutic vaccine INO-3112 (MEDI0457) in combination with durvalumab.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety profile of MEDI0457 in combination with durvalumab in patients
      with recurrent/metastatic human papilloma virus (HPV) 16- or 18- associated cancer.

      II. To evaluate the progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of patients
      with recurrent/metastatic incurable HPV-16/18 positive solid malignancies receiving the
      combination of MEDI0457and durvalumab.

      III. To evaluate objective response rate (ORR) by immune-related criteria of the combination
      of MEDI0457 and durvalumab in patients with recurrent/metastatic incurable HPV-16/18 positive
      solid malignancies.

      IV. To evaluate the disease control rate at 24 weeks.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the cellular and humoral immune response to immunotherapy with MEDI0457 in
      combination with durvalumab,

      II. To examine the correlation between anti tumor activity and biomarkers including:

      IIa. HPV-specific cellular and humoral responses. IIb. Programmed death ligand 1 status. IIc.
      The number of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, HPV 16/18 E6/E7 deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)
      levels and HPV 16/18 E6/E7 DNA sequence in biopsy tissue and plasma.

      III. To evaluate the pharmacokinetics and anti-drug antibodies (ADA) for durvalumab.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive DNA plasmid-encoding interleukin-12/HPV DNA plasmids therapeutic vaccine
      INO-3112 intramuscularly (IM) and via electroporation at 1, 3, 7, and 12 weeks and durvalumab
      intravenously (IV) at 4, 8, and 12 weeks. Starting week 12, cycles repeat every 8 weeks for
      DNA plasmid-encoding interleukin-12/HPV DNA plasmids therapeutic vaccine INO-3112 and every 4
      weeks for up to 13 doses of durvalumab in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 90 days, every 3 months for
      12 months, and then every 6 months thereafter.
