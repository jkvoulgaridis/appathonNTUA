      The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-536. TAK-536 is being tested in Japanese
      healthy adult male participants. This study will look at the PK and effect of food on the PK
      following single oral administration of TAK-536 pediatric formulation.

      The study will enroll 12 healthy participants. Participants will be randomly assigned (by
      chance, like flipping a coin) to one of the two treatment groups and will receive a single
      oral dose of 10 mg of TAK-536 pediatric formulation with 200 mL of water according to the
      following treatments in each period during the study.

        -  Treatment Group A: single oral administration in the morning under fasted condition
           (Period 1), followed by single oral administration after breakfast (Period 2)

        -  Treatment Group B: single oral administration after breakfast (Period 1), followed by in
           the morning under fasted condition (Period 2)

      This single-center trial will be conducted in Japan. The overall time to participate in this
      study is approximately one month. Participants will make five visits to the clinic and be
      hospitalized for eight days in total.

    <ipd_description>Takeda makes patient-level, de-identified data sets and associated documents available for all interventional studies after applicable marketing approvals and commercial availability have been received (or program is completely terminated), an opportunity for the primary publication of the research and final report development has been allowed, and other criteria have been met as set forth in Takeda's Data Sharing Policy (see www.TakedaClinicalTrials.com for details). To obtain access, researchers must submit a legitimate academic research proposal for adjudication by an independent review panel, who will review the scientific merit of the research and the requestor's qualifications and conflict of interest that can result in potential bias.
