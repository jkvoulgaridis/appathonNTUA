    <textblock>
      This is an open label Phase II/III study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of test drug,
      Insulin Tregopil (IN-105) compared with Insulin Aspart (IAsp) in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus
      patients. on stable dose of Metformin and insulin Glargine. The study will be conducted in 2
      parts, Part I and Part II. The study duration will be approximately 37 weeks for Part I and
      for Part II of the study respectively

  <detailed_description>

      Part I of the study is a Phase II multi-center, randomized, open label clinical study to
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of Insulin Tregopil (2 dose levels: 30 mg, 45 mg) compared
      with IAsp in the treatment of T2DM patients. Part II of the study is the Phase III,
      multi-center, randomized, open label clinical study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of
      Insulin Tregopil (30 mg or 45 mg based upon the outcome of Part I data) compared with IAsp in
      the treatment of T2DM patients. For Part I and Part II, the study duration will be
      approximately 37 weeks (3 weeks Screening, 8 weeks Run-in, 24 weeks Treatment, 2 weeks Safety
      follow-up). An Independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will evaluate the data
      from Part I of the study. Part II of the study will be initiated after approval from the
      office of Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) and Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB)
      recommendation based on review of data from Part I of the study. In both Part I and Part II
      of the study, T2DM patients with glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) 7.5 to 10% (both inclusive), on
      stable dose of metformin ± oral antidiabetic drugs (OADs) ± basal insulin who are eligible
      for insulin glargine administration as per investigator discretion and who satisfy the
      selection criteria will be enrolled. The eligible patients will go through a Run-in period of
      8 weeks. At the end of 8 weeks Run-in period, eligibility will be checked and patients will
      enter the treatment period of 24 weeks and will be allocated to 3 treatment arms (Part I) or
      randomized to 2 treatment arms (Part II); if found eligible for randomization. A total of 90
      patients in part 1 and 268 patients in part 2 will be randomised to the treatment arms from
      approximately 40 centers in India.

      <pre_assignment_details>The trial included an 8-week run-in period and a 24-week treatment period. During the run-in period, the subjects received insulin glargine along with metformin. In total, 143 subjects entered the run-in period, of these 52 subjects were run-in failures. Hence, 91 subjects were randomly assigned to each treatment arm.</pre_assignment_details>

          <description>At randomization, all subjects started on 45 mg mealtime insulin Tregopil (oral) in combination with insulin glargine (basal insulin, SC, once or twice daily) and metformin (oral) in a basal-bolus regimen. Insulin Tregopil was administered (oral) 10 minutes prior to each main meal, was titrated to the 2-hour PPG target of 141-179 mg/dL according to the titration algorithm. Dose adjustments were considered once/twice weekly in the initial 4 weeks, based on the 2-hour SMPG on the previous week. Basal insulin and metformin treatment continued without changing the frequency or dose.</description>

          <description>At randomization, all subjects started on 4 units of mealtime insulin aspart (bolus insulin) in combination with insulin glargine (basal insulin, once or twice daily) and metformin (oral) in a basal-bolus regimen. Insulin aspart was administered (sc) 0-5 minutes before each main meal, was titrated to the pre-prandial glycaemic target of 71-129 mg/dL and 2-hour PPG target of 141-179 mg/dL according to the titration algorithm. Dose adjustments were considered daily based on the pre-prandial and 2-hour SMPG on the previous week.

        <time_frame>Week 0, Week 12</time_frame>
        <population>This endpoint was summarized using ITT analysis set in Part I. ITT set included all randomized subjects. At Week 12, data from available participants are summarized.</population>

            <description>At randomization, all subjects started on 45 mg mealtime insulin Tregopil (oral) in combination with insulin glargine (basal insulin, SC, once or twice daily) and metformin (oral) in a basal-bolus regimen. Insulin Tregopil was administered (oral) 10 minutes prior to each main meal, was titrated to the 2-hour PPG target of 141-179 mg/dL according to the titration algorithm. Dose adjustments were considered once/twice weekly in the initial 4 weeks, based on the 2-hour SMPG on the previous week. Basal insulin and metformin treatment continued without changing the frequency or dose.</description>

          <title>Insulin Tregopil (IN-105) - 30mg</title>
          <description>SAt randomization, all subjects started on 30 mg mealtime insulin Tregopil in combination with insulin glargine (basal insulin, SC, once or twice daily) and metformin (oral) in a basal-bolus regimen. Insulin Tregopil was administered (oral) 10 minutes prior to each main meal, was titrated to the 2-hour PPG target of 141-179 mg/dL according to the titration algorithm. Dose adjustments were considered once/twice weekly in the initial 4 weeks, based on the 2-hour SMPG on the previous week. Basal insulin and metformin treatment continued without changing the frequency or dose.</description>

          <description>At randomization, all subjects started on 4 units of mealtime insulin aspart (bolus insulin) in combination with insulin glargine (basal insulin, once or twice daily) and metformin (oral) in a basal-bolus regimen. Insulin aspart was administered (sc) 0-5 minutes before each main meal, was titrated to the pre-prandial glycaemic target of 71-129 mg/dL and 2-hour PPG target of 141-179 mg/dL according to the titration algorithm. Dose adjustments were considered daily based on the pre-prandial and 2-hour SMPG on the previous week. Basal insulin and metformin treatment continued without changing the frequency or dose</description>
