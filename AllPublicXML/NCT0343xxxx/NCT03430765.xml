  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study will be a pilot randomized controlled trial comparing treatment as usual
      (TAU) to treatment as usual plus a brief Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) intervention
      (TAU + ACT) with mastectomy and lumpectomy patients identified as at-risk for developing
      persistent post-operative pain. The ACT intervention is a single individual therapy session
      scheduled two weeks following surgery. Potential participants will be recruited from the
      University of Iowa Breast Cancer Clinic. A sample size of n = 30 for each arm will be
      recruited. An attrition rate of 20% is anticipated so the total N to be recruited for the
      study is 72 participants. Study measures will consist of self-report questionnaires and
      medical record data. Data will be collected prior to surgery, one-week after surgery, and 3
      months after surgery.

      Psychological interventions addressing depression, anxiety, and psychological approaches to
      pain management in pre-surgical patients may serve to prevent the development of persistent
      post-surgical pain, depression, and anxiety in at-risk individuals. Acceptance and Commitment
      Therapy (ACT) is a psychological therapy that has been shown to be effective in minimizing
      the impairing impact of chronic pain and in treating depression and anxiety. ACT is a
      behavior therapy incorporating mindfulness, which aims to increase psychological flexibility
      via facilitating psychological acceptance and committed action in the direction of one's
      personally identified values. ACT has also shown promise in brief interventions, including a
      one day ACT workshop with patients with comorbid migraine and depression. The current study
      proposes to identify pre-operative breast cancer patients who are at increased risk for
      developing persistent post-surgical pain and to offer a brief ACT intervention with the aim
      of reducing the incidence of persistence post-surgical pain and psychological sequela.
