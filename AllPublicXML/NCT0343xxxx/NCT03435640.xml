      Patients will receive intra-tumoral (IT) NKTR-262 in 3-week treatment cycles. During the
      Phase 1 dose escalation portion of the trial, NKTR-262 will be combined with systemic
      administration of bempegaldesleukin. After determination of the recommended Phase 2 dose
      (RP2D) of NKTR-262, between 6 and 18 patients may be enrolled at the RP2D to further
      characterize the safety and tolerability profile of the combination of NKTR 262 plus
      bempegaldesleukin (doublet) or NKTR 262 plus bempegaldesleukin in combination with nivolumab
      (triplet) in Cohorts A and B, respectively. In the Phase 2 dose expansion portion, patients
      will be treated with doublet or triplet in the relapsed/refractory setting and earlier lines
      of therapy.

      Cancer treatments that couple pharmacological activation of tumor antigen presentation with
      activation and expansion of CD8+ T and natural killer (NK) cells in the tumor environment
      have the potential to induce an effective anti-tumor immune response in patients. NKTR-262 is
      a small molecule agonist of toll-like receptors (TLRs) 7/8 designed to be retained in the
      tumor micro-environment in order to activate antigen-presenting cells (APC), such as
      dendritic cells, to create new antigen-specific cytotoxic T cells. As a CD122-biased agonist,
      bempegaldesleukin monotherapy increases newly proliferative CD8+ T cells in tumors. NKTR-262
      plus bempegaldesleukin is expected to increase expansion of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells. In
      preclinical studies, a single IT injection of NKTR-262 plus IV bempegaldesleukin resulted in
      complete abscopal effects in tumor models. Preliminary clinical data show bempegaldesleukin
      plus nivolumab enhances immune-stimulatory responses. The REVEAL trial will assess safety and
      anti-tumor activity of NKTR-262 with bempegaldesleukin +/- nivolumab for the treatment of
      selected cancers.
