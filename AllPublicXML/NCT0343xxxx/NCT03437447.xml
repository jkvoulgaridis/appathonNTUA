    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to assess the bioequivalence (BE) of new 600 milligram (mg)
      Cisticid tablet (Test) versus 600 mg Biltricide tablets (Reference) at a dose of 1200 mg in
      healthy male participants. Praziquantel (PZQ) is the active ingredient for Cisticid and
      Biltricide tablets.

        <title>Number of Participants With Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) and Serious TEAEs</title>
        <description>An adverse event (AE) was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment. An AE was any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. A serious adverse event (SAE) was an AE that resulted in any of the following outcomes: death; life threatening; persistent/significant disability/incapacity; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; congenital anomaly/birth defect or was otherwise considered medically important. The term TEAE is defined as AEs starting or worsening after the first intake of the study drug. TEAEs included both Serious TEAEs and non-serious TEAEs.</description>
