      The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of JUVÉDERM VOLUMA®
      XC injectable gel using cannula in participants seeking correction of age-related volume
      deficit in the mid-face.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Mid-Face Volume Deficit Scale (MFVDS) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Screening) to Month 1</time_frame>
    <description>The evaluating investigator (EI) assessed the participant's overall mid-face volume deficit for each cheek using a 6-point photonumeric scale, where: 0=None (moon face; fullness) [best] to 5=Severe (wasting) [worst]. A negative change from Baseline indicates improvement.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With at Least a 1-Point Improvement (Decrease From Baseline) in MFVDS Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Screening) to Month 1</time_frame>
    <description>The EI assessed the participant's overall mid-face volume deficit for each cheek using a 6-point photonumeric scale, where: 0=None (moon face; fullness) [best] to 5=Severe (wasting) [worst]. The percentage of participants who showed ≥1-point improvement (decrease in severity) from Baseline is reported.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in FACE-Q Satisfaction With Cheeks Questionnaire Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Screening) to Month 1</time_frame>
    <description>The participant completed the 5-item Satisfaction with Cheeks module of the FACE-Q questionnaire that evaluated various aspects of the cheeks including symmetry, smoothness, attractiveness, contour, and fullness using a 4-point scale where: 1=very dissatisfied to 4=very satisfied. The total score was transformed to a 0 to 100 point scale, with higher scores indicating greater satisfaction. A positive change from Baseline indicates improvement. The FACE-Q Satisfaction with Cheeks outcome was assessed by the participant overall and not by each cheek.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product. A TEAE is defined as an AE that initially occurred or increased in severity on or after the treatment start date.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs)</title>
        <description>An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product. A TEAE is defined as an AE that initially occurred or increased in severity on or after the treatment start date.</description>

        <population>Safety population included all randomized participants who received at least 1 study treatment.
