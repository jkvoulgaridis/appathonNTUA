    <textblock>
      With focus on atrial wall strain and strain-rate, In healthy volunteer adult subjects, heart
      ultrasound is recorded during resting, Valsalva manoeuver, Muller manoeuver, passive leg
      raising, and handgrip. Echocardiographic recordings are made before and during each
      intervention. Participants are otherwise resting in a reclined position.
