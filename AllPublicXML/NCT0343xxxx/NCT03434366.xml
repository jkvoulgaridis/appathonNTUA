  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a life-long neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by
      qualitative abnormalities in reciprocal social interactions and patterns of communication,
      and by a restricted, stereotyped, repetitive repertoire of interests and activities. The use
      of medications in adolescents and young adults with ASD is extremely common. However, few
      data address the effectiveness and harms of medications specifically in this population.

      The purpose of the study is to determine the efficacy and safety of intranasal ketamine with
      dexmedetomidine in children with ASD.

      address the effectiveness and harms of medications specifically in this population. A
      previous study reported the first case study demonstrating clinical improvement in mood and
      eye fixation scores from intranasal ketamine treatment in a &quot;complicated&quot; subject with autism
      spectrum disorderHowever,The purpose of the study is to determine the efficacy and safety of

    <measure>Autism Diagnostic Interview Revised (ADI-R)</measure>
    <time_frame>change from baseline at 2, 5 and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Autism Diagnostic Interview Revised is an investigator-based semi-structured diagnostic interview, The ADI-R provides empirically derived diagnostic algorithms for three subdomains of qualitative impairments. The social interaction domain includes questions about emotional sharing, offering and seeking comfort, social smiling, and social responding comprising four subscores. The second domain (communication) assesses stereotyped expressions, pronoun reversal, and the social usage of language (B1-B4). In the third domain repetitive and stereotyped behavior as hand- and finger mannerisms, unusual sensory interest or activities are investigated by four subscales. Most items are scored from zero to three, relying on the interviewer to make judgements on child's behaviour based on the recall of information from parents/carers. . A total score is then calculated for each of the three subdomains. The ADI-R has an algorithm for autism based on scores in these three areas and on onset.</description>

    <measure>Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS)</measure>
    <time_frame>change from baseline at 2, 5 and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) is a semi-structured assessment of communication, social interaction and play or imaginative use of materials for individuals suspected of having autism or other ASD. It consists of four modules, each of which is appropriate for children, adolescents and adults of differing developmental and language levels, ranging from no expressive or receptive language to verbally fluent adults. The examiner selects the module that is most appropriate for a particular child, adolescent on the basis of his/her expressive language level and chronological age. Selected algorithm items relating to social interaction and communication are then entered into an algorithm. The scores must meet the separate cut-offs for both the communication and social domains and the cut-off for the summation of the two. Repetitive behaviours are recorded and coded as part of the clinical observations but do not contribute to the ADOS summary algorithm.</description>

    <description>ABC is a scale used for nonadaptive behaviors created to screen and indicate the probability of a diagnosis of autism. The questionnaire approaches 57 atypical behaviors related to five areas: sensorial, relational, use of body and objects, and social skills.

    <measure>Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS)</measure>
    <time_frame>change from baseline at 2, 5 and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>CARS assesses the child on a scale from 1 to 4 in each of 15 dimensions or symptoms (including the ability to relate to people, emotional response, imitation, body use, object use, listening response, fear or nervousness, verbal communication, nonverbal communication, activity level, level and reliability of intellectual response, adaptation to changes, visual response, taste, smell and touch responses and general impressions). A total score of at least 30 strongly suggests the presence of autism. Children who score between 30 and 36 have mild-to-moderate autism while those with scores between 37 and 60 have severe autism.
