  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well epacadostat and pembrolizumab work in treating
      participants with pancreatic cancer that has spread to other places in the body. Epacadostat
      may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.
      Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may help the body's immune
      system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and
      spread. Giving epacadostat and pembrolizumab may work better in treating participants with
      pancreatic cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the efficacy of epacadostat in combination with pembrolizumab as determined
      by the best overall response rate in previously treated patients with advanced pancreatic
      adenocarcinoma with homologous recombination repair deficiency (HRD) aberrations.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To further determine the efficacy of epacadostat in combination with pembrolizumab in
      previously treated patients with advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma with HRD aberrations.

      II. To assess the safety and tolerability of epacadostat in combination with pembrolizumab in
      previously treated patients with advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma with HRD aberrations.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To identify predictive, mechanistic, and/or surrogate biomarkers of clinical efficacy of
      epacadostat in combination with pembrolizumab in previously treated patients with advanced
      pancreatic adenocarcinoma with HRD aberrations utilizing exploratory studies investigating
      the patients tumor and immune system response including: flow cytometry of fresh peripheral
      blood mononuclear cell (PBMC), PDL-1.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1 and
      epacadostat orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-21. Cycles repeat every 21 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unaccepted toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up at 30 days, every 8 weeks
      for 3 years, and then every 12 weeks thereafter.
