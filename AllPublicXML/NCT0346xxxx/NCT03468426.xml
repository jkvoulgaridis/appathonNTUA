      PART 1:

      Primary objective:

      - To determine the Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) of BI 836880 in combination with BI 754091
      in patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-squamous NSCLC who progressed during or
      after first line (in case of checkpoint inhibitor naïve patients) platinum-based therapy and
      patients who relapsed after completion of at least 2 cycles (in case of checkpoint inhibitor
      relapsing patients) of platinum-based chemotherapy and a checkpoint inhibitor treatment
      (monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy).

      Secondary objective:

        -  To provide safety data

        -  To evaluate the basic pharmacokinetics of BI 836880 and BI 754091 during combination
           therapy after the first and fourth infusion cycle.

      PART 2:

      Primary objective:

      - To assess anti-tumour activity of BI 836880 in combination with BI 754091 in patients with
      locally advanced or metastatic non-squamous NSCLC and other solid tumors

      Secondary objective:

        -  To provide safety data and further investigate clinical efficacy including disease
           control (DC), duration of objective response (DoR), progression free survival (PFS), and
           tumour shrinkage

        -  To evaluate the basic pharmacokinetics of BI 836880 and BI 754091 during combination
           therapy after the first infusion cycle.
