  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fluid overload (FO), resulting from high volume fluid therapy, is frequent and contributes to
      excessive visceral edema, delayed fascial closure, and adverse outcomes among postinjury open
      abdomen (OA) patients. Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) is a promising tool in
      monitoring fluid status and FO. Thus, we sought to investigate the efficacy of BIA-directed
      resuscitation among postinjury OA patients.

    <description>After the achievement of CVP, MAP and ScvO2 goals, if hyperhydration (HL &gt; 74.3%) was found, then the following fluid management was applied with each passing 6h. If HL was above 87% (severe level), fluid infusion was restricted, a furosemide drip was used, and CRRT was initiated with an ultrafiltration rate when patients were failure or inadequate response to above diuretic therapy that gave a net negative fluid balance of at least 1500 ml during the next 6h. If HL was 81%-87% (moderate level), above methods were used to trigger a net negative fluid balance (about 1000 ml) for the next 6h. Similarly, If HL was 74.3%-81% (mild level), a net negative fluid balance of about 500 ml would be achieved during the next 6h of ICU hospitalization. If HL was blow 71%, a state of dehydration, CVP, MAP, and ScvO2 was maintained as above during ICU resuscitation.</description>

    <description>In both groups, a multi-frequency BIA with eight tactile electrodes (Inbody S10 Biospace, Biospace Co. Ltd., Seoul, Korea) was used to assess body fluid status every 6h within the first 72h after admission to the ICU and daily for a period of 4 days.
BIA recording was not adjusted by clinicians in fluid restrict, pharmacological and mechanical means of therapy.
In contrast, in group BIA, fluid resuscitation protocol with adjustment determined according to HL measured by BIA.</description>
