    <textblock>
      The Coordinating and Data Management Center (CDMC) at MD Anderson Cancer will be responsible
      for the coordination and data management for the Evaluation of a mixed meal test for
      Diagnosis and characterization of Type 3c diabetes mellitus secondary to pancreatic cancer
      and chronic pancreatitis (DETECT), which is part of the NIH U01 funded Consortium for the
      Study of Chronic Pancreatitis, Diabetes, and Pancreatic Cancer (CPDPC). Similar to all
      studies that will be coordinated and managed by the CDMC, no patient enrollment will occur at
      MDACC. All patient recruitment will occur at external sites that are a part of the CPDPC,
      which are listed in the appended DETECT protocol. The data management systems, auditing, and
      monitoring effort are supported by the CDMC.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All patients must sign an informed consent indicating that they are aware of the
             investigational nature of this study. Patients must have signed an authorization for
             the release of their protected health information.

          -  Patients must be ages ≥40 and &lt;85.

          -  Patients must have a diagnosis of one of the following based on study definitions;

          -  New Onset Diabetes (&lt;3 years) in subjects with Pancreatic Cancer (PDAC);

          -  New Onset Diabetes (&lt;9 years) in subjects with Chronic Pancreatitis;

          -  New Onset Diabetes (&lt;3 years) in subjects without Pancreatic disease (i.e., T2DM)

          -  Long standing T2DM (≥3 years) without Pancreatic disease

          -  Long standing diabetes (≥3 years) in subjects with PDAC

          -  Long standing diabetes (≥9 years) subjects with chronic pancreatitis

          -  non-diabetic subjects with PDAC

          -  non-diabetic subjects with chronic pancreatitis

          -  non-diabetic controls without Pancreatic disease

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must not have any significant medical illnesses (including diabetes) that in
             the investigator's opinion cannot be adequately controlled with appropriate therapy or
             would compromise the patient's ability to tolerate study interventions.

          -  Diabetes must be stable enough to permit holding diabetes medications following the
             criteria below:

          -  Subjects taking higher doses of insulin (≥ 0.75 unit/kg/day).

          -  Subjects in the non-pancreatic disease subgroup (i.e., T2DM) on longer acting agents,
             including thiazolidinediones and once-weekly GLP-1 agonists (Bydureon [exenatide],
             Ozempic [semaglutide], Trulicity [dulaglutide]). Conversely, the use of these
             medications is permitted for subjects in the CP and PDAC groups.

          -  Patients currently receiving oral steroid medications.

          -  Hospitalization for acute pancreatitis within 2 months before study visit (with the
             exception of subjects enrolled into the PDAC group as this may be a symptom of the
             disease).

          -  The presence of a symptomatic cyst in subjects with CP. The presence of a cyst in
             subjects with pancreatic cancer is not an exclusion, including cancer arising from a
             mucinous cystic lesion.

          -  Any subject with a pancreatic cancer histologic subtype other than adenocarcinoma
             (e.g., subjects with pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors are excluded).

          -  Previous pancreatic surgery (including total pancreatectomy, pancreaticoduodenectomy,
             distal pancreatectomy, pancreaticojejunostomy, enucleation, or Frey procedure).

          -  Previous treatment for pancreatic cancer, including chemotherapy or radiation.

          -  Previous vagotomy or gastric surgery, including endoscopic gastric reduction
             procedures.

          -  Previous diagnosis of gastroparesis.

          -  Patients on treatment for any cancer (except non-melanoma skin cancer or carcinoma
             in-situ of the cervix).

          -  Allergy or intolerance to ingredients in Boost drink.
