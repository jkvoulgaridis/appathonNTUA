  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Theoretical models of chronic pain hypothesize a privileged treatment of pain-related
      information that would be the basis of avoidance behaviors in chronic pain. This privileged
      treatment, also called attentional bias, has been found experimentally in chronic pain.
      Meta-analyses confirmed that but leaded the question of the difference found between bias in
      period of attention orientation and bias in period of maintained attention. One of the
      hypotheses is to consider one or more cognitive processes that would &quot;fix&quot; the attention
      around significant perceived problems and that would hinder the attentional disengagement and
      the reorientation of attention towards neutral or positive stimuli. In view of the scientific
      literature in psychopathology but also in chronic pain we think that the negative repetitive
      thoughts (RNT) variable is one of these processes. So the investigators want to better
      understand the difference of attentional bias at different moments of the attentional process
      by interrogating the Repetitive Thinking variable. More specifically the investigators test
      the Attentional Bias hypothesis in Fibromyalgia. Patient with Fibromyalgia will be recruited
      at the Pain Center of CHU-Amiens. Patients will complete different scales and also the visual
      probe task. First, the investigators hypothesize the attention bias for pain-related
      information in the FM group is correlated with the level of negative repetitive thinking in
      the maintained attention phase. Second, the investigators hypothesize the attention bias is
      more important in the attention maintenance phase (1250 ms) than in the attention orientation
      phase (500 ms).
