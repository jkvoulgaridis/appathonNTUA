  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In a randomized multicenter trial the investigators want to compare the ability of two
      hCG-based models in correctly classifying EPs as high risk among PULs and correctly
      classifying IUPs and failed PULs as low risk after two hCG measurements.

      After the classification of PULs into high or low risk of EP, the clinical management will be
      the same within each risk group (high and low) regardless of randomization group (which model
      classified the patients). The clinical management will be according to the management
      protocol published in a NICE guideline.

      Pregnancy of unknown location (PUL) is a term used to describe a situation where there is no
      evidence of a gestation either intra-or extrauterine on transvaginal sonography (TVS) in
      women seeking medical attention for various reasons in early pregnancy. The principal tool in
      PUL management besides TVS is the interpretation of the change in serial serum human
      chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) levels. A recent meta-analysis concluded that there is not
      enough evidence to recommend a specific strategy using hCG when managing PULs. In a NICE
      (National Institute of health and care excellence) guideline however women with a PUL
      acceptable for outpatient surveillance, where the rate of change in rising hCG levels
      surpassing 63 % in 48 hours (h) highly likely represents an IUP and the patient is triaged to
      a TVS after one week. Those with a decline in hCG levels of more than 50 % are predicted to
      be failed PULs and a urinary pregnancy test (UPT) after two weeks is appropriate. If the rate
      of change in hCG levels fail to meet these cut-offs a re-visit within 24 h is warranted in
      order to possibly diagnose an EP and suitable treatment selected. In a previous study; an hCG
      based logistic regression model, M4 classified 70 % of all PULs as low risk of being an EP,
      hence qualifying for a reduced follow-up while correctly identifying 88 % of EPs. A study
      from Sahlgrenska University hospital (SU) evaluated the M4 model with similar results, where
      also the cut-offs by NICE similarly identified 86 % of EPs but to a lesser extent correctly
      classified low risk PULs. Another finding in the study was that EPs identified by M4 mainly
      depicted rising hCG levels opposed to the NICE model identifying mainly EPs with declining
      hCG levels which could have clinical consequences since EPs with rising hCG levels more often
      seem to necessitate laparoscopic surgery and maybe a postponed diagnosis could be deleterious
      in these cases. Hence, the M4 model potentially would be better than the NICE cut-offs for
      PUL management. None of these findings however have been evaluated in a randomized controlled
      trial (RCT).
