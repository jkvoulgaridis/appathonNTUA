  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-regional, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, clinical trial to
      evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and efficacy of SHR-1314 in adults
      with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a multiple dose escalating design to evaluate the safety, PK, and
      pharmacodynamics (PD) of multiple subcutaneous injections of SHR-1314. There are two parts in
      this study. The safety, PK, and PD will be evaluated in Part A, the dose escalation part. The
      efficacy and safety on different doses will be assessed in parallel-groups in Part B.

    <description>Percentage of participants with treatment-emergent positive anti-SHR-1314 antibodies was summarized by treatment group.

    <measure>Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI) score</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline through 24 weeks (Part A) or 36 weeks (Part B)</time_frame>
    <description>PASI combines the extent of body surface involvement in 4 anatomical regions(head,trunk,arms,and legs).For each region the percent area of skin involved was estimated from 0(0%) to 6(90%-100%) and severity was estimated by clinical signs of erythema,induration and scaling with a scores range from 0(none) to 4(very severe).Each area is scored by itself and the scores were then combined for the final PASI. Final PASI calculated as:sum of severity parameters for each region*area score*weighing factor (head[0.1],upper limbs[0.2],trunk[0.3],lower limbs [0.4]).Overall scores range from 0(no psoriasis) to 72(most severe disease). Percent change from baseline in PASI score over time will be evaluated.</description>

    <measure>Physician's Global Assessment (PGA) of 0 or 1 achievement</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline through 24 weeks (Part A) or 36 weeks (Part B)</time_frame>
    <description>The PGA of psoriasis is scored on a 6-point scale, reflecting a global consideration of the erythema, induration, and scaling across all psoriatic lesions. Average erythema, induration, and scaling are scored separately over the whole body according to a 6-point severity scale (0 [clear] to 5 [severe]). The total score was calculated as average of the 3 severity scores and rounded to the nearest whole number score to determine the PGA score and category (0=clear; 1=almost clear; 2=mild; 3=moderate; 4=moderate to severe; 5 = severe). Proportion of subjects achieving PGA response of 0 or 1 over time will be evaluated. PGA response of 0 or 1 is defined as a PGA score of 0 (clear) or 1 (almost clear) and an improvement of at least 2 points on the PGA scale from baseline.</description>

             randomization.

          4. Presence of other skin conditions (e.g. skin infections, seborrheic dermatitis) that
             in the judgement of the Investigator could interfere with assessment of psoriasis.

          7. History of depression and/or suicidal ideation or behavior which in the opinion of the
             Investigator, makes the subject unsuitable for clinical study participation.

             judgement of the Investigator prevents the subject from participating in the study.

          9. Have a known allergy or hypersensitivity to any biologic therapy at screening that
             would pose an unacceptable risk to the subject if participating in this study.

             randomization) in any other trials.

         12. Have had a live attenuated vaccination within 12 weeks before randomization, or intend
             to have a live attenuated vaccination during the course of the study, or have
