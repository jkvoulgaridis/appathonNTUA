  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate that individuals with low short-term
      practice effects (STPE) on cognitive testing are more likely to be identified as &quot;positive&quot;
      on amyloid imaging than individuals with high STPE. STPE may also inform us about other
      AD-related biomarkers, including hippocampal volumes, functional connectivity, and APOE
      status. By realizing the aims of this pragmatic study, we hope to be able to offer more
      economical and efficient screening of potential participants for clinical trials, which would
      reduce participant burden and financial costs.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  65 years or older

          -  Identified as intact, Mild Cognitive Impairment, or Alzheimer's disease

          -  Able to complete study procedures

          -  All participants must have a collateral source (e.g. spouse, adult child, caregiver,
             close friend) available to briefly comment on the cognitive abilities and daily
             functioning of the participant. If the participant is diagnosed with probable AD
             dementia, a legally authorized representative (e.g. spouse, adult child) must be
             available to provide informed consent for the participant.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of major stroke, head injury with loss of consciousness of &gt;30 minutes, or
             other neurological/systemic illness that may affect cognition

          -  Current or past major psychiatric illness (e.g., schizophrenia, bipolar affective
             disorder)

          -  History of substance abuse

          -  Current use of antipsychotics or anticonvulsant medications

          -  Known allergic or hypersensitivity reactions to previously administered
             radiopharmaceuticals.

          -  Need for monitored sedation or anesthesia during PET or MRI scanning.

          -  Claustrophobia to a degree that the individual cannot undergo PET or MRI imaging

          -  History of metal injury which precludes the individual from undergoing MRI imaging

          -  Evidence of stroke or mass lesion on a CT or MRI scan

          -  History of radiation therapy to the brain

          -  History of significant major medical illnesses, such as cancer or AIDS.

          -  Inadequate vision, hearing, and manual dexterity to participate in the cognitive
             assessments.

          -  15-item Geriatric Depression Scale score of &gt;5

          -  Clinical Dementia Rating score of &gt;1

          -  Mini Mental State Examination score of &lt;20
