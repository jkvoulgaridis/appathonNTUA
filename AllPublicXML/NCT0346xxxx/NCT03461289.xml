      Phase 3, open-label, single-arm, single-dose, trial of onasemnogene abeparvovec-xioi (gene
      replacement therapy) in patients with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) Type 1 who meet
      enrollment criteria and are genetically defined by a biallelic pathogenic mutation of the
      survival motor neuron 1 gene (SMN1) with one or two copies of survival motor neuron 2 gene
      (SMN2). Up to 30 patients &lt; 6 months (&lt; 180 days) of age at the time of gene replacement
      therapy (Day 1) will be enrolled.

      Phase 3, open-label, single-arm, single-dose, trial of onasemnogene abeparvovec-xioi (gene
      replacement therapy) in patients with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) Type 1 who meet
      enrollment criteria and are genetically defined by a biallelic pathogenic mutation of the
      survival motor neuron 1 gene (SMN1) with one or two copies of survival motor neuron 2 gene
      (SMN2). 30 patients &lt; 6 months (&lt; 180 days) of age at the time of gene replacement therapy
      (Day 1) will be enrolled.

      The trial includes a screening period, a gene replacement therapy period, and a follow-up
      period. During the screening period (Days -30 to -2), patients whose parent(s)/legal
      guardian(s) provide informed consent will complete screening procedures to determine
      eligibility for trial enrollment. Patients who meet the entry criteria will enter the
      in-patient gene replacement therapy period (Day -1 to Day 3). On Day -1, patients will be
      admitted to the hospital for pre-treatment baseline procedures. On Day 1, patients will
      receive a one-time intravenous (IV) infusion of onasemnogene abeparvovec-xioi, and will
      undergo in-patient safety monitoring over the next 48 hours. Patients may be discharged 48
      hours after the infusion, based on Investigator judgment. During the outpatient follow-up
      period (Days 4 to End of Trial at 18 months of age), patients will return at regularly
      scheduled intervals for efficacy and safety assessments until the End of Trial when the
      patient reaches 18 months of age. After the End of Trial visit, eligible patients will be
      asked to participate into the long-term follow up trial.

      All post-treatment visits will be relative to the date on which gene replacement therapy is
      administered, until the patient is 14 months of age, after which they will be relevant to the
      patient's date of birth.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with SMA Type 1 as determined by diagnosis of SMA based on gene mutation
             analysis with biallelic SMN1 mutations (deletion or point mutations) and one or two
             copies of SMN2 [inclusive of the known SMN2 gene modifier mutation (c.859G&gt;C)]

          -  Patients must be &lt; 6 months (&lt; 180 days) of age at the time of onasemnogene
             abeparvovec-xioi infusion

          -  Patients must have a swallowing evaluation test performed prior to administration of
             gene replacement therapy

        Exclusion Criteria:
