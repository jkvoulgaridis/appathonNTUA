      To assess immunogenicity following one dose of Vi-DT vaccine immunization. To compare the
      safety and immunogenicity of Vi-DT to Vi polysaccharide vaccine in adults, adolescents, and
      children groups.

      To compare the safety and immunogenicity of Vi-DT to IPV vaccine in infants groups.

      Kinetics of Vi-specific IgG antibodies up to 6 months and 1 year after administration of 1
      dose of vaccine.

      To evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of Vi-DT co-administered with MR vaccine in infants
      (≥ 9months -23 months old).
