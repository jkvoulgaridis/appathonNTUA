  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are studying the feasibility, acceptability, and outcomes of an
      intervention called Enhanced Dialysis Education (EDU) Intervention. CKD-EDU is a palliative
      care-based dialysis decision-making intervention that involves educating patients and
      caregivers about dialysis and engaging them in shared decision-making. Half of the enrolled
      patients will receive CKD-EDU and the other half will receive Usual Care.
