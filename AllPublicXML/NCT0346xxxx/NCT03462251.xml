  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of first-line treatment ribociclib
      in combination with aromatase inhibitor (AI) or fulvestrant OR capecitabine with bevacizumab
      OR paclitaxel with / without bevacizumab in patients with HR-positive, HER2-negative advanced
      breast cancer with visceral metastasis.

      Half of the patients will receive a combination of ribociclib and AI/fulvestrant while the
      other half will receive capecitabine + bevacizumab or paclitaxel +/- bevacizumab.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized, open-label, two-arm, multicenter, interventional phase III
      trial in Germany. The study will include adult women with HR-positive, HER2-negative advanced
      breast cancer with visceral metastases, who received no prior therapy for advanced disease.

      158 patients will be enrolled and randomized 1:1 (stratified by the presence of lung and / or
      liver metastases) to receive Arm A: a combination of ribociclib and AI or fulvestrant; OR Arm
      B: capecitabine + bevacizumab OR paclitaxel +/- bevacizumab

      Treatment will be continued until disease progression, intolerable toxicity or death.
      Progression-free survival (PFS) will be based on tumor assessments by local
      radiologists/investigator using RECIST v1.1 criteria. Treatment might be continued beyond
      RECIST-defined progressive disease (PD) in case of negligible or clinically irrelevant
      disease progression according to the investigator's discretion until clinically relevant
      disease progression or symptomatic deterioration.
