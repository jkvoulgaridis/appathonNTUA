             conditions (e.g., schizophrenia), dementia, or significant neurological disorders

             suspected infection, hepatitis B or C, or cancer) that, in the investigator's opinion,
             would expose them to undue risk of a significant adverse event (AE) or interfere with
             assessments of safety or efficacy during the course of the trial.

          7. History of, treatment for, or evidence of, alcohol or drug abuse within the past 12
