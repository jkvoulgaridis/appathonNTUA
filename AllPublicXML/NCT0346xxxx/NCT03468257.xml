  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will be enrolled in a stress-induced eating intervention with 5, 7, or 9 treatments
      or control. Treatment will comprise imagining a stressful event, engaging in a stress relief
      activity (Progressive Muscle Relaxation), and consuming a fruit once per day. There will be
      one lab visit at baseline in which participants undergo an acute laboratory stressor (i.e.,
      speech and math tasks) and consume food from a buffet. There will be another lab visit at two
      weeks post-intervention. In the second (and final) lab visit, participants will repeat the
      acute laboratory stressor (i.e., speech and math tasks) and buffet, and additionally complete
      questionnaires about their experience in the study.

    <description>The Healthy Eating Index was developed by the USDA to capture diet quality. The total score is able to capture both the healthiness of fruits and the unhealthiness of classic comfort foods that are high in calories, fat, and sugar.</description>
