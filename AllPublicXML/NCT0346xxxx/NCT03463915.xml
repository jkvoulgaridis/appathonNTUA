  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS) is a condition that results in long-term
      bladder and pelvic pain. IC/BPS affects women more often than men. How the disorder develops
      is not completely known. Bladder instillation is a commonly used treatment in which a mixture
      of different ingredients are passed into the bladder to help IC/BPS symptoms. There is room
      to learn more about bladder instillations and which ingredients in them work best. The
      purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of a bladder instillation that contains
      a steroid (triamcinolone acetonide) to a bladder instillation that does not contain a steroid
      to treat IC/BPS in women. The study hypothesis is that women with IC/BPS treated with bladder
      instillations that contain a steroid will have improved outcomes compared to women treated
      with bladder instillations that do not contain a steroid.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS) is a chronic pain disorder involving the
      genitourinary tract. IC/BPS disproportionately affects women with over 80% of patients with
      IC/BPS as female.[1] Like other chronic pain conditions, IC/BPS is physically and emotionally
      taxing on patients. IC/BPS costs the United States over $100 million annually due to direct
      healthcare costs and loss of worker productivity.[2] The exact pathophysiology of the disease
      is unknown, leading to a limitation in our ability to treat the disorder effectively. The
      current leading etiologic theory is that IC/BPS is a neurologically-derived chronic systemic
      pain syndrome due to its association with musculoskeletal pelvic pain, irritable bowel
      syndrome, chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia, and vulvodynia.[3-6] Although several
      options exist to treat IC/BPS, therapeutic effects are often transient.[7,8] Previous studies
      in chronic pain disorders have shown that multimodal treatment is more effective than
      single-agent treatment,[9,10] so future therapy should aim to augment rather than replace
      current treatments. Bladder instillation is a commonly used treatment in which a mixture of
      different agents are instilled into the bladder to improve IC/BPS symptoms. The data on the
      efficacy of bladder instillations, as well as which ingredients in the mixture are effective,
      is limited.[11,12] Small studies have shown the potential of steroids in decreasing IC/BPS;
      the mechanism of action is hypothesized to be due to decrease inflammation in the bladders of
      these patients.[13,14] The knowledge gap that exists is the necessity of a steroid in the
      bladder instillation treatment for IC/BPS symptoms especially since this tends to be the most
      expensive ingredient.

      To evaluate the utility of a steroid in the bladder instillation treatment of IC/BPS, we
      propose a randomized, double blind, controlled trial that will compare the efficacy of
      bladder instillations with and without triamcinolone acetonide on IC/BPS symptoms in women.
      We hypothesize that the addition of triamcinolone acetonide in bladder instillation therapy
      will result in a more robust treatment response than bladder instillations without
      triamcinolone acetonide. Our rationale is based on 1) the results of small studies that
      showed improvement of IC/BPS symptoms with use of a steroid and 2) the hypothesized mechanism
      of action of steroids decreasing inflammation in the bladder.
