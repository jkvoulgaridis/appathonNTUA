    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy of treatment with ustekinumab or
      adalimumab in biologic naive participants with moderately-to-severely active Crohn's disease
      (CD) who have previously failed or were intolerant to conventional therapy (corticosteroids
      and/or immunomodulators, such as azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, or methotrexate), as
      measured by clinical remission at one year.

      This study compares the safety and efficacy of ustekinumab versus adalimumab. It will consist
      of screening (within 1- 5 weeks prior to Week 0), treatment phase (Weeks 0 to 52), and
      follow-up phase (up to Week 76). The primary hypothesis is that ustekinumab is superior to
      adalimumab as measured by clinical remission after one year of treatment. Study assessments
      will include Crohn's disease activity index (CDAI), video ileocolonoscopy; CD-related
      healthcare utilization; patient-reported outcomes (PROs); laboratory evaluations; biomarkers;
      review of concomitant medications and adverse events (AEs); and evaluation of serum
      concentrations of study agent as well as development of antibodies to study agent. All
      participants will randomly be assigned to receive either ustekinumab or adalimumab. No
      participants will be treated with placebo only.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants with Clinical Remission at Week 52</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage of participants with clinical remission at Week 52 will be assessed. Clinical remission is defined as a Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) score of less than (&lt;) 150 points (in general, CDAI score ranges from 0 to approximately 600; higher score indicates higher disease activities). CDAI was assessed by collecting information on 8 different Crohn's disease-related variables (extra-intestinal manifestations, abdominal mass, weight, hematocrit, total number of liquid stools, abdominal pain/cramping, use of antidiarrheal drug(s) and/or opiates, and general well-being). A decrease in CDAI over time indicates improvement in disease activity.</description>

          -  Has a stool culture or other examination positive for an enteric pathogen, including
             Clostridium difficile toxin, in the last 4 months unless a repeat examination is

          -  Has received a Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccination within 12 months or any
             other live bacterial or live viral vaccination within 2 weeks of baseline

          -  Has a history of, or ongoing, chronic or recurrent infectious disease, including but
             not limited to, chronic renal infection, chronic chest infection, recurrent urinary
