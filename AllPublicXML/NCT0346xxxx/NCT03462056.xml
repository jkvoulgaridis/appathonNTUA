  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children with cystic fibrosis require increased caloric intake to maintain appropriate
      growth, an important determinant of long-term outcomes. This study seeks to determine the
      feasibility of using a novel therapeutic food to promote weight gain and growth in children
      with cystic fibrosis.

    <description>Participants will receive Cystic Fibrosis Ready to Use Supplemental Food sufficient to provide approximately 20% of estimated daily caloric needs up to 500kcal of total calories, 18.5 grams of protein and 28g of fat. The supplement is also optimized to provide excellent protein quality and optimal polyunsaturated fatty acid composition</description>
