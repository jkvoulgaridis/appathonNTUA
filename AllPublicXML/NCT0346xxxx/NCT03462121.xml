  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre, Phase 2 study,
      with an optional open-label extension, to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of
      RPh201 in subjects with mild to moderate AD who are eligible for enrollment in this study.

      Subject participation will include a Screening Phase, Treatment Phase, and an Optional
      Open-Label Extension. The Screening Phase will be up to 4 weeks prior to randomization. Both
      the subject and their study partner(s) will sign an informed consent form (ICF). At Visit 2,
      Subjects will be randomized 2:1 to RPh201 or placebo. The Treatment Phase will last for 6
      months post-randomization, or until subject withdrawal from the study, whichever comes first.
      The Optional Open-Label Extension will begin once a subject has completed the Treatment Phase
      and the subject and their study partner(s) have signed an ICF to continue on the study. The
      Optional Open-Label Extension will continue for 6 months, or until subject withdrawal from
      the study, whichever comes first. Subjects who do not participate in the Optional Open-Label
      Extension will be asked to return for an optional post-study visit 6 months after the end of
      the Treatment Phase.

      Subjects may participate in an optional biomarker sub-study. Up to 15 subjects may also
      participate in an optional FDG-PET sub-study during their study participation. Separate
      informed consent will be required for both of these sub-studies.

    <time_frame>Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>The CDR is a global clinical scale with established diagnostic and severity-ranking utility widely used in clinical trials yielding global and sum of boxes scores (CDR-SB). The CDR global score is used in AD trials as a global measure of disease severity. The CDR is rated based on subject and informant input. The CDR assess three domains of cognition (memory, orientation, judgment/problem solving) and three domains of function (community affairs, home/hobbies, personal care) using semi- structured interviews of both the study subject and a companion/informant carried out by a trained rater and scored using a standard methodology. Each domain is rated on a 5-point scale of functioning as follows: (0) no impairment; (0.5) questionable impairment; (1) mild impairment; (2) moderate impairment; (3) severe impairment (personal care is scored on a 4-point scale without a 0.5 rating available). Higher scores indicate greater impairment.</description>

    <time_frame>Month 3</time_frame>
    <description>The NPI is designed to detect, quantify, and track changes of psychiatric symptoms in a demented population.6 It uses a structured, caregiver-based interview format to assess 10 behavioral domains (delusions, hallucinations, agitation/aggression, dysphoria/depression, anxiety, apathy, irritability, euphoria, disinhibition, and aberrant motor behavior). The same behaviors are then rated on level of severity (1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe). The domain total score is the product of the frequency score multiplied by the severity score for that behavioral domain. An NPI total score is obtained by summing all the individual domain total scores.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects must be ≥65 years of age at the time of consent.

          -  Subjects 65-69 years old, inclusive, must have evidence of cerebrovascular disease.

          -  Meet National Institute on Aging-Alzheimer's Association 2011 criteria for All-Cause
             Dementia and have evidence for probable AD or possible AD with coexisting
             cerebrovascular disease. Coexisting cerebrovascular disease includes evidence of any
             of the following: cortical infarcts, subcortical and lacunar infarcts, macro or
             micro-hemorrhage, and small vessel ischemic microangiopathy.

          -  Willing and able to provide informed consent or, if incapable of informed consent,
             have a legally authorized representative willing to consent on their behalf.

          -  MMSE at screen visit: 15-22, inclusive.

          -  Cholinesterase inhibitors, memantine, and other background medications impacting
             cognition and mood, if used, are at stable doses for at least 6 weeks prior to
             screening.

          -  A study partner is available who has adequate contact with the subject to administer
             study drug, oversee study drug compliance, report on adverse events (AEs), and provide
             meaningful input into scales and assessments.

          -  Adequate hearing, vision, and fluency in the language of testing.

          -  Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain must reveal findings consistent with AD
             with or without coexisting cerebrovascular disease. In subjects for whom brain MRI is
             contraindicated (e.g., presence of a pacemaker), computed tomography (CT) of the brain
             is acceptable. Historic MRI or CT scans up to 18 months prior to screening may be used
             for inclusion unless there have been interval clinical events warranting an updated
             scan.

          -  Male subjects who are sexually active must agree to use one of the following
             acceptable methods of birth control from Screening and for at least one month after
             the last dose of study drug: abstinence (no sexual intercourse), male condom, or
             vasectomy.

          -  Subjects must be willing and able to comply with scheduled visits, treatment plan,
             laboratory tests, and other study procedures.

          -  Optional FDG-PET sub-study: no contraindications to PET imaging. Individuals
             participating in the FDG-PET sub-study will be capped at 15 volunteers and a further
             cap may be imposed on the number enrolling in this sub-study without evidence of
             cerebrovascular disease.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Neurological or non-neurological conditions other than AD and cerebrovascular disease
             that, in the Investigator's opinion, contribute to, or provide alternative etiology
             for, the subject's dementia. Examples include, but are not limited to, brain tumors,
             clinically significant head injury, Parkinson's disease, current or prior excess use
             of alcohol that, in the investigator's judgment, has caused or significantly
             contributed to the subject's cognitive decline, or primary psychiatric disorders
             (e.g., schizophrenia or bipolar affective disorder).

          -  Unstable medical conditions which are likely to impact subject's ability to complete
             the trial and which are likely to confound AE assessment. These include, but are not
             limited to, uncontrolled hypertension, uncontrolled diabetes, and cancer within past
             the 2 years. Exceptions include prostate cancer in-situ and local basal and squamous
             cell skin cancers.

          -  Chronic use of systemic or inhaled steroids (use of topical steroids is acceptable).

          -  Other concomitant medications that, in the Investigator's judgment, impair cognition
             and/or confound efficacy assessments.

          -  Women of child-bearing potential are excluded (e.g., women who have not been
             post-menopausal for at least 2 years or are not surgically sterile).

          -  Treatment with investigational product from a previous clinical drug trial within the
             last 30 days or five half-lives prior to Visit 2 (Baseline), whichever is longer.
