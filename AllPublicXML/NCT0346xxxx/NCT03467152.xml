    <measure>Mean Change from Baseline in the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) Total Score at 12 Weeks of Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The MoCA scale assesses different cognitive domains: attention and concentration, executive functions, memory, language, visuoconstructional skills, conceptual thinking, calculations, and orientation. It is useful to characterize global cognitive impairment in dementia with Lewy bodies. The total possible score is 30 points; a score of 26 or above is considered normal.</description>

    <measure>Mean Clinician's Interview Based Impression of Change Plus Caregiver Input (CIBIC-Plus) Scale Score at 12 Weeks of Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The CIBIC-Plus scale is designed to measure various domains that describe participant function: general, mental/cognitive state, behavior, and activities of daily living. It is a semi-structured global rating derived from a comprehensive interview with the participant and caregiver or informant by an independent rater who has no access to the source data or other psychometric test scores conducted post-randomization as part of the protocol. The CIBIC-Plus scores are: 1 (marked improvement), 2 (moderate improvement), 3 (minimal improvement), 4 (no change), 5 (minimal worsening), 6 (moderate worsening), and 7 (marked worsening).</description>

    <measure>Mean Clinician's Global Impression of Change - In Dementia With Lewy Bodies (CGIC-DLB) Scale Score at 12 Weeks of Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The CGIC-DLB scale provides an overall clinician-determined summary measure of change from the participant's clinical status at the Baseline Visit that takes into account all available information from the efficacy endpoints (which include cognitive function, non-cognitive symptoms, behavior, and the impact of the symptoms on the participant's ability to function) and safety data.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change from Baseline in the Cognitive Fluctuation Inventory (CFI) Score at 12 Weeks of Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The CFI scale assesses cognitive fluctuation with the same format as the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI). It evaluates fluctuation in various domains including attention, ability to perform daily functions, orientation, verbal communication and behavior. It is scored based on frequency and severity with a score range of 0 to 12. The scale also assesses the degree of caregiver or informant distress engendered by the symptoms.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change from Baseline in the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) Total Score at 12 Weeks of Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The MMSE is a 30-point scale that measures orientation to time and place, registration, immediate and delayed recall, attention, language, and drawing. Scores range from 0 (most impaired) to 30 (no impairment).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change from Baseline in the NPI Total Score at 12 Weeks of Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>This NPI scale assesses the frequency and severity of 12 neuropsychiatric symptoms commonly described in dementia participants: delusions, hallucinations, agitation/aggression, depression/dysphoria, anxiety, elation/euphoria, apathy/indifference, disinhibition, irritability/lability, motor disturbance, nighttime behaviors, and appetite/eating changes. The scale also assesses the degree of caregiver or informant distress engendered by each of the symptoms. It is rated from 0 to 144, with higher scores indicating a greater neuropsychiatric disturbance. A subscore covering the domains of delusions, hallucinations, apathy, and depression (NPI-4) will also be derived.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants with Adverse Events (AEs), including Severe Adverse Events, Serious AEs, AEs Resulting in Study Discontinuation</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 22 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Adverse Events (AEs) will be graded for severity on a 3-point scale of mild, moderate, and severe. Severe AEs defined as those AEs that are incapacitating, with inability to work or to perform normal daily activity. A Serious AE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: results in death; is life threatening (ie, the participant was at immediate risk of death from the adverse event as it occurred; this does not include an event that, had it occurred in a more severe form or was allowed to continue, might have caused death) requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; is a congenital anomaly/birth defect or is medically important due to other reasons than the above mentioned criteria.</description>

    <time_frame>Up to 22 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The C-SSRS (mapped to Columbia Classification Algorithm of Suicide Assessment (C-CASA) categories); is an interview-based instrument to systematically assess suicidal ideation and suicidal behavior. C-SSRS assess whether participant experience any of the following: completed suicide; suicide attempt (response of &quot;yes&quot; on &quot;actual attempt&quot;); preparatory acts toward imminent suicidal behavior (&quot;yes&quot; on &quot;preparatory acts or behavior&quot;, &quot;aborted attempt&quot; or &quot;interrupted attempt&quot;), suicidal ideation (&quot;yes&quot; on &quot;wish to be dead&quot;, &quot;non-specific active suicidal thoughts&quot;, &quot;active suicidal ideation with methods without intent to act or some intent to act, without specific plan or with specific plan and intent, any self-injurious behavior with no suicidal intent (&quot;yes&quot; on &quot;has participant engaged in non-suicidal self-injurious behavior&quot;). Here, number of participants with positive response (&quot;yes&quot;) to suicidal behavior or/and Ideation, any non-suicidal self-injurious behavior will be reported.</description>

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female, age 50 to 85 years, inclusive at time of consent.

          -  Meet criteria for probable dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) (as defined by the 4th
             report of the DLB Consortium).

          -  Mini-Mental State Examination ≥14 and ≤26 at Screening Visit.

          -  Has experienced visual hallucinations during the past 4 weeks before Screening Visit.

          -  If receiving acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEI), must have been on a stable dose
             for at least 12 weeks before Screening Visit, with no plans for dose adjustment during
             the study. Treatment-naive participants can be entered into the study but there should
             be no plans to initiate treatment with AChEIs from Screening to the end of the study.

          -  If receiving memantine, must have been on a stable dose for at least 12 weeks before
             Screening Visit, with no plans for dose adjustment during the study. Treatment naive
             participants can be entered into the study but there should be no plans to initiate
             treatment with memantine from Screening to the end of the study.

          -  Must have an identified caregiver or informant who is willing and able to provide
             follow-up information on the participant throughout the course of the study.

             investigator's opinion, the participant's assent should be obtained, as required in
             accordance with local laws, regulations and customs, plus the written informed consent
             of a legal representative should be obtained (capacity to consent and definition of
             legal representative should be determined in accordance with applicable local laws and
             regulations). In countries where local laws, regulations, and customs do not permit
             participants who lack capacity to consent to participate in this study, they will not
             be enrolled.

          -  Any neurological condition that may be contributing to cognitive impairment above and
             beyond those caused by the participant's DLB, including any comorbidities detected by
             clinical assessment or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

          -  History of transient ischemic attacks or stroke within 12 months of Screening.

             higher.

          -  Any major psychiatric diagnosis, including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and current
