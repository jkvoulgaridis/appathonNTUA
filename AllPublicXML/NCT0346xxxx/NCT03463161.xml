             participated in a study of an investigational therapy and received study therapy or

          -  Diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving systemic steroid therapy or any other
             form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to the first dose of trial

          -  Has not recovered from prior surgery, chemotherapy or radiation therapy from adverse
             events due to a previous treatment/ administered agent (i.e., ≤ Grade 1 or return to

        typical side effects from radiotherapy are an exception to this criterion and may qualify
        for the study.

        Note: If subject received major surgery, they must have recovered adequately from the
        toxicity and/or complications from the intervention prior to starting therapy.

             Exceptions include basal cell carcinoma of the skin or squamous cell carcinoma of the
             skin that has undergone potentially curative therapy or in situ cervical cancer or any

             excluded.

          -  Use of any UGT1A9 inhibitor from screening through follow-up period, including the
             following: diclofenac, imipramine, ketoconazole, mefenamic acid, and probenecid. See
