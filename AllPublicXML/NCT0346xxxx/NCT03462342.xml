      Investigational agent, AZD6738 will be given in combination with Olaparib to women with
      recurrent ovarian cancer (platinum-sensitive or platinum-resistant).

      This study will determine if using Olaparib in combination with AZD6738 is safe and tolerable
      and also determine the objective response rate and progression free survival of combination
      of AZD 6738 and Olaparib in women with recurrent ovarian cancer in distinct Pt-sensitive and
      Pt-resistant cohorts.

      Women 18 years or older, who have recurrent ovarian cancer will be enrolled in this study.
      After consenting to participate in this trial, they will undergo screening process which will
      involve medical exam and blood work. If found eligible to participate in the trial, they will
      be given olaparib to be taken on all 28 days of the cycle and investigational AZD 6738 from
      days 1-7. For the first cycle, the subject will need to come in every week for lab tests and
      physical exam - this will help the treating physician determine an adverse event as soon as
      it happens. After that, patients are expected to come in every month at the end of each cycle
      (each cycle is 28 days).

      Patients will undergo scans for tumor assessments every 2 cycles and if stable disease or
      response to therapy is documented after cycle 4, imaging will continue every 3 cycles
      thereafter.

             primary peritoneal, and/or fallopian tube cancer histologically or cytologically
             confirmed that is recurrent and for which standard curative measures do not exist or
             are no longer effective. For Cohort D, Part I, patients may have any non-mucinous
             epithelial ovarian cancer (including histology's such as clear cell, or endometrioid).

             to undergo mandatory tumor biopsies (non-target lesion). Patients should have at least
             one lesion (non-target) for biopsy. However, for 50% of patients in Cohorts A, B, C,
             and D Part II, if patients are found to not have a safe lesion to biopsy by the
             radiology team, they may still be enrolled in the study and forego the biopsy.
             Patients for consideration for Cohort D Part I (dose escalation) are not required to
             undergo a biopsy for enrollment. Patients who undergo attempted biopsies that are
             unsuccessful may still enroll and receive study drug.

                  subjects per cohort.

               -  Cohort C and Cohort D Part II: All subjects must have either a germline or
                  somatic BRCA mutation, or other HRD mutation, or tumor is HRD positive. Other HRD

                  of Pennsylvania PI.

               -  Cohort D Part I: Patients will be enrolled irrespective of BRCA status.

          7. Adequate renal function, defined as measured creatinine clearance ≥ 51 ml/min.

          8. Adequate hepatic function, defined as AST and ALT levels ≤ 2.5 X ULN (for subjects

             therapy, and radiation therapy, or investigational agents; 6 weeks for mitomycin C) to
             initiate screening and 3 weeks from previous therapy to initiate treatment.

         11. Platinum-sensitive is defined as recurrence &gt;6 months by RECIST 1.1 imaging from last
             platinum. Platinum-resistant is defined as recurrence &lt; 6 months by RECIST 1.1 imaging
             from last platinum regimen).

               -  For Cohort A, there is no limit to number of prior regimens.

               -  For Cohort B, patients may not have had more than 3 prior cytotoxic therapies
                  since the development of platinum-resistance.

         12. Prior treatment with a PARPi is permitted but not mandatory for Cohorts A and B and
             Cohort D Part I. Prior treatment with PARPi is mandatory for Cohort C and D Part II.
             If a patient has received a prior PARPi, then the patient must have demonstrated a
             clinical benefit of PARPi treatment by an initial response (by CA-125 or imaging) to
             PARPi treatment or clinical benefit from PARPi treatment as maintenance therapy
             followed by disease progression for enrollment. Clinical benefit for maintenance is
             defined as: a) prior maintenance with PARPi after 1st line chemotherapy of at least 12
             months or b) prior maintenance with PARPi after &gt;1 line of chemotherapy for minimum of
             6 months.

             If the prior PARP inhibitor used was olaparib, then patients must have received
             treatment without significant toxicity or the need for a permanent dose reduction. For
             Cohort C and D Part II, patients may not have received cytotoxic chemotherapy in the
             interval between PARPi monotherapy and enrollment.

             chewing, breaking, crushing, opening, or otherwise altering the product formulation.
             They should not have gastrointestinal illnesses that would preclude the absorption of
             AZD6738 or olaparib, which are oral agents.

         15. Postmenopausal defined as:

               -  Amenorrhea for 1 year or more following cessation of exogenous hormonal
                  treatments;
