  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Laparoscopy is increasingly used for major abdominal and pelvic surgery. As this approach is
      also recommended in elderly patients with serious comorbidities, optimal fluid therapy
      guidance during this procedure is important.

      Many studies have reported that less invasive dynamic indices such as pulse pressure
      variation (PPV) and stroke volume variation (SVV), which are derived from the arterial
      pressure waveform, are superior to static indices to predict fluid responsiveness. PPV and
      SVV are based on the heart-lung interaction and reflect cyclic changes in stroke volume
      induced by mechanical ventilation in the closed-chest condition. Therefore, their ability to
      predict fluid responsiveness can be affected by factors that influence the arterial tone or
      the compliance of the respiratory system.

      Laparoscopic surgery for the abdominal visceral organs requires pneumoperitoneum and the
      Trendelenburg position to optimize surgical conditions, and can reduce cardiac output and
      respiratory compliance. Accordingly, the usefulness of PPV and SVV in predicting fluid
      responsiveness during laparoscopic surgery under these conditions may be questioned.

      It has been clearly shown that the values of dynamic parameters are significantly correlated
      with the magnitude of VT. Min et al. reported that augmentation of PPV and SVV via a
      temporary increase in VT from 8 to 12 ml/kg improved their predictive power in the
      inconclusive zone with respect to fluid responsiveness (PPV values of 9% and 13%,
      respectively). Another recent study reported that on increasing VT from 6 to 8 ml/kg,
      augmented PPV and SVV, as well as their absolute changes, predicted fluid responsiveness with
      high sensitivity and specificity, even in critically ill patients receiving low VT.

      Therefore, the aim of the current study was to investigate whether increasing VT from 6 to 8
      ml/kg would improve the predictive power of PPV and SVV in patients undergoing robot-assisted
      laparoscopic surgery in the Trendelenburg position under lung-protective ventilation. We also
      assessed the ability of absolute changes in PPV and SVV values induced by a temporary
      increase in VT from 6 to 8 ml/kg to predict fluid responsiveness.
