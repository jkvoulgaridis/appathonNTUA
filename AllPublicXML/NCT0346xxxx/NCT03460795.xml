  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cirrhosis of the liver is a common clinical chronic progressive liver disease, which is a
      diffuse liver lesion caused by one or more causes over a long period of time or repeatedly.
      Nodules, abnormal spherical areas of cells, form as dying liver cells are replaced by
      regenerating cells. This regeneration of cells causes the liver to become hard. The potential
      for stem cells to differentiate into hepatocytes cells was recently confirmed. In particular,
      mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) transplantation has been applicated in the clinic for treat
      several human diseases such as liver injury and liver fibrosis displayed good tolerance and
      efficiency. Besides, regulatory T cells(Tregs) had been proved as an immune regualtory T cell
      subsets, which could reduce immune cell activation and reduce liver injury severity. The
      purpose of this study is to learn whether and how MSCs and Tregs can improve the disease
      conditions in patients with decompensated cirrhosis.

      Cirrhosis of the liver is a common clinical chronic progressive liver disease, which is a
      diffuse liver lesion caused by one or more causes over a long period of time or repeatedly.
      Nodules, abnormal spherical areas of cells, form as dying liver cells are replaced by
      regenerating cells. This regeneration of cells causes the liver to become hard. Decompensated
      liver cirrhosis is mainly manifested by liver function damage and portal hypertension, with
      multiple system involvement. Complications such as upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage, hepatic
      encephalopathy, secondary infection, hypersplenism, ascites, and carcinogenesis often occur
      in the late stage. The potential for stem cells to differentiate into hepatocytes cells was
      recently confirmed. In particular, mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) and Tregs transplantation had
      been applicated in the clinic for treat several human diseases such as liver injury and liver
      fibrosis displayed good tolerance and efficiency. The purpose of this study is to learn
      whether and how MSCs and Tregs can improve the disease conditions in patients with
      decompensated cirrhosis.
