  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to obtain preliminary data comparing indwelling pleural catheters
      (IPCs) versus IPCs plus doxycycline for pleurodesis as treatments for malignant pleural
      effusion (MPE). Indwelling pleural catheters (IPCs) are commonly used to treat pleural
      effusions (build-up of fluid in the lungs). Doxycycline is an antibiotic that is also used to
      treat pleural effusions. The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if adding
      doxycycline to the use of an IPC can lead to shorter treatment times with IPCs.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To obtain preliminary data comparing indwelling pleural catheters (IPCs) versus IPCs plus
      doxycycline for pleurodesis as treatments for malignant pleural effusion (MPE).

      OUTLINE: Patients choose 1 of 2 groups.

      GROUP I: Patients undergo IPC placement and receive doxycycline via IPC 5 days later.

      GROUP II: Patients undergo IPC placement.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 10-14 days and then monthly
      for up to a year.

    <measure>Time to pleural catheter removal</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>This outcome will be analyzed by cause-specific hazard Cox model with treatment group as a covariate. Whenever a catheter is removed, the cause for removal will be documented. For the analysis, causes will include removal due to decreased drainage (i.e., as per plan) as well as removal due to complications (e.g. infection, empyema, refractory pain) or other reasons (e.g. catheter plugged but no complication to the patient, patient preference without a complication). We will also analyze time to catheter removal for any cause and conduct pre-specified secondary analyses to evaluate the effect of fluid drainage amount (i.e., how much was being put out from the indwelling pleural catheter (IPC) the day of IPC placement and on the day of doxycycline instillation) and size of residual effusion as assessed by chest x-ray (CXR) (on day of IPC placement and day of doxycycline instillation) on time to catheter removal.</description>
