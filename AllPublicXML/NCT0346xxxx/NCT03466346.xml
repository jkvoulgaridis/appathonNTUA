    <textblock>
      Despite carrying the vast majority of the global mental disorder burden, 75% of adults with
      mental disorders in Low and Middle Income Countries have no access to services. This study
      will test strategies for integrating first and second line evidence-based depression and
      trauma-related disorder treatments with primary care services at a large public sector
      hospital and conduct robust cost and cost-benefit analyses of each treatment to produce a
      &quot;menu&quot; of cost-benefit options for personalized, integrated mental health care with
      corresponding effectiveness and implementation values.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mental disorders are a leading cause of global disability, driven by depression and anxiety.
      Most of the disease burden is in Low and Middle Income Countries (LMICs), where 75% of adults
      with mental disorders have no service access. Despite nearly 15 years of efficacy research
      showing that local non-specialists can provide evidence-based care for depression and anxiety
      in LMICs, few studies have advanced to the critical next step: identifying strategies for
      sustainable &quot;real world&quot; non-specialist treatment including integration with existing
      healthcare platforms and response to common clinical dilemmas, such as what treatment to
      start with and how to modify it.

      Given the need to personalize treatment to achieve remission (absence of disease) and the
      scarcity of mental health specialists in LMICs, successful reduction of population-level
      disability caused by depression and anxiety requires (1) evidence-based strategies for
      first-line and second-line (non-remitter) treatment delivered by non-specialists, with (2)
      confirmation of presumed mechanism of action and (3) patient-level moderators of treatment
      outcome to inform personalized, non-specialist treatment algorithms.

      The research team has worked in western Kenya for 6 years with a UCSF-Kenya collaboration
      that supports integrated HIV services at over 70 primary healthcare facilities in Kisumu
      County (Family AIDS Care and Education Services [FACES]). Primary care populations in Kenya
      have high prevalence of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) (26%) and Posttraumatic Stress
      Disorder (PTSD) (35%). Kenyan leaders lack an evidence base for two essential treatments -
      psychotherapy and second generation antidepressants- without which scale-up will fall short
      of its potential. We conducted a randomized, controlled trial in Kisumu County of
      Interpersonal Psychotherapy (IPT) delivered by non-specialists for HIV-positive patients with
      MDD and PTSD. In our study, IPT achieved full remission of MDD and PTSD in the majority of
      participants.

      Given the high prevalence of MDD-PTSD co-morbidity, we will collaborate with the FACES team
      providing services to Kisumu County Hospital (KCH) primary care outpatient clinic (~10,000
      patients/month) to conduct a randomized trial of IPT versus fluoxetine for MDD and/or PTSD.
      Local non-specialists will be trained in mental health care for the SMART and hired through
      the Kenyan Ministry of Health to work at KCH. SMART participants will be randomized to: (1)
      first line treatment with IPT or fluoxetine; (2) second line treatment for non-remittersâ€”
      treatment &quot;switch&quot; (e.g., IPT to fluoxetine) or treatment &quot;combination&quot; (e.g., addition of
      IPT to fluoxetine). Research with mental health specialists in high income countries suggests
      that antidepressants and psychotherapy have equivalent short-term efficacy and that
      psychotherapy yields superior long-term relapse prevention. We will test the role of
      previously identified mechanisms in mediating remission and key moderators of treatment
      effect. Results of moderator and Q learning analyses will produce first and second-line
      non-specialist treatment algorithms.

    <description>IPT was developed in the 1980s by Gerald Klerman and Myrna Weissman to address interpersonal issues in depression. IPT is now considered evidence-based, first-line treatment for depression. IPT improves symptoms by addressing problems in social relationships. IPT is traditionally delivered as weekly one-hour sessions over 12 weeks, focused on one interpersonal problem area.</description>

    <ipd_description>NIMH Data Archive The National Institutes of Health (NIH) and NIMH have developed a federation of data repositories called the NIMH Data Archive (NDA) to store the collection of data from participants in research studies related to mental health, regardless of the source of funding. The extensive information collected by these studies, and subsequently stored in the National Database for Autism Research (NDAR), the NIH Pediatric MRI Repository (PedsMRI), the National Database for Clinical Trials Related to Mental Illness (NDCT), and the Research Domain Criteria Database (RDoCdb) provides a rare and valuable scientific resource. The NIH and the NIMH seek to encourage the use of these resources to achieve rapid scientific progress. In order to take full advantage of such resources and maximize their research value, it is important that data be made available, on appropriate terms and conditions, to the largest possible number of qualified investigators in a timely manner.</ipd_description>
