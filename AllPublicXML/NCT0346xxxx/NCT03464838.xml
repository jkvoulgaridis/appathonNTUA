  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gambling disorder is associated to high impulsivity and excessive risk-taking behaviour.
      These behavioural characteristics related to addiction are linked to cognitive processes in
      specific brain areas located in the prefrontal cortex (PFC).

      With the aim of studying the role of PFC in gambling disorder, the investigators employ
      transcranial current direct stimulation (tDCS), a noninvasive brain stimulation technique
      that applies a very weak electrical current to the superficial areas of the brain.

      The clinical phase of the research consists on studying the effects of tDCS in combination
      with cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) in patients that attend the United Kingdom (UK)
      National Problem Gambling Clinic. The main objective of the project is to investigate whether
      the combination of tDCS and CBT can help to decrease impulsivity and risk-taking behaviour
      and therefore improve the treatment for gambling disorder.

      The investigators aim to have a total of 32 participants diagnosed with gambling disorder
      with the Problem Gambling Severity Index (PGSI). There will be 16 participants per group
      having two different groups (real stimulation and sham). Real stimulation involves the
      application of tDCS stimulation and sham condition is used as a control (similar to a
      placebo).

      Participants will attend 8 weekly sessions where they receive tDCS stimulation for 20
      minutes, while complete CANTAB cognitive tasks that measure cognitive processes such us
      control inhibition and risk-taking behaviour. Electroencephalography (EEG) activity will be
      measured before and after tDCS.

      Participants will also complete cognitive questionnaires (Pathological Gambling adapted
      Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (PG-YBOCS), Gambling Symptom Assessment Scale (G-SAS)
      and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) for gambling cravings.

    <time_frame>Change from baseline PG-YBOCS scores at week 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8</time_frame>
    <description>It is a 10-item questionnaire that measures the gambling severity. The scores range from 0 to 4 in each question and the total score ranges from 0 to 40. The questions 1 to 5 assess urges and thoughts associated with gambling disorder, and the rest assess the behavioral component of the disorder. The total score will be calculated as well as the separate scores. Gambling severity will be higher with higher PG-YBOCS scores.</description>

    <measure>Change in scores on the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline VAS scores at week 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8</time_frame>
    <description>It is a horizontal line which length is 100 mm where the left side corresponds to the lower scores and the right side to the highest scores (it ranges from 0 to 10). The participant will draw a line where the level best represents their gambling cravings at the current time. The score will be calculated by measuring this line (in millimetres). The gambling cravings will be higher with higher VAS scores.</description>

    <measure>Change in scores on the Gambling Symptom Assessment Scale (G-SAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline G-SAS scores at week 8</time_frame>
    <description>It is a 12-item scale to measure gambling symptoms. Each of the 12 questions has a score ranging from 0 to 4 based on the last week. It is useful to measure changes during treatment. The total score ranges from 0 to 48. The symptoms severity will be higher with higher G-SAS scores.</description>
