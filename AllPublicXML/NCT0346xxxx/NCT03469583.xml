    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, single-center, open-label, three subsequent dosing periods study to
      evaluate the drug-drug-interaction (DDI), pharmaco-kinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD),
      safety, and tolerability of a single dose of EYP100a combined with ETV in healthy men and
      women dosed in the morning under fasted conditions.

    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, single-center, open-label, three consecutive dosing periods study to
      evaluate the drug-drug interaction, PK, safety, tolerability and PD of a single dose of
      EYP100a combined with ETV in healthy men and women. Sixteen (16) adult male and female
      healthy participants 18 to 60 years of age inclusive are planned to participate in the study.
      Women of childbearing potential will be eligible to participate if she is non pregnant or non
      lactating and willing to use adequate contraception.

      All participants in the study will be monitored for safety after administration of the last
      dose of investigational product and with a follow up visit. The DDI, PK, PD, safety and
      tolerability of EYP001a and ETV will be assessed based on plasma-concentration profiles of
      EYP001a and ETV, FXR related PD markers and the types and frequency of treatment-emergent
      adverse events (TEAEs) reported, concomitant medication usage, and changes from baseline in
      physical examination (PE), vital signs, electrocardiogram (ECG), and standard clinical
      laboratory tests.
