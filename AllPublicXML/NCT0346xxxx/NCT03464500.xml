    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study enrolling 90 healthy,
      overweight, middle aged subjects (30 placebo, 30 low dose and 30 high dose AMAZ-02
      intervention), 40-65 years of age, who are otherwise healthy. AMAZ-02, a food derived
      ingredient, will be given as a daily oral dose for 4 months.
