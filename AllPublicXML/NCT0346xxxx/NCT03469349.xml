      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of actovegin in participants
      with peripheral arterial disease (PAD) Fontaine Stage IIB.

      The study will enroll approximately 366 participants. Participants will be randomly assigned
      to one of the two treatment groups in 1:1 ratio:

        1. Actovegin

        2. Placebo (dummy inactive substance) - this is a tablet/intravenous infusion that looks
           like the study drug but has no active ingredient

      All participants will be asked to take intravenous infusion for 2 weeks followed by oral
      tablets for 10 weeks.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted Russia, Georgia, and Kazakhstan. The overall time
      to participate in this study is 25 to 26 weeks. Participants will make multiple visits to the
      clinic, and 12 weeks after last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.

    <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 2, 12 and 24</time_frame>
    <description>ACD will be assessed using treadmill testing. ACD is the distance at which claudication pain becomes so severe that the participant is forced to stop, also known as maximal walking distance.</description>

    <description>Rest pain is defined as a continuous burning pain, that begins, or is aggravated, after reclining or elevating the limb and is relieved by sitting or standing.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in 36-Item Short Form Survey (SF-36) at Weeks 12 and 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 12 and 24</time_frame>
    <description>SF-36 participant-reported measure of health-related quality of life. It consists of 8 sections: vitality, physical functioning, bodily pain, general health perceptions, physical role functioning, emotional role functioning, social role functioning, and mental health, that are the weighted sums of the questions in each health domain. Each scale is directly transformed to a 0 to 100 scale on the assumption that each question carries equal weight. The lower the score, the more disability, and the higher the score, the less disability, that is, a score of zero is equivalent to maximum disability and a score of 100 is equivalent to no disability.</description>
