      The goal of this compassionate use program is to provide a mechanism to supply Cabotegravir,
      CAB on an individual named patient basis for treatment of individuals who have no available
      treatment alternatives and/or limited treatment options (e.g., who are unable to participate
      in the Phase III clinical studies or do not qualify), and are in need of new drugs to
      construct an effective antiviral regimen and may require the use of parenterally administered
      drug given underlying medical conditions. You can access ViiV's Policy on Compassionate via
      https://us.viivhealthcare.com/media/124424/viivs-external-policy-on-cup_final-version_23feb20

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  HIV-infected patients will be eligible for treatment if ALL the following apply:

               -  Male or female patients aged ≥ 18 yrs

        NOTE: all female patients of reproductive potential should use every precaution to prevent
        pregnancy including either complete abstinence from intercourse from 2 weeks prior to
        administration of CAB, throughout receipt of CAB and for at least 52 weeks after
        discontinuation of CAB LA; or use of one of the following methods of highly reliable
        contraception:

          1. Contraceptive subdermal implant

          2. Intrauterine device or intrauterine system

          3. Combined estrogen and progestogen oral contraceptive

          4. Injectable progestogen

          5. Contraceptive vaginal ring

          6. Percutaneous contraceptive patches

          7. Male partner sterilisation with documentation of azoospermia prior to the female
             subject's entry into the study, and this male is the sole partner for that subject.
             The documentation on male sterility can come from the site personnel's: review of
             subject's medical records, medical examination and/or semen analysis, or medical
             history interview provided by her or her partner.

        These allowed methods of contraception are only effective when used consistently/correctly
        and in accordance with the product label. The investigator is responsible for ensuring that
        patients understand how to properly use these methods of contraception.

          -  Inability to construct a viable antiviral treatment regimen with commercially
             available medications;

          -  Demonstrated need for a long acting, injectable antiretroviral including, but not
             limited to malabsorption or inability to achieve adequate drug levels via oral route.
             NOTE: Poor/incomplete adherence to oral meds is not a sufficient rationale for
             inclusion.

          -  The patient/legal guardian or representative has given informed consent to treatment
             prior to administering CAB (in a manner consistent with all national requirements).
             The patient/legal guardian or representative has also given informed consent for the
             transmission of a copy of the anonymized adverse and serious adverse event (SAE) and
             pregnancy reports (in compliance with local regulatory authority requirements) to GSK
             and ViiV where allowable by local regulations, and to the country regulatory authority
             as required.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients will not be eligible for treatment if ANY of the following apply:

               -  Patient has estimated creatinine clearance &lt;50 mL/min via Cockcroft-Gault method;

               -  Females who are pregnant or women who are breastfeeding, or plan to become
                  pregnant or breastfeed during treatment.

               -  Patients who have had known or suspected allergic reaction or hypersensitivity
                  reactions to integrase inhibitors;

               -  Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &gt;5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN)

               -  ALT ≥ 3 times ULN and bilirubin ≥ 1.5 times ULN (with &gt; 35% direct bilirubin)

               -  Evidence for moderate to severe hepatic impairment, grade 3-4 liver fibrosis, or
                  cirrhosis

               -  Patients who are eligible for actively enrolling clinical trials involving CAB.

               -  Significant coagulopathy precluding chronic IM dosing

        NOTE: Patients should not be treated via the named patient/compassionate use program if
        they are eligible and/or able to participate in any of the Phase III clinical trials of CAB
        and the patient is suitable for participation in such clinical trials. In that instance
        (assuming consent is obtained) the patient should preferentially be enrolled into the
        ongoing clinical trial to allow detailed data collection. In accordance with national
        requirements patients should not be treated in the named patient/compassionate use program
        if they have responded to previous treatment with CAB in another clinical trial without
        review and prior approval by the VSLC.
