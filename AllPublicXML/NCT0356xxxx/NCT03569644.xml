    <textblock>
      This qualitative interview-based study aim to build a tool to assess quality of life in
      patients (adults or children) suffering from 6 autoinflammatory diseases (FMF, TRAPS, CAPS,
      MKD, Still and PFAPA).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recent understanding of the physiopathological mechanisms that underpin autoinflammatory
      diseases (AIDs) allowed a revolution in the therapeutic management of these patients,
      particularly through the use of biotherapies. However new treatments need to be evaluated by
      valid tools. AIDAI score created and validated by our team evaluates activity of 4
      autoinflammatory diseases. One of the important components, not explored by the scores
      currently available, is the impact of these treatments on quality of life (QoL) of patients.
      The existing quality of life scales are not adapted to these recurrent chronic pathologies.
      Throught a qualitative study based on interviews of patients and/ or parents, the
      investigators aim to build a tool to evaluate QoL in patients suffering from 6 aAIDs
      :familial Mediterranean fever (FMF), mevalonate kinase deficiency (MKD), tumour necrosis
      factor receptor-associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS), cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes
      (CAPS), Still's disease and PFAPA syndrome.

The consultation for this research is 45 to 90 minutes long. This prolongs their presence in consultation with the doctor.
