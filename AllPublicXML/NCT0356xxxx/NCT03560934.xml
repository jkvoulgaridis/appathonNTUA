    <textblock>
      The investigators plan to test the effects of 10-60 mg dronabinol (oral THC) on subjective
      (surveys) and objective (polysomnographically scored (PSG)) sleep in non-frequent and
      frequent cannabis users following an acclimation and baseline night of sleep. The mornings
      after baseline sleep and dronabinol administration, cognitive performance will also be
      measured and participants may also perform morning typical behaviors such as change in
      posture (getting out of bed/tilt test) and mild intensity physical activity. This pilot study
      is in healthy young adults without a history of chronic disease.

    <time_frame>Over the 3-night stay.</time_frame>
    <description>Blood pressure (BP) will be measured every 30 min during wake and every 15 minutes during sleep. Beat-by-beat (BP) will be measured during sleep using a non-invasive device employing the volume-clamp method with hydrostatic correction (BMeye Nexfin or AD Instruments NIBP). Additionally an automated calibrated sphygmomanometer will be used to record sporadic BP at intervals during an exercise challenge.</description>

    <measure>Heart Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Over the 3-night stay.</time_frame>
    <description>For the duration of the study, 2 channels of EKG are recorded (RA-V6) and stored at a sample frequency of 256 Hz. This software will be used for peak detection (R-wave detection and subsequent heart rate variability (HRV) analysis to estimate cardiac vagal tone).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Subjective measures of sleepiness/alertness</measure>
    <time_frame>Over the 3-night stay.</time_frame>
    <description>Subjective sleepiness and alertness will be measured regularly (~1/h) across wake periods during the study protocol using the Stanford Sleepiness Scale. The scale measures subjective sleepiness on a 1-5 point Likert scale with 5 indicating the highest degree of sleepiness and 1 indicating the lowest degree of sleepiness.</description>

    <description>Subjects categorized as frequent cannabis users (&gt;3x/week for 3 months) will receive a single dose of 10-60mg dronabinol on the second or third night of their stay in the clinical laboratory, one hour prior to bedtime and five minutes after completion of a study snack. The other night, participants will receive a placebo.
Dronabinol is an orally active, synthetic THC currently indicated for weight loss in patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) or anorexia and for nausea and vomiting associated with cancer. Dronabinol is nearly absorbed (90%-95%) after a single oral dose of the capsule formulation with 10-20% of the administered dose researching the systemic circulation due to extensive first-pass hepatic metabolism and high lipid solubility. The onset of action is ~30 to 60 minutes with peak effects from 2-4-h following dose (Fig. 2) (34). The 10-60mg of dronabinol will be administered by OHSU's research pharmacy services.</description>
