        <title>Number of Participants With Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) and Serious TEAEs</title>
        <description>An Adverse event (AE) was defined as any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease associated with the use of study drug, whether or not considered related to the study drug or worsening of pre-existing medical condition, whether or not related to study drug. A serious adverse event (SAE) was an AE that resulted in any of the following outcomes: death; life threatening; persistent/significant disability/incapacity; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; congenital anomaly/birth defect or was otherwise considered medically important. An AE was considered as 'treatment emergent' if it occurred after the first drug administration of each period or if it was present prior to drug administration but exacerbated after the drug administration. TEAEs included both Serious TEAEs and non-serious TEAEs.</description>
