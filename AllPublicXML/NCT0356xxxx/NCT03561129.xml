  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Several studies had analyzed the correlation between embryo transfer operator experience and
      implantation, clinical pregnancy, abortion and delivery rate.

      The aim of the present study is determining if the probabilities of embryo implantation and
      pregnancy are associated to the operator performing the embryo transfer.

      This study allows following more than 30 different operators in a global period of 20 years
      with almost 20,000 procedures.

      Several studies had analyzed the correlation between embryo transfer operator experience and
      implantation, clinical pregnancy, abortion and delivery rate. Until now, the evidences are
      mixed and inconclusive.

      The aim of the present study is determining if the probabilities of embryo implantation and
      pregnancy are associated to the operator performing the embryo transfer.

      The database includes all the fresh embryo transfers, performed between January 1997 and
      December 2016 at Humanitas Fertility Center after IVF-ICSI cycles. Only embryo transfers
      performed by the surgeon on duty for that day (&quot;Gynecologist of the Day&quot;) will be included.

      Secondary end point is to evaluate if it is possible to draw a learning curve for transfer in
      terms of pregnancies for the different surgeons.

      The strength of this study relies on the completeness of the preoperative factors and follow
      up and on the vastest dataset in literature that can permit to correct for multiple
      confounders and analyze a wide group of outcomes.

        The study database includes all the fresh embryo transfers, performed between January 1997
        and December 2016 at Humanitas Fertility Center after IVF-ICSI cycles. Only embryo
        transfers performed by the surgeon on duty for that day (&quot;Gynecologist of the Day&quot;) will be
        included. A wider similar database was used for a previous research.

        Data are collected using an exclusive internal web-based database.
