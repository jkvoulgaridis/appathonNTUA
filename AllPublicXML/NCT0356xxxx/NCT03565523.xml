  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dietary nitrate (NO3-) supplementation has been shown to improve skeletal muscle
      contractility and fatigue resistance, particularly in fast-twitch (type II) muscle fibers.
      Furthermore, NO3- supplementation has been shown to speed reaction time. Taken together,
      these findings suggest that NO3- ingestion may be ergogenic during all-out sprint running and
      reactive agility tasks. Moreover, increasing muscle force production at high contraction
      speeds would be expected to translate into improved muscle power and, subsequently, improved
      performance in very explosive forms of exercise, such as vertical jumping. Therefore, the
      purpose of this investigation is to assess the effect of short term (5 days) NO3-
      supplementation on linear running sprint performance, reactive agility and vertical jump
      performance in a rested and fatigued state.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male and female participants in self-reported good general health as assessed by the
             standard procedures described below and specifically meeting normal blood pressure
             range (systolic: 100-135, diastolic: 60-90) and body mass index (BMI) range
             (16.0-29.9)

          2. Range of 18-45 years of age

          3. Participants must participate in an intermittent exercise based sport (e.g. soccer,
             rugby, hockey), at a competitive level (i.e. competes in officiated matches/games).

          4. Understanding of the procedures to be undertaken as part of the study

          5. Willingness to participate in exercise testing and follow supplementation guidelines
             and other instructions provided by the experimenter

          6. Informed, voluntary, written consent to participate in the study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Known pulmonary, cardiovascular or metabolic disease

          2. Food allergies including phenylketonurea (PKU)

          3. Current regular use of any dietary supplement (excluding macronutrient based
             supplements) or previous use of any dietary supplement in the past 6 months that is
             known to have a lasting effect.

          4. Blood donation within 3 months prior to the start of the study

          5. Substance abuse within 2 years of the start of the study

          6. Smoking

          7. Any prescription and non-prescription medication which may impact saliva production
             (antidepressants, diuretics, analgesics, antihistamines, anti-hyper/hypo-tensives,
             anti-anxiety, appetite suppressants).

          8. Current or previous use of phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) inhibitors.

          9. Participation in another clinical trial within past 4 weeks.
