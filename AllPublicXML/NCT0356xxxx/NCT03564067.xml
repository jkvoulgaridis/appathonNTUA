  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label pilot feasibility study that will recruit 15 participants. The purpose
      of the pilot study will be to evaluate the feasibility of open label Transcranial direct
      current stimulation (tDCS) in combination with computerized cognitive behavior therapy (cCBT)
      to maintain wellness following an acute course of Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) for up to 6
      months.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Home-based tDCS-cCBT will involve 30-min tDCS (3 days per week) for the first 3 months and
      once weekly for the subsequent 3 months, in combination with computerized CBT delivered
      through an online portal for the duration of tDCS each day. Subjects who miss 4 consecutive
      treatment days or 20 percent of total treatments will be excluded from the study as it is our
      intention to encourage compliance with the proposed treatments to maintain optimal wellness.
      All missed treatment days will be recorded in a log for each participant.

      Aim 1. To investigate the effectiveness of maintenance tDCS-cCBT for patients with MDD who
      have responded to a successful acute course of ECT.

      Hypothesis 1. tDCS-cCBT will effectively maintain treatment response in MDD in a manner that
      is non-inferior to that of maintenance ECT.

    <description>Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (24-item version)
This scale is used to quantify the severity of symptoms of depression
Scale range: 0-76 (total score)
Lower scores indicate lower severity of depressive symptoms (i.e., better outcome)
Higher scores indicate higher severity of depressive symptoms (i.e., worse outcome)</description>

    <description>After baseline assessments are complete, participants will be provided with a tDCS device (Soterix Medical tDCS mini-Clinical Trials system (mini-CT)), which is deactivated until a code is provided by the research staff. Each tDCS session will be delivered in combination with a computerized CBT module and participants will progress through the computerized CBT course (Beacon Therapist-Assisted-Internet-Delivered CBT) over the 6 months of treatment at their own pace.</description>

    <description>Participants are provided with an activation code. This code will unlock a single session with the pre-set 30 minute duration and intensity (direct current 2mA, current density 0.80A/m2, with anode over the left and cathode over the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, respectively). Home-based tDCS will involve 30-min tDCS (3 days per week) for the first 3 months and once weekly for the subsequent 3 months.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. History of Major Depressive Disorder with most recent episode treated with acute ECT
             at the Temerty Centre for Therapeutic Brain Intervention, CAMH.

          2. Individuals capable to provide consent who are receiving care as outpatients, and are
             now remitters (defined by the 24-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD-24) â‰¤
             10).

          3. Age 18-85, inclusive.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. History of a DSM-IV substance use disorder within the past three months

          2. Concomitant major unstable medical illness

          3. Pregnancy or the intention to become pregnant during the study

          4. DSM-IV diagnosis of any psychotic disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, or
             post-traumatic stress disorder (current or within the last year) as confirmed by the
             Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI)

             chorea, multiple sclerosis, head trauma with loss of consciousness for greater than or
             equal to five minutes)

          8. Presenting with a medical condition, a medication, or a laboratory abnormality that
             could cause a major depressive episode or significant cognitive impairment in the
             opinion of the investigator (e.g., hypothyroidism with low TSH, Cushing's disease)

         11. Requiring a benzodiazepine with a dose equivalent to lorazepam 2 mg/day or higher or
             any anticonvulsant due to the potential of these medications to limit the efficacy of
             ECT

         12. The inability to communicate in spoken and written English fluently enough to complete
             the neuropsychological tests due to a language barrier or a non-correctable clinically
             significant sensory impairment (i.e., cannot hear or see well enough to complete the

         13. Cognitive impairment or physical impairment such that they are unable to learn to, or
             physically unable to apply tDCS to their scalp without assistance (after training).
