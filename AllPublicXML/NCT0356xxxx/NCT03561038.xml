  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a randomized controlled trial of all the patients referred to University of
      Arkansas Medical for Medical Sciences (UAMS) for endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) guided biopsy of
      solid mass lesions. EUS guided tissue acquisition will be performed in all these patients
      using both needle types (22-gauge Franseen Fine Needle Biopsy (FNB) (Acquire, Boston
      Scientific Corporation, Natick, Mass) and 22-gauge Fork-tip FNB needle (SharkCore,
      Medtronic)) with randomization of the order in which the needle will be used.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All procedures will be performed by the advance endoscopists Dr Sumant Inamdar (SI) and Dr
      Benjamin Tharian (BT) using a linear array echoendoscope (Olympus UCT180, Olympus America
      Corp, Center Valley, Pa) with patients in the left lateral decubitus position after
      administration of anesthesia (propofol or general anesthesia). During EUS, the mass will
      first be punctured using either needle based on the randomization assignment. Tissue
      acquisition will be performed using the fanning maneuver (4 strokes at 4 different locations
      within the mass). After performing 2 dedicated passes for cell block for histological
      analysis using the randomized needle, 2 additional passes will be made for cell block with
      the alternate needle. Sample obtained from each pass is placed into a separate container to
      be analysed separately. The occurrence of immediate adverse events will be noted at the time
      of procedure, and late adverse events will be documented by follow-up telephone calls at 1
      week post-procedure
