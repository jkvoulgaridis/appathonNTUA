  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The insertion of peripheral vascular catheters (PVCs) is the most often invasive procedure
      performed in hospital settings. During hospitalization, the majority of patients need to have
      a PVC inserted. These devices are not risk-free, affecting patients' safety and well-being.
      In clinical settings, health professionals must deal with difficult venous accesses due to
      the patient's age, physical characteristics, clinical status, and medication, which hinder
      the PVC insertion. When veins are not visible or palpable, this may lead to successive
      puncture attempts, causing pain to the patient and discomfort to the nurse, which results in
      increased costs.

      Guidelines state that puncture should be attempted only twice per professional, to a maximum
      of four attempts; against this recommendation and due to the patient's therapeutic needs and
      clinical situation, health professionals attempt to puncture multiple times in a single
      scenario. In this regard, health professionals should consider using specific technologies
      that help to select the vein and reduce the number of puncture attempts and catheter-related
      mechanical complications. Taking into account the multiplicity of existing technologies in
      the international market that assist health professionals in peripheral venous
      catheterization, ultrasound and infrared devices emerge in the literature as two of the most
      commonly used during this procedure.

      These technologies were developed with the purpose of improving peripheral intravenous
      catheterization success rate and thus reducing the number and extent of the negative effects
      of multiple or unsuccessful attempts, with the additional purpose of avoiding the
      frustrations of health professionals in these scenarios. However, such technologies are still
      underused in clinical practice, since health professionals are not familiar with the use of
      these devices. Moreover, the costs associated with their purchase and maintenance may be
      considered as excessive in relation to the traditional method.

      The project investigators aim to determine whether the use of either ultrasound or
      near-infrared vascular imaging will significantly improve the success rate of peripheral
      intravenous catheterization in adults on first attempt by nurses compared with the standard
      approach, reduce immediate related complications and improve patient and provider
      satisfaction.

    <description>The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) is a commonly used measure of trait and state anxiety (Spielberger, Gorsuch, Lushene, Vagg, &amp; Jacobs, 1983). It can be used in clinical settings to diagnose anxiety. Form Y, its most popular version, has 20 items for assessing trait anxiety and 20 for state anxiety. All items are rated on a 4-point scale (e.g., from &quot;Almost Never&quot; to &quot;Almost Always&quot;). Higher scores indicate greater anxiety. The STAI is appropriate for those who have at least a sixth-grade reading level.</description>

    <description>Near-infrared imaging devices project near-infrared light onto the skin, which is absorbed by deoxygenated hemoglobin. The invisible image of the underlying vascular pattern is captured by the device, processed and projected, in real time, back onto the patient's skin using visible green light.
