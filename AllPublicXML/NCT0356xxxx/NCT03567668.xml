  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Congenital mitral insufficiency is one of the most common valvular diseases in the pediatric
      population worldwide, carrying a high morbidity and mortality risk if not treated immediately
      and properly. Given that mitral replacement likely increased risk of cardiac dysfunction and
      mitral reoperation, mitral repair is the currently preferred surgical strategy in the
      majority of pediatric patients with mitral insufficiency. Unfortunately, previous evidences
      demonstrated the long-term hemodynamic alteration in response to significant mitral
      regurgitant might lead to a reversible or irreversible pulmonary vascular remodeling
      regardless of concomitant other cardiac malformations, which is associated with increased
      risk of morbidity and mortality following the surgery. Currently available researches mainly
      focused the association of pulmonary vascular pressures with risk of mortality and morbidity
      on adult rheumatic or degenerative mitral insufficiency; however, knowledge is still lacking
      regarding pediatric population with congenital mitral insufficiency. The investigator wil
      assess the relationship between baseline sPAP and risk of operative morbidity and mortality.

    <description>Commissural plication was the most commonly used technique to repair mitral insufficiency, which was selectively supplemented by a specific combination of one or more of the following procedures: cleft closure, chordal shortening, transposition or replacement, edge-to-edge repair, leaflet augmentation, or division of papillary muscles, depending on the individual etiology and anatomy.</description>
