  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The new American Heart Association (AHA) blood pressure guidelines are expected to raise the
      prevalence of high blood pressure to ~46% in the United States. One recommendation for
      lowering blood pressure is aerobic exercise, which produces a period of lowered blood
      pressure (post-exercise hypotension; PEH) that lasts up to 24 hours. It is believed that PEH
      may be responsible for the observations of lowered blood pressure following initiation of
      exercise. However, most Americans eat too much salt, which expands plasma volume and may
      prevent PEH, rending aerobic exercise ineffective in improving blood pressure status.

    <textblock>
      Recently released blood pressure guidelines from the American Heart Association and American
      College of Cardiology are expected to raise the prevalence of hypertension in America from
      ~33% to ~46%. A single bout of aerobic exercise produces a prolonged period (up to 24 hours)
      of lowered blood pressure (post-exercise hypotension; PEH). Repeated bouts of aerobic
      exercise results in maintenance of lowered blood pressure, leading to recommendations of
      aerobic exercise for improvement of blood pressure status. However, more than 90% of
      Americans consume more sodium in their diets than is recommended. This is alarming, as excess
      dietary sodium intake expands plasma fluid volume, which may in turn attenuate the reduction
      in BP following exercise. Therefore, the objective of this project is to determine the
      effects of high dietary sodium intake on PEH. The investigators hypothesize that, compared to
      a recommended sodium diet, a high salt diet will attenuate post-exercise hypotension.

    <description>For 10 days each, participants will be asked to eat a recommended sodium diets (2300 mg Na+/d) while taking unmarked pills containing uniodized table salt. On the 10th day, participants will report to the lab to complete 60 minutes of cycling exercise. Following exercise, participants will rest for 60 minutes while undergoing serial blood pressure measurements. Participants will then be outfitted with ambulatory blood pressure cuffs for assessment of blood pressure over the following 24 hours.</description>

    <description>For 10 days each, participants will be asked to eat a recommended sodium diets (2300 mg Na+/d) while taking unmarked pills containing a placebo (dextrose). Participants will complete both interventions in random order. On the 10th day, participants will report to the lab to complete 60 minutes of cycling exercise. Following exercise, participants will rest for 60 minutes while undergoing serial blood pressure measurements. Participants will then be outfitted with ambulatory blood pressure cuffs for assessment of blood pressure over the following 24 hours.</description>
