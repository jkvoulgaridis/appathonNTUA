    <textblock>
      This study aim to compare a new postural garment (Posture Plus Force ®) versus exercises in
      women with non specific cervical pain. The investigators focus on nurses and allied health
      professionals due to the importance of posture in work related musculoskeletal disorders.

      OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of a postural garment versus exercises in nurses with
      non-specific cervical pain.

      DESIGN: Randomized cross over clinical trial with a 3 months sequence treatment and a 3
      months washout period..

      PARTICIPANTS: Nurses and allied health professionals with cervical pain aged 21 to 55 years.

      INTERVENTIONS:

      Participants are allocated at random to receive interventions in two groups:

        -  P+ : a postural garment (Posture Plus Force - FGP srl ® - Italy) to be worn from 2 to 4
           hours per day, during 90 days.

        -  Ex: five physiotherapy sessions to learn stretching and strengthening exercises (20
           minutes) with instructions to continue at home on a daily basis for 90 days.

      The subjects in each group will be cross over after three months of wash out period.

      MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:

      The primary outcomes are postural control and pain intensity. Pictures on sagittal and
      frontal plane as well as measurements of static posturography with a scan (SpinalMouse ®) are
      conducted at T0 (pre-intervention), T1 immediately after garment fitting for P+ group and
      after the 5th session for Ex group, T30, T60 and T90 at day 30, day 60 and day 90 of
      follow-up. Pain is measured by visual analogue scale (VAS) on the same assessment days.

      STATISTICAL ANALYSIS:

      Statistical analysis is conducted following intention-to-treat principles, and the treatment
      effects calculated using linear mixed models.

    <description>Visual analogue scale is a psychometric measuring instrument designed to document cervical pain severity in individual subjects.

A 100-mm long horizontal line with verbal descriptors is used to grade the amount of pain that a patient feels from no pain (left 0 mm) to an extreme amount of pain (right 100 mm).</description>

    <description>SpinalMouse ® is a device that, combined with a computer program, assesses the curvatures of the spine without applying radiation. The device is guided manually on the skin along the spinous process apophysis from C7 to S3. The measuring head follows their contour in the sagittal plane and records clinically relevant data. A software program using an algorithm uses this information to calculate the angle of kyphosis and angle of lordosis. Data obtained have been proved to be reliable and accurate</description>

    <time_frame>Neck disability is assessed pre-intervention (Day 0)</time_frame>
    <description>Cervical pain-related disability will be assessed with the validated Spanish version of Neck Disability Index. The Neck Disability Index is a ten-item questionnaire based on the Oswestry Low Back Pain Index that assesses disability associated with neck pain and whiplash. There are four items that relate to subjective symptomatology (pain intensity, headache, concentration, sleeping) and six items that relate to activities of daily living (lifting, work, driving, recreation, personal care, reading). The questionnaire is self and administered requires only 5-10 minutes to complete. It is scored from 0 (no disability) to 50 (maximum disability). Each subject select from one of six potential responses for each item ranging from no disability (0) to total disability (5). The ten items are summed to gain the total score.</description>
