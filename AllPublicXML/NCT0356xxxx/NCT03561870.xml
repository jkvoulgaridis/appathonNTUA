  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent data demonstrate that in IDH-mutant gliomas, 2 hydroxy-glutarate production induces a
      homologous recombination defect that renders tumor cells exquisitely sensitive to
      poly(adenosine 5'-diphosphate-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors, including olaparib
      (Lynparza; AstraZeneca). The aim of this open-label phase 2 study is to evaluate the efficacy
      of olaparib in in recurrent IDH-mutant high grade gliomas based on 6 months progression-free
      survival.
