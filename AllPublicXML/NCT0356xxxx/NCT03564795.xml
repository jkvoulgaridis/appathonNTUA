    <textblock>
      A randomized, controlled, 30-subject, within-subject trial for examining the effectiveness of
      KeraStat Gel, as opposed to the institutional standard of care, silver sulfadiazine, in
      improving cosmesis of the healed wound.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study seeks to determine whether the use of KeraStat Gel as the primary dressing for
      partial thickness burns results in improved cosmesis of the healed wound, and results in less
      painful dressing changes, faster reepithelialization, and reduction in need for excision and
      grafting. The study will enroll 30 subjects. The study design is a randomized, controlled,
      within-subject trial to compare the effectiveness of KeraStat Gel vs. standard of care (SOC),
      silver sulfadiazine (SSD). Each of two distinct burns will be randomized to the use of
      KeraStat Gel or SOC. Patients will be seen weekly for the first month and then at months 3,
      6, and 12 post burn.

    <description>The degree of cosmetic improvement of the healed wound will be assessed by Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale (POSAS) at one year. This scale consists of two parts: a Patient Scale and an Observer Scale. Both scales contain six items that are scored numerically on a 10-point range, where a '10' indicates the 'worst possible' [e.g. itching or pigmentation] and a '1' indicates normal skin. The Patient Scale is summed to make a 'Total Patient Score&quot; ranging from 6 - 60. The Observer Scale is summed to make up a 'Total Observer Score' ranging from 6 - 60. The Total Patient Score and Total Observer Score can be summed into a Total POSAS Score ranging from 12 to 120.</description>

    <description>Subject will complete Visual Analog Pain Scale (VAS) before and after in-clinic dressing changes. The Visual Analog Scale is presented as a 100 mm horizontal line ranging from 'No Pain' (0 mm) to 'Worst Pain Imaginable' (100 mm). The patient will mark the line to represent his or her level of pain before and after dressing changes.</description>
