  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of the study is to assess the feasibility and acceptability of a
      Culturally-Tailored Cognitive Behavior intervention (CT-CB) for African American patients
      with uncontrolled Type 2 diabetes. After the baseline visit subjects will be randomly
      assigned to undergo a six session group-based or web-based behavioral intervention (CT-CB)
      program or to general education (usual care). The intervention duration is 12 weeks.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      African Americans are approximately twice as likely to be diagnosed with diabetes and to
      experience gaps in diabetes care compared to Whites. Lower health literacy and
      socio-economic, language, and communication barriers are all associated with disparities in
      diabetes care. The role of Behavioral theory is foundational in understanding behavior change
      among patients in the self-management of diabetes. Further culturally tailoring increases
      acceptance and effectiveness of diabetes self-management.

      The aim of this pilot study is to test the feasibility and acceptability of a culturally
      tailored, cognitive behavioral intervention (CT-CB) program using a group-based vs. a
      web-based format, and determine if it can improve diabetes self-management among African
      Americans compared with usual individual based care at the clinic. Forty-five African
      American patients with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes (HbA1C &gt; 8 %), aged &gt; 18 years, will be
      randomly assigned to undergo a six session group-based or web-based behavioral intervention
      (CT-CB) program or to general education (usual care). After 12 weeks, patients will be
      followed for an additional three months to evaluate for diminution of treatment effects. Both
      the group -based and the web-based CBT intervention group will be followed for an additional
      three months to study for possible diminution of treatment effects over time.

      Diabetic measures like Hemoglobin (HbA1C) at baseline vs. 3 months; the Patient Health
      Questionnaire to assess depressive symptoms; Diabetes Distress Scale, anxiety, self-efficacy,
      quality of life (SF-12), Diabetes Health Belief Scale, process measures such as Patient
      Activation Measure (PAM-13), medication adherence questionnaire, session-participation,
      glucose self-monitoring, diet and physical activity are measured at each visit pre and post
      intervention. Trained study staff will also conduct neuropsychological tests including
      language and memory tests, attention and executive function tests, clinical diagnosis,
      activities of daily living (ADL).

    <masking_description>Research staff conducting the psychological, physical, outcome assessments, and study analyses will be blinded to participant's group allocation. To minimize bias, participants in the intervention group will be asked to refrain from disclosing their group assignment to study staff who collect data and questionnaires. Due to the overt nature of the CT-CB approach, the investigators and participants in the intervention group will not be blinded.</masking_description>

    <description>Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1C) in % will be measured via blood draw and processing. Normal values HbA1C are less than 5.7%, values between 5.7% and 6.4% indicate pre-diabetes, and persons with levels of 6.5% or higher are considered to have diabetes.</description>

    <measure>Change in Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 3 months post randomization</time_frame>
    <description>Depressive symptoms are assessed by the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). The PHQ-9 is a 9-item scale where respondents indicate how much they are bothered by certain problems on a 4-point scale where 0 = not at all and 3 = nearly every day. Total scores range from 0 to 27 with degree of depression considered minimal for scores between 0-4, mild for scores of 5-9, moderate for scores of 10-14, moderate to severe for scores 15-19, and severe for scores of 20-27.</description>

    <measure>Change in Diabetes Distress Scale (DDS17) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 3 months post randomization</time_frame>
    <description>The Diabetes Distress Scale (DDS17) is a 17-item questionnaire assessing the severity of problems of living with diabetes. Participants indicate the degree to which each item impacts their life on a 6-point scale where 1 = not a problem and 6 = a very serious problem. The scores are summed and divided by 17 to generate an average score that can range from 1 to 6. Scores of 3 or more are considered high distress.</description>

    <measure>Change in 12-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-12) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 3 months post randomization</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of life will be assessed with the 12-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-12). The Short Form-12 Health Survey Questionnaire (SF-12) is a measure of general physical and mental health. The SF-12 consists of 12 items with a Likert-type response format that measures quality of life with a Physical Component Summary (PCS) and Mental Component Summary (MCS). Subscales associated with the PCS include physical functioning, role limitations due to physical problems, bodily pain, and general health perceptions. Subscales associated with the MCS include vitality (energy and fatigue), social functioning, role limitations due to emotional problems, and mental health. A scoring algorithm is used to generate a total score for each component ranging from 0 to 100. Low values represent a poor health state while high values represent a good health state.</description>

    <measure>Change in Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item (GAD-7) Scale Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 3 months post randomization</time_frame>
    <description>Anxiety will be assessed using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item (GAD-7) Scale. Participants use a 4-point scale in response to statements about anxiety (such as &quot;trouble relaxing&quot;) to indicate how bothered they have felt by item over the last two weeks. Degree of anxiety is rated as 0 = &quot;not at all&quot; to 3 = &quot;nearly every day&quot;. Total scores range from 0 to 21. Scores of 5-9 indicate mild anxiety, 10-15 indicates moderate anxiety and scores 15 and greater indicate severe anxiety.</description>
