      To evaluate the efficacy of Daromun neoadjuvant treatment followed by surgery to improve in a
      statistically significant manner the recurrence-free survival (RFS) of Stage IIIB/C melanoma
      patients with respect to the standard of care (surgery alone).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The present study is an open-label, randomized, controlled, two-arm multi-center study of the
      efficacy of Daromun neoadjuvant intratumoral treatment followed by surgery versus surgery
      alone in clinical stage III B/C melanoma patients. 248 patients will be randomized in a 1:1
      ratio to receive Daromun treatment followed by surgery (Arm 1) or surgery alone (Arm 2).

      In both arms, follow-up for assessing RFS will be performed up to five years after
      randomization. Survival information will also be collected in the following year (up to six
      years in total after randomization).

      This is an open-label study and there is no blinding.

      Patients who successfully complete the screening evaluations and are eligible for
      participation in the study will be enrolled and randomly assigned (1:1) to two parallel
      treatment arms: Daromun and surgery (Arm 1) or surgery alone (Arm 2).

      To ensure a balance across treatment groups, stratified randomisation with permuted block
      will be used and separate randomization list for each subgroup (stratum) will be produced.
      Patients will be stratified on the basis of the following prognostic factors:

        -  Stage of disease (2 levels): Stage IIIB vs. Stage IIIC

        -  Planned post-surgical adjuvant therapy (4 levels): high-dose interferon-α2b, Ipilimumab,
           anti-PD-1and other adjuvant therapies.

      The primary objective of the study is to demonstrate that a neoadjuvant Daromun treatment
      followed by surgery improves in a statistically significant manner the recurrence-free
      survival (RFS) of Stage IIIB/C melanoma patients with respect to the standard of care
      (surgery alone).

      Primary endpoint of the study is RFS in a time-to-event analysis in the Daromun plus surgery
      treatment group (Arm 1) versus the surgery alone control group (Arm 2). Analysis will be
      based on the &quot;Intention To Treat&quot; population.

      The key secondary objective of the study is to demonstrate that a neoadjuvant Daromun
      treatment followed by surgery improves in a statistically significant manner the overall
      survival (OS) of patients with resectable Stage IIIB/ or C melanoma patients with respect to
      the standard of care (surgery alone).

             systems, bilateral tubal occlusion, vasectomized partner or sexual abstinence.
             Pregnancy test will be repeated at the safety visit (only WOCBP and only for patients
             in Arm 1).

         16. Male patients with WOCBP partners must agree to use simultaneously two acceptable
             methods of contraception (i.e. spermicidal gel plus condom) from the screening to
             three months following the last study drug administration.

         17. Evidence of a personally signed and dated informed consent document indicating that
             the subject has been informed of all pertinent aspects of the study.

         18. Willingness and ability to comply with the scheduled visits, treatment plan,
             laboratory tests and other study procedures.

             cell carcinoma, superficial bladder tumors (Ta, Tis &amp; T1), second primary melanoma in
             situ or any cancer curatively treated ≥ 5 years prior to study entry

          4. Concurrent disease, which, in the opinion of the investigator, would place the patient
             at undue risk or interfere with the study.

          5. History within the last year of acute or subacute coronary syndromes including
             myocardial infarction, unstable or severe stable angina pectoris.

          6. Inadequately controlled cardiac arrhythmias including atrial fibrillation

          7. Heart insufficiency (&gt; Grade II, New York Heart Association (NYHA) criteria)

          8. LVEF ≤ 50% and/or abnormalities observed during baseline ECG and Echocardiogram

         10. Ischemic peripheral vascular disease (Grade IIb-IV)

         11. Severe diabetic retinopathy

             weeks before enrollment

         19. Planned administration of growth factors or immunomodulatory agents within 7 days
             before enrollment

         20. Patient requires or is taking corticosteroids or other immunosuppressant drugs on a
             long-term basis. Limited use of corticosteroids to treat or prevent acute
             hypersensitivity reactions is not considered an exclusion criterion.

         21. Any conditions that in the opinion of the investigator could hamper compliance with
             the study protocol
