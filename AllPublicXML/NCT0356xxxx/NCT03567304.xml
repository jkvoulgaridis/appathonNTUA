  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People living with HIV in the era of antiretroviral therapy (ART) continue to suffer high
      rates of neurocognitive disorder. This is a randomized control trial aiming to evaluate
      improvement of neurocognitive function after switching efavirenz (EFV) to rilpivirine (RPV).
      EFV based regimen is currently the first line ART in Thailand. There are several reports
      suggested that HIV-infected patients who took EFV based regimen had poorer neurocognitive
      function compared to the comparator. RPV, another first line regimen, has been known to have
      less neuropsychiatric side effects. We hypothesized that switching EFV to RPV could improve
      neurocognitive function.

      People living with HIV (PLWH) in the era of antiretroviral therapy (ART) continue to suffer
      high rates of neurocognitive disorder. Previous report revealed that 36% of PLWH in Thailand
      had this condition. There are several reports suggested that HIV-infected patients who took
      efavirenz (EFV) based regimen had poorer neurocognitive function compared to the comparator.
      Rilpivirine (RPV), another first line regimen, has been known to have less neuropsychiatric
      side effects. We hypothesized that switching EFV to RPV could improve long term
      neurocognitive function.

      PLWH (20 years and older) who received EFV-based regimen for at least 1 years at Chiang Mai
      University Hospital will be invited to this study. Neurocognitive function will be evaluated
      using 3 screening questions, International HIV Dementia Scale, Montreal Cognitive Assessment,
      and comprehensive neurocognitive battery test evaluating 6 different cognitive domains. The
      participants will be categorized in to 4 groups based on their neurocognitive test results;
      no evidence of neurocognitive deficit, asymptomatic neurocognitive impairment (ANI), mild
      neurocognitive disease (MND), and HIV associated dementia (HAD) using Frascati's criteria.
      The participants with ANI or MND and meet the eligibility criteria will be enrolled to this
      study. The participants will be randomized in to 2 arms; continuing EFV-based regimen or
      switching to RPV-based regimen. Neurocognitive function will be evaluated at 6 and 12 months.
