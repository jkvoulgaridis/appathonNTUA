  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to assess at how differences in the microbiome
      (naturally occurring bacteria) of a baby may protect, or put a baby at risk, for allergic
      problems. The microbiome refers to the thousands of bacteria and molds that live in and on
      our bodies. The microbiome plays an important role in our health. Differences in the
      microbiome can affect our immune system in ways that might make some people more likely to
      get allergies and asthma.

      Early life events and exposures are very important for establishing the human microbiome. The
      newborn baby's microbiome changes very quickly during the first weeks and months of life.
      There is information that suggests C-section birth is associated with higher risk of certain
      diseases, including allergies and asthma. Some researchers think one reason for this is that
      passing through the mother's vaginal canal during birth exposes the baby to bacteria that
      promote healthy immune system development, something that C-section babies don't get.
      Transferring these potentially beneficial vaginal bacteria to C-section babies may help
      prevent some diseases later.

      This is a pilot study of 120 pregnant women and their infants conducted at hospitals in the
      Mount Sinai Health System in New York, NY. Eighty women will deliver via elective, unlabored
      C-section, and 40 will undergo spontaneous vaginal delivery. The 80 women undergoing
      C-section will be randomized in a masked (blinded) 1:1 fashion to have their neonates undergo
      vaginal seeding or placebo seeding immediately after birth (within 10 minutes) followed by
      standard care.The infants of the 40 women undergoing spontaneous vaginal delivery will
      receive usual standard care.

      All 120 pregnant women will have biospecimens collected to assess their vaginal, skin, gut,
      placental, breast milk, and oral microbiome. All infants will have biospecimens collected to
      assess their gut, skin, nasal, and oral microbiome, as well as blood to assess allergen
      sensitization and immune markers. Infants will be followed with at-home stool collections and
      questionnaires weekly for the first 4 weeks and at weeks 8, 26, and 39. An in-person study
      visit will occur at 13 weeks and 52 weeks, and the primary endpoint will be assessed at 52
      weeks. Study enrollment is projected to occur over 24 months.

    <intervention_model_description>This study will enroll pregnant women during the third trimester of pregnancy whose infants have a first-degree relative ( the mother, biological father, or full sibling) with atopic disease or food allergy.The study excludes women with a history of active atopic dermatitis within the past 5 years to avoid the potential transfer of vaginal microbiota to the infant that may predispose to atopic disease.Women undergoing elective, unlabored C-section will be randomized to have their infants undergo vaginal seeding or placebo seeding plus standard of care. Women and infants who undergo placebo seeding will serve as a control population.In addition, women and infants undergoing vaginal delivery will also be included as a second control group, in part to determine if vaginal seeding will decrease allergen sensitization rates to a level similar to vaginally delivered infants, and also to serve as a comparator group for gut microbiome development during the infant's first year of life.</intervention_model_description>
