  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if CBT-I (cognitive behavioral therapy for
      insomnia) is a feasible treatment for insomnia in individuals undergoing cancer treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a single arm feasibility trial in which all eligible participants
      receive five weekly sessions of CBT-I (cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia) delivered
      before or during their cancer treatments. CBT-I is a non-drug behavioral treatment for
      insomnia and is considered the most effective treatment for insomnia. However, CBT-I is not
      routinely offered to cancer patients due to unknowns about its feasibility in this
      population. Data will be obtained at pre- and post-CBT-I and at eight-week follow-up, and
      will focus on acceptability, implementation, and efficacy in order to assess feasibility. The
      study will focus on cancer patients who are diagnosed with gastro-intestinal (GI) cancer.
