      The aim of the study is to assess a new fetal surgery approach to repair open spina bifida.
      The fetal group hypothesis is to perform a minimally invasive procedure using a fetoscopic
      technique in order to access to amniotic cavity and make the endoscopic repair. This approach
      will allow investigators to make the closure of the defect and avoid the use of an
      hysterotomy, reducing the risk of maternal complications as uterine dehiscence (rupture),
      hemorrhage and preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM), the patient also will be able
      to have a vaginal delivery.

      Spina bifida can be a devastating neurological congenital anomaly . It results from
      incomplete middleline closure of the neural tube between 22 and 28 embryological days. Its
      incidence is approximately 1 per 1,000 / 2,000 births. It is considered the most common
      congenital anomaly of the central nervous system that is compatible with life, 90% of the
      defects are lumbar and sacral.

        1. The most frequent form is myelomeningocele (MMC), characterized by the extrusion of the
           spinal cord into a sac filled with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and is associated with
           lower limb paralysis and bowel and bladder neurological dysfunction.

        2. The majority of MMCs can be diagnosed between before 20 weeks. MMC is associated with
           Chiari II malformation, which includes a constellation of anomalies such as hindbrain
           herniation, brainstem abnormalities, low-lying venous sinuses and a small posterior
           fossa.The Chiari II malformation can have deleterious effects on motor, cranial nerve
           and cognitive functions. Postnatally most MMC patients develop hydrocephalus and require
           a ventriculoperitoneal shunt. Shunts require lifelong monitoring and have a high failure
           rate due to infection, obstruction, and fracture.

      Experimental studies using animal models have shown that prenatal coverage of a spina
      bifida-like lesion can preserve neurological function and reduce or reverse hindbrain
      herniation.These studies suggest a &quot;two-hit&quot; hypothesis in which the ultimate neurologic
      deficit results from a combination of the failure of normal neural-tube closure (first hit)
      with secondary spinal cord injury resulting from prolonged exposure of sensitive neural
      elements to the amniotic fluid (second hit mechanism).

      Based on this hypothesis, open fetal surgical repair of MMC was proposed, and the recent
      publication of the NICHD sponsored randomized controlled trial demonstrated clear neonatal
      benefit of open in-utero fetal surgical repair of MMC. The study showed a reduction in the
      incidence of hydrocephalus and in the radiographic severity of hindbrain herniation (relative
      risk: 0.67; 95% confidence interval: 0.56-0.81).

      Open in-utero fetal surgery is not without risk and the NICHD study (MOMS Trial) showed an
      elevation in maternal-fetal morbidity/risk when compared to the postnatally treated group,
      including higher risk for chorioamniotic separation (26% vs. 0%, respectively), maternal
      pulmonary edema (6% vs. 0%), oligohydramnios (21% vs. 0%), placental abruption (6% vs. 0%),
      spontaneous membrane rupture (46%; RR: 6.15; 95% CI: 2.75-13.78), spontaneous labor (38%; RR:
      2.80, 95%CI: 1.51-5.18), maternal blood transfusion (9%; RR: 7.18; 95%CI: 0.90-57.01), and
      preterm delivery before 34 weeks (46%; RR: 9.2; 95%CI: 3.81-22.19). The reason for the
      increased incidence of these complications is related to the nature of the open fetal
      procedure, which involves a multi-faceted invasive approach including maternal laparotomy,
      large hysterotomy with uterine edge stapling, and open fetal repair of the spina bifida
      defect that may involve manipulation and exposure of the fetus for a significant amount of
      time.

      Fetal endoscopic surgery has progressed rapidly over the past decades and the investigators
      are now able to perform a number of intricate procedures inside the uterus with specially
      designed instruments. These procedures include laser therapy for Twin-twin-transfusion
      syndrome, fetal cystoscopy and fulguration of posterior urethral valves, release of amniotic
      bands, and placement of various shunts and balloons inside fetal structures and cavities
      (peritoneal, pleural, cardiac, and trachea).

      Fetoscopy offers a less invasive therapeutic option that could reduce a number of the
      morbidities (both maternal and fetal) related to open fetal procedures.

      A few animal studies and some clinical human experience with fetoscopic repair of MMC have
      been reported showing the feasibility of covering the defect with a patch and sealant, or
      even in performing a full repair. These repairs have been accomplished using at least two
      (and sometimes more) entry ports through the uterine wall. Kohl et al. in Germany, have
      demonstrated the feasibility of performing a complete percutaneous fetoscopic repair of MMC
      using carbon dioxide to distend the uterus and provide a dry working area for the surgeon to
      perform the repair.

      These investigators described a two-layer covering technique using an absorbable patch
      (Durasis, Cook, Germany) and sutures. However, while they showed that the procedure is
      feasible, their percutaneous technique with complete two layer surgical closure of the defect
      using sutures was associated with prolonged operative time and significant maternal and
      obstetrical morbidities.

      Fetoscopy in a CO2 gas filled uterus has been recently reported by groups in Bonn, Germany
      (Kohl et al) and Sao Paulo, Brazil (Pedreira et al). The fetoscopic technique the
      investigators use has been developed and tested in a fetal sheep model of MMC by the
      investigators group and others (Peiro et al). This fetoscopy technique has now been employed
      by a group of investigators, in human fetal surgery cases in Houston, Texas, Monterrey México
      and in Shiraz, Iran showing its feasibility and applicability to the human uterus and fetus,
      and demonstrating an improved degree of flexibility in terms of access to the fetus
      regardless of placental location. The technique is designed to decrease the maternal risks of
      open uterus fetal surgery while maintaining a similar level of fetal benefit as seen in the
      MOMS trial.

      The investigators technique employs general deep anesthesia and an open abdomen/exteriorized
      (but closed) uterus methodology that allows the minimally invasive closure of the fetal
      neural tube using the same closed skin repair currently employed at another US centers using
      the open uterus approach. The technique employs a novel approach to low pressure uterine
      distention using the same carbon dioxide gas 8-12 mmHg that others attempting fetoscopic
      repair have used, but employing a much lower gas flow rate and pressure. In addition, this
      technique allows a significantly quicker neural tube repair because of improved access to the
      fetus, ability to manipulate the fetus into the required position, and superior port
      placement resulting from the exteriorized maternal uterus.

      The technique consist in a three access ports (10 French each) and these can be sutured into
      the uterus allowing a closed seal and minimizing gas leakage. Finally, a 2-3 mm Storz
      surgical sets enables a full surgical repair to be performed via a fetoscopic approach.

      There have been reports about sheep model, with dual access port fetoscopic neural tube
      closure using a 12 french cannula, a second 9 french cannula, a cover patch, and a medical
      sealant with similar results to that seen with open fetal surgical repair in the same sheep
      model. Using the knowledge and expertise gained with more than 3 years of experience in
      fetoscopic sheep surgery, Dr. Peiro has now performed 8 minimally invasive repairs on human
      patients in Barcelona (Vall D'Hebron Hospital, Instituto Nacional de Perinatologia, Mexico
      City, Mexico). Also there have been reports at Texas Childrens Hospital ( Belfort) using two
      ports technique in order to successfully repair the defect.

      The neurosurgical repair proposed in this protocol will involves release of the placode,
      dissection of the surrounding skin and attempted primary closure of the defect using
      available skin. In those cases where the investigators are able to complete the procedure
      with full skin closure of the defect, the only difference between the open uterus procedure
      and the fetoscopic procedure, will be that the surgery will be done fetoscopically rather
      than through an open uterine incision. If the investigator group is unable to close the skin
      primarily despite best fetoscopic efforts, the option of performing/completing the repair as
      an open procedure exists and will be offered to the patient previous counselling of the
      maternal morbidity. The patient is monitored in hospital until ready for discharge.

      Approximately 6 weeks after the surgery a post-procedure fetal MRI will be performed. If
      there is evidence of good closure of the neural tube defect and reversal of the Chiari II
      malformation, a vaginal delivery can be attempted based on obstetric criteria. Patients will
      be followed in person every 3-4 months after birth to 12 months at the Spina Bifida Clinic at
      Christus Muguerza Alta Especialidad. Remaining visits will be yearly up to 5 years. If this
      is not possible, questionnaire(s) will be mailed to the participants and records will be
      requested from the treating neurosurgeon on this same schedule.
