  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Even with major advances in clinical therapy and percutaneous interventions, coronary artery
      bypass grafting (CABG) is the most common cardiac surgery performed worldwide and is an
      effective treatment in reducing symptoms and mortality in patients with coronary artery
      disease (CAD). However, CABG is a complex procedure that triggers a series of clinical and
      functional complications, such as series postoperative repercussions as muscle wasting in the
      first four hours after surgery. For quantification of changes in muscle structure and
      morphology ultrasonography has been used.

      In this context, cardiac rehabilitation program (CRP) is an essential component of care in
      CABG patients, because this intervention can prevent muscle weakness and wasting. Among
      different treatment modalities, functional electrical stimulation (FES) is a feasible therapy
      for neuromuscular activation and prevent muscle weakness and wasting in patients in phase I
      CRP, however the effect of this intervention in phase II CRP not been fully elucidated. The
      purpose of this study will to assess the effects of FES plus combined aerobic and resistance
      training on muscle thickness of quadriceps femoris, lower limbs muscle strength, functional
      capacity, QoL in in CABG patients enrolled in a phase II CR program.
