  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: The appearance of tastants in the small intestine following food ingestion results
      in the onset of digestion and absorption but can also result in the activation of a negative
      feedback mechanism from different parts of the intestine to the stomach, the small intestine
      and to the central nervous system. These processes inhibit food processing, appetite
      sensations and food intake, and furthermore they increase feelings of satiety and satiation.
      In this study, we aim to investigate the effects of oral sham feeding and intragastric
      delivery of a bitter tastant (quinine) on ad libitum food intake, satiation, gastrointestinal
      symptoms, and heart rate variability.

      Objective: To investigate the effect of oral sham feeding and intragastric delivery of a
      bitter tastant on food intake.

      Secondary Objective(s):

        1. To compare the effect of oral sham feeding and intragastric delivery of a bitter tastant
           on satiation.

        2. To assess the effect of oral sham feeding and intragastric delivery of a bitter tastant
           on gastrointestinal symptoms/complaints.

        3. To assess the effect of oral sham feeding and intragastric delivery of a bitter tastant
           on heart rate variability.

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Satiation/satiety</measure>
    <time_frame>At T= -20 mins, T= -10 mins, T=0 mins, T= 10 mins, T= 20 mins, T= 30 mins, T= 40 mins, T=50 and T= end, where T= 0 is ingestion of capsule and sham-feeding and T= end is whenever the participant finishes the test meal given at T= 50 mins.</time_frame>
    <description>Difference in satiation/satiety (as measured by VAS 0-100mm). VAS scores for satiety feelings (e.g., satiety, fullness, hunger, prospective feeding, desire to eat, desire to snack) will be measured using Visual Analogue Scales (VAS, 0 to 100 mm) anchored at the low end with the most negative or lowest intensity feelings (e.g., extremely unpleasant, not at all), and with opposing terms at the high end (e.g., extremely pleasant, very high, extreme). Volunteers will be asked to indicate on a line which place on the scale best reflects their feeling at that moment. The scoring forms will be collected immediately so that they cannot be used as a reference for later scorings.</description>

    <description>Difference in gastro-intestinal symptoms (as measured by VAS 0-100mm). VAS scores for gastrointestinal symptoms (burning, bloating, belching, cramps, colics, warm sensation, sensation of abdominal fullness, nausea, pain and relaxation/tensness) will be measured using Visual Analogue Scales (VAS, 0 to 100 mm) anchored at the low end with the most negative or lowest intensity feelings (e.g., extremely unpleasant, not at all), and with opposing terms at the high end (e.g., extremely pleasant, very high, extreme).
