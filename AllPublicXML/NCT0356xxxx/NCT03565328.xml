  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      People are living longer and are more likely to survive a heart attack if they have one.
      Longer life expectancy is good but it also means more people get chronic heart failure over
      time. This is a condition in which the heart doesn't pump blood as well as it should.
      Treatment of chronic heart failure has not improved much in a few decades. Researchers want
      to see if giving a dietary supplement to people with heart failure can help their heart
      function. The supplement is nicotinamide riboside (NR).

      Objective:

      To study how NR affects skeletal muscle function in people with heart failure.

      Eligibility:

      Adults ages 18-70 with clinically stable systolic heart failure

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with a medical history and physical exam. They will answer
      demographic questions and review their current medical treatments. They will have blood and
      urine tests. They will have an echocardiogram. This uses sound waves to test heart function.

      Participants will have 8 study visits over 16 weeks. At these visits, they will have some of
      the following:

      Repeat of screening tests

      Skin sample taken

      Skeletal muscle exercise NMR spectroscopy. Muscles will be measured while participants do
      foot exercises.

      Cardiopulmonary exercise testing. Participants may ride a stationary bike or walk on a
      treadmill. A facemask will analyze their breath. Heart and blood pressure measurements will
      be taken.

      Participants will take the supplement in pill form each day for 12 weeks. Pill bottles will
      be checked at study visits.

      Participants should not significantly change their activity levels during the study.

    <textblock>
      As life expectancy increases and acute cardiac mortality decreases, the incidence of chronic
      heart failure (HF) continues to rise, and despite this, conceptual advances in the treatment
      of chronic heart failure have not increased substantially over last few decades. One
      intracellular component of heart failure progression is mitochondrial bioenergetic
      dysfunction. Although the mechanism underpinning this is not completely understood, recent
      metabolomics data demonstrated an incomplete flux of metabolites through oxidative
      phosphorylation (OX PHOS) in HF. In parallel, data has shown that hyperacetylation of
      mitochondrial bioenergetic enzymes, with the concomitant blunting of enzymatic activity is
      evident in HF. Putting these together, an emerging hypothesis implicates excessive
      acetylation of mitochondrial proteins with the subsequent blunting of bioenergetic enzyme
      function, as a mechanism underpinning incomplete flux through OX PHOS resulting in HF
      progression.

      In parallel with cardiac bioenergetic deficiency chronic HF subjects display disrupted
      skeletal muscle OX PHOS, which is thought to contribute towards overall fatigue and reduced
      exercise tolerance. Interestingly exercise training in HF subjects improves skeletal muscle
      mitochondrial OX PHOS capacity and subject activity levels. Exercise training additionally
      increases activity of the mitochondrial regulatory deacetylase sirtuin enzymes SIRT1 and
      SIRT3, in parallel with improved skeletal muscle OX PHOS capacity. At the same time
      HF-associated disruption in skeletal muscle metabolic function activates skeletal muscle
      cytokine production. These inflammatory programs, in turn, are proposed to contribute towards
      impaired functional capacity in HF. Interestingly, and mirroring improved OX PHOS following
      exercise programs in HF studies, exercise training similarly reduces skeletal muscle
      inflammatory effects.

      Biochemical and bioenergetic consequences of impaired mitochondrial OX PHOS leads to
      decreased NAD+ levels, which exacerbate mitochondrial dysfunction by inactivating the NAD+
      dependent sirtuin enzymes. Experimental studies using NAD+ precursors to increase NAD+
      production have been shown to normalize NADH/NAD+ ratios and activate Sirtuin enzymes,
      resulting in enhanced OX PHOS with beneficial effects in numerous systems including skeletal
      muscle and in the blunting of inflammation.

      In this pilot study we will directly assess the effect of the NAD+ precursor, nicotinamide
      riboside (NR) on skeletal muscle mitochondrial OX PHOS in HF subjects using: skeletal muscle
      NMR spectroscopy assessment of the rate of high energy phosphate recovery in response to
      submaximal exercise; assessment of the effect of NR on functional capacity using
      cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) to determine VO(2max) and anaerobic threshold;
      evaluation of the NR effect on serum metabolomics at rest and in response to CPET; and by
      measuring circulating cytokine levels pre- and post- NR administration. These studies would
      enable a more comprehensive assessment of the role for NR supplementation on skeletal muscle
      mitochondrial function in subjects with systolic HF
