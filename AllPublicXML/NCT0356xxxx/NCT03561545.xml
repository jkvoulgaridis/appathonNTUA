  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During weightlessness, the cardiovascular system is subject to rapid changes which has been
      demonstrated in studies of short term (Space Shuttle) and long term missions to Skylab, MIR,
      and the International Space Station (Nicogossian et al., 1989; Blomquist, 1994; Platts et
      al., 2014). There is also evidence for changes in the blood vessel structure, the metabolism
      and the responses to vasodilator and constrictor substances that might have long-term health
      consequences resembling the effects of aging on the cardiovascular system (Hughson and
      Shoemaker, 2004). Cardiovascular adaptations cause an increased incidence of postflight
      orthostatic intolerance (fainting), decreased cardiac output and reduced exercise capacity.
      Besides these postflight effects, weightlessness could also have harmful consequences during
      the flight. For example, it has been shown that cardiac arrhythmia may occur during space
      missions, even in healthy individuals (Convertino, 2009).

      To understand the cardiovascular reactions of the human body to changing conditions of
      gravity is thus an important aim of space science.

      While non-invasive imaging of microcirculation is a very promising tool to evaluate
      cardiovascular condition, knowledge on the involvement of the microcirculation in
      cardiovascular alterations induced by weightlessness is very limited and further research in
      this field seems promising. Before using a non-invasive technique for imaging the
      microcirculation during space flights, it has to be evaluated on earth.

      Different proven simulation models exist for investigating the effects of weightlessness on
      the human body under terrestrial conditions: head down bed rest, dry and wet immersion, and
      parabolic flights. Among these models, only parabolic flight recreates a real state of
      weightlessness (see the participant document of information for a description of parabolic
      flights). Cardiovascular studies have often been performed during parabolic flights. Within
      the limitations inherent to the method (short duration of weightlessness - about 21 s -
      following and followed by hypergravity 20 s periods at 1.8g), some remarkable results have
      been published over the years.

      The aim of our research approach is to test feasibility of the in vivo evaluation of the
      microcirculation in parabolic flight in order to be able to better describe cardiovascular
      response mechanisms under these conditions. In this context, we expect alterations in the
      microcirculatory flow during the weightlessness period of parabolic flight.

      Our approach might help develop a diagnostic tool to more easily identify
      weightlessness-induced cardiovascular diseases and improve strategies for adapting astronauts
      to weightlessness prior to the space mission.
