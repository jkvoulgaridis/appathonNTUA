  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is conducted to overcome the problems of conventional indirect bonding technique,
      through investigating accuracy of two novel three dimensionally digitally printed indirect
      bonding transfer trays (full arch &amp; segmented) in terms of accuracy of transferring brackets,
      rate of immediate bond failure and chair side time.

    <textblock>
      Fourteen patients (7 in each group) with mild to moderate crowding, requiring orthodontic
      treatment with full set of permanent teeth including second molars, will be selected for this
      study. A total of 196 brackets will be used (98 Full Arch Tray and 98 Segment Arch Tray). The
      same bracket type and bonding material will used in both groups. The accuracy of bracket
      transfer will be measured by 3 Shape Ortho planner software (Bracket Placement Module), rate
      of bond failure by counting number of debonded brackets upon tray removal &amp; chair side time
      by using digital watch.
