  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was conducted to evaluate the 2-year progression free survival rate of elderly
      patients with primary CNS lymphoma followed by combination of rituximab and methotrexate
      followed by rituximab and cytarabine.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As described, standard therapy for patients with primary CNS lymphoma is not based on a high
      level of evidence yet, and studies in elderly patients with this disease are very limited.
      Based on the Korea National Cancer Incidence Database, it is estimated that about 100 ~ 150
      cases of primary central nervous system lymphoma are diagnosed per year in Korea, but there
      is no analysis through prospective studies. As described previously, MTX monotherapy in
      elderly patients is relatively safe and does not reduce clinical utility. Although the
      autologous therapy may consider autologous stem cell transplantation, it is difficult to
      apply in elderly patients. Brain radiation therapy is not a primary consideration because it
      may cause neurological sequelae, especially in elderly patients. High-dose cytarabine is a
      safely administered drug that has been used extensively in clinical studies involving the
      treatment of elderly patients.Rituximab has not been studied prospectively for medications,
      doses, and intervals that are expected to play a role in patients with primary CNS lymphoma,
      as described above, and may be caused by reducing the number of cytotoxic anticancer drugs in
      elderly patients And to reduce the treatment effect.

      Therefore, the authors propose a two-phase study in which R-A induction therapy is performed
      after R-M induction therapy in elderly patients with primary CNS lymphoma.
