  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gepotidacin (GSK2140944) is a novel triazaacenaphthylene bacterial type II topoisomerase
      inhibitor that is being developed for the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections
      (UTIs; acute cystitis). This Phase IIa study will evaluate plasma and urine pharmacokinetics
      of gepotidacin in female subjects with acute cystitis. Eligible female subjects will receive
      twice daily (BID) dose of gepotidacin 1500 milligram (mg) for 5 days via oral route.
      Pre-treatment and post-treatment samples for pharmacokinetic (PK) assessments will be
      collected throughout the study. The total duration of the study is approximately 28 days.

        <description>An AEs is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant, temporally associated with the use of a study treatment, whether or not considered related to the study treatment. An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose: results in death; is life-threatening; requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; results in persistent disability/incapacity; is a congenital anomaly/birth defect; and other important medical events which may require medical or surgical intervention. Safety Population consisted of all participants who received at least 1 dose of gepotidacin.</description>

        <description>Vital sign including body temperature was measured in semi-supine position after 5 minutes of rest for the participants in a quiet setting without distractions. Baseline was defined as the latest non-missing value at Day -1 or at Day 1 pre-dose. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the post-dose visit value from the Baseline value. Assessment at Test-of-cure visit was conducted between any day of Days 10 to 13.</description>

        <description>Blood samples were collected to analyze the hematology parameters: Basophils, Eosinophils, Lymphocytes, Monocytes, Neutrophils and Platelet counts. Baseline was defined as Day -1. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the post-dose visit value from the Baseline value. Assessment at Test-of-cure visit was conducted between any day of Days 10 to 13.</description>

Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the post-dose visit value from the Baseline value. Assessment at Test-of-cure visit was conducted between any day of Days 10 to 13.</description>

Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the post-dose visit value from the Baseline value. Assessment at Test-of-cure visit was conducted between any day of Days 10 to 13.</description>

        <description>Urine samples were collected at indicated time points to analyze parameters including glucose and nitrites by dipstick. The dipstick test gives results in a semi-quantitative manner, and results for urinalysis parameters can be read as negative and positive in the urine sample. Baseline was defined as Day -1. Assessment at Test-of-cure visit was conducted between any day of Days 10 to 13. Only categories with significant values have been presented.</description>

The dipstick test gives results in a semi-quantitative manner, and results for urinalysis parameters can be read as negative, 5 indicates 5 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) and 20 indicates 20 mg/dL in the urine sample. Baseline was defined as Day -1. Assessment at Test-of-cure visit was conducted between any day of Days 10 to 13. Only categories with significant values have been presented.</description>

The dipstick test gives results in a semi-quantitative manner, and results for urinalysis parameters can be read as negative, Small indicates 25 Erythrocytes per microliter (Ery/mcL), Moderate indicates 50 Ery/mcL and Large indicates 250 Ery/mcL in the urine sample. Baseline was defined as Day -1. Assessment at Test-of-cure visit was conducted between any day of Days 10 to 13. Only categories with significant values have been presented.</description>

        <description>Urine samples were collected at indicated time points to analyze parameter including protein by dipstick. The dipstick test gives results in a semi-quantitative manner, and results for urinalysis parameters can be read as negative indicates &lt;10 mg/dL, 1+ indicates 30 mg/dL and 2+ indicates 100 mg/dL in the urine sample. Baseline was defined as Day -1. Assessment at Test-of-cure visit was conducted between any day of Days 10 to 13. Only categories with significant values have been presented.</description>
