    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well cemiplimab works before surgery in treating participants
      with stage III-IV head and neck squamous cell cancer that has come back. Immunotherapy with
      monoclonal antibodies, such as cemiplimab, may help the body's immune system attack the
      cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the overall response rate (ORR) using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
      Tumors (RECIST) version (v)1.1 criteria to neoadjuvant cemiplimab (REGN2810) (anti-PD-1
      inhibitor) in patients with advanced-stage cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) of the
      head and neck who are planned for definitive local surgery and radiation.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the pathologic response rate to neoadjuvant REGN2810 in patients with
      advanced-stage cSCC of the head and neck.

      II. To determine the safety and tolerability of neoadjuvant REGN2810 in patients with
      advanced-stage cSCC of the head and neck who are planned for definitive local surgery and
      radiation.

      III. To estimate the 2-year disease-specific (DSS), disease-free (DFS) and overall survival
      (OS) compared to historical controls.

      IV. To determine the time to recurrence and patterns of failure. V. To evaluate the effects
      of neoadjuvant REGN2810 on the expression of PD-1 and potential related immune regulating
      targets in cSCC of the head and neck.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants receive cemiplimab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes every 3 weeks. Courses
      repeat every 3 weeks for up to 6 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up for 30 days and then
      periodically for up to 5 years.
