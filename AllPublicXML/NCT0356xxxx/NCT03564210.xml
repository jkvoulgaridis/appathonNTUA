    <textblock>
      This study will prospectively examine the effect of screen time on recovery from concussion.
      Patients 12 to 25 years of age presenting to the ED with a concussion will be randomized to
      allow for screen time as tolerated or to abstain from screen time for the first 48 hours of
      recovery. The amount of screen time use and duration of concussive symptoms will be assessed
      through daily surveys and a daily post-concussive symptom score (PCSS).
