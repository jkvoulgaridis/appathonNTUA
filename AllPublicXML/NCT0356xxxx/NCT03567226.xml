  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The positive effects of exercise on ocular health are known, but modern lifestyles have made
      it difficult to incorporate physical activity into the daily lives of the Chinese population.
      Recent studies suggest that exercise plays an important role in lowering intraocular pressure
      (IOP) by protecting retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) in glaucoma patients as well as other
      potential neuroprotective benefits. Increasing the amount of physical activity within the
      Chinese glaucoma population may have marked effects on health outcomes and coincides with the
      Chinese government's efforts to make exercise an urgent public health priority. There is a
      need for innovative, cost-effective, and proven interventions to promote exercise behavior
      change and social media platforms may be able to fill this niche. WeChat is China's largest
      and most frequently used social media and messaging application with an estimated 570 million
      users. The platform has been found to be a useful tool in healthcare settings to promote
      weight-loss, health literacy, and patient adherence in Chinese populations. This study is a
      5-weeks randomized control trial with three total study visits. 80 patients from an academic
      glaucoma clinic in Wenzhou Medical College will be randomized into two groups. The
      intervention group will be enrolled into an Official WeChat Group and receive periodic
      reminders to exercise, health education materials, and motivational incentives. The control
      group will receive weekly reminders and leaflets at the first clinic visit. Patients' daily
      step data will be monitored using an Accelerometer WGT3X-BT. The intervention duration will
      include an initial clinic visit, a one-week follow-up after wearing the accelerometer, and
      then a subsequent one-month follow-up visit after wearing the accelerometer. At the one-week
      visit the patient will be randomized and at the subsequent one-month visit there will be a
      close-out discussion about the study. In addition to collecting step data at clinic visits,
      investigators will also measure patients' visual field tests, optical coherence tomography
      angiography (angio-OCT), and intraocular pressure (IOP) using Goldmann Tonometry. The
      investigators' hypothesis is that using an Official WeChat Patient Group will be a robust and
      effective stimulus to increase physical exercise.

    <description>The primary outcome variable will be the number of daily steps taken over the course of one month for each participant. This outcome will be measured by having participants wear the Accelerometer WGT3X-BT, from which we can collect steps data. From this primary outcome measure we will also assess the change in number of steps taken comparing the first week to the following month after the intervention.
Assuming mean enrollment number of steps per day is 9,302.29, we can detect an average increase of 2,500 steps per day with alpha set to 0.05 with 80% power.</description>

The WeChat Group will be a community forum to share information, encourage each other, and receive communications from the study team. In addition, the study team will disseminate the following information through the group:
Daily/Weekly Reminders to exercise
Health education materials regarding glaucoma and general health and exercise
Motivational content
Surveys to gauge what information participants found most interesting and useful to help them exercise</description>
