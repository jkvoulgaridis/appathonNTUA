      Mobile electronic devices (MED) including, smartphones and tablets, offer a new type of
      assistive technology for visually-impaired people (VIP). They offer the possibility to
      replace optical magnifiers for those with mild impairment, and braille or auditory for those
      with severe visual loss, using standard consumer devices, which are relatively cheap and
      convenient. However not all VIP and rehabilitation professionals are familiar with the
      devices and their potential.

      In this study VIP who are interested in purchasing a MED will be recruited and trained. The
      effectiveness of this training will be determined by assessing the usage of devices by the
      participants from completion of training to 6 months, using questionnaires, and by remote
      monitoring of their MED. Validated questionnaires will be used to measure changes in quality
      of life, depression, adaptation to vision loss, and ability to carry out everyday tasks,
      before and after training, and 6 months later. Ongoing support has been found to be important
      when introducing users to new technology, in the form of volunteers to provide assistance and
      advice. The standard &quot;training course only&quot; model will therefore be compared to a scheme in
      which each participant is paired with a &quot;buddy&quot; (a university student) who can provide
      continuing support by visiting the VIP regularly at home.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      By converting text into speech and being cheaply and readily available, smartphones and
      tablets offer a completely new type of assistive technology for visually-impaired people
      (VIP). Research on these mobile electronic devices (MED) is relevant to rehabilitation and
      enablement of individuals with all types of visual impairment, with all degrees of severity.
      The majority of UK adults have a smartphone, but take-up is least amongst the over 75s who
      form the majority of the VI population. This is the population in whom MED have the greatest
      potential to reduce social isolation and increase independence, so it is important that the
      potential benefits are not restricted to those already comfortable with technology. Despite
      the great interest regarding what could be achieved with MED, evidence is currently lacking
      that they do provide significant improvements in quality of life, and that the specific
      training which is currently offered by many different organisations can help to facilitate
      effective use of MED.

      The study aim is to evaluate the effectiveness of two different models of training in giving
      the user on-going access and improved quality of life. The two models to be compared will be
      a &quot;training course only&quot;, versus a scheme in which each participant is paired with a &quot;buddy&quot;
      (a local university student) who can provide continuing assistance by visiting the
      participant at home.

      VIP who are interested in purchasing a MED will be recruited and trained. The usage of
      devices will be assessed by questionnaire from completion of training to 6 months and through
      a tracking app. Validated questionnaires will be used to measure changes in quality of life,
      depression, adaptation to vision loss, and ability to carry out everyday tasks, before and
      after training, and 6 months later.

In Section 3 the participant identifies 5 activities which they would like to improve, and grades on a scale of 0-10) the importance of the task, their performance, and their satisfaction with their performance of it. An &quot;importance x satisfaction&quot; and &quot;importance x performance&quot; score for each activity are calculated.</description>
