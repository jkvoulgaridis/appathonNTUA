      Investigation of the role of adding oral antibiotics to preoperative mechanical bowel
      preparation before colorectal surgery for cancer.

    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to investigate whether the addition of oral antibiotics to Mechanical
      Bowel Preparation (MBP) prior to colorectal cancer surgical procedures reduce the superfical
      and deep surgical site (SSI) infectious complications. The study is prospective and is
      designed in a randomized single-blinded controlled fashion. It is taking place at one
      academic surgical unit of Athens Medical School, located at a tertiary referal institution.
      Patients scheduled to undergo an elective surgical resection for colon or rectal cancer will
      be allocated to either formal MBP the day before surgery or a combined MBP with
      administration of oral antibiotics. Exclusion criteria are the following: emergency surgery,
      obstructive or perforated cancer, patients intolerance to bowel preparation regimen and
      allergies to orally administered antibiotics.

      Intervention arms: Patients will be randomised into two groups, concealed from the treating
      surgeon.

      Group A:

      Preoperative oral antibiotic therapy with rifaximin 400 mg plus metronidazole 500mg the day
      prior to surgery at 2:00, 3:00 and 10:00 pm, with MBP (2 vials sodium phospate 45ml at 1:00
      and 7:00 pm)

      Group B:

      MBP (2 vials sodium phospate 45ml at 1:00 and 7:00 pm) alone Both groups will receive iv
      antibiotics (cefoxitin 2 gr plus metronidazole 500gr) perioperatively and discontinuation
      within 24 hours.

      Outcome measures: The primary end point is surgical site infection (SSI), including (i)
      superficial wound infection, (ii) deep wound infection, and (iii) intrabdominal infection
      (contaminated fluid or pus collection) within 30 days of the procedure (decrease 3% in the
      rate) Secondary measures: Anastomotic leaks, other surgical and non-surgical compliactions,
      hospital length of stay, readmission rate, patients' preparation tolerance, preparation
      regimens side-effects, time to beginning of adjuvant treatment for colorectal cancer.

      Sample Size: It is estimated that 105 patients per treatment arm are needed.
