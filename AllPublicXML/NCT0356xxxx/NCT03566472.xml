    <textblock>
      Glargine is commonly used in insulin supplemental therapy in patients with type 2
      diabetes(T2D) at present. This study aims to investigate the current status of blood glucose
      control in patients with T2D treated with glargine. Glycated hemoglobin(HbA1c) will be tested
      in these patients to assess the blood glucose control and Continuous Glucose Monitoring
      System (CGMS) will be used to investigate the glucose variability. Islet function, duration
      of diabetes, complications, exercise, insulin dose, oral medication regimen and insulin
      antibodies will be recorded in detail. This study will analysis the association between these
      clinical characteristics and blood glucose control.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with T2DM, which was defined bypublished Criteria of World Health
             Organization in 1999;

          2. Patients were using glargine with or without oral hypoglycemic drugs and having a
             stable dose of glargine for more than 2 month would be recruited into this study;

          3. Patients had relatively constant diet and exercise in 2 month before the study;

          4. Fasting blood glucose was between 6.1 and 16mmolL, and postprandial (or random) blood
             glucose &lt;22.2mmol/L.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with severe cardiovascular diseases, such as stroke, transient ischemic
             attack, myocardial infarction, unstable angina, coronary artery bypass grafting,
             percutaneous coronary intervention, and heart failure;

          2. Patients with severe infectious diseases;

          3. Patients with acute complications of diabetes on admission, such as diabetic
             ketoacidosis, diabetic hyperosmolar nonketotic coma, and lactic acidosis;

          4. Patients with history of psychiatric disorders and were unsuitable to use CGMS;

          5. Any other situations that made patients unsuitable to participate in the study, such
