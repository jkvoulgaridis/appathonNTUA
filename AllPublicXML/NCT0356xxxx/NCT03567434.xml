  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the impact of evening alcohol consumption on sympathetic activity and
      baroreflex function in binge drinkers. Our central hypothesis is that evening binge alcohol
      consumption will lead to sympathetic overactivity and blunted baroreflex function.

      This study will recruit male and female binge drinkers who will participate in a randomized,
      cross-over, double-blind, placebo-based study to examine the impact of an evening of alcohol
      vs. placebo/fluid-control on autonomic and cardiovascular control at night and the subsequent
      morning. The study will utilize established techniques for assessing sleep (polysomnography)
      and autonomic/cardiovascular control (microneurography, beat-to-beat finger plethysmography,
      electrocardiogram, etc.). All subjects will undergo a familiarization night in the sleep
      laboratory prior to their first randomized test session with either alcohol or
      placebo/fluid-control. Both men and women will be tested to address a secondary aim of
      determining the impact of sex (male vs. female) and ovarian cycle (early follicular vs.
      midluteal phase) on sympathetic neural responsiveness to evening alcohol in binge drinkers.
      Finally, as a tertiary/exploratory aim, participants that have a respiratory disturbance
      index of ≥5 episodes per hour during the alcohol treatment will be asked to consider one
      additional overnight session where they will be randomly assigned to either continuous
      positive airway pressure (CPAP) or sham-CPAP for one additional night of evening alcohol
      consumption.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Men and women age 21 - 40 years

          -  Binge drinkers as defined by a pattern of consuming ≥4 drinks if female (≥5 drinks if
             males) in ≤ 2 hours on more than one occasion within the past 6 months, and at least
             once in the past 30 days. The National Institute of Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism
             (NIAAA) definition of a &quot;drink&quot; will be used.

          -  Women must be eumenorrheic and premenopausal with regular and consistent menstrual
             cycles (i.e., ~25-30 days ovarian/uterine cycles that include 2-7 days of
             menstruation)

          -  Willingness to abstain from exercise and caffeine at least 12 hours prior to any
             autonomic and cardiovascular testing, and abstain from alcohol 24 hours prior to any
             autonomic and cardiovascular testing (unless experimentally administered).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Body mass index ≥ 35 kg/m2

          -  Smokers

          -  A physician diagnosis of diabetes

          -  Pregnancy

          -  Taking any cardiovascular medications

          -  Severe obstructive sleep apnea as determined by an apnea-hypopnea index of ≥ 30
             episodes per hour

          -  Moderate-to-severe Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) as determined by the Diagnostic and
             Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-V)

          -  Individuals suspected to have mutant alcohol dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2) isoenzyme as
             determined using a validated flushing questionnaire

          -  Women using hormonal contraceptives (i.e., oral, intrauterine, etc.) in the prior 6
             months
