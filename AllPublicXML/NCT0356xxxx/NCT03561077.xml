  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective is to study the feasibility of a program for the management of chronic
      painful adolescents in meditation groups. This program is an adaptation of the MBI-A
      (Mindfulness-based intervention for adolescent) program developed in another socio-cultural
      context (i.e. in Canada). The secondary objectives will be to study the effect of a
      mindfulness meditation program for adolescents on pain, quality of life, acceptance of pain,
      functional disability, catastrophism, anxiety-depression, emotional repercussions and
      acceptance of mindfulness

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Paediatric chronic pain can lead to serious consequences in terms of daily functioning
      (school absenteeism and loss of social interactions) and global quality of life.
      Mindfulness-based interventions (MBI's) approaches which emphasize acceptance rather than
      control of pain have gained increasing attention in adults with chronic pain. The
      effectiveness of MBI's for chronic pain in paediatric population remains largely unknown. An
      MBI program for adolescent was conducted in Toronto's Hospital for Sick Children and happened
      to be feasible and well received for adolescents with chronic pain conditions. The aim of the
      present program is to study the feasibility in France of a mindfulness program dedicated for
      adolescents with chronic pain.

      An eight-session, two hour Mindfulness Based Intervention dedicated to adolescents will be
      provided. The intervention will focus on skill building and will incorporate mindfulness
      meditation, exercises and activities specially adapted to teenagers with chronic pain. Topics
      will include mind body connection, the effect of stress on pain, living in the present
      moment, focused awareness, responding versus reacting to pain and/ or difficult situations,
      non judgement, gratitude, kindness and compassion towards self and others.
