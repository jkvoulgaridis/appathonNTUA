  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) is a chronic inflammatory condition of the gastrointestinal
      tract that significantly affects quality of life of patients.

      Several studies have reported that the loss of work productivity is significantly higher than
      that of the general population due to disease-related symptoms and various factors in
      patients with inflammatory bowel disease in Western countries, but there is few data in
      Korea.

      Therefore, this study is to assess the effect of disease on sick leave, work disability and
      health related quality of life in Korean patients with inflammatory bowel disease by using
      validated questionnaires.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      First, the investigators will estimate the prevalence of work disability in patients with
      inflammatory bowel disease using the Work Productivity and Activity Index (WPAI), that have
      been validated in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.

      Secondary, the predictor of work productivity impairment in patients with inflammatory bowel
      disease and distribution of type and severity of work disability will be identified.

      Third, the investigators will explore the correlation between the quality of life and
      psychosocial aspects (anxiety disorder, depression) of patients with inflammatory bowel
      disease.

      One year later, the same questionnaire will be surveyed repeatedly in the same participants
      under usual care to investigate the changes in patient-reported outcome measures.

    <measure>Mean Total Percentage of Work Impairment by Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire (WPAI) in CD or UC Participants</measure>
    <time_frame>From initial diagnosis until date of data collection (approximately 1 years)</time_frame>
    <description>The WPAI assess the impact of IBD on work productivity and daily activities during the previous 7 days. The WPAI includes 6 questions: 1 (if currently employed); 2 (hours missed due to disease); 3 (hours missed other reasons); 4 (hours actually worked); 5 (degree disease affected productivity while working); 6 (degree disease affected regular activities). WPAI generates four component scores: percentage of work time missed (absenteeism); percentage of impairment while working (presentisms); percentage of overall work impairment (absenteeism and presentisms combined); and percentage of activity impairment. Unemployed participants only answer questions related to employment status and activity impairment. Scores for WPAI range from 0% to 100%, where 0 % indicates no impairment and 100% is total loss of work productivity/activity</description>
