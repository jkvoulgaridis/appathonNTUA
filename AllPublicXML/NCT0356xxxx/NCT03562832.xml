  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      2X-121 is a small molecule targeted inhibitor of Poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP), a key
      enzyme involved in DNA damage repair in cancer cells. The PARP inhibitor demonstrated
      clinical activity in a prior Phase 1 study in a number of solid tumors. 2X-121 has a novel
      dual-inhibitory action against both PARP 1/2 and Tankyrase 1/2. The molecule is also active
      in P-glycoprotein expressing cells, suggesting it may overcome some of the PARP inhibitor
      resistance.

      The Phase 2 study is using 2x-121 DRPÂ® biomarker in metastatic breast cancer patients to
      identify patients likely to respond to and benefit from treatment with 2X-121.

          -  With a drug response prediction (DRP) for 2X-121 with an outcome measured as being in
             the upper 20% likelihood of response.

          -  Prior chemotherapy or hormone therapy for metastatic breast cancer is allowed.
