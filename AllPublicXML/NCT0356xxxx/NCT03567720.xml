  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, Multi-Cohort, Open-Label, Multi-Center Study. Cohort 1 will be a
      single-arm study of intratumoral tavokinogene telseplasmid (tavo) plus electroporation (EP)
      in combination with pembrolizumab therapy. Cohort 2 will be a single-arm study of
      intratumoral tavo-EP plus pembrolizumab with nab-paclitaxel (Abraxane®) chemotherapy.
      Subjects with TNBC and EP accessible cutaneous / subcutaneous disease will be enrolled in
      this study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be comprised of a screening period, treatment period and a long-term
      follow-up.

      Eligible subjects will be treated with intratumoral tavo-EP to the accessible lesions on Days
      1, 5 and 8 every 6 weeks and with IV pembrolizumab (200 mg) on Day 1 of each 3-week cycle for
      up to 17 cycles of tavo-EP and 33 cycles of pembrolizumab from baseline (approximately 2
      years) or until subsequent disease progression. For Cohort 2, subjects will be treated with
      an approved chemotherapy per standard of care, limited to nab-paclitaxel (Abraxane®). All
      accessible lesions, each ≥ 0.3 cm × 0.3 cm, may be treated; except where possible, 1
      measurable lesion by RECIST (size ≥ 1.0 cm) should be selected and left untreated for the
      duration of the study.

      Long-term Follow-up: All subjects will be followed after the End of Study (EOS) visit for
      Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) (through 90 days from the last dose of study drug) and
      long-term survival status for up to 1 year. EOS visit will occur 4 weeks after last study
      treatment administration.

             abnormality that might confound the results of the study, interfere with the subject's
             participation for the full duration of the study, or is not in the best interest of
             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating Investigator.

         17. Subject has not recovered (i.e., ≤ Grade 1 or at Baseline) from adverse events (AEs)
             due to a previously administered agent.

         18. Participation in another clinical study of an investigational anti-cancer agent or has
             used an investigational device within 30 days of screening.
