      This study is being performed to assess the feasibility of adapting radiotherapy plans based
      on functional lung information and increasing the dose to the primary tumour. This is a
      single arm interventional pilot study involving 20 patients.

      Aims Primary: to assess the feasibility of using ventilation and perfusion positron emission
      computed tomography (V/Q PET/CT) scans to adapt radiotherapy plans using Volumetric Modulated
      Arc Therapy (VMAT) to avoid regions of functional lung and deliver a higher dose to the
      primary tumour Secondary: to assess the incidence of acute and late radiotherapy toxicities,
      to quantify regional ventilation loss and regional perfusion loss on post treatment V/Q
      PET/CT, to assess associations of V/Q PET/CT with other functional lung imaging techniques,
      to assess overall survival, progression free survival and quality of life outcomes.

      Participants: 20 patients stage IIIa-c non-small cell lung cancer for curative intent
      radiotherapy.

      Methods: All patients will receive functional lung adapted 60 Gray (Gy) in 30 fractions to
      the primary and nodal planning target volume with a simultaneous integrated boost to the
      primary tumour to a total dose 69Gy in 30 fractions.

      Expected outcomes: That functionally adapted lung radiotherapy using V/Q PET/CT imaging and
      VMAT planning is technically feasible.
