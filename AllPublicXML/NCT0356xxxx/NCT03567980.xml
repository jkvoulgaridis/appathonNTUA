  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Seborrheic dermatitis is a common and recurrent dermatosis that characteristically involves
      the scalp, nasolabial folds, eyebrows, glabella, and upper eye lids. It presents as an
      erythematous, thin scaly patch with a greasy sandpaper texture that varies depending on
      disease severity. While seborrheic dermatitis most frequently occurs on the face, it can
      involve other areas of the body especially the chest, abdomen, and axilla. Overall incidence
      is thought to be between 2-5% of the general population, though this is likely an
      underestimation. Pruritus is variable, though the signs and symptoms of this disorder are
      certainly worsened by certain external conditions especially weather, personal perspiration,
      stress, and poor hygiene. Patients often complain about the red, scaly patches on the face.

      Antifungal agents are frequently used as monotherapy or in combination regimens in the
      treatment of seborrheic dermatitis. Topical corticosteroids are often used for their
      anti-inflammatory effects. Long term use of topical steroids on the face is not a preferred
      treatment modality due to the risk of striae development and other textural changes that
      occur over time. Therefore, topical crisaborole may be an alternative given its
      non-corticosteroid anti-inflammatory action. Crisaborole is a phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE-4)
      inhibitor that increases intracellular cyclic AMP (cAMP) levels to exert its
      anti-inflammatory effects. While it has not previously been investigated for its effects in
      seborrheic dermatitis, further studies evaluating its role in this disease are warranted.

      Therefore, the investigators propose a proof of concept study using topical crisaborole 2%
      ointment on the face for 4 weeks to evaluate the anti-inflammatory action of this agent and
      its utility in the treatment of facial seborrheic dermatitis.

    <description>• The Itch Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) is a subject-administered, 11 point horizontal scale anchored at 0 and 10, 0 representing &quot;no itch&quot; and 10 representing &quot;worst itch imaginable.&quot; Overall severity of a subject itching is indicated by circling the number that best describes the worst level of itching in the past 24 hours.
The Itch NRS (A numeric measurement of itch) will be collected to assess the percentage of improvement of patient reported itching. This will be calculated as a percent changes from baseline in the Itch NRS scale.</description>
