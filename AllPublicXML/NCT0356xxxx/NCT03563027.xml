    <textblock>
      In this randomized, controlled trial the investigators will compare the use of social and
      financial incentive-based interventions to increase physical activity among overweight and
      obese Veterans during a 12-week intervention with 8 weeks of follow-up.

      In this 3-arm randomized trial, the investigators will compare the effectiveness of a social
      incentive-based gamification intervention with and without loss-framed financial incentives
      to increase physical activity relative to a control among overweight and obese adults
      Veterans. All Veterans will use a Fitbit wearable device to establish a baseline step count,
      select a step goal increase of 33% to 50% above baseline and then participate in a 12-week
      intervention and 8-week follow-up period. The two intervention arms will be entered into a
      game with points and levels designed using insights from behavioral economics. They will be
      asked to select a social support partner who will receive weekly updates on their progress in
      the game. Veterans in one arm will also receive loss-framed financial incentives allocated to
      an account each week during the intervention and financial incentives taken away each day the
      step goal was not achieved.
