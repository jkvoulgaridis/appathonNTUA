  <brief_summary>

      The overall purpose of this project is to investigate the neuro adaptations of pain and
      biomechanical differences between placebo and a custom-made foot orthoses for patients with
      RA.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune, chronic, progressive, systemic inflammatory
      disease leading to substantial pain, disability, and other morbidities. In Denmark there are
      40.000 patients with RA. In RA, synovitis, effusion, eventually erosive arthritis, bone loss
      and weakening of the muscle and tendon apparatus are thought to cause clinically recognizable
      valgus heel or pes planovalgus deformity. These symptoms gradually cause irreversible joint
      deformities and changes in the locomotion of muscles3. Over 85% of patients with RA
      experience painful feet and ankles during the course of the disease. Despite medical
      developments, foot orthotics (FO) are still an important adjunct treatment and are often
      prescribed with the intention to stabilize and align the foot. This is due to a number of
      reasons: 1) persistent foot and ankle problems still occuring even after clinical remission
      is reached. 2) patients with increased disease activity may have mechanical foot impairments
      that need treatment in conjunction with systemic management. and 3) patients, who have not
      responded to or are ineligible for biologic agents, continue to have active foot impairments.
      However, the scientific research literature within FO treatment has lagged behind clinical
      practice, often leading the clinician to recommend interventions based on opinion and past
      experience rather than published evidence9.

      Production of FO is an enormous industry. Consequently, there is a great variety of products
      with different materials, design, manufacturing techniques and procedures. In the literature,
      some FO have been shown to reduce pain however there is a considerable amount for which the
      studies are either inconclusive or refute the effect of FO. This might be due to differences
      in methodology, sparse description of the orthotics and limited information on patient's
      disease type and stage. However, multidisciplinary studies are still limited and it is,
      therefore, too early to come up with guidelines about how these interventions affect the
      human body mechanically from current knowledge. Previous studies have primarily focused on
      how foot orthotics affect pain, foot function, walking speed, forefoot plantar pressure and
      gait parameters, while not considering the mechanical principles on which the rationales for
      FO were originally based. This has led to an abundance of clinical trials that are
      challenging to interpret, as FO clinical outcomes and FO gait mechanics have not been studied
      together.

    <time_frame>Week 4 and 8</time_frame>
    <description>Gait analysis will be performed using a 3D marker-based motion capture system from Qualisys, Sweden.
To investigate gait mechanics, detailed patient-specific musculoskeletal (MS) computer models will be created based on clinical medical images (MRI), anthropometrics and motion capture data. The models will be created utilizing a musculoskeletal computer modeling software AnyBody Modeling System (AMS). A detailed cadaver-based model The Twente Lower Extremity Model 2.0 (TLEM 2.0) is developed for AMS to obtain patient-specific architecture, scale bones, joints, and muscles attachments relative to the patient in combination with image-based morphing techniques. These models will be used to estimate joint angles, joint torques, muscle forces and joint forces of the ankle, knee and hip joint.</description>

    <description>Motion capture
A pressure insole (2-3 mm thick) system (PedarX, Novel) will be placed in the patient's shoe attached to a small computer. It is a commercial available system that can measure accurate and reliable pressure distribution for monitoring local loads between the foot and the FO.</description>

    <description>Measured by temperature sensor (Orthotimer). Orthotimer is an electronic microsensor that documents the wearing time of orthopaedic devices. It is small and flat thermometer, (9 x 1 x 4.5 mm) and will be integrated in the handed-out FO. The sensor stores time, date and temperature every 15 minutes. This information allow for accurate measurements of how often the patients uses the FO.</description>

    <measure>Pain - Pressure pain threshold</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0, 4 and 8</time_frame>
    <description>To investigate pressure pain threshold (PPT) a handheld algometer will be used. An algometer is an instrument used to measure the pain threshold in relevant areas of the leg, foot and arm. The pain threshold is defined as the point where the pressure is experienced as pain. The pressure increases gradually with an interval until the pain is experienced and the patient presses a stop button. Each measurement is repeated 3 times in each session.</description>

    <time_frame>Week 0, 4 and 8</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects will be asked to draw their perceived pain on pain mapping drawings. Drawings will be scanned and layered and averaged though MATLAB, version 2017B (The MathWorks, Inc., Natick, Massachusetts, USA). The area of Pain will be measured using ImangeJ v.1.8.0_112 (National Institutes of Health, Madison, Wisconsin, USA).</description>

    <description>A commercial available accelerometer based activity monitor (Polar M200) will be lent to the participants. The device will be used to monitor the participant's activity. Participants will be instructed to use the device during the two months they are involved in the project, during the placebo period and during FO treatment.</description>
