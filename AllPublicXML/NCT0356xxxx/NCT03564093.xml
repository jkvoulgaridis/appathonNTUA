    <textblock>
      The study objective is to determine if intranasal dexmedetomidine is a safe and effective
      sedative drug during small painful procedures in the pediatric emergency room. Patients of
      the pediatric emergency room at Oulu university hospital with any medical condition requiring
      a small painful procedure like i.v. cannulation or lumbar puncture are asked to join the
      investigator's study if they would seem to benefit from a sedative drug during the procedure.
      Patients are randomly assigned to treatment group receiving intranasal dexmedetomidine 1µg/kg
      and to placebo group receiving 4,5% saline solution. The primary outcome is the success of
      the procedure. Cardiovascular and respiratory effects, the pain experienced by the patient,
      sedation scores and duration of crying are also monitored.

    <description>The success of the first attempt of the procedure (venous cannulation or lumbar puncture) is evaluated at the end of the first attempt of the procedure. Succesfulness of venous cannulation is tested by the doctor on call by flushing the cannula with saline. If the cannula works without complications the cannulation is successfull. Lumbar puncture is successfull if all the samples needed from the liquor are collected.</description>
