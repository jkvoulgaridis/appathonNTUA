  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test whether deposit contracts, wherein individuals invest
      their own money with the study to serve as the incentive, with or without daily feedback
      about progress help individuals to increase step counts and more often meet a step goal
      compared to self-monitoring only.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 68% of adults are overweight or obese, which is associated with increased risk
      for health conditions, including cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and cancer. These
      individuals are more often sedentary than the general population, which compounds the risk
      for these same conditions. While the benefits of engaging in physical activity are
      well-established, few individuals are able to successfully increase activity to recommended
      levels. Existing intervention programs, often derived from theories such as social cognitive
      theory or related theories, have had limited success. Behavioral economics offers a promising
      alternative, suggesting that engagement in any behavior is based on the maximizing utility
      and happiness. Interventions based on this theory aim to increase the immediate benefit of
      engaging in physical activity, often using a financial incentive.

      This study will last for 16 weeks. Each participant will invest $42 with the study, and be
      exposed to to each of three interventions. All participants will have the use of a FitBit for
      ongoing self-monitoring and a step-count goal of 10,000 steps per day. In one condition,
      these will be the only interventions you receive. In one condition, you will receive a
      monetary consequence for meeting or not meeting the goal. Each day during the incentive
      conditions, you will be eligible to lose $0.75 of your own money for not meeting the goal, or
      to earn back $0.75 of your money plus $0.75 from the study (i.e., a total of $1.50) for
      meeting the goal. In the third condition, you will have daily feedback mid-afternoon about
      your distance from the goal and the money you stand to gain or lose. You will be made aware
      of what condition you are in.
