  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators assessed non-organ-specific antibodies before and 24 weeks after the end of
      therapy with direct-acting antivirals, in order to better clarify the clinical relevance of
      these antibodies in terms of treatment response and prognostic value.

      To achieve this goal patients with hepatitis C virus related advanced liver disease, with
      detectable circulating autoantibodies on at least two determinations before treatment, were
      enrolled.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      About 40-70% of hepatitis C virus patients develop at least an autoimmune extra-hepatic
      disorder presumably due to the interaction between hepatitis C virus E2 envelope protein and
      B lymphocyte Cluster of Differentiation-81 receptor. In addition, the same interaction is
      responsible for the production of different serum non-organ-specific antibodies. The clinical
      significance of the latter phenomenon has not been fully understood except for the presence
      of liver kidney microsome-1 antibody, which is linked to a molecular mimicry between the
      cytochrome enzyme CYP2D6, primarily expressed in the liver, and hepatitis C virus proteins in
      genetically predisposed subjects.

      Actually, no data are available about the prevalence and clinical significance of serum
      non-organ-specific antibodies in hepatitis C virus patients treated with second generation
      direct-acting antivirals.
