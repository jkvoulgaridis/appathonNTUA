    <time_frame>week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The CDRS-R is a semi-structured, clinician-rated instrument designed for use with children and adolescents between the ages of 6-17 years and contains 17 ordinally-scaled items that evaluate the presence and severity of symptoms commonly associated with childhood depression. The CDRS-R total score ranges from 17 to 113.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline in Clinical Global Impression-Severity (CGI-S) scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI-S is a clinician-rated scale used to rate the severity of the patient's current state of mental illness compared with an MDD patient population. The patient will be rated on a scale from 1 to 7, with 1 indicating a &quot;normal, not at all ill&quot; and 7 indicating &quot;among the most extremely ill patients.&quot;</description>
