  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and perceived effectiveness of the
      culturally-adapted COMFORT Communication Curriculum in two Native American reservation
      communities. Participants in one community will have an advance care planning conversation
      with a healthcare professional trained in the the culturally-adapted curriculum. Participants
      in the other community will receive usual care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Advance care planning (ACP) is an important component of palliative care (PC), and is a
      critical, ongoing dialogue between health care professionals (HCPs), patients, and families;
      where patients' comprehension of their illness and illness progression, goals of care, and
      treatment choices are discussed. Essential to ACP is the interdisciplinary team, where each
      member must be comfortable and confident initiating conversations about quality of life and
      end-of-life (EOL) care. ACP is often hindered by low health literacy, including PC health
      literacy, uncertainty regarding illness trajectory and end-of-life palliative care (EOLPC)
      options, and lack of awareness about ACP among patients. For HCPs, discomfort, lack of EOL
      communication training, and knowledge of cultural differences are often barriers to ACP.
      Foundational to ACP is PC health literacy, which necessitates considering semantics,
      eliminating misconceptions, and recognizing uncertainty. Ensuring access to ACP for patients
      with serious life-limiting illness requires that all healthcare disciplines receive
      evidence-based EOLPC communication training. The COMFORT communication curriculum (CC) is an
      intervention that trains interdisciplinary HCPs to provide patient- and family-centered EOLPC
      communication. Patient outcomes related to this intervention have not been studied. Moreover,
      the curriculum's efficacy and fit has not been specifically tested with minority groups.
      Native Americans (NA) are disproportionately affected by serious life-limiting conditions and
      life expectancy is 4 years less than all other US races. Despite greater morbidity and
      mortality, NAs use of PC is largely unknown. Yet, it has been identified that tribal
      communities are requesting EOLPC services and will participate in ACP when conducted in a
      culturally-respectful manner. There is an urgent need to develop culturally-relevant
      communication approaches specific to EOLPC, including ACP, for use with NAs with serious
      life-limiting illness. The investigators propose a collaborative clinical trial to: 1)
      Culturally-adapt the COMFORT CC for pilot testing with NA communities; 2) Implement the
      culturally-adapted COMFORT CC in 2 tribal communities by training 20 interdisciplinary
      (nurses, social workers, primary care providers) HCPs to conduct culturally-respectful and
      relevant ACP; 3) Conduct a pilot, wait-list controlled trial of the culturally-adapted
      COMFORT CC in 2 tribal communities to evaluate feasibility, acceptability, and perceived
      effectiveness by comparing 30 NAs completing ACP with a trained HCP and 30 NAs receiving
      usual care. Implementing a culturally-relevant communication intervention to improve EOLPC
      health literacy is a high priority for the Rosebud and Pine Ridge reservations in South
      Dakota. This proposed study will culturally-adapt and evaluate the COMFORT CC on these 2
      reservations and will provide the foundation for an R01-funded intervention study that could
      positively impact EOLPC literacy and outcomes among the 566 US federally recognized NA
      tribes.

    <description>This will be evaluated by patient report using the validated Mishel Uncertainty in Illness Scale- Community (MUIS-C) pre and post outpatient clinic visit only at the intervention site. Uncertainty in illness (construct) is often discussed in relationship to health literacy, and for purposes of this study, end of life palliative care health literacy. This outcome will be evaluated by patient report using the validated MUIS-C, which has been used extensively in cancer, cardiac, and chronic illness patients and in cross-cultural studies. The MUIS-C is a 23-item Likert-format scale, where patients score items from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). The total score range is 23-115, with higher scores indicating a greater level of uncertainty. Reported Cronbach's alphas are 0.74 to 0.92.</description>

    <description>Healthcare professionals participating in the COMFORT Communication Curriculum (CC) training will complete a C-COPE (Comfort with Communication in Palliative and End of Life Care) questionnaire before and after training. This will be done only at the intervention site.The C-COPE operationalizes the key components within the COMFORT CC and is a 28-item instrument including 2-ranked items and 26 Likert-format items, where healthcare professionals score items from 1 (not difficult) to 5 (very difficult). The range of possible C-COPE total scores is 26-130, with higher scores indicating less comfort with end of life palliative care communication, while rated items are categorized according to patient, family, and team communication. Preliminary psychometric analysis of test-retest reliability with ICC &gt; 0.77, internal reliability for total score with Cronbach's alpha = 0.91.</description>
