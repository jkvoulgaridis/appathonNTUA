  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The long-term goal of this research is to apply technologic approaches to improve the use of
      oral oncolytics. The objective of this study is to assess patient adherence to oral
      oncolytics and to validate a currently available smart phone application (iRxReminder)
      partnered with an automated dispensing device, a &quot;Pod&quot;, in affecting patient adherence. The
      rationale for this study is that medication adherence to oncolytics varies and strategies are
      needed to improve it.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The change in the number of patients that report high adherence over time via smart phone application alone</measure>
    <time_frame>0, 4, 8 and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Adherence will be assessed via smart phone application at baseline, 4, 8 and 12 weeks.
Adherence reported via the phone application will be done using an adherence question assessment.This assessment is ordinal in nature and asks the patient to rate their adherence on a scale (poor, fair, good, very good, excellent).</description>

    <measure>The change in the number of patients that report high adherence over time via smart phone application and POD</measure>
    <time_frame>0, 4, 8 and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Adherence will be assessed via smart phone application + POD at baseline, 4, 8 and 12 weeks.
Adherence reported via the phone application will be done using an adherence question assessment.This assessment is ordinal in nature and asks the patient to rate their adherence on a scale (poor, fair, good, very good, excellent).
For the Pod there will be continuous adherence assessed via the pod each time the patient administers or does not administer a scheduled dose. This will be figured into the overall adherence rating.</description>
