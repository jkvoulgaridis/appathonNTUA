        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient is legally competent, has been informed of the study, voluntarily agrees to
             participate, and has signed the informed consent form.

          -  Arteriovenous fistula is located in the arm.

          -  Native AV fistula / graft was created ≥ 30 days prior to the initial procedure and has
             undergone at least one hemodialysis sessions.

          -  Venous stenosis of the AV fistula / graft with the target lesion located from the
             anastomosis to the axillosubclavian junction and an abnormality attributable to the
             stenosis as defined by K/DOQI guidelines.

          -  Patients with a dysfunctional or thrombosed hemodialysis access and a &gt;50% stenosis,
             regardless of prior treatment (All types of lesion and access failure)

          -  If AV access is thrombosed, must undergo a successful thrombectomy with minimal
             residual thrombus.

          -  Intended target lesion or if a tandem lesion can be treated with ≤120 mm of DCBs in
             length.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Life expectancy &lt; 9 months

             duration of the study.

          -  The hemodialysis access is located in the leg.

          -  Patient has more than two lesions in the access circuit.

          -  Patient has a secondary non-target lesion that cannot be successfully treated

          -  Target lesion is located central to the axillosubclavian junction.

          -  Surgical revision of the access site planned.

          -  Recent surgical interventions of the access site.

          -  Known allergy or sensitivity to iodinated contrast media, that cannot be adequately
             managed with pre- and post-procedure medication.

          -  Known allergy or sensitivity to paclitaxel.

          -  Patients who are taking immunosuppressive therapy, or routinely taking ≥ 10 mg of
             prednisone per day.

          -  Patients who have a medical condition, in the opinion of the Investigator, that may
             cause the patient to be noncompliant to the protocol or confound the data.

          -  Patients anticipating a kidney transplant.

          -  Patients anticipating a conversion to peritoneal dialysis.

          -  The patient has a stent located in the target or secondary non-target lesion.

          -  Patient has an active infection in the AV access or a systemic infection.
