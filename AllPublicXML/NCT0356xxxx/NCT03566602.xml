      The objective of the study is to clinically assess the safety and performance of the Dura
      Sealant Patch as a means of reducing intra- as well as post-operative CSF leakage in patients
      undergoing elective cranial intradural surgery with a dural closure procedure.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Preoperative Subjects who are able to provide a written informed consent prior to
        participating in the clinical investigation.

        Subjects who are ≥ 18 years old. Subjects who are able to comply with the follow-up or
        other study requirements. Subjects who are planned for an elective intracranial intradural
        surgery in whom a dural incision of at least 2 cm in length is necessary, which will be
        closed.

        Female subjects of child bearing potential must agree to use any form of contraception from
        the time of signing the informed consent form through 90 days post-surgery.

        Intraoperative Surgical wound classification Class I/Clean. Minimally 5 mm of dural space
        surrounding dural opening.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Preoperative Female subjects who are pregnant or breastfeeding. Subjects with an assumed
        impaired coagulation due to medication or otherwise. Subjects suspected of an infection
        requiring antibiotics. Subjects with any type of dural diseases in planned dural closure
        area. Subjects requiring re-opening of planned surgical area within 90 days after surgery.

        Subjects requiring local radiotherapy in planned surgical area. Subjects with a known
        allergy to any of the components of the Dura Sealant Patch.

        Subject who previously participated in this study or any investigational drug or device
        study within 30 days of screening.

        Subjects with a presence of hydrocephalus. Intraoperative Subjects in whom elevation of
        PEEP or pCO2 has a potential detrimental effect. Subjects who will require a CSF or wound
        drain, electrodes or other devices passing the dural layer or extra to intracranial bypass
        surgery.

        Primary closure of the dura mater with synthetic, non-autologous or autologous material
        other than galea.

        A gap &gt; 3 mm after primary closure of the dura mater.
