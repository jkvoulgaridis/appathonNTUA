  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall aim of this study is to assess the effects of a new treatment called Secukinumab
      in adults suffering from moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. Furthermore, the study shall
      support the extension of the approval for Secukinumab from psoriasis to atopic dermatitis.
      The effectiveness of Secukinumab is determined on the reduction of the eczema score EASI 50
      (Eczema Area and Severity Index, a tool to measure the severity of atopic dermatitis) at week
      4.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Secukinumab is a humanized anti-IL-17A monoclonal antibody. Since Secukinumab is well
      established in the therapy of psoriasis with a highly favorable benefit to risk ration and
      IL-17 has been described in atopic dermatitis this study aims to investigate the effects of
      anti-IL-17 in atopic dermatitis.

      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter, double-blinded study to evaluate the
      efficacy and safety of subcutaneous Secukinumab compared to placebo in 45 adults with atopic
      dermatitis.

      The study consists of 3 periods: a screening period of at least -14 days and up to -35 days,
      and a treatment period of 16 weeks and a follow-up period of additional 8 weeks. During the
      screening period eligibility of the patients is confirmed. Eligible patients are randomized
      2:1 to treatment arm A or B at Day -7 (+2 to -15) during the randomization visit. Secukinumab
      (Cosentyx®) will be used according to the official label and SmPC (Summary of Product
      Characteristics). Patients in treatment arm A receive 300 mg Secukinumab administered as 2
      subcutaneous injections of 150 mg (i.e. 2x 150 mg) at baseline day 1 and week 1, 2, 3, 4, 8,
      12 and injections with placebo at week 5, 6, 7 and 16. For assessments of the study endpoints
      visits are performed at weeks 20 and 24. Placebo will be administered as 2 subcutaneous
      injections. Patients in treatment arm B receive placebo until visit 3 (week 3) and will
      switch to Secukinumab 300 mg s.c. up from visit 4 (week 4), visit 5, 6, 7, 8, 12 and16. For
      assessments of the study endpoints visits are performed at weeks 20 and 24.

             allowed to participate.

             including chronic infections,

          4. Contraindications of Secukinumab by label (i.e. approval for the treatment of
             psoriasis in the EU - refer to point 14 - 16 at the bottom of this section),

                  contraception and should not be used alone,

                  The following methods are considered more effective than the barrier method and

               2. Total abstinence: When this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of
                  the subject (Periodic abstinence [e.g. calendar, ovulation, symptothermal,
                  post-ovulation methods] and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of

                  In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has
                  been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment,

               4. Male partner sterilization (at least 6 months prior to screening). For female
                  subjects on the study, the vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner
                  for that subject,

               5. Use of established oral, injected or implanted hormonal methods of contraception,
                  intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS) NOTE: Women are considered
                  post-menopausal and not of child bearing potential if they have had:

             i. 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile
             (e.g. age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or • six months of spontaneous
             amenorrhea with serum FSH levels &gt;40 mIU/mL

             Or

             ii. Surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation
             at least six weeks before taking study treatment. In case of oophorectomy alone, only
             when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone
             level assessment is she considered not of child bearing potential.

         12. History of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection or positive HIV serology at
             screening,

         13. Positive with hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) or hepatitis C antibody at the
             screening visit (a report ≤ 6 months is also accepted),

         14. History of alcohol or drug abuse within 1 year of the screening visit,

         15. Planned major surgical procedure during the patient's participation in this study,

         16. Hypersensitivity against Secukinumab,

         17. Active or reactive tuberculosis,
