      QUILT-3.088 NANT Pancreatic Cancer Vaccine: Phase II Randomized Trial of the NANT Pancreatic
      Cancer Vaccine vs. Standard-of-Care as First- Line Treatment for Patients with Metastatic
      Pancreatic Cancer.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a two-cohort, open-label, randomized phase 2 study to evaluate the safety and
      efficacy (as assessed by PFS) of the NANT Pancreatic Cancer Vaccine regimen (experimental
      arms) vs SoC therapy (control arms) as first-line treatment for subjects with metastatic
      pancreatic cancer.

      Subjects will be enrolled into two independent cohorts based on ECOG status. Subjects with
      ECOG 0-1 will be randomized 1:1 to receive the NANT Pancreatic Cancer Vaccine regimen
      (experimental arm) or gemcitabine in combination with nab-paclitaxel (control arm), while
      subjects with ECOG 2 will be randomized 1:1 to receive the NANT Pancreatic Cancer Vaccine
      regimen (experimental arm) or gemcitabine monotherapy (control arm).

      The experimental arms will be administered in two phases, an induction and a subsequent
      maintenance phase. The treatment regimen administered in the experimental arms will be
      identical for all subjects, independent of ECOG status. Subjects may continue induction
      treatment for up to 1 year. Those who have a complete response (CR) in the induction phase
      will enter the maintenance phase of the study. Subjects who experience ongoing stable disease
      (SD) or an ongoing partial response (PR) after 1 year of induction phase treatment may enter
      the maintenance phase at the Investigator's discretion. Subjects may remain on the
      maintenance phase of the study for up to 1 year.

      Treatment in the study will be discontinued if the subject experiences confirmed PD or
      unacceptable toxicity, withdraws consent, or if the Investigator feels it is no longer in the
      subject's best interest to continue treatment. Subjects receiving treatment in the control
      arms may cross over to treatment in the induction phase of the experimental arms after
      experiencing PD. Subjects receiving treatment in the experimental arms with an initial
      assessment of PD per RECIST 1.1 may, at the discretion of the Investigator, continue to
      receive study treatment until PD is confirmed. The maximum time on study treatment is 2
      years.

    <intervention_model_description>This is a randomized parallel group study comparing the NANT Pancreatic Cancer Vaccine and standard therapy with respect to efficacy and safety in treatment naïve patients with pancreatic cancer. Patients will be stratified by ECOG status and then randomized 1:1 to receive either the NANT Pancreatic Vaccine (n~532) or standard therapy with gemcitabine alone (ECOG 2; n~266) or combined with nab-paclitaxel (ECOG 0-1; n~266). Treatment may continue for up to 2 years or until documented progression (RECIST v 1.1) or unacceptable toxicity. Patients on standard therapy who progress or experience unacceptable toxicity may crossover to receive NANT Pancreatic Vaccine.</intervention_model_description>

             profiling. If an historic specimen is not available, the subject must be willing to
             undergo a biopsy during the screening period, if considered safe by the Investigator.

          7. Must be willing to provide blood samples prior to the start of treatment on this study
             for prospective tumor molecular profiling and exploratory analyses.

          8. Must be willing to provide a tumor biopsy specimen 8 weeks after the start of
             treatment for exploratory analyses, if considered safe by the Investigator.

             by this protocol.

         10. Agreement to practice effective contraception for female subjects of child-bearing
             potential and non-sterile males. Female subjects of child-bearing potential must agree

             non-sterile male subjects must agree to use a condom for up to 4 months after
             treatment. Effective contraception includes surgical sterilization (eg, vasectomy,
             tubal ligation), two forms of barrier methods (eg, condom, diaphragm) used with
             spermicide, intrauterine devices (IUDs), and abstinence.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Serious uncontrolled concomitant disease that would contraindicate the use of the
             investigational drug used in this study or that would put the subject at high risk for
             treatment-related complications.

          2. Systemic autoimmune disease (eg, lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, Addison's
             disease, autoimmune disease associated with lymphoma).

          3. History of organ transplant requiring immunosuppression.

          4. History of or active inflammatory bowel disease (eg, Crohn's disease, ulcerative
             colitis).

          5. Inadequate organ function, evidenced by the following laboratory results:

               1. Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &lt; 1,000 cells/mm^3.

               2. Platelet count &lt; 75,000 cells/mm^3.

               3. Total bilirubin greater than the upper limit of normal (ULN; unless the subject
                  has documented Gilbert's syndrome).

               4. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST [SGOT]) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT [SGPT])
                  &gt; 2.5 × ULN (&gt; 5 × ULN in subjects with liver metastases).

               5. Alkaline phosphatase levels (ALP) &gt; 2.5 × ULN (&gt; 5 × ULN in subjects with liver
                  metastases, or &gt;10 × ULN in subjects with bone metastases).

               6. Serum creatinine &gt; 2.0 mg/dL or 177 μmol/L.

               7. Serum anion gap &gt; 16 mEq/L or arterial blood with pH &lt; 7.3.

             accident/stroke, or myocardial infarction within 6 months prior to first study
             medication; unstable angina; congestive heart failure of New York Heart Association
             grade 2 or higher; or serious cardiac arrhythmia requiring medication. Subjects with
             uncontrolled hypertension should be medically managed on a stable regimen to control
             hypertension prior to study entry.

          7. Serious myocardial dysfunction defined by echocardiogram (ECHO) as absolute left
             ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) 10% below the institution's lower limit of
             predicted normal.

          8. Dyspnea at rest due to complications of advanced malignancy or other disease requiring
             continuous oxygen therapy.

          9. Positive results of screening test for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).

         10. Current chronic daily treatment (continuous for &gt; 3 months) with systemic
             corticosteroids (dose equivalent to or greater than 10 mg/day methylprednisolone),

             ketoconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole, clarithromycin, indinavir, nefazodone,
             nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, telithromycin, voriconazole, and grapefruit
             products) or strong CYP3A4 inducers (including phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifampin,
             rifabutin, rifapentin, phenobarbital, and St John's Wort) within 14 days before study
