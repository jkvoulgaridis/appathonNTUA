    <textblock>
      This is a window-of-opportunity trial to determine if atorvastatin given for 1 to 4 weeks at
      a dose of 80 milligrams per day (mg/day) is sufficient to decrease the level of
      conformational mutant tumor protein 53 (p53) in malignant diseases (solid tumor and relapsed
      Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)).

             null.

          -  Participants with histologic or cytologic confirmation of any malignant disease who
             are planning and eligible to undergo surgical resection. For participants with Solid

             cancers: bladder, gastric, colon, endometrial, cervical/dysplasia, melanoma, or
             breast), unless a complete remission was achieved at least 2 years prior to study
             entry AND no additional therapy is required during the study period
