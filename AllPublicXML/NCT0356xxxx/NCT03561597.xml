    <textblock>
      Background: The Expert Committee on the Assessment, Prevention and Treatment of Child and
      Adolescent Overweight and Obesity recommends a staged based approach to the management of
      adolescents with overweight and obesity from Stage 1-4 with increasing intensity of
      management in higher stages. Mobile health application is an attractive community based
      treatment for adolescent obesity due to its wide penetration and convenience. Early weight
      loss has been found to be the strongest predictor of good long term outcome in obesity.
      However there is currently no known study that use early weight loss as a predictor factor
      for a stepped up approach using a mobile health application.

      Clinical significance: The current study use a mobile health intervention to identify
      participants with early weight loss in a stepped up approach.

      Primary objective will be to examine the proportion of patients triaged to the low risk
      Weight Management Clinics (WMC) after brief intervention by a nurse coordination and
      completion of 4 sessions of Kurbo Program over a 12 month recruitment period.

      Secondary objectives will be to examine changes in BMI z-score, metabolic profile, examine
      program feasibility and fidelity and explore other predictors of poor response to program.

      Methodology:

      Children aged 13-17 years old with BMI percentile of above 90th percentile, who are referred
      to the WMC, will receive a brief intervention by the WMC nurse coordinator followed by
      introduction to Kurbo program, a multifunctional mobile application, for more detailed
      dietary and physical activity recommendations and implementation of behavioural changes.
      Patients that are able to engage with Kurbo intervention and showed a decrease in BMI
      percentile over 4 sessions of Kurbo will be offered the low risk weight management clinic.

      At baseline, month 3 and month 6, the patient's weight and height, body fat composition,
      waist circumference and blood pressure will be measured as per usual standard protocol.
      Questionnaires to assess eating, quality of life and dietary recall will be administered as
      part of the research. Accelerometers will also be fitted to assess physical activity.

      At baseline and month 6, metabolic blood tests (HbA1C, fasting lipid panel, oral glucose
      tolerance test, fasting insulin level and liver function test) were collected after a minimum
      8 hour fasting period together with bloods for aromatic amino acid, branch chain amino acid
      and long chain acylcarnitines .

      Current low risk WMC patients will be offered 2 monthly follow up with optional dietician and
      exercise physiologists counselling and exercise sessions. The high risk WMC patients will be
      routinely offered the standard high risk follow up protocol consisting of weekly follow up
      with the multidisciplinary team for 4 weeks followed by 2 weekly appointments for 2 months
      and monthly appointment thereafter based on clinical response.

    <measure>Mean BMI z-score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>To examine the effect of the waitlist intervention and WMC intervention on mean BMI z-score change at baseline, 3 months and 6 months. Body mass index (BMI) will be calculated as kg/m2 and BMI-z score calculated using the L, M, S parameters published by the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention. BMI z-score are measures of relative weight adjusted for child age and sex. Reduction of more than 0.25 in childhood obesity has been found to be clinically significant for reduction of cardiovascular risk factors.</description>

    <description>To examine the effects of waitlist intervention on disordered eating at baseline, 3 and 6 months. Psychological dimensions of eating behaviors were determined using a validated self-reporting Eating Pattern Inventory for Children (EPI-C) at visit 0 and visit 2. The 20-item questionnaire assessed four dimensions ((dietary restraint, external eating, parental pressure to eat, and emotional eating). Responses to each item were listed on a 4-point Likert scale (1 = not at all, 2 = sometimes, 3 = mostly, 4 = always). Higher scores in the respective dimensions are indicative of greater external eating, emotional eating, dietary restraint or parental pressure to eat.</description>

    <description>Participants will undergo Kurbo program, a Mobile health application, for more detailed dietary and physical activity recommendations and implementation of behavioural changes. The patient's progress will be reviewed by the nurse clinician at one month post intervention to determine whether the BMI percentile has shown a reduction through the Kurbo Program. Patients that declined Kurbo intervention, has a BMI of more than 99th percentile or continue to have increase in their BMI percentile in Kurbo program, will be offered the high risk weight management clinic appointment for a more detailed multidisciplinary evaluation for targeted intervention. Patients that are able to engage with Kurbo intervention and showed a decrease in BMI percentile over 4 sessions of Kurbo will be offered the low risk weight management clinic (WMC). There will be a month 3 and month 6 visit for study measurements in this study.</description>

    <description>The Kurbo program is a multifunctional mobile application that aid adolescents and their families to learn healthy eating habits and weight management through the use of a mobile application with dietary self-monitoring and weekly interactive coaching sessions. Using the Kurbo app, adolescents track their food and exercise, as well as learn about healthy behaviours through games and videos. The Kurbo coaches check in with adolescents for 15 minutes once a week via video, phone or text over a 12 weeks period.</description>
