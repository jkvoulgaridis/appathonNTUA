  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bivalirudin is widely used as an anticoagulant to reduce the risk of bleeding in PCI
      perioperative period. Additionally, 15.7%-32.7% patients have diabetes mellitus who undergo
      percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI), so bivalirudin was used to anticoagulate in these
      patients to evaluate its safety and efficacy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bivalirudin is a specific reversible thrombin direct inhibitor and the function of thrombin
      activity site can be recovered through hydrolyzing bivalirudin by thrombin. Therefore,
      bivalirudin is widely used as an anticoagulant during percutaneous coronary intervention
      (PCI) for coronary heart disease, and 15.7%-32.7% patients have diabetes mellitus who undergo
      percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI). At the same time, elderly patients have higher
      risk of bleeding whose age over 65, so bivalirudin can reduce the risk of bleeding and the
      incidence of net adverse clinical events for the elderly patients whose age over 65 with
      diabetes mellitus in PCI perioperative period.
