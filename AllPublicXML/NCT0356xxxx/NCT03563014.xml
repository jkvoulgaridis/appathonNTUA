  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this non interventional study is to describe the proportion of Belgian mCRPC
      patients which were treated with 1 to 4 and 5 to 6 Radium-223 injections and the patient
      characteristics which are potentially associated with this proportion.
