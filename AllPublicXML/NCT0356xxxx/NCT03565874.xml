  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mothers who deliver prematurely (&lt;37 weeks of gestational age) experience intense stress and
      anxiety given that their child's survival and development might be compromised. From the
      existing literature, it is known that a heart rate variability biofeedback (HRVB) program
      increases heart rate variability (HRV), which in turn, is related to significant reductions
      in perceived stress and anxiety. This study's aim is to evaluate the feasibility of an HRVB
      program in a sample of mothers who delivered prematurely.

    <measure>Satisfaction Regarding the Intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>After completing the HRVB program (on average 3 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Satisfaction will be measured through a questionnaire. Questions will be asked about global satisfaction, utility, timing and difficulty about their experience (assessed on single item Likert scale).
Higher scores reflects more satisfaction. Possible range 2 to 10.</description>

    <measure>Stress</measure>
    <time_frame>Before and after completing the HRVB program (on average 3 weeks).</time_frame>
    <description>Perceived stress will be measured on the Perceived Stress Scale-14 (PSS-14). PSS-14 score is calculated on 14 items ranging from 0 to 4. The 7 positive state items (4,5,6,7,9,10 and 13) must have their score reversed (0=4, 1=3, 2=2, 3=1, 4=0) in order to calculate the total score by summing up all 14 items.(Min=0, Max=56). Higher scores indicate a higher level of stress. A validated French version of the PSS will be used.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>PTSD</measure>
    <time_frame>Before and after completing the HRVB program (on average 3 weeks).</time_frame>
    <description>Post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms will be measured with the Post-traumatic stress disorder checklist (PCL-5) for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-Fifth Edition (DSM-5). PCL-5 is a 20 items self-report measure that assesses the presence and severity of PTSD symptoms. Items on the PCL-5 correspond to DSM-5 criteria for PTSD. Each item is rated on a 5 point Likert scale (from &quot;Not at all&quot; to &quot;Extremely&quot;). Total score is calculated by adding up scores for all items (Min = 0, Max = 80). Higher scores indicate a higher level of PTSD. A validated French version of the PCL will be used.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Anxiety</measure>
    <time_frame>Before and after completing the HRVB program (on average 3 weeks).</time_frame>
    <description>Anxiety symptoms will be measured with the State and Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). STAI score is calculated on 40 items (20 items assessing trait anxiety and 20 items assessing state anxiety) rated on a 4 point Likert scale (from &quot;Almost never&quot; to &quot;Almost always&quot;). Total score for state and trait anxiety is calculated by adding up all items (Min = 20, Max = 80).
Higher scores indicate a higher level of anxiety. A validated French version of the STAI will be used.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Depression</measure>
    <time_frame>Before and after completing the HRVB program (on average 3 weeks).</time_frame>
    <description>Depression symptoms will be assessed with a 13-item short form of the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), which is a 13-item, self-report rating inventory that measures symptoms of depression. The scale for each item goes from 0 to 3.
Total score is calculated by adding up scores from each item (Min = 0, Max = 39).
Higher scores indicate a higher level of depression. A validated French version of the BDI will be used.</description>

PCL-5 is a 20 items self-report measure that assesses the presence and severity of PTSD symptoms. Items on the PCL-5 correspond to DSM-5 criteria for PTSD. Each item is rated on a 5 point Likert scale (from &quot;Not at all&quot; to &quot;Extremely&quot;). Total score is calculated by adding up scores for all items (Min = 0, Max = 80). Higher scores indicate a higher level of PTSD. A validated French version of the PCL will be used.</description>

        <description>Anxiety symptoms will be measured with the State and Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). STAI score is calculated on 40 items (20 items assessing trait anxiety and 20 items assessing state anxiety) rated on a 4 point Likert scale (from &quot;Almost never&quot; to &quot;Almost always&quot;). Total score for state and trait anxiety is calculated by adding up all items (Min = 20, Max = 80).
Higher scores indicate a higher level of anxiety. A validated French version of the STAI will be used.</description>

Heart rate variability biofeedback: Before the start of the program and after one week of adherence to the program, two sessions will be conducted with a psychologist in order to define each participant’s individual resonance frequency (i.e., breathing rhythm allowing for cardiac coherence), using the Nexus program from Mindmedia company. Then, each participant will receive training on the HRVB program using an Emwave device. The HRVB program itself will be carried individually for 20 min daily over the course of two weeks. Five daily sessions of 10 minutes will be considered as the minimum adherence to the program. Each participant will be asked to report in a diary all eventual major stressful life events.</description>
