  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children requiring prolonged courses of PN are at risk for developing PN associated liver
      disease. We hypothesize that although omega-6 fatty acid emulsions prevent fatty acid
      deficiency, they are not cleared in a manner similar to enteral chylomicrons and therefore
      accumulate in the liver and resulting in steatotic liver injury. We further hypothesize that
      a fat emulsion comprised of omega-3 fatty acids (i.e., fish oil) such as Omegaven® would be
      beneficial in the management of steatotic liver injury by its inhibition of de novo
      lipogenesis, the reduction of arachidonic acid-derived inflammatory mediators, prevention of
      essential fatty acid deficiency through the presence of small amounts of arachidonic acid,
      and improved clearance of lipids from the serum.

    <description>After the diagnosis of PNALD is made, patients who are followed by the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, NICU, will contact Dr. Honrubia and Dr. Swarup. Cases may also include referrals of patients with PNALD from other healthcare facilities or self-referrals. If the patient's parents or guardians agree to participate in the study, informed consent will be obtained. The history of present illness and past medical history will be reviewed with the guardian and pertinent demographic and medical information will be recorded on data collection forms. This form will be used to record all laboratory results, nutritional history, and descriptions of any liver biopsies performed.</description>

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        - 1. Inborn and transferred newborns born between the gestational age of 22-40 weeks who
        develop chronic liver failure, secondary to parenteral nutrition.

        2. Patients will be PN dependent (unable to meet nutritional needs soley by enteral
        nutrition) and are expected to require PN for at least another 30 days 3. Patients must
        have diagnosis of parenteral nutrition associated liver disease (PNALD) as defined by serum
        direct bilirubin greater than 2mg/dL on 2 consecutive occasions 4. have had PNALD for at
        least four weeks prior to planned Omegaven initiation 5. Direct bilirubin &gt; 2.0 mg/dl 6.
        Signed patient informed consent. 7. The patient must have utilized standard therapies to
        prevent the progression of his/her liver disease including surgical treatment, cyclic PN,
        avoiding overfeeding, reduction/removal of copper and manganese from PN, advancement of
        enteral feeding, and the use of ursodiol (i..e., Actigall®).

        Exclusion Criteria:

        - 2. Other causes of chronic liver disease (Hepatitis C, Cystic fibrosis, biliary atresia,
        and alpha 1 anti-trypsin deficiency,) 3. severe and/or unstable concomitant systemic
        disease such as complex congenital cardiac disease, renal failure, autoimmune disease,
        sepsis, inborn error of metabolism, genetic liver disease, 4. bleeding disorder; 5.
        biochemical disturbance with potential of worsening with proposed treatment, e.g.
        persistent hyperglycemia, hypertriglyceridemia, hypercalcemia.

        6. The parent or guardian or child unwilling to provide consent or assent In rare
        instances, patients diagnosed with PNALD may later be found to have liver disease due to
        other causes in addition to the use of PN (i.e., inborn errors of metabolism, viral
        infections ). Such causes may not be known at the time of enrollment and will not preclude
        them from continuing in the study.
