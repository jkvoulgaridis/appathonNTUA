    <textblock>
      This study will determine the safety and tolerability and establish a preliminary recommended
      Phase 2 dose of MK-4830 administered as monotherapy and in combination with pembrolizumab
      (MK-3475) in participants with advanced solid tumors; determine the safety and tolerability
      for the combination of MK-4830 with pembrolizumab + carboplatin/pemetrexed in participants
      with non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), and MK-4830 in combination with pembrolizumab +
      lenvatinib in renal cell cancer; and to evaluate objective response rate (ORR) in
      participants with advanced solid tumors treated with MK-4830 in combination with
      pembrolizumab.
