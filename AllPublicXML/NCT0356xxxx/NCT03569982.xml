  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      MOHS method is an effective surgical technique to remove skin cancerous tumors in the
      head-neck area. Patients undergoing MOHS surgery are struggled with emotional stress during
      the day of surgery, due to fear of significant damage to the body's image and anxiety about
      the need for repeated surgeries. In this study we will examine the effect of integrative
      medicine (including acupuncture, touch/manual, and breathing/relaxation modalities) on the
      reduction of anxiety and pain in patients undergoing MOHS surgery.

    <textblock>
      MOHS method is an effective surgical technique to remove skin cancerous tumors in the
      head-neck area, with immediate microscopic examination in a frozen slice of the full margin.
      Patients undergoing MOHS surgery are struggled with emotional stress during the day of
      surgery, due to fear of significant damage to the body's appearance and image and anxiety
      about the need for repeated surgeries performed on the same day to remove the tumor. In this
      study we will examine the effect of integrative medicine (including acupuncture,
      touch/manual, and breathing/relaxation modalities) on the reduction of anxiety and pain in
      patients undergoing MOHS surgery. The study was designed on the basis of interdisciplinary
      collaboration of researchers from plastic, integrative and gynecological medicine.
