  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this clinical investigation is to evaluate the clinical benefits of left
      ventricle (LV) only pacing combined with automatic adjustment of AV timing (SyncAV) in
      patients receiving cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) after 6 months of therapy.

      This clinical investigation is a prospective, two-arm, randomized 1:1, multicenter
      feasibility study designed to evaluate the effectiveness of LV only with multipoint pacing
      (MPP) and SyncAV compared to bi-ventricular pacing with MPP and SyncAV. The clinical
      investigation will be conducted at approximately 7 centers in Europe and Canada.
      Approximately 120 subjects will be enrolled in the study. No site may enroll more than 33% of
      the total subjects.

      Data will be collected at enrollment, CRT implant procedure, hospital pre-discharge, one and
      6 months post implant. Enrollment data collection will include demographics, cardiovascular
      history, medication, echocardiography measurements and quality of life questionnaire. CRT
      implant procedure data collection will include implanted system information and lead
      location. The electrical conduction recording procedure will include surface ECG and device
      IEGM recordings during various pacing configurations at implant or up to 45 days post
      implant. In patients who consent to invasive measurements (expected target of at least 80
      patients), a hemodynamic recording procedure will include invasive hemodynamic measurements
      during various pacing configurations which may take place during device implant or up to 45
      days post implant. Hospital pre-discharge data collection will take place within 3 days after
      the CRT implant, electrical conduction recordings visit or hemodynamic recordings visit and
      will include system information, surface ECG, and device IEGMs.

      In a subset of patients from selected centers that have access to this technology (expected
      20 patients), non-invasive electrical activation data will be collected with body surface
      mapping within 45 days of the implant procedure.

      Patients will be randomized 1:1 to receive either biventricular pacing with multipoint pacing
      (MPP) or LV-only pacing with MPP at the one-month (± 15 days) visit. The 6-month (± 15 days)
      post randomization follow up visit will include surface ECG, IEGMs, echocardiographic
      parameters and quality of life questionnaire.

      Subjects participating in this clinical investigation will follow the hospital center
      standard of care from implant to 6 month follow up. The expected duration of enrollment is
      1.5 year. The total duration of the clinical investigation is expected to be 2 years.
