  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The trial is an observational, multi-center study to determine if a new blood test
      (Immunobiogram®) done after renal transplant can help predict how well the immune system is
      working and responding to a new kidney. These blood tests could, in the future, potentially
      guide how doctors manage patient's anti-rejection medication.

    <textblock>
      Rejection in renal transplants is a major problem unsolved in the long term, as 30-50% of
      patients lose their kidney due to rejection, or rejection mechanisms are involved elsewhere.
      One of the presumed key factors that may deliver such bad outcomes is the difficulties to
      personalise immunosuppressive treatment; a medical need that currently relies on
      immunosuppressive levels for some medications (pharmacokinetics), clinical guideline
      recommendations, adverse events profiles and some expensive biomarkers which are not widely
      used. Immunobiogram® (IMBG) is a tool that evaluates the sensitivity/resistance profile of
      patients to each of the most widely used and representative immunosuppressant drugs (IM).
      Thus, IMBG offers information that could become pivotal in clinical management of renal
      transplanted patients, if its potential benefits are proven. In this clinical study, a
      technology validation will be performed in which the robustness of the bioassay will be
      evaluated; and a correlation between the current clinical prognoses of each patient and
      resistance patterns will be explored.

    <description>Robustness of Immunobiogram® (IMBG) as an In Vitro Diagnostic Bioassay to study the sensitivity/resistance patterns of Immunosuppressant drugs in Renal Transplantation, evaluated as follows:
Immunobiogram® offers personal sensitivity/resistance patterns of Immunosuppressive Medications (IM), with a range of responses for each IM drug considering all patients included
Immunobiogram® shows intrasubject consistency in terms of similarity with a maximum +/- 20% of variation in the inhibitory dose/distance 50 (ID50), in the three IMBG performed on inclusion; and additionally, similar consistency must be observed in the last three IMBG performed one month after inclusion</description>

    <arm_group_label>ARM 1-Bad vs Good Clinical Evolution</arm_group_label>
    <description>This arm is intended to evaluate the correlation of Immunobiogram® sensitivity/resistance patterns with clinical prognosis as it may be judged at this moment considering clinical outcomes and immune-biomarker evolution in the past 12 to 18 months. Thus, it may confirm the BH-Pilot study findings. Renal transplant patients of two types will be included:
Patients who, over previous months, have had a bad clinical evolution, in which rejection mechanisms were involved
Patients with a good and stable clinical evolution
IMBG sensitivity/resistance profiles will be compared amongst the two groups to evaluate the differences.</description>
  </arm_group>
  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>ARM 2-Stable Renal Transplant Patients</arm_group_label>
    <description>This arm is intended to evaluate robustness of Immunobiogram® as an IVD test. Thus, it will be performed intrasubject comparisons and inter-time evaluation of two sets of Immunobiogram® separated by 30+/- 10 days, each including three IMBG determinations (IMBGx3 - IMBGx3, the two sets separated by 30+/- 10 days). The intended evaluation will be to analyse the similarities between all IMBG tests performed, both between the same set and also between the two sets planned.</description>
