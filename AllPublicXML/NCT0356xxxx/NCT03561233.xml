  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Proton pump inhibitor (PPI) twice daily dosing regimen—a standard dose therapy for
      gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)—is an effective therapy for uncomplicated GERD in
      systemic sclerosis (SSc) but there is no data of response rate of standard dose of PPI and
      predictors of PPI-partial response (PPI-PR) GERD in SSc.Objectives of the study were to
      determine the prevalence of omeprazole partial response GERD in SSc and to define the
      predictors of PPI-PR GERD in SSc. Adult SSc patients having GERD were treated with omeprazole
      20 mg twice daily 30 minutes before meal for 4 weeks. Severity of symptom-grading by visual
      analogue scale (VAS) and frequency of symptoms by frequency scale for symptoms of GERD (FSSG)
      were assessed at baseline and 4 weeks after treatment. PPI-PR GERD was defined by less than
      50% improvement in VAS of severity of symptom and acid reflux score by FSSG after treatment
      compare to baseline.

    <measure>Changing severity of heart burn of SSc related GERD evaluated by visual analogue score (VAS) Changing Severity of Heart Burn of SSc Evaluated by Visual Analogue Score (VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>VAS scale 0-100 was applied for an outcome measurement of the severity of heart burn. The VAS scale 0 was no symptoms of heart burn and scale 100 was a maximum symptom of heart burn. The changing of the severity of heart burn was the changing of VAS before and after treatment. PPI-PR GERD is defined when the changing of severity of heart burn is improvement less than 50% compare to baseline.</description>

    <measure>Changing of Frequency of Symptoms in SSc related GERD Evaluated by Frequency Scale for the Symptoms of GERD (FSSG)</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Unit scale 0-48 was applied for an outcome measurement of the frequency of symptoms. The unit scale 0 was no symptom and scale 48 was usual symptom of GERD. The changing of the frequency of symptoms was the changing of the unit scale before and after treatment. PPI-PR GERD is defined when the changing of frequency of symptom in SSc related GERD evaluated by FSSG is improvement less than 50% compare to baseline.</description>

    <description>The number of dcSSc subset in the patient who response to omeprazole and partial response to omeprazole, DcSSc is defined as yes or no when the patient has skin tightness includes trunk and both extremities and not include trunk and extremities, respectively.</description>

    <description>The number of dysphagia in the patients who response to omeprazole and partial response to omeprazole. Esophageal dysphagia is defined as yes or no when the patients has dysphagia and no dysphagia symptom, respectively.</description>

    <description>The number of age&gt;60 years in the patients who response to omeprazole and partial response to omeprazole. Age&gt;60 is defined as yes or no when the patient has age&gt;60 and equal or less than 60 years, respectively.</description>

    <measure>The proportion of participant with modified Rodnan skin score (mRSS)&gt;20 between the patient who response to omeprazole and partial response to omeprazole</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The number of mRSS&gt;20 in the patients who response to omeprazole and partial response to omeprazole. The mRSS was assessed at 17 sites; viz., the face, chest, abdomen, arms, forearms, hands, fingers, thighs, legs and feet. Assessment was rated as 0 (normal skin thickness), 1 (mild but definite skin thickness), 2 (moderate thickness), or 3 (sever thickness with inability to pinch a fold of skin). The score was calculated by summing the rating score from all 17 areas (range, 0-51). mRSS&gt; 20 is defined as yes or no when the patient has mRSS&gt;20 and equal or less than 20, respectively.</description>
