      Interpretation of endoscopic characteristics of colorectal polyps with Blue Light Imaging A
      study of BLI images and videos of colorectal polyps will be presented initially as a training
      set followed by with explanation and teaching in a didactic session to two separate groups. A
      post-test will be conducted to look at the quality of the learning experience.

      To evaluate the teaching tool regarding the criteria for BLI images of colorectal polyps by
      the following measures

        -  Inter-observer agreement between same and different groups

        -  Accuracy in describing the morphology of colorectal polyps • This new teaching tool will
           improve

        -  Inter-observer agreement by at least 5%- 10% (depending on the group)

        -  Accuracy by at least 5%- 10% (depending on the group)• To determine the improvement of
           inter-observer agreement in identifying/ describing colorectal polyps after the didactic
           session in both the groups

        -  Overall Accuracy, Sensitivity, Specificity, Positive predictive value and negative
           predictive value pre-and post-test in both the groups

        Study participants are contacted while they are at the VA medical centre. All
        gastroenterology attending physicians, gastroenterology fellows, residents and medical
        students will be notified about the study and asked about the willingness to participate if
        they fit the inclusion/exclusion criteria. Practicing gastroenterologists and trainees will
        be contacted and inquired about their intent of participating in the assessment of
        images/videos. This is a voluntary project and not a part of any mandatory training. There
        is no coercion of participants who do not want to participate.

        This study includes only the images and videos from standard pre-existing database. This
        database was developed by European investigators for educational purposes. This information
        has no patient identifiable parameters. This information is stored in a secure server with
        guarded access.
