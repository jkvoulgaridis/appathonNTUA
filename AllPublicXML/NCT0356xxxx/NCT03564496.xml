  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this trial is to measure the changes in neural activities during tDCS
      session using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Participants (N=60) (20 Healthy Controls and
      40 participants with neurological disorders, ie. multiple sclerosis) will be recruited to
      complete self-report measures and a brief cognitive assessment and then undergo an hour long
      stand-alone MRI scan while simultaneously undergoing tDCS stimulation. Methodology for this
      study is the administration of 15-minutes of of active tDCS during MRI acquisition compared
      to time without active tDCS.

    <measure>Cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2):</measure>
    <time_frame>15 Minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The vastly energetic brain has high cerebral O2 consumption, which is critical for neuronal functions and is proportional to neuronal and synaptic activity changes.</description>

    <measure>Neuronal Reactivity (NR)</measure>
    <time_frame>15 Minutes</time_frame>
    <description>NR represents tDCS-induced global neural reactivity measured by CMRO2 levels in cells available to respond to neural stimuli.</description>

    <measure>Functional connectivity (FC)</measure>
    <time_frame>15 Minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Functional networks of DLPFC will be extracted from pre-processed RS-fMRI data prepared within C-PAC toolbox.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Fractional Amplitude of Low Frequency Fluctuations (fALFF)</measure>
    <time_frame>15 Minutes</time_frame>
    <description>fALFF [36] is a RS-fMRI measure that quantifies the baseline neural activity by low frequency oscillations at rest.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Voxel-mirrored homotopic connectivity (VMHC)</measure>
    <time_frame>15 Minutes</time_frame>

    <description>The simultaneous tDCS will be performed at up to 2 mA dose intensity to determine CMRO2 changes from when the tDCS is on when the tDCS is off. The stimulation (left anodal at DLPFC regions) consists of 15-min up to 4 mA tDCS using 5x5 cm electrode sponge with ~30s ramp-up and ramp-down periods.</description>
