      the objective of this study is to investigate the effect of practising Zumba exercise in
      decreasing menstrual pain in young women with primary dysmenorrhea.

    <textblock>
      primary dysmenorrhea or painful menstruation without pelvic pathology is one of the most
      common complaints in women's medicine. The pain begins with the onset of menstrual bleeding
      and lasts for 72-12 h. Pain is usually in the middle line of the highest severity.
      Dysmenorrhea pain is often described as cramped and intermittent. Zumba is a dance-based
      fitness class that originated in Colombia in the 1990s and is now extremely popular
      worldwide. the aim of this study is to investigate the effect of 8 weeks of regular Zumba
      exercise on the severity of primary dysmenorrhea.

    <description>Pain intensity will be measured by using a 10-point visual analog scale(VAS) in which a line was calibrated from 0 to 10 with 0 representing ''no pain at all''and 10 representing ''worst pain possible.'' Participants will indicate their perceived pain levels by pointing to the appropriate value on a 10-cm horizontal ruler. The intensity of pain will be rated to the ﬁrst decimal place in centimeters.Higher scores represent higher menstrual pain intensity.</description>

    <description>Participants will engage in 16 classes of 60-minute Zumba® fitness for two consecutive menstrual cycles (an 8-week period, twice weekly). Each class was one hour in length and a recovery period of at least 48 h was taken between classes. Each session will be initiated with low-intensity movements for the ﬁrst 5 min, followed by an increasing intensity throughout the workout. At the end of the training session, the intensity will be gradually reduced. The Zumba sessions will be supervised by three certiﬁed Zumba instructors, each responsible for regular sessions per week.</description>
