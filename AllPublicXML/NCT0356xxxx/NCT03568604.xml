      Open label study at a single research center. Subjects meeting inclusion and exclusion
      criteria will receive 6.5 mg prasterone vaginal inserts daily for twenty weeks. A physical
      examination and vulvoscopy with photography of the vulva, vestibule, urethral meatus and
      vagina will be performed at baseline and every 4 weeks for 20 weeks. Pain diaries will be
      completed between visits.

      This is an open label study to be conducted at a single research center, San Diego Sexual
      Medicine. Subjects meeting inclusion and exclusion criteria will receive 6.5 mg prasterone
      vaginal inserts daily for twenty weeks. After the informed consent is signed, a baseline
      physical examination and vulvoscopy with detailed photography of the vulva, vestibule,
      urethral meatus and vagina will be performed. Physical examination and vulvoscopy with
      detailed photography of the vulva, vestibule, urethral meatus and vagina will be repeated
      prospectively every 4 weeks for a total of 20 weeks. Therefore, physical examination and
      vulvoscopy with detailed photography of the vulva, vestibule, urethral meatus and vagina will
      be performed prospectively at baseline (vulvoscopy session 1), 4 weeks (vulvoscopy session
      2), 8 weeks (vulvoscopy session 3), 12 weeks (vulvoscopy session 4), 16 weeks (vulvoscopy
      session 5) and 20 weeks (vulvoscopy session 6) following daily administration of 6.5 mg
      prasterone. In addition, pain diaries will be dispensed at each visit and collected at the
      following visit, with questions regarding pain during sexual activity.

    <description>The primary objective of this study is to prospectively document, using vulvoscopy with detailed photography, the visible changes to the vulva, vestibule, urethral meatus and vaginal region in menopausal women with moderate to severe dyspareunia using 6.5 mg daily prasterone for twenty weeks, comparing baseline to 20 weeks. Photographs will be assessed by an independent reviewer using a ten-parameter Likert rating scale, the Vulvoscopic Genitourinary Tissue Appearance (VGTA) scale. This scale assesses for labia majora resorption, labia minora resorption, clitoral atrophy, urethral meatal prolapse, introital stenosis, pallor, erythema, mucosa inflammation, loss of vaginal ruggation, and anterior vaginal wall atrophy. VGTA values for each parameter are 0 (normal), 1(mild), 2 (moderate) or 3 (severe). Each parameter will be calculated separately as well as the total score as primary outcome measure.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in pain as noted on cotton-tipped swab (Q-tips®) test.</measure>
    <time_frame>Twenty weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Secondary objectives include changes in pain as noted on the Pain Scale during the cotton-tipped swab (Q-tips®) test. Pain is assessed by applying pressure with the cotton-tipped swab in 7 specific locations around the vestibule (1:00, 3:00, 5:00, 6:00, 7:00, 9:00 and 11:00) and the patient is asked to assess her pain at each location on a scale of 0-3 with 0 being no pain and 3 being the most severe. The total score is then used to determine outcome.</description>
