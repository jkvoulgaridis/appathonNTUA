      Protocol Summary:

        1. Question Does the adjunction of a humidification system to non-invasive ventilation
           circuit improve sleep quality and comfort of chronic ventilated respiratory insufficient
           patients? Does it change the efficacy of long-term non invasive ventilation therapy and
           patient-ventilator interactions?

        2. Aims

      Main aim:

      The primary endpoint of this study is to objectively evaluate the consequences of a
      humidification system's adjunction on quality of sleep, 2 months after treatment's beginning.

      Second aims:

      The secondary endpoints are to evaluate the consequences of a humidification system's
      adjunction on non invasive ventilation's efficacy / patient-ventilator asynchronies /
      patients' comfort / treatment adherence.

      Before the clinical trial, the investigators conducted a bench study using a mechanical lung
      in order to evaluate the ventilator's behavior with and without a humidification system.

      The clinical trial will include patients with chronic respiratory failure with an indication
      of long-term non invasive ventilation therapy. Patients will be included in the Pulmonology,
      Thoracic Oncology and Respiratory intensive care unit of Rouen University Hospital.

      It will be a prospective monocentric study, including consecutively all eligible patients.
      Informed consent will be obtained from all of them.

      At baseline, patients will be hospitalized for two consecutive nights for non invasive
      ventilation's set up. During the first night, a polysomnography will be performed without non
      invasive ventilation. Then, patients will be treated by non invasive ventilation with a
      bi-level self-regulated pressure mode and an open circuit.

      Patients will be randomized in two groups: without a humidification system and with a
      humidification system. Partitioning by the physiopathological pattern (obstructive versus
      obesity hypoventilation syndrome vs. neuromuscular disease) will be done.

      During each night, arterial blood gases will be measured at bedtime and awakening. Patients
      will be monitored by:

        -  polysomnography (only during the first night)

        -  transcutaneous capnography

        -  accessory inspiratory muscles surface electromyography

        -  pneumotachograph on non invasive ventilation's circuit

        -  pressions measured at the mask.

      Follow-up will take place at two months after non invasive ventilation's beginning with or
      without humidification. Patients will be hospitalized for one night only. Blood gases at
      bedtime and at awakening will be measured. A polysomnography with non invasive ventilation
      will be performed. Observance will be evaluated.

    <time_frame>Assessement will be performed at baseline and 2 month after initiation of non invasive ventilation with or without humidification.</time_frame>
    <description>Outcome will be assessed using the Pittsburgh sleep quality index. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) is a self-report questionnaire that assesses sleep quality over a one-month time interval. The measure consists of nineteen individual items, creating seven components which are summed to produce a global score. Each component ranges from zero to three (zero: no difficulty at all ; three: great difficulties). Global score ranges from zero (no difficulty) to twenty-one points (great difficulties).</description>

    <description>Outcome will be assessed using the Nasal Obstruction Symptom Evaluation questionary (NOSE) which is an instrument allowing clinicians to better understand impact of nasal obstruction on patients' quality of life. The measure consists of five individual items evaluated on a one-month past interval. Each item ranges from zero (not a problem) to four (severe problem). Then, scores are summed to create a global score ranging from zero (not a problem) to twenty (severe problem).</description>

    <description>Outcome will be assessed using the Severe Inspirator Insufficiency questionary.

The measure consists of forty-nine individual items, creating seven components which are summed to produce a global score. Each item ranges from one to five (one: not true ; five: very true). Each component ranges from zero to one hundred. Global score is the seven components' mean. It ranges from zero (bad quality of life) to one hundred percent (best quality of life).</description>
