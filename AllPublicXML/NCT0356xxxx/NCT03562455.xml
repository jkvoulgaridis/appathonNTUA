  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of VRSim 3.0 on power wheelchair (PWC)
      driving skills and to obtain qualitative feedback from users on the design of the virtual
      reality (VR) simulator to inform device development.

      A virtual reality platform may lead to better training of people with complex disabilities
      who desire to be power wheelchair users and thus allow them to benefit from living a more
      active life. A virtual reality training program could significantly impact the lives of
      people with disabilities by improving function, reducing abandonment of power wheelchairs,
      and reducing morbidity and mortality and associated costs occurring from power wheelchair
      accidents. This new virtual reality training program will reflect improvements in
      accessibility, customization, simulator sickness, ease of use, and will have report
      generating capabilities as compared to previous virtual reality training platforms. The
      investigators expect that virtual reality training will be a superior alternative to standard
      in-person wheelchair training.

    <measure>Power Wheelchair Driving Skill</measure>
    <time_frame>This outcome measure will be assessed at each of 4 training sessions, which may take up to one year to complete.</time_frame>
    <description>Power wheelchair driving skills will be evaluated using the Power Mobility Clinical Driving Assessment (PMCDA). The PMCDA contains 23 questions related to specific power wheelchair driving tasks. Each task will be given a score from 1 to 3; a score of 1 will be given if the driver requires physical assistance or cannot complete the task, a score of 2 will be given if the driver requires verbal or auditory hints or cues, but no physical assistance, and a score of 3 will be given if the driver completes the task without help. Scores will be added together for a possible total from 23 to 69.</description>

    <measure>Perception of Virtual Reality Training System</measure>
    <time_frame>This outcome measure will be assessed at the completion of the study, which may take up to one year to complete.</time_frame>
    <description>Qualitative feedback on the participants' experience with VRSim 3.0 will be obtained to inform future software development using a semi-structured interview as well as a Virtual Experience Test (VET) survey. The semi-structured interview will contain open-ended questions aimed at exploring usability factors that may be barriers or facilitators to the use of VR for PWC driving training. The VET is a validated survey instrument that will be used to measure the virtual environment experience. It will contain 17 questions based on based upon five dimensions of experiential design: sensory, cognitive, affective, active, and relational. The survey questions will be scored from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree).</description>

    <measure>Simulator Sickness</measure>
    <time_frame>This outcome measure will be assessed at the beginning and end of 4 training sessions, which may take up to one year to complete.</time_frame>
    <description>Participants in the virtual reality group will be given a Simulator Sickness Questionnaire (SSQ) at the beginning and end of each training session to assess the degree of simulator sickness induced by the gaming platform. The SSQ contains 16 questions based on symptoms of simulator sickness, and participants will rate each symptom as either none, slight, moderate, or severe.</description>

    <measure>Perceived Workload of Training</measure>
    <time_frame>This outcome measure will be assessed at each of 4 training sessions, which may take up to one year to complete.</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be given a NASA-Task Load Index (NASA-TLX) survey to assess perceived workload at the end of each training session. The NASA-TLX contains 6 questions to assess workload on a scale from low to high.</description>

    <measure>Power Wheelchair Driving Capacity</measure>
    <time_frame>This outcome measure will be measured at the beginning and end of the study, which may take up to one year to complete.</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be evaluated using the Power Mobility Screening Tool (PMST) to assess driving capacity. The PMST contains 5 questions based on motor, sensory, and cognitive skills. The questions will be scored from 1 to 3, and will be added together for a possible total from 5 to 15.</description>
