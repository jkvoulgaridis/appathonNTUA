  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The production of protein rich animal products is associated with a large environmental
      burden, and with ethical considerations. Additionally, the over-consumption of meat might be
      associated with detrimental effects to health.

      Using mycoprotein, a food ingredient derived from the fermentation of a fungus, as a meat
      substitute could result in environmental benefits, and could have a role in managing obesity,
      diabetes and improving metabolic health. However, naturally produced mycoprotein has a high
      nucleotide content and little is known about the impact of nucleotides in uric acid levels
      and other health markers.

      The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of a meal based on nucleotide rich
      mycoprotein on uric acid concentrations and other markers of health.
