      The aim of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness of olive oil in the prevention of
      nipple cracking, nipple pain and ascension maternal satisfaction in lactating women. It's a
      prospective, randomized study of 80 lactating women, admitted to Tri-Service General hospital
      postpartum unit. Eligible patients were randomized to olive oil group or breast milk group
      and evaluate the effect of olive oil for nipple pain, nipple trauma, and maternal
      satisfaction.

      Previous studies have shown that olive oil, applied to the skin, has analgesic and
      anti-inflammatory properties. It is proposed in this study that olive oil may also help
      prevent cracked nipple and sore nipple in breastfeeding mothers. The aim of the study is to
      evaluate the effectiveness of olive oil in the prevention of nipple cracking, nipple pain and
      ascension of maternal satisfaction in lactating women. It's a prospective, randomized study
      of 80 lactating women, admitted to TSGH postpartum unit. Eligible patients were randomized
      into two groups of 40 women. In Group 1 Olive oil will be applied on the nipple after
      breastfeeding, and in Group 2 drops of breast milk were applied to the nipple after feeding.
      Clinical evaluations were made during the first 3 days of treatment and the 7th and 10th day
      after delivery. Furthermore, we will check the 1month breastfeeding rate data, which
      collected by the hospital nurse for baby-friendly hospital policy.
