  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this randomized clinical trial is to compare the efficacy and safety of wide
      area circumferential ablation using contact force catheter with cryoballoon ablation for the
      treatment of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia and is associated with stroke,
      reductions in quality of life and overall survival. Previous studies have shown that
      cryoballoon ablation was noninferior to radiofrequency ablation with respect to efficacy for
      the treatment of patients with drug-refractory paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. However, the
      pulmonary vein isolation for radiofrequency catheter ablation in previous studies was done
      around each pulmonary-vein antrum, and it's not wide area circumferential ablation. Moreover,
      the induction of atrial fibrillation by isoproterenol or programmed stimulation and burst
      pacing was not performed in most of previous studies. We hypothesize that wide area
      circumferential ablation with contact force catheter and combined catheter ablation the
      potential atrial triggers and/or other atrial arrhythmias induced by aggressive induction is
      more effective than cryoballoon ablation in patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.

    <description>Wide area circumferential ablation with contact force catheter will be performed in Patients allocated in this group,the induction of atrial fibrillation by isoproterenol or programmed stimulation and burst pacing will be performed. If frequent atrial premature beats are found beyond pulmonary vein, activation mapping will be performed for eliminating the triggers. If atrial tachycardias(ATs)are induced, activation mapping the ATs and ablation will be performed. Electrical isolation of pulmonary veins and elimination the triggers and ATs induced by isoproterenol or programmed stimulation and burst pacing are the endpoints of ablation</description>

    <intervention_name>Cryoballoon ablation</intervention_name>
    <description>In the cryoballoon procedures, pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) was achieved using fluoroscopic guidance to position the cryoballoon catheter. Once PV-to-balloon occlusion was confirmed by retrograde radiopaque contrast agent retention, circumferential ablation was performed by freezing with a single-shot delivery of coolant to the balloon.</description>
