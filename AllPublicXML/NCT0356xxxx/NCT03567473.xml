  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We hypothesize that infants with bronchiolitis treated with nebulized epinephrine in the
      Emergency Department (ED) and a 2-day course of oral dexamethasone will have fewer
      hospitalizations over 7 days compared to infants treated with placebo. To examine this
      hypothesis, we will conduct a phase III, multicentre, randomized, double-blind trial. Infants
      presenting to one of twelve study EDs will be enrolled to one of two study groups: (1)
      nebulized epinephrine and oral dexamethasone or (2) nebulized normal saline and oral placebo.
      Our primary outcome will be admission for bronchiolitis by day 7 following the enrolment. As
      a planned secondary analysis, a between-group comparison of the primary outcome will be
      performed in those patients presenting with a first episode of bronchiolitis.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Presenting to the ED with an episode of bronchiolitis. Bronchiolitis will be defined
             as an episode of wheezing or crackles in a child &lt; 12 month of age associated with
             signs of an upper respiratory tract infection (e.g. cough, coryza, nasal congestion)
             during the period deemed to be peak season for RSV bronchiolitis (approximately
             December to April in Northern Hemisphere and June to October in Southern Hemisphere).
             We have chosen not to define bronchiolitis as the first episode of wheezing or
             crackles to better reflect the clinical guidelines and clinical practice
             internationally.

          2. Age 60 days to less than 12 months. Children younger than 60 days will not be enrolled
             due to the risk of concomitant infection and other issues pertaining to glucocorticoid
             use in the very young. Children older than 12 months will not be enrolled to minimize
             the risk of enrolling children with asthma.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Respiratory distress assessment instrument (RDAI) score of less than or equal to 3.
             This RDAI will ensure children with very mild respiratory diseases are not enrolled.
             This is the lower limit of the RDAI range used in CanBEST.

          2. Previously known chronic disease that may affect cardiopulmonary status of the
             patient, such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia currently receiving oxygen, cystic
             fibrosis, congenital heart disease and immune deficiency. These children may be at
             higher risk for developing severe illness.

          3. Severe respiratory distress evidenced by a sustained pulse rate &gt; 200 beats/min, a
             sustained respiratory rate &gt; 80 breaths/min, profound lethargy (as deemed by the
             treating physician), or requiring resuscitation room care. We will exclude these
             children as they are likely to be admitted due to severity of illness.

          4. Presenting with symptoms of apnea prior to enrollment.

          5. Treatment with oral, inhaled, or IV corticosteroids within the last 1 week.

          6. History of adverse reaction to glucocorticoids.

          7. Treatment with any beta-agonists (salbutamol/albuterol or epinephrine/adrenaline) in
             the ED prior to study enrolment.

          8. Presence of varicella or recent (less than 3 weeks) close contact (defined as any
             household or daycare contact, or greater than 15 minutes of face to face contact, or
             greater than 1 hour of being in the same dwelling with an individual) without a
             history of prior infection. These patients are not enrolled to reduce any risk of
             developing severe varicella with corticosteroid use.

          9. Insurmountable language barrier (patient's parent/guardian is unable to understand
             English or French to give informed consent and participate in follow-up).

         10. Any child born at less than 37weeks gestation who is younger than 60 days corrected
             age. We will not enroll these children to lower any risk of exposing young infants to
             corticosteroids.

         11. Previous enrolment in the trial.

         12. Unavailability for follow-up period.
