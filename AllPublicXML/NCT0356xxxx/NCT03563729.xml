      This clinical trial is to clarify whether treatment with a checkpoint inhibitor alone
      (pembrolizumab) or two in combination (ipilimumab and nivolumab), results in clinical benefit
      for MM patients with brain metastases and in need of steroid treatment. Patients will be
      treated in four arms depending on steroid dose level at inclusion (&gt; 10 &lt; 25 mg prednisolone
      or &gt; 25 mg prednisolone) and treatment (pembrolizumab alone or the combination of ipilimumab
      and nivolumab).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cancer immunotherapy with checkpoint inhibitors (CPI) has demonstrated significant response
      rates, with clinical responses of exceptional duration observed in pivotal clinical trials
      for multiple types of solid tumors. Results from clinical trials demonstrate a considerable
      survival benefit of CPI over standard treatments, leading to registration of CPI for lung-,
      head and neck-, bladder-, renal cancer, lymphomas and metastatic melanoma (MM). To date, CPI
      appear to hold the key for longterm survival - at least for patients treated in clinical
      trials.

      Patients enrolled in pivotal clinical trials for immunotherapy of MM are highly selected and
      does not include patients with brain metastases. Small phase II studies lend support to CPI
      to yield responses in melanoma that has metastasized to the brain. However, a large
      proportion of patients that develop brain metastasis will require continued systemic
      treatment with steroids to alleviate symptoms from the central nervous system (CNS). This
      group of patients are not offered treatment with CPI, as it is generally assumed that steroid
      treatment hamper their clinical efficacy. Thus, this group of patients face a large unmet
      need.

      Due to the immune inhibiting effects, steroids are used to manage immune-related adverse
      events (irAEs) induced by CPI treatment. However, patients receiving steroids in this context
      are still able to achieve and maintain clinical benefit even after stopping treatment.

      It is not known whether steroid treatment at the time of initiation of CPI treatment
      diminishes the treatment effect, as patients in need of steroid treatment are generally
      excluded from clinical trials.
