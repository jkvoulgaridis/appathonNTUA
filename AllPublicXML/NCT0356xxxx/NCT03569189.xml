  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the effect of a 7-day westernised high-fat (65% of kilocalories),
      high-calorie (150% of requirements) diet on markers of inflammation in the blood and white
      adipose tissue. Participants will firstly complete a 3-day weight maintenance phase (Days
      1-3) before completing a 7-day high fat diet intervention (Days 4-10). On days 4 and 11
      participants will complete a laboratory visit where anthropometric measurements, blood and
      adipose samples will be collected.

      The investigators hypothesise that consuming a high-fat, high-calorie diet for 7 days will
      alter the inflammatory responses in white adipose tissue and will induce metabolic
      endotoxaemia / systemic inflammation.
