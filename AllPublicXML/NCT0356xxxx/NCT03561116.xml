  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A huge body of scientific evidence has suggested that xanthohumol (XAN) consumption, a
      polyphenol present in beer, has a positive effect on energy metabolism. This compound is
      known for its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer properties which confer
      potential to be used as a food supplement. Nevertheless, XAN lipophilic properties prevent
      the extensive use of this molecule as a functional food compound. The company TA-XAN S.A.M.
      (Wiesbaden, Germany) has patented a method to overcome this solubility problem. So, the main
      aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of XAN consumption on metabolic syndrome
      progression in individuals recently diagnosed.
