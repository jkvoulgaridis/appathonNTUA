  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Randomized, controlled, double-blind trial of the effect of a single dose of potassium on
      ADHD symptoms as measured by changes in measures of symptoms of ADHD correlated with the
      results of their Lidocaine Effectiveness Test.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects with a confirmed diagnosis of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), who
      are either untreated or poorly controlled with existing ADHD therapy, will be recruited for a
      single, four-hour session.

      Each subject will be tested for lidocaine effectiveness using the application of lidocaine
      gel to the tongue and assessment by taste.

      The subjects will then be assigned to two arms, (1) lidocaine sensitive (effective) or (2)
      lidocaine insensitive (ineffective), and then randomized as to an intervention of potassium
      supplementation or a placebo.

      Each subject will:

        -  Complete questionnaires about their history of certain symptoms and a food diary.

        -  Get an ECG to exclude those with arrhythmias.

        -  Have their baseline serum potassium tested

        -  Have measures of ADHD symptoms performed.

      Then each subject will receive the intervention of a single dose of the potassium or placebo.

      After the wait of one hour, a repeat serum potassium and measurement of symptoms will be
      performed.

      Note; The FDA also requires a Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) for all ADHD
      trials

    <intervention_model_description>The trial will have 2 arms, lidocaine sensitive (effective) and lidocaine insensitive (ineffective). The sample will be enriched to have 50% in each arm. Within each arm, subjects will be randomized on a 1-to-1 allocation to the treatment or control groups.
The investigators will adopt an iterative approach of testing of batches of subjects because (1) the frequency of lidocaine-insensitivity is only known approximately, (2) the frequency may be unevenly distributed across ethnic groups, and (3) the exact effect size of the potassium is not known, though reported to be high in off-label use in clinical settings with more chronic administration.
At the end of testing 40 patients, the results will be analyzed for statistical significance. (1) If the results are statistically significant with a 95% confidence, the testing may stop with the first batch of 40 subjects. (2) If not, sequential, iterative batches of 20 subjects will be tested, and the results reanalyzed.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking>Quadruple (Participant, Care Provider, Investigator, Outcomes Assessor)</masking>
    <masking_description>The scoring of the lidocaine test is masked, using the coded identity of the tastes. The scoring will be done during the visit by the Scoring and Randomization Specialist so that the patient can be assigned to an intervention or control group to maintain equal numbers in treatment versus control groups. To prevent bias, the Scoring and Randomization Specialist will not be involved in any of the ADHD assessment steps and the patients will not be told about their lidocaine status until after all study testing is done. The subjects and other study personnel such as those doing the ADHD testing will be told not to discuss what they could or couldn't taste. Having scored the lidocaine test, the Scoring and Randomization Specialist will assign subjects to Intervention versus Control using a 1-to-1 allocation.</masking_description>

    <description>The questionnaire is a standard assessment tool for measuring the level of ADHD symptoms. The ADHD-RS-IV is for adults and the ADHD-RSM-5 is for teenagers. This test has been validated for measuring the impact of drugs in ADHD, typically multi-dose, multi-week changes.
Since this study is a single-dose, several-hour study, the Investigators will complete only the portions designed to done with the patient and by the clinician; sections designed to be completed by parents and teachers. The results will establish expectations for future multi-dose studies.

The first assessment will serve as a baseline and the assessment post-intervention will measure any changes. (all scores from 0-100)
