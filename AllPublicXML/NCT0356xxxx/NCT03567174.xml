  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are several biomedical interventions that can help people who inject drugs
      (particularly those with or at risk for HIV), but these services often do not get to the
      people most in need. In this project investigators propose to determine if delivery of these
      services to PWID by an integrated care van that is linked to a mobile syringe service program
      improves clinical outcomes, is feasible and sustainable, and is cost-effective.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Biomedical interventions that have direct applicability to people who inject drugs (PWID)
      have flourished over the past 15 years (HIV treatment as prevention, pre-exposure
      prophylaxis, office-based medication-assisted treatment (MAT) with buprenorphine, and
      hepatitis C virus (HCV) treatment with direct acting agents). However, penetration of these
      interventions among PWID is low relative to the potential benefits. Syringe service programs
      (SSP) are an essential risk reduction service for PWID, and represent the outermost reach of
      public health services for this population. The Baltimore City Health Department (BCHD) and
      investigators at Johns Hopkins University are developing a dedicated integrated care van
      (ICV) to complement the city's mobile SSP, with the goals of optimizing the HIV care cascade
      in HIV-positive clients and extending needed biomedical interventions to PWID. A nurse
      practitioner, case worker, and peer navigators will engage HIV-positive clients (known and
      newly diagnosed) and collaborate closely with local HIV clinics to promote progress toward
      durable viral suppression. To support the ICV's role in HIV care facilitation, investigators
      propose an innovative application of the Center for Disease Control (CDC)-sponsored &quot;Data to
      Care&quot; initiative - a multi-source health service database designed to assist health
      departments track the HIV care cascade in real time. Additionally, the ICV will provide rapid
      HIV testing, PrEP screening and initiation, buprenorphine-based MAT, HCV testing and
      referrals to treatment, and wound care. Using a cluster-randomized trial design,
      investigators propose to determine whether the ICV intervention advances the HIV care cascade
      among HIV-positive PWID, improves the Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) continuum, and
      increases uptake of MAT and HCV treatment (Aim 1). Additionally, investigators will examine
      the implementation of the ICV intervention using a mixed methods approach among PWID,
      local/state public health stakeholders, and medical providers to examine the intervention's
      feasibility, acceptability, coverage, fidelity, and sustainability (Aim 2). Finally,
      investigators will determine the incremental cost-effectiveness of the ICV intervention (Aim
      3). Investigators have assembled a multi-disciplinary team with methodological expertise in
      PWID interventions and cost-effectiveness evaluations, and longstanding collaboration with
      investigators' partners at the BCHD.

    <time_frame>Prior 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>To capture the multifaceted nature of the ICV intervention and the array of health issues relevant to PWID, we developed a scoring rubric based on World Health Organization guidelines for evidence-based PWID services, a predictive risk model for HIV seroconversion among PWID developed by the Baltimore-based ALIVE study, the HCV care continuum, and the overdose epidemic. In the scoring rubric, points are allocated on the basis of riskier behaviors or health status (e.g., needle sharing, poorly controlled HIV) or for failing to use evidence-based services (e.g.,syringe service program, opioid substitution therapy, HCV testing).
This outcome will be assessed in all participants at all time points. The score is based on self-report, biomarker testing, and medical record review, and ranges from 0 to 18, with higher scores indicating higher risk and lower utilization of services (worse overall status).</description>

    <measure>Qualitative assessments</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>To provide context to our study and identify facilitators and barriers to the intervention, we will conduct qualitative assessments. First, we will conduct in-depth interviews (IDIs) with ~ 30 PWID participants. The interview will explore accessibility, coverage, and barriers accessing the services in question. Second, we will conduct IDIs with Baltimore City Health Department (BCHD) staff who work on either the existing SSP van or the newly created ICV (N~12). The interview will explore feasibility, perceived benefits and challenges of offering services in the field, and changes in perceptions after intervention roll-out on the ICV. Third, we will conduct IDIs with BCHD and Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DHMH) officials and managers who are involved in PWID services (N~10). The interview will explore feasibility, and perceived benefits and challenges of offering services in the field on the ICV. We will digitally record the interviews.</description>
