    <textblock>
      This will be an open-label trial to describe the effects of cryoneurolysis with iovera° on
      symptom relief in patients with painful Kellgren-Lawrence (KL) grade 2-4 ankle osteoarthritis
      (OA). The Foot and Ankle Outcome Score (FAOS) subscales will be used to assess outcomes at 6,
      12 and 24 weeks after treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to assess clinically significant long-term symptomatic relief with
      cryoneurolysis in people with unilateral ankle osteoarthritis (OA). The investigators will
      treat 1) the Superficial Fibular Nerve (SFN), Sural Nerve (SN) and Saphenous Nerve and/or 2)
      the Deep Fibular Nerve (DFN) with cryoneurolysis using the iovera° device. The primary study
      endpoint, clinically significant improvement in pain 12 weeks after each treatment, will be
      assessed using the FAOS pain subscale. If a participant is a non-responder (&lt;20% improvement
      in pain within the 12 weeks following baseline), then the other treatment will be offered
      (e.g. if start with superficial group, then offer the DFN).

      The secondary outcomes will be improvement in quality of life (FAOS-QoL), activities of daily
      living (FAOS-ADL) and Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) for pain.

      The tertiary outcome will be improvement in physical performance measures (40m fast-paced
      walking test, standing balance test).

    <description>The iovera° device consists of a reusable, portable hand-piece, along with a single-patient use sterile smart Tip (cryoprobe) and disposable nitrous oxide (N2O) cartridges (cryogen). The smart tip is composed of closed-tip stainless steel needles, thereby fully enclosing the cryogen. There are 2 types of smart tips that will be utilized during this study, depending on the depth of the nerves being treated. The shorter smart tip comes in 2 variants - three X 6.9 mm or 8.9 mm, 27-gauge needles, with an attached skin warmer to prevent damage to the underlying skin. The longer smart tip also comes in 2 variants - 55 mm 22-gauge needle or a 90 mm 20G needle.
The effect is by initiation of a cooling cycle, by fully inserting the smart tip into the procedure site and activating the cryogen flow. As the gas travels through the length of the needle, an ice ball develops around the needle freezing the surrounding tissue.</description>

          -  Skin breakdown at the ankle joint where the injection is planned to take place.

          -  Participated in any investigational drug or device trial within 30 days prior to
