      INTRODUCTION Menopause is one more stage in a woman's life. The hormonal change is associated
      with a series of symptoms that usually manifest around 50 years. Not all women manifest all
      the symptoms or with the same intensity. The most common symptoms are: hot flushes and night
      sweats, changes in mood, insomnia or difficulty sleeping, weight gain, vaginal dryness and /
      or urinary problems; what is detrimental to the well-being of women. At this stage the woman
      feels more discouraged than usual, and may show moments of anxiety, stress or irritability
      with the people around her. Sleep disturbances can also cause a state of tiredness and
      excessive sleepiness during the day, or even persistent headaches that interfere with the
      daily routine could improve some of these aspects related to sleep disturbances and thus the
      quality of life of the woman.

      The objectives of this study are to know the effect of cranial therapeutic massage on
      insomnia, in order to improve the quality of life and the woman's corporal satisfaction, and
      to promote a better functioning and performance of the activities of daily life.

      MATERIAL AND METHODS In this study, the investigators selected women aged between 45 and 60
      years, who presented changes and symptoms characteristic of the menopausal period,
      accompanied by alterations in sleep. In addition, the inclusion criteria require that women
      have not had a menstrual period for one year.

      Exclusion criteria are excessive stress, the use of medications to promote sleep and some
      type of contraindication to receive treatment.

      Protocol design It consists of a randomized clinical trial, with a total of 50 participants
      (n = 50), divided into a control group (n = 25) and an experimental group (n = 25).

      Intervention The experimental group is subjected to 1 session per week of manual cranial
      therapy consisting of massage and cranial relaxing techniques, with a duration of 30 minutes
      each session approximately, for 3 weeks and one month follow-up. Manual therapy consists of a
      prone and supine cranial massage.

      The control group does not receive treatment, but they will be evaluated the same as the
      experimental group.

      Evaluations Clinical interview Includes anthropometric data (age, weight and height). The
      quality of life questionnaire Sf-36 and the Menopause Rating Scale (MRS) that assesses the
      state of well-being of the menopausal woman through 11 simple answer questions.

      The Pittsburg Quality of Sleep Questionnaire (PSQI) takes sleep habits into account during
      the last month. The PSQI contains a total of 19 questions, grouped into 10 questions. In all
      cases, a score of 0 would indicate ease of sleeping, while a score of 3 would be a severe
      difficulty.

      On the other hand, the Sleep Journal also evaluates sleep habits, characteristics and sleep
      quality, but unlike the previous one, this questionnaire has to be answered daily by the
      patients.

      The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) is composed of 14 questions that relate to the level of
      stress perceived during the last month; The higher the score of each question, the higher the
      level of stress the person has.

      The Body Satisfaction Questionnaire. 10 questions is which must be answered according to the
      state of health that best describes the person at that time.

      The Patient Global Impression of Change Scale questionnaire assesses the sensation of change,
      in terms of quality of life and sleep, functionality and limitation to perform the activities
      of daily life, which the participant has experienced since the beginning of the treatment of
      this study.

      Analysis of data The data obtained will be stored in a database (SPSS), with which the
      analysis of the data will also be performed.

    <description>SF-36 is a health questionnaire, both physical and metal. It contains 36 items comprising 8 health status sub-scales. It includes different dimensions (Bodily Pain, Perceptions, Mental Health, Physical Function, Role-physical, Role-emotional, Social Function, and Vitality).

    <measure>Climacteric symptoms</measure>

    <description>The Menopause Rating Scale (MRS) assesses the severity of climacteric symptoms. It consists of 11 symptoms divided into three groups: 1. MRS somatic level, includes: hot flashes, sweating, heart discomfort, sleep disturbances and joint and muscle discomfort; 2. Psychological MRS: depressive mood, irritability, anxiety and physical and mental fatigue; 3. Urogenital MRS: sexual problems, problems with urine and vaginal dryness.

The total MRS score is the sum of the scores obtained in each block.</description>

    <description>Patient Global Impression of Change Scale, published by Hurst H. and Bolton J. Evaluates the sensation of change after the treatment received. It contains 7 affirmations (1 = I have improved a lot, 2 = I have improved a lot, 3 = I have improved a little, 4 = I am the same, 5 = I have worsened a little, 6 = I have worsened a lot, 7 = I have worsened a lot), together with an analog scale on the degree of change (0 = much better, 5 = no change, 10 = much worse).</description>
