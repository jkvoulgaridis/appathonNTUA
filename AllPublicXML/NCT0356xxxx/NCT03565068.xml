  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This 4-panel study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) and
      corrected QT interval (QTc) effect of MK-8189 (vs. placebo) in healthy participants (Panel
      A), as monotherapy in participants with schizophrenia (Panel B), as add-on therapy in
      participants with schizophrenia (Panel C), and under an alternative dose-titration scheme in
      participants with schizophrenia (Panel D).

          -  Has any clinically significant abnormal laboratory, VS, physical examination, or
             12-lead safety ECG findings at screening or changes from baseline that may interfere
             with the interpretation of PK or safety parameters or, in the opinion of the
             investigator, would make the participant inappropriate for entry into this study.

             at the screening visit or a positive urine pregnancy test within 48 hours before the
             first dose of study intervention. If the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed

             successfully treated ≥10 years prior to the prestudy (screening) visit where, in the
             judgment of both the investigator and treating physician, appropriate follow-up has
             revealed no evidence of recurrence from the time of treatment through the time of the

          -  Has participated in another investigational study within 4 weeks (or 5 half-lives,
             whichever is greater) prior to the prestudy (screening) visit. The window will be
             derived from the date of the last visit in the previous study.

          -  Has history or presence of risk factors for Torsade de Pointes (e.g., cardiac disease,
             heart failure, hypokalaemia or hypomagnesaemia, hypertrophy, cardiomyopathy, or family

             for any other reason the investigator considers the participant inappropriate for
             participation in the study.
