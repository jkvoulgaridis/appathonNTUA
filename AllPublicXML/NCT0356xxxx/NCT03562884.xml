  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose is to demonstrate that BLI800 is non-inferior, on overall colon cleansing, to
      Fortrans® (a reference colonic lavage in China) administered in adult subjects scheduled to
      undergo a colonoscopy for a routinely accepted diagnostic indication.

    <description>Efficacy of BLI800 versus Fortrans® will be evaluated with the BBPS global score which ranges from 0 to 9. It will be blindly scored and evaluated by a centralised assessment (blinded assessors will assess the electronic record of colonoscopy and rate it).</description>

    <measure>Patient compliance with BLI800 versus Fortrans®</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The proportion of subjects who fully followed prescription will be analyzed. The compliance with the instructions of use provided in the prescription will be evaluated by the measurement of unused preparation and fluid intake recorded by the subject on the subject's leaflet. A subject will be considered as fully compliant with the instructions of use provided in the prescription if he drinks the whole preparation and any required further fluid intake.</description>

    <measure>Patient Satisfaction with BLI800 versus Fortrans®</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 2</time_frame>
    <description>Patient satisfaction will be evaluated by patient satisfaction scale. Satisfaction of bowel preparation will be performed by questionnaire assessing difficulty using bowel-cleansing preparations, ability to consume preparation, acceptability of taste, overall experience and questions regarding acceptance or refusal of future use of the same bowel preparation.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient tolerability with BLI800 versus Fortrans®</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 2</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluation of patient tolerability will be performed by patient tolerability questionnaire. Tolerability will be assessed by questionnaire recording the presence and intensity of specific symptoms (nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, abdominal distension, and abdominal discomfort).</description>
