  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this research project is to build upon the Testing and Linkage to Care for
      Injecting Drug Users (TLC-IDU) parent study and describe post-cure HCV reinfection in a
      population of people who inject drugs (PWIDs) in Kenya.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In addition to describing reinfection in a substance using cohort, we will identify
      individual predictors of HCV reinfection in Kenya, as well as identifying individual
      utilization intervention approaches and dosing that reduce reinfection risk and treatment
      cite level risk factors (frequency of visits, community vs hospital location etc.).
      Determining the risk factors specific to reinfection and understanding the impact of
      concurrent harm reduction interventions will guide service delivery and implementation of HCV
      elimination strategies in Kenya and throughout the region.

      Research staff will obtain a sample of capillary or venous blood from participants at the
      treatment site and send specimens to Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI) laboratory in
      Kisumu, Kenya for a Hepatitis C V RNA test. If viral load is detectable confirmatory samples
      will be sent to the Center for Disease Control (CDC) laboratory for next generation
      sequencing, to guide treatment. Samples will be collected at two time points post SVR and if
      re-treated in this study, 12 weeks after treatment completion to determine SVR.
