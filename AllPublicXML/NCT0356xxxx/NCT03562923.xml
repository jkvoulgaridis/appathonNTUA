  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To compare the efficacy and safety profiles of Fluticasone Propionate 100 mcg and Salmeterol
      50 mcg Inhalation Powder (test product) and ADVAIR DISKUS (fluticasone propionate 100 mcg and
      salmeterol 50 mcg inhalation powder) (reference product) and to show that the efficacy of the
      2 active products is superior to that of placebo in the treatment of subjects with asthma.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female subjects (≥ 12 years of age) of non-child bearing potential or of child
             bearing potential committing to consistent and correct use of an acceptable method of
             birth control.

          -  Diagnosed with asthma as defined by the National Asthma Education and Prevention
             Program (NAEPP) at least 12 weeks prior to screening.

          -  Pre-bronchodilator FEV1 of ≥40% and ≤85% of the predicted value during the screening
             visit and on the first day of treatment.

          -  Currently non-smoking; had not used tobacco products (i.e., cigarettes, cigars, pipe
             tobacco) within the past year, and had ≤ 10 pack-years of historical use.

          -  ≥15% reversibility of FEV1 within 30 minutes following 360 mcg of albuterol inhalation
             (pMDI).

          -  Able to discontinue their asthma medications (inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting
             β agonists) during the run-in period and for remainder of the study.

          -  Able to replace current short-acting β agonists (SABAs) with salbutamol/albuterol
             inhaler for use as needed for the duration of the study (subjects should be able to
             withhold all inhaled SABAs for at least 6 hours prior to lung function assessments on
             study visits).

          -  Able to continue the following medications without a significant adjustment of dosage,
             formulation, dosing interval for the duration of the study, and judged able by the
             investigator to withhold them for the specified minimum time intervals prior to each
             clinic visit:

               -  short-acting forms of theophylline 12 hours

               -  twice-a-day controlled-release forms of theophylline 24 hours

               -  once-a-day controlled-release forms of theophylline 36 hours

               -  Able to discontinue the following medications for the specified minimum time
                  intervals prior to the run-in period and for the remainder of the study:

               -  oral corticosteroids 1 month

               -  parenteral corticosteroids 1 month

               -  oral short-acting β-agonists 12 hours

          -  Willingness to give their (and in the case of a minor their parent/guardian was able
             to give) written informed consent to participate in the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Life-threatening asthma, defined as a history of asthma episode(s) requiring
             intubation, and/or associated with hypercapnoea; respiratory arrest or hypoxic
             seizures, asthma related syncopal episode(s), or hospitalizations within the past year
             or during the run-in period.

          -  Evidence or history of clinically significant disease or abnormality including
             congestive heart failure, uncontrolled hypertension, uncontrolled coronary artery
             disease, myocardial infarction, or cardiac dysrhythmia. In addition, historical or
             current evidence of significant hematologic, hepatic, neurologic, psychiatric, renal,
             or other diseases that in the opinion of the investigator, would put the patient at
             risk through study participation, or would affect the study analyses if the disease
             exacerbated during the study.

          -  Hypersensitivity to any sympathomimetic drug (e.g., salmeterol or albuterol) or any
             inhaled, intranasal, or systemic corticosteroid therapy.

          -  Medication(s) with the potential to affect the course of asthma or to interact with
             sympathomimetic amines, e.g.:

               -  β-blockers

               -  oral decongestants

               -  benzodiazepines

               -  digitalis

               -  phenothiazines

               -  polycyclic antidepressants

               -  Monoamine oxidase inhibitors

          -  Viral or bacterial, upper or lower respiratory tract infection or sinus or middle ear
             infection within 4 weeks prior to the screening visit or during the run-in period.

          -  Factors (e.g., infirmity, disability or geographic location) that the investigator
             felt would likely limit the patient's compliance with the study protocol or scheduled
             clinic visits.
