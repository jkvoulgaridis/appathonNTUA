  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to explore the efficacy of CD19-targeted CAR-T cell therapy
      for minimal residual disease (MRD) in B-cell Malignancies after autologous stem cell
      transplantation.

    <textblock>
      Relapse is a common cause of failure in patients with B-cell malignancies after autologous
      stem cell transplantation. CD19-targeted CAR-T cells showed excellent therapeutic efficiency
      in B-cell malignancies. Investigators attempt to treat minimal residual disease
      (MRD)-positive B-cell Malignancies after autologous stem cell transplantation by
      CD19-targeted CAR-T cells and hope to explore the therapeutic effects of CD19-targeted CAR-T
      cell therapy.
