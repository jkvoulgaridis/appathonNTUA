      52 adult IBS patients were recruited. 50% were given a fecal microbiota transplantation in
      colonoscopy and 50% were given an FMT made of their own feces as placebo. follow up time was

    <textblock>
      52 adult IBS patients of any subgroup(IBS-D, IBS-C or IBS-M), were recruited and given an FMT
      in colonoscopy. Neither the patient nor the care taking personnel did know in which group the
      patients belonged to. The patients were screened with fecal samples for 16RNA sequencing and
      they were repeatedly done IBS-SSS questionnaire and questionnaires for quality of life and
      psychical condition. Follow up time was 1 year after the colonoscopy.
