  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to examine if exposure to vegan soul food restaurants can increase
      African American adults' perceived benefits of consuming plant-based foods more so than
      standard guidelines. Although the health benefits of vegan diets are well documented, many
      people are reluctant to commit to a vegan diet long term. Various issues like food
      preparation, a lack of social support, or other barriers are often mentioned as reasons why
      people can't be vegan. This study will (1) find out if short term exposure (i.e. 3 weeks) to
      culturally tailored curriculum focusing on the health benefits of consuming plant-based foods
      increases African American adults' perceptions of adopting a vegan diet. And (2) if eating
      out a few times a week at vegan soul food restaurants can further increase African American
      adults' perceived benefits of a vegan than having to prepare all meals at home.

      Study participants will receive counseling and informational materials from a trained
      research assistant to follow a vegan diet for 3 weeks. Participants will be randomly assigned
      to either a standard group or a restaurant group. The standard group will receive gift cards
      to shop at local super markets. The restaurant group will receive gift cards to eat out a few
      times a week at local vegan soul food restaurants. Changes in individuals' perceived benefits
      and barriers to consuming plant-based foods will be assessed with a validated survey at
      baseline and at the end of the 3 week period.
