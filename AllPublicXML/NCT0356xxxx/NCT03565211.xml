An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject participating in a clinical trial.
The intensity of an AE would be classified using the following 3-point scale: mild (awareness of signs or symptoms, but no disruption of usual activity), moderate (event sufficient to affect usual activity [disturbing]) or severe (inability to work or perform usual activities [unacceptable]).
The possibility of whether the investigational medicinal product caused the AE would be classified as one of the following: reasonable possibility, no reasonable possibility.</description>

             following a progestogen withdrawal or spontaneous menses.

          -  Clinically significant gynecologic pathology, such as submucosal fibroids, intramural
             fibroids &gt;5 cm, communicating hydrosalpinx, uncorrected uterine septum, endometrial
             cancer or endometrial atypia, scar tissue inside the cavity or poorly developed
             uterine lining from prior uterine surgery, pelvic tuberculosis, or any other
             conditions that could adversely affect pregnancy success.

          -  Uncontrolled elevation of prolactin or too little thyroid hormone in the blood.

          -  History of more than one failed fresh in vitro fertilization cycle. A failed cycle is
