    <textblock>
      This pilot trial studies the impact of genetic information on developing liver damage caused
      by asparaginase in participants with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Testing
      saliva samples may help doctors find certain genetic markers that may predict whether
      participants will tolerate asparaginase, which is given as part of clinical care for acute
      lymphoblastic leukemia.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To establish the association between the SOD2 rs4880 genotypes and asparaginase-induced
      hepatotoxicity in Hispanic patients.

      II. To identify novel single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are associated with
      asparaginase induced hepatotoxicity.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants' SOD2 rs4880 SNP genotype (based on saliva from buccal swabs) will be
      classified. Participants with the CC genotype will be compared to participants with the CT or
      TT genotype. Buccal swabs of prospective participants' saliva will be collected when
      participant achieves complete remission (during regular clinical visit). Retrospective
      participants will be identified through search of pharmacy records for those who received
      asparaginase within the last 5 years (2012-2017). Recurrent patients will be consented during
      their regular clinical visits and samples will be collected.
