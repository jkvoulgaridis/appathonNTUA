  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: People live increasingly longer and are expected to function independently in
      their own homes to a greater extent than before. This puts great demands on the support given
      to older persons living at home, to be efficient and provide good conditions for them to
      manage on their own and experience good health. Short time goal directed reablement delivered
      by a multidisciplinary team is expected to strengthen the functional capacity and quality of
      life, while home care-hours and thus municipal expenditures decline. Theoretical focus of
      this project is related to international classification of functionality and disability (ICF)
      in which participation are understood as engagement in life situations and related to the
      environment as well as the person. Reablement is expected to extend the time of independent
      and autonomous life for older persons while also reducing municipal costs of elder care.

      Aim: This research project measures the effects of reablement in terms of bio-psycho-social
      health among older people (65+). In addition, the project highlights older person's
      experiences of the intervention and the professional team´s experiences of working with
      reablement.

      Methods: This is a randomized controlled study of the intervention reablement performed by
      the multiprofessional team with controls receiving usual home care. The effects are measured
      by self-reported health and quality of life, physical capacity, and home care hours. Data are
      collected at inclusion (applying for home care), after the three months intervention and at
      six months. Interviews with users are performed after the intervention, and staff experiences
      through written narratives.

      Impact of results: This project will contribute with collecting possible evidence of
      reablement, and contribute with knowledge development of older persons' bio-psycho-social
      health and experiences.

    <measure>Change in self-assessed overall life satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline overall life satisfaction rating at 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Participants' overall life satisfaction ratings are included in the Health as Ability of Acting questionnaire (HACT; Snellman et al. 2011), which is based on Nordenfelt's theory of health (2004). These global ratings are made on a VAS scale, which is coded from 0 (very unsatisfied with life) to 100 (very satisfied with life).</description>

    <measure>Change in self-assessed mental health</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline mental health ratings at 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Mental health is mirrored with a short version of the Clinical Outcomes in Routine Evaluation - Outcome Measure (CORE-OM; Elfström et al. 2013, Evans, et al., 2002), called General Practitioner (GP-)CORE (Sinclair et al. 2005). The 14 items in GP-CORE are summarized and divided by 14, forming a total mean score ranging from 0 (no psychological distress) to 4 (maximum psychological distress).</description>

    <description>Participants' ratings from the Health as Ability of Acting questionnaire (HACT; Snellman et al. 2011) are categorized into one of three health groups:
Good health: (a) Fulfilled vital goals or (b) the person possesses the ability to achieve the unfulfilled vital goals and the intention to use this ability or (c) experiencing a certain degree of ability to achieve vital goals and have the intention to use the ability.
Acceptable health: (a) Unfulfilled vital goals. The person have a certain degree of ability to achieve goals and the intention to use the ability. (b) Unfulfilled vital goals. The person have a certain degree of ability to achieve these goals but have no intention to use the ability.
Poor health: (a) experiencing a certain degree of ability to achieve vital goals, judged as important, and the intention to use the ability. (b) Unfulfilled vital goals. The person lacks the ability to achieve the unfulfilled goal or goals, despite judging them as important.</description>

    <measure>Change in self-assessed activity performance satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline activity performance satisfaction ratings at 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Self-assessed activity performance satisfaction is estimated with interviewer administered Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM; Law et al., 1990). In relation to a central activity problem area that the participants' themselves chose during the interview, the participants' are asked how well they think they can perform up to the five most important activities that relate to the central activity problem area. Then the participants are asked how satisfied they are with their performance, rating each activity performance satisfaction from 1 to 10. Then a mean value is calculated by dividing the sum of activity performance satisfaction ratings by the number of rated activities, giving a mean that can range from 1 (not at all satisfied) to 10 (extremely satisfied).</description>

In relation to a central activity problem area that the participants' themselves chose during the interview, the participants' are asked how well they think they can perform up to the five most important activities that relate to the central activity problem area. The participants rate each activity from 1 to 10 regarding how well the can perform the activity. Then a mean value is calculated by dividing the sum of activity performance by the number of activities, giving a mean that can range from 1 (cannot perform the activity at all) to 10 (can perform the activity extremely well).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in lower extremities physical activity performance</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline lower extremities physical activity performance at 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Lower extremities physical activity performance is measured by a trained administrator with the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB; Guralnik et al., 1994). The SPPB is calculated from three components: the ability to stand for up to 10 seconds with feet positioned in three ways; time to complete a 3-m walk; and time to rise from a chair five times. Each component is scored from 0 to 4, with the scores from the three tests summed to give a total, with a maximum of 12 and a minimum of 0. A higher score indicates a higher level of function, while lower scores indicate a lower level of function.</description>

    <measure>Change in upper extremities physical activity performance</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline upper extremities physical activity ability at 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Upper extremities physical activity performance is measured with a hand dynamometer test (Mathiowetz et al., 1985). The Jamar hydrolic hand dynamometer model J00105 is used. The test of each hand is repeated 3 times, and the average is scored by the trained administrator as the recorded result. The resulting grip strength may vary from 0 kilograms (no grip strength) to 90 kilograms (maximum grip strength).</description>

    <description>Intensive home-based rehabilitation is delivered up to 3 months by an interprofessional team (nurse, enrolled nurse, physiotherapist, occupational therapist, social worker). The entire team completed a 5-week college course. The team negotiates goal-directed contents of the rehabilitation initiatives with the user. Each user is handled deliberately based on decisions in the team in cooperation with the care managers overarching goals in admitted services. All participants have personal contact persons, and these contact persons have twice the time per participant as compared to traditional home care. The interprofessional team also has regular meetings to discuss every participant, and all rehabilitation goals activities related to those are documented.</description>
