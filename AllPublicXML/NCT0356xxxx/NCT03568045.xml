      To evaluate the feasibility of providing daytime bright light in the ICU in a pilot
      randomized controlled trial. Feasibility will be assessed via the following metrics: daytime
      bright light is acceptable and tolerable to patients and has high fidelity and sustainability
      as an intervention.

    <description>Patients will be enrolled within 30 hours of noon on enrollment day (e.g. at or after 6am on the prior calendar day). Enrollment will occur before noon, and the day of enrollment is termed study day 1.

Patients will undergo monitoring (light levels, circadian alignment), starting on study day 1. Patients will be exposed to bright light from 8am to noon starting on study day 2 and continuing through study day 5. Bright light exposure will occur in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and on the floor if the patient is transferred.
Feasibility metrics will be collected.</description>
