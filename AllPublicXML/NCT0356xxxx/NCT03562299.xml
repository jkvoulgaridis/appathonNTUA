  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the clinical safety and obtain preliminary effectiveness data for OrthoPure™ XT
      device in a small group of US patients at 12 and 24 months. The clinical experience obtained
      from this study will be used to develop a pivotal study for follow up in a larger patient
      population.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The OrthoPure™ XT device is a decellularized, sterile, single use biological scaffold for use
      in the treatment of patients with a partial or complete tear of the Anterior Cruciate
      Ligament (ACL) who require surgical reconstruction of the ACL.

      This is a Pilot Safety Study. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the clinical
      safety of the OrthoPure™ XT device in a small group of patients that require reconstruction
      of the Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) due to partial or complete tear of the ACL.

      Clinical safety will be analyzed through measurement of immune response (alpha-Gal IgG),
      blood and urine analysis, incidence of secondary surgical interventions with the treated
      knee, and the incidence of individual adverse events.

      The second objectives of this study are to assess the efficacy endpoints, specifically:
      improvement in knee stability, function and pain; improvement in patient quality of life and
      radiographic analysis.
