             colonic CD at baseline (Visit 2) as defined by:

               1. CDAI score between 220 and 450 (inclusive) AND

             variable of CDAI) over the 7 most recent days out of the 10 days before colonoscopy
             preparation (may or may not be contiguous) AND/OR ii. Average of the daily stool
             frequency subscore &gt;=4 of type 6/7 (very soft stools/liquid stools) as shown in the
             BSFS over the 7 most recent days out of the 10 days before colonoscopy preparation
             (may or may not be contiguous) c. Presence of ulcerations that are characteristic to
             CD, as determined by a colonoscopy performed during screening, and as defined by the
             SES-CD &gt;6 (SES CD &gt;=4 for isolated ileitis) Note that the participant must be

        locally, a central laboratory may be used, with prior agreement from the sponsor:

          1. An IGRA is strongly recommended for participants with a prior Bacillus Calmette-Guérin
             vaccination but may be used for any participant Documentation of IGRA product used and
             the test result must be in the participant's source documentation if performed locally
             Acceptable IGRA products include QuantiFERON-TB Gold Plus In-Tube Test

          2. If the results of the IGRA are indeterminate, the test may be repeated, and if a
             negative result is obtained, enrollment may proceed In participants with no history of
             treated active or latent TB, a positive test on repeat will exclude the
             participantParticipants with a history of active or latent TB infection must follow
             instructions for &quot;Participants with a prior diagnosis of active or latent TB are
             excluded unless both of the following criteria are met&quot; in this criterion

          3. Participants with repeat indeterminate IGRA results, with no prior TB history, may be
             enrolled after consultation with a pulmonary or infectious disease specialist who
             determines low risk of infection (ie, participant would be acceptable for
             immunosuppressant [eg, anti-TNF] treatment without additional action) This
             consultation must be included in source documentation Results from a chest x-ray,
             taken within the 12 weeks before or during screening (Visit 1)must show no
             abnormalities suggestive of active TB infection as determined by a qualified medical
             specialist

               -  Participants with a pre-existing demyelinating disorder such as multiple
                  sclerosis or new onset seizures, unexplained sensory motor, or cognitive

                  screening

               -  Participants with any unexplained symptoms suggestive of PML based on the
                  targeted neurological assessment during the screening period

               -  Participants with a transplanted organ. Skin grafts to treat pyoderma gangrenosum
                  are allowed

               -  Participants with a significant concurrent medical condition at the time of
                  screening (Visit 1) or baseline (Visit 2), including, but not limited to, the
                  following:

        a. Any major illness/condition or evidence of an unstable clinical condition (eg, renal,
        hepatic, hematologic, GI [except disease under study], endocrine, cardiovascular,
        pulmonary, immunologic [eg, Felty's syndrome], or local active infection/infectious
        illness) that, in the investigator's judgment will substantially increase the risk to the
        subject if he or she participates in the study b. Cancer or history of cancer or
        lymphoproliferative disease within the previous 5 years (other than resected cutaneous
        basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, or carcinoma in situ of the uterine cervix
        that has been treated with no evidence of recurrence) c. Presence of acute coronary
        syndrome (eg, acute myocardial infarction, unstable angina pectoris) within 24 weeks before
        screening (Visit 1) d. History of significant cerebrovascular disease within 24 weeks
        before screening (Visit 1)

          -  Participants who have had significant trauma or major surgery within 4 weeks before
             the screening (Visit 1), or with any major elective surgery scheduled to occur during
             the study.

          -  Participant with evidence of cirrhosis with or without decompensation (ie, esophageal
             varices, hepatic encephalopathy, portal hypertension, ascites)

          -  Participant with primary sclerosing cholangitis

          -  Participant with evidence of positive hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) or hepatitis
             B core antibody (HBcAb) Note: if a subject tests negative for HBsAg, but positive for
             HBcAb, the subject would be considered eligible if no presence of hepatitis B virus
             (HBV) DNA is confirmed by HBV DNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) reflex testing
             performed in the central laboratory

          -  Participant with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) (positive HCV antibody [HCVAb] and
             HCV RNA) Note: Participant who are HCVAb positive without evidence of HCV RNA may be
             considered eligible (spontaneous viral clearance or previously treated and cured
             [defined as no evidence of HCV RNA at least 12 weeks prior to baseline])

          -  Participant with any of the following abnormalities in hematology and/or serum
             chemistry profiles during screening (Visit 1) Note: Screening laboratory tests, if the
             results are considered by the investigator to be transient and inconsistent with the
             subject's clinical condition, may be repeated once during the screening period for
             confirmation results must be reviewed for eligibility prior to the screening
             colonoscopy procedure

                  Modification of Diet in RenalDisease Study Equation Note: if platelet count is
                  &lt;150,000 cells/mm3, a further evaluation should be performed to rule out
                  cirrhosis, unless another etiology has already been identified

          -  Participant with known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection based on
             documented history with positive serological test, or positive HIV serologic test at
             screening, tested at the site's local laboratory in accordance with country
             requirements or tested at the central laboratory Note: A documented negative HIV test
