  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the effect of curcumin food supplement on gut microbiota of children with
      irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and to review any correlation between the changes in the
      microbiota with symptoms.

      This is a prospective, placebo-controlled, double blinded, randomized control trial. This
      study will evaluate the effect of curcumin food supplement on gut microbiota of children with
      irritable bowel syndrome. Curcumin is a commonly used spice in Asian cooking and has a very
      good safety profile. Developing preparation of this compound for targeted delivery in the GI
      tract would provide a novel way to treat common FGID. This study will provide preliminary
      data for future studies to evaluate the role of gut microbiota in the pathophysiology of pain
      predominant FGID and how food supplements can be used to manipulate the microbiota.

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Comparison of GI Symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>To compare the GI symptoms at baseline and after 8-weeks of curcumin dietary supplementation we will be using a previously validated Irritable Bowel Syndrome Severity Scoring System (IBS-SSS) questionnaire (Francis CY, Morris J, Whorwell PJ. The irritable bowel severity scoring system: a simple method of monitoring irritable bowel syndrome and its progress. Aliment Pharmacol Ther 1997; 11(2): 395-402). This questionnaire measures symptom severity and includes a scale of &quot;none&quot; to &quot;very severe&quot; or &quot;very happy to very unhappy&quot; or &quot;not at all&quot; to &quot;completely&quot; as well as &quot;often/occasionally/never.&quot; The maximum achievable score is 500 and mild, moderate and severe cases are indicated by scores of 75 to 175, 175 to 300 and &gt;300 respectively. Higher scores means worse outcome and vice versa. At the end of the 8-weeks curcumin supplementation any absolute or relative decrease in the total score in comparison to baseline will considered as improvement in outcome.</description>
