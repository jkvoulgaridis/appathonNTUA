  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this multi-center study, the investigators plan to develop a simple blood-based test for
      early detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The test is based on a single injection of
      Pramlintide, an amylin analogue and FDA-approved drug currently used for treatment of
      diabetes. The investigative team has provided evidence in humans with full-blown AD and
      AD-relevant mouse models that a single injection of Pramlintide transiently renders the blood
      brain barrier (BBB) more permeable to Amyloidbeta (Aß) peptides, allowing their efflux from
      the brain compartment into the blood. This Aß efflux causes a corresponding transient
      elevation of blood levels of Aß, the magnitude of which the applicants believe is
      proportional to the brain amyloid load as determined by AV-45 PET. The measured difference in
      the level of plasma Aß taken just before and a short time after injection should reveal the
      magnitude of the transient increase in blood Aß levels. Supportive preliminary data comes
      from later stage (full-blown) AD patients with more in-depth background studies in Tg2576 and
      5X Familial Alzheimer's Disease (FAD) mouse models. If successful for use as an early AD
      (i.e., at the Mild Cognitive Impairment [MCI] stage) biomarker, this could be a game-changer
      for both early AD diagnostics and clinical trials aimed at identifying and testing the
      efficacy of drugs useful for treatment of AD at early stages. If Pramlintide is effective in
      releasing mobile pools of Aß from the brain into the blood, this could also have some
      therapeutic potential, with the goal of reducing brain amyloid load.

      Three groups of particpants will be studied: 1) amnestic MCI with or without positive AD
      imaging pathology, 2) probable AD with positive imaging AD pathology, and 3) controls who
      have normal cognition and do not have memory complaints.

    <description>Enrolled subjects will have a pre-trial blood draw (3 ml) and will be placed with an IV needle for future blood draws. Pramlintide will be subcutaneously injected in the abdominal area. For each arm the participants will be randomized so that half will be given a dose of 0.8 mcg/kg and the other half of the arm a dose of 1.6 mcg/kg. Blood will be drawn before and at 5, 30, 60, and 180 min after injection. Vital signs and blood glucose will also be checked at these time points. Thirty minutes after the injection, subjects will be offered a standard meal. Subjects will have a final check of vital signs and blood glucose approximately 15 min before discharge.</description>
