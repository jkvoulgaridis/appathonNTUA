  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is estimated that 30% of Alzheimer's disease cases globally are associated with changeable
      risk factors, such as diet and physical activity. In particular, a Mediterranean diet (MD)
      has been associated with reduced risk of cognitive decline and improved brain function.

      The investigators developed educational resources on the Mediterranean diet and lifestyle
      (THINK-MED) in accordance with the Medical Research Council guidance for developing and
      evaluating complex interventions, based on a systematic literature review and informed by
      qualitative work with patients with mild memory problems.The feedback gathered informed
      refinements and tailoring of the resource and overall MD intervention.

      This study aims to evaluate feasibility of the &quot;THINK-MED&quot; Mediterranean lifestyle
      educational intervention to encourage dietary behaviour change among community-dwelling
      people with subjective cognitive impairment.

      This pilot RCT aims to evaluate the feasibility of a theory-based, tailored Mediterranean
      lifestyle education intervention (THINK-MED) to encourage behaviour change among participants
      who have subjective cognitive impairment.

      This study will be a 6 month randomised controlled trial (RCT) with a total of 30
      participants who will be randomised to 1 of 3 groups:

        1. Group 1 will receive the &quot;THINK-MED&quot; Mediterranean Lifestyle Education for Memory
           resource on one occasion at baseline (n=10)

        2. Group 2 will receive the &quot;THINK-MED&quot; Mediterranean Lifestyle Education for Memory
           resource at monthly intervals for 5 months, with an initial face-to-face visit from the
           research dietitian (month 1) and accompanied by telephone feedback (month 2-5) (n=10)

        3. Group 3 is a control group. Participants in this group will receive the &quot;THINK-MED&quot;
           Mediterranean Lifestyle Education for Memory resource after completing the 6 month study
           (n=10)
