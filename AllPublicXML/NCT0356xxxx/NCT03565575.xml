      Primary Objective:

      The purpose of this trial is to evaluate the impact of an interactive tablet based
      counselling session correcting risk perception and addressing ambiguity around availability,
      usability and effectiveness of PrEP on PrEP uptake within 6 months in adolescent girls and
      young women (AGYW) aged 18-24 years.

      Hypothesis:

      Correcting misperceptions of risks of HIV infection and off-setting ambiguity effects about
      the availability, usability and efficacy of PrEP, through localized, interactive,
      tablet-based counselling, will increase uptake of PrEP in HIV-negative AGYW.

      Study outcomes:

      The primary outcomes for the study will be risk perception measured in a follow-up survey at
      6 months and proportion of women taking up PrEP within 6 months measured with biomarkers of
      plasma antiretroviral (ARV) drug presence.

    <description>Intervention participants play an interactive tablet based quiz including the following information components:
Risks of HIV infection under different scenarios such as between two hypothetical individuals and with different behaviours.
Interactive counselling on key facts around PrEP, its usability and local availability
All individuals will have the option to sign up for contact by a nurse from the health clinic to discuss PrEP further and make an appointment for a visit. Participants will also be given a PrEP referral letter which they can present directly at one of the participating study clinics to begin PrEP. In two sites a community-led intervention will also be implemented to address social obstacles and to increase support from peers, families and social structures.</description>
