      The study aims to compare the results between colonoscopies with two different attachments on
      the distal end of the colonoscope.

  <detailed_description>

      This will be a prospective, randomized controlled study. Subjects referred for a screening,
      surveillance, or diagnostic colonoscopy will be prospectively enrolled. This study aims to
      compare the number of adenomas detected per colonoscopy (APC) between an Endocuff colonoscopy
      and an AmplifEYE colonoscopy.

      It is estimated that the Endocuff Vision will result in an APC of 2.3. The investigators
      consider that a clinically acceptable ADR for the Medivators device would be within 20% of
      this value or 1.5.

    <description>Comparison of the insertion time, overall withdrawal time, inspection time, and total procedure time between the AmplifEYE colonoscopy and the Endocuff Vision colonoscopy.
Insertion time: time it takes from the colonoscope first being inserted to when the cecum is reached Withdrawal time: time calculated from when withdrawing is started in the cecum until the colonoscope is removed. This includes time spent washing, suctioning, inspecting the colon, and removing polyps.
Inspection time: time spent actually examining the colon and does not include time spent for washing the colon, suctioning, and removing polyps.
Total procedure time: time from the initial insertion of the colonoscope through the complete withdrawal of the colonoscope.</description>
