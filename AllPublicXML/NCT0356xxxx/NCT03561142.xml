  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a growing body of evidence that surgery and associated morbidities can be omitted
      without compromising oncological safety in selected patients who have achieved a clinical
      complete response after radiochemotherapy. However with standard neoadjuvant treatment
      regimens the pathological complete response rate lies in the range between 10%-20%, the
      number of patients qualifying for non-operative management is even lower since the
      sensitivity of currently available diagnostic measures for predicting the pathological
      complete response hardly surpasses 50%-60%.The hereby proposed phase II trial CAO/ARO/AIO-16
      aims at finding novel and innovative aspects of rectal cancer treatment. According to
      recently published data the radiochemotherapy regime in the present study with consolidating
      chemotherapy and delayed assessment of response has the potential to achieve pathological
      complete rates of approximately 40%. A standardized re-evaluation after consolidating
      chemotherapy will select patients who are candidates for organ-preservation. These patients
      will not undergo radical surgery and will instead be follow-up closely for tumor regrowth.
