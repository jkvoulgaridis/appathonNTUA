  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Existing real-world studies have provided evidence that novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs) in
      general and rivaroxaban in particular are more effective and at least as safe as warfarin in
      non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) patients with renal impairment. Nevertheless, it is
      known that clinicians often hesitate to prescribe NOACs to patients with even moderate renal
      impairment. Therefore, it is important to investigate effectiveness and safety of rivaroxaban
      and other NOACs compared to vitamin-K antagonists in NVAF patients with renal dysfunction in
      real life setting.

      The primary objectives of this study are to describe the risk of ischemic stroke (IS)/
      systemic embolism (SE) and intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) in patients with non-valvular atrial
      fibrillation (NVAF) and renal impairment initiating treatment with individual NOACs
      (rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban) compared to phenprocoumon.
