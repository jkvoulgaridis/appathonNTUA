    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and effectiveness of DTG use in HIV
      positive pregnant women. This is a 3-year multi-site prospective observational study.
      Approximately, 250 HIV positive pregnant women from potential European AIDS Treatment Network
      (NEAT ID) sites across Europe will be enrolled. The enrollment period will be over 2 years
      with a follow-up period of 1 year for outcomes. The data collected will be that obtained
      during routine standard of care assessments; and the subjects will not undergo any
      interventional study procedures.
