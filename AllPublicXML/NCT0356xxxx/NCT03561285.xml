  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The burden of stroke is increasing in many low- and middle income countries.(1) Around 10% of
      all thrombotic cerebrovascular events (CVE) occur in young population defined as younger than
      50 years old (2)

      In the majority of these patients, the cause of the ischaemic stroke remains undetermined.(3)
      Arterial thrombosis is a major clinical manifestation of the antiphospholipid syndrome (APS),
      an autoimmune condition characterised by thrombotic events and/or pregnancy morbidity with
      persistently positive antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) (4).

      Considering all patients with cerebral ischaemia, the prevalence of aPL seems rather high in
      young adults, who might constitute a subgroup at high risk for recurrence.(5)

      Through the support of the Antiphospholipid Syndrome Alliance for Clinical Trials and
      International Networking (APS ACTION), a systematic review aiming to estimate the frequency
      of clinically significant aPL profiles in the general population (no age limit) was
      completed. (6)

      The pathogenesis of ischemic stroke is complex, and several studies documented
      hypercoagulable states as a significant mechanism underlying stroke. (8).

      The latter include protein C, protein S, or antithrombin III deficiencies, activated protein
      C resistance and anti-phospholipid antibodies (aPLA), including anticardiolipin (aCL)
      antibodies or lupus anticoagulant (LAC), which influence stroke susceptibility owing to their
      capacity to disturb normal hemostatic mechanisms (9).

      While aPLA are clinically associated with a state of hypercoagulation and prothrombotic
      disorders, the exact mechanism underlying their prothrombotic effects remains unknown (10).

      aPLA are detected either functionally, owing to their ability to prolong coagulation time in
      a phospholipid-dependent coagulation test (LAC), or by measuring specific [anticardiolipin
      (aCL) and antiphosphatidylserine (aPS)] antibodies by specific immunoassays, using anionic
      phospholipids as antigens (11).

      The contribution of LAC to the overall risk of both venous and arterial thrombosis, including
      ischemic stroke, is now well recognized (12).

      While the contribution of aPLA (including LAC and aCL antibodies) to thrombosis is well
      established, their role as independent risk factors in the pathogenesis of ischemic stroke
      yielded apparently conflicting results. (13).

      These conflicting results could be explained by differences in ethnic origin , inherent
      variation in aPLA levels and in the failure in some studies to account for the contribution
      of covariates (14).

      Osteopontin (OPN) was first identified as a protein involved in bone remodelling, but later
      also shown to have important immunological roles. (15).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  A study was included if it reported on the laboratory investigation of any aPL and
             confirmed CVE

          -  Included patients aged &lt;50 years

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Exclusion criteria included non-atherosclerotic causes, rheumatic heart disease,
             ventricular arrhythmias, uncompensated heart failure, stroke secondary to atrial
             fibrillation, hematoma, brain tumors, accidental or iatrogenic stroke, arterial
             malformation and recent acute myocardial infarction. Information on cardiovascular and
             cerebrovascular risk factors will be obtained at baseline.

          -  Cardiovascular disease will positive if subjects reported a history of heart disease
             or stroke, whereas diabetes will be assessed according to fasting blood glucose and/or
             use of glucose-lowering drugs (including insulin).
