  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      OPTIMUM (MIBG 2014-01) is a Phase II, single-arm, non-randomized, open-label study of
      therapeutic 131I-iobenguane (131I-MIBG) for the treatment of neuroblastoma. The study will be
      conducted in male and female subjects, greater than 1 year of age, with iobenguane avid,
      relapsed, high-risk neuroblastoma.

      Subjects will receive 18 mCi/kg of 131I-MIBG intravenously, and if the subject qualifies, the
      subject will receive the second 18 mCi/kg 131I-MIBG treatment (no sooner than 6 weeks
      following the first therapeutic 131I-MIBG treatment). Subject must have an overall response
      of stable disease or better, as assessed by the Investigator, and meet certain predefined
      criteria to receive the second treatment.

      Following a screening period of up to 4 weeks, the duration in the study treatment phase for
      an individual subject, who receives two treatments, is up to 22 weeks. For an individual
      subject, who receives one treatment only, the duration of the treatment phase is 16 weeks. In
      addition, there is a 2-year follow-up after the treatment phase, during which assessments
      will be performed to assess disease progression, as well as record adverse events.

             showed new progressive disease (revised INRC criteria progressive disease) as
             described in Park, et al. (2017).This may include one or more of the following drugs:

             of study drug.

          6. If a woman of childbearing potential, have a negative serum pregnancy test result
             prior to each dosing and, if sexually active, be practicing an effective method of
             birth control [e.g., intrauterine device, double-barrier method (i.e., diaphragm, or a
             cervical cap) with intravaginal spermicidal foam, cream or gel], or male partner
             sterilization throughout the study.

          7. Age at study entry ≥1 year.

          8. Previous platelet transfusions are permitted, as long as the subject has a platelet

             and serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase (aspartate aminotransferase) [SGOT (AST)]
             &lt;3 × upper limit of normal (note that for ALT, the upper limit of normal for all sites
             is defined as 45 U/L).

         12. Normal thyroid function as measured by T4 and TSH or have abnormal results that are
             not considered clinically important by the Investigator or may be receiving
             levothyroxine.

         13. Cardiac Function: Ejection fraction (≥55%) documented by echocardiogram within 1 month
