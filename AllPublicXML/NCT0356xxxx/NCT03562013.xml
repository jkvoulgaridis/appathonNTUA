  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A systematic review examining outpatient opioid use identified only three pediatric studies
      published between 2015 and 2016. Of these three, two studies had a short-term follow up with
      patients at three days after discharge; moreover, these three studies were limited by
      focusing on one surgical population, restriction of data to 0-12 yr old participants, and the
      other being a brief report. As a result, there are no pediatric studies that have examined
      opioid use amongst 0-18 yr olds, across multiple surgery types, and beyond 3 days after
      discharge.

      This study is being done to learn how long children (0-18 yrs) needed to use the prescribed
      opioid medication for and how families can be better prepared to provide adequate and safe
      pain management at home. Follow up will take place 28 days after discharge from the hospital.
