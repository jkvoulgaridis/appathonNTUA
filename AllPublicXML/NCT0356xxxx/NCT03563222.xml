    <description>Smoflipid is a sterile, nonpyrogenic, white, homogenous lipid emulsion for intravenous infusion. The lipid content of Smoflipid is 0.20 g/mL, and comprises a mixture of soybean oil, medium chain triglycerides, olive oil, and fish oil. Smoflipid is indicated as a source of calories and essential fatty acids for parenteral nutrition when oral or enteral nutrition is not possible, insufficient, or contraindicated.
The mean essential fatty acid content of Smoflipid is 35 mg/mL linoleic acid (omega-6) and 4.5 mg/mL α-linolenic acid (omega-3).</description>

    <description>Intralipid 20% is a sterile, non‑pyrogenic fat emulsion intended as a source of calories and essential fatty acids. Intralipid 20% is indicated as a source of calories and essential fatty acids for patients requiring parenteral nutrition for extended periods of time and as a source of essential fatty acids for prevention of essential fatty acid deficiency. The major component fatty acids are linoleic acid, oleic acid, palmitic acid, α-linolenic acid and stearic acid.</description>

    <intervention_name>Smoflipid</intervention_name>
    <description>The study drugs will be infused via a dedicated line for parenteral nutrition (PN) into a central vein using a central venous catheter or a peripherally inserted central catheter.
The initial rate of infusion should be no more than 0.05 mL/minute for the first 10 to 15 minutes. If no untoward reactions occur, the rate can be changed to permit infusion of 0.5 mL/kg/hour.
The individual dosage of study drug should be infused at a constant rate for 10 to 24 h/d. The administration flow rate is determined by dividing the volume of study drug by the duration of the infusion. Maximum infusion rate for lipid should not exceed 0.125 g/kg/h lipid.
Study drug infusions should be given 5 to 7 days per week. Study treatment will last for a minimum of 90 consecutive days and as long as PN is indicated, up to 365 consecutive days. If the indication for PN continues after Study Day 365, PN will continue per normal institution policy.</description>
