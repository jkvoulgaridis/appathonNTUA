  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is observed that pregnant women using psychoactive substance (s) have a more random and
      more accidental pregnancy follow-up than women with no addictive problems.

      The consumption approach can be either omitted during the pregnancy monitoring, or entrusted
      to the course or more often in late pregnancy or occurs more brutally during delivery at the
      time of complications (neonatal or obstetric). In this context, health professionals are
      looking for levers that allow women to take appropriate care quickly.

      This difficulty of access to care questions us and all the more because the time of the
      pregnancy is a moment of important psychic reorganization conducive to modify its habits, to
      change its glance on its consumptions and thus to start a care concerning addiction.

      Invesigators hypothesize that this population has less access to medical care during
      pregnancy for fear of stigmatization by the health care provider.

      Invesigators propose a multicenter qualitative study based on individual clinical interviews
      to collect the testimony of women who used psychoactive substance (s) during their pregnancy.

      The purpose of this work is to identify ways to improve the multidisciplinary medical
      management of these women by focusing on the representations they can make care of.
