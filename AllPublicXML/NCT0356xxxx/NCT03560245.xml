  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized double-blind Placebo-controlled, Phase 2 study comparing bryostatin to
      placebo for the treatment of moderately severe to severe Alzheimer's disease in subjects not
      receiving memantine treatment. The study is 15 weeks in duration, including a safety and
      efficacy evaluation 30 days after the last dose of study drug. Subjects will receive 7 doses
      of study drug during the study. The primary efficacy endpoint is defined as the change from
      baseline to Week 13 in the Severe Impairment Battery (SIB) total score.

      Eligible subjects will be stratified based on Mini Mental State Exam (MMSE-2) scores 4-9 vs.
      10-15 and will be randomized 1:1 to one of two treatment arms: 20µg bryostatin or placebo for
      twelve weeks. The first two doses of study drug will be a loading dose 20% higher (i.e.,
      24µg) than the assigned dose and will be administered one week apart. Thereafter, the
      assigned dose of 20µg will commence with the third dose and be administered every other week.
      Drug is administered IV by continuous infusion over 45(±5) minutes. Subjects are scheduled to
      receive seven doses over 12 weeks.

    <description>The Severe Impairment Battery (SIB) assesses cognition in subjects with moderate and severe Alzheimer's disease(AD). Test questions measure attention, language, orientation, memory, praxis, visuospatial ability, construction, social skills, orienting head to name. Non-verbal responses are allowed, thus decreasing the need for language output. Forty questions are included with a total point score range of 0-100. Lower scores indicate greater cognitive impairment.</description>
