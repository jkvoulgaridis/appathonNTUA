  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multicenter study of
      repeated doses of MOR106 administered as IV infusion. MOR106, is an antibody which is being
      developed as a treatment for diseases such as psoriasis and atopic dermatitis. An antibody is
      a protein that is made by the body in a defense reaction against viruses and bacteria or
      other small particles. In this case, MOR106 will act against IL-17C interleukin by binding to
      it. This way it could be possible to act against these diseases.
