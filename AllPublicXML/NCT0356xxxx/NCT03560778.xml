      A small bladder capacity and more frequent urgency episodes were predictors of OAB-wet, and
      the above findings might indicate that OAB-wet and OAB-dry are a continuum of OAB. Older age,
      high maximum flow rate, high detrusor pressure at maximum flow rate and the presence of
      urodynamic stress incontinence were also independent predictors for OAB-wet, and the above
      might indicate that OAB-wet and OAB-dry have at least partly different underlying
      pathophysiologies.

      Aims: To identify factors predicting the presence of OAB-wet and to further derive the
      underlying pathophysiology in OAB-wet vs. OAB-dry.

      Methods: Between September 2007 and September 2013, the medical records of women with OAB who
      completed a 3-day bladder diary and underwent urodynamic studies in a tertiary referral
      center will be reviewed. OAB-wet will be diagnosed in patients who complained of at least one
      episode of urgency incontinence in the previous month; otherwise, OAB-dry is diagnosed.
      Multivariate logistic regression analysis will be used to predict the presence of OAB-wet.

    <description>The variables of urodynamic study included maximum flow rate, average flow rate, voided volume, volume of strong to desire, detrusor pressure at maximum flow during voiding cystometry (PdetQmax), Valsalva leak point pressure (VLPP), maximal urethral pressure (MUP), maximal urethral closure pressure (MUCP), functional profile length, urethral closure pressure area (UCPA), continence length, continence area, pressure transmission ratio (PTR) at MUP, and electromyography (EMG). The urodynamic parameters will be interpreted together to get a complete urodynamic report and diagnosis, thus to compare the difference between OAB-wet and OAB-dry</description>

    <measure>Compare the difference of bladder diary parameters between OAB-wet and OAB-dry</measure>
    <time_frame>1 week</time_frame>
    <description>The 3-day bladder diary parameters included maximum daytime voided volume excluding the morning void derived from 3-day bladder diaries (DVVmax), urgency episodes, urgency incontinence episodes, daytime frequency, nocturia, total voided volume and total water intake. The bladder diary parameters will be interpreted together to get a complete report, such as urinary urgency and nocturia, thus to compare the difference between OAB-wet and OAB-dry</description>
