  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective, open-label, multi-site, growth, safety and tolerance study to
      evaluate a NF (New Formula). A minimum of 45 evaluable infants with confirmed growth failure
      will be enrolled. Growth failure for 30 infants will be due to congenital heart disease and
      15 infants due to other organic or non-organic causes. Study infants (in-patient or living
      with parents/ caregivers at home) will be fed the NF for a period of up through 16 weeks or
      until the time the infant subject meets criteria for switching to a lower calorie density
      formula, relative to baseline in infants with growth failure. Weight, height, head
      circumference and mid upper arm circumference will be measured regularly throughout the
      study. NF and other food intake, tolerance and stool diaries will be completed regularly.
      Serious adverse and adverse events will be monitored throughout the study. Infants will be
      evaluated, at each study visit, for criteria to switch to a lower calorie density formula.
      The primary objective is to improve weight-for-age z score relative to baseline. The
      secondary objectives are to improve weight-for-length, length-for-age, head
      circumference-for-age, mid upper arm circumference-for-age, weight velocity and length
      velocity z scores relative to baseline.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Infants must have attained term gestation (≥37 weeks of gestational age) at the time
             of screening

          2. Infants, male or female, aged 1 through 8 months

          3. Infants with congenital heart disease or other organic/non-organic cause of growth
             failure with a weight-for-length z score ≤ -1.0 or weight gain ≤ -2.0 z score based on
             WHO growth standards. (for weight gain metrics please see Appendix I): Weight gain (g)
             for boys and girls by age ( -2 z scores for weight velocity). Infants with Down
             syndrome must have a weight for length z-score ≤-1.0 z score. Infants with Down
             syndrome who meet the weight gain criterion (≤ -2.0 z-score weight gain) and have a
             weight for length z-score &gt;-1.0 z-score will not be eligible for enrolment.

          3. 3. Infants with known or suspected genetic conditions listed in Appendix VI and/or
             metabolic conditions known to interfere with growth or body dysmorphology that can
             interfere with obtaining standard anthropometric measurements (weight, length, head
             circumference, and mid upper arm circumference), with the exception of infants
             diagnosed with Down syndrome who may be enrolled in the study

             nutrition.

          6. Child feeding directly at the breast more than twice per day

          7. Infants participating in any other studies involving investigational or marketed
             products concomitantly or within two weeks prior to the entry into the study. Infants
             participating in vaccination trials, who are only receiving follow-up blood
             monitoring, are not excluded.

          8. Principal Investigator's uncertainty about the willingness or ability of the
             parent/caregiver or legal guardian to comply with the protocol requirements

          9. Infants whose parent is younger than the legal age of consent

         10. Infants born large for gestational age (LGA). LGA: Birth weight &gt; 90th percentile for
             gestational age (please see chart in Appendix I)

         11. Infants born small for gestational age (SGA). SGA: Birth weight &lt; 10th percentile for
             gestational age (please see chart in Appendix I) * Note: For hepatic dysfunction, a
             conjugated bilirubin &gt;2.0 mg/dL and for renal dysfunction child should not meet any of
             the pRIFLE criteria for renal disease (estimated creatinine clearance decreased by 25%

             more hours) or has chronic medical renal disease. In most children labs need not be
             obtained. These criteria only come into play when there is a consideration of liver or
             renal disease in the individual child.
