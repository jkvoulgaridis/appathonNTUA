  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective collection of data utilizing the Imaging Beta Probe (IBP) in
      patients with positron emission tomography (PET) positive disease. A pilot clinical study
      involving 5 patients will be conducted using the IBP. The sterilized IBP will be used
      intraoperatively in surgical wounds for localization of tumor sites and detecting
      completeness of excision vs. positive margins. The outcome of each of these studies will be
      documented and used to demonstrate clinical benefits of the new probe. The investigators will
      correlate the images from the probe of the Fludeoxyglucose (18FDG) positive tissue, both
      in-vivo and ex-vivo after dissection, with the previously performed PET scan and with the
      routine pathology results obtained on the surgical specimens.The experimental imaging
      modality studied in this protocol will be compared to clinically utilized modalities of
      ultrasound and PET/ CT. Localization between imaging modalities will be compared with respect
      to: detection and side of localization.
