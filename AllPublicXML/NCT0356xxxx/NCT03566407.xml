    <textblock>
      To evaluate the relationship between noninvasive biomarkers (patient serological markers and
      metagenomic analysis of stool) and disease status as determined by colonoscopy and by
      clinical symptoms in patients with Crohn's disease, and to evaluate whether changes in the
      biomarker levels over time correlate to changes in the state of patients' disease.

    <description>The primary endpoint for assessing clinical validity of candidate biomarker will be correlation to the degree of mucosal healing as determined by colonoscopy scored by the Simple Endoscopic Score for Crohn's Disease (SES-CD). - A scale that via colonoscopy of Crohn's disease patients measures: 1. Presence and size of ulcers 2. Extent of ulcerated surface 3. Extent of affected surface and 4. Presence and type of intestinal narrowings. Scale goes from 0 to 56 with a higher score indicating greater severity of disease.</description>

             informed consent and are undergoing a colonoscopy at the study site.

          2. The patient must have a confirmed diagnosis of CD based on results a complete medical
             evaluation and the assessment by a physician specialized in inflammatory bowel
