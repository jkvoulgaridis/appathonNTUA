  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gastric cancer is one of the most common malignant tumors worldwide. With the rapid aging of
      global population, the number of elderly patients with local advanced gastric cancer is
      increasing. Surgery is the essential treatment for local advanced gastric cancer. However,
      because of the degeneration of physiological organs, cell functions, compensatory ability,
      immunity, and physiological reserve ability, elderly patients often face great safety issues
      when having surgery. Therefore, how to treat the elderly patients with local advanced gastric
      cancer with safe and effective surgery is one of the important problems in the field of
      gastric cancer treatment. With the introduction of minimally invasive treatment concepts and
      techniques, the role of laparoscopic radical gastrectomy in the treatment of early gastric
      cancer, as well as the advantages of trauma control and postoperative accelerated
      rehabilitation have been confirmed, however, there is still a lack of sufficient high-level
      clinical evidence in the elderly patients with advanced gastric cancer. The current study
      therefore aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of laparoscopic versus open gastrectomy
      for advanced gastric cancer in elderly patients, using a randomized parallel controlled study
      design. The investigators hypothesized that laparoscopic gastrectomy is superior to open
      gastrectomy in terms of perioperative safety for local advanced gastric cancer patients aged
      70 and above.

      Gastric cancer is one of the most common cancer and cause of cancer death worldwide. With the
      rapid aging of global population, the number of elderly patients with local advanced gastric
      cancer has been continuously increasing. Surgery is the essential treatment for local
      advanced gastric cancer. However, elderly patients are at high risk of postoperative
      complications due to reduced functional reserve and increased comorbidities. Studies have
      shown that elder patients can have postoperative complication incidence up to 18%-32% and
      surgery-related mortality rate to 3.8%-9.5%. Therefore, elderly patients usually require more
      restrict operative injury control compared to the younger population. Surgical safety and
      effectiveness has become a crucial research focus for local advanced gastric cancer among
      elderly patients.

      Laparoscopic gastrectomy is one of the standard treatments for early gastric cancer and has
      demonstrated its application value in local advanced gastric cancer. Two recent meta-analysis
      on observational studies have shown the feasibility of laparoscopic gastrectomy in elderly
      gastric cancer patients. Compared to conventional open resections, elderly patients may
      benefit from the advantages of laparoscopic approach such as less trauma, less blood loss,
      faster bowel movement recovery, earlier food intake, and shorter hospitalization. However,
      laparoscopic gastrectomy raises issues such as prolonged operation time and disturbance of
      circulatory and respiratory dynamics by carbon dioxide pneumoperitoneum during the procedure.
      Nonetheless, all currently available evidence comes from observational studies that are
      susceptible to bias and evidence on long-term survival is scarce. The investigators therefore
      proposed to conduct this randomized controlled trial comparing the feasibility and survival
      benefit of laparoscopic with open gastrectomy for elderly patients with local advanced
      gastric cancer. The investigators hypothesized that laparoscopic gastrectomy is superior to
      open gastrectomy in terms of perioperative safety for local advanced gastric cancer patients
      aged 70 and above.

    <description>Will be assessed using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life questionnaires (i.e. QLQ-C30), which contains both QLQ-STO22 and ELD14 modules. This is a questionnaire developed to assess the generic and disease-specific quality of life for elderly gastric cancer patients by European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer. The Summary Score will be calculated from the mean of scales. Prior to calculating the mean, the symptom scales will need to be reversed to obtain a uniform direction of all scales. The summary score should only be calculated if all of the required scale scores are available (using scale scores based on the completed items, provided that at least 50% of the items in that scale have been completed.</description>
