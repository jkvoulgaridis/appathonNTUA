  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study would be conducted to assess the effectiveness of low-level laser therapy,
      hyaluronic acid gel and herbal gel as adjunctive aids in the healing of gingivectomy wounds.
      As the gingivectomy wound heals by secondary intention, this study aims to compare the
      healing potential of low-level laser therapy, hyaluronic acid gel and herbal gel when applied
      topically at baseline, 1st day,3rd day and 7th day after gingivectomy procedure.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Low-level laser therapy applied to soft tissues stimulates specific metabolic processes in
      healing wounds. Major changes observed in wounds treated with low-level laser therapy(LLLT)
      include increased healthy granulation tissue formation with early epithelization, increased
      fibroblast proliferation and matrix synthesis.

      Hyaluronic acid is a polysaccharide gel and it has many properties that make it a potentially
      ideal molecule for assisting in wound healing by inducing early granulation tissue formation,
      inhibiting inflammation, providing epithelial turnover and also aiding in connective tissue
      angiogenesis.

      Hiora gel is a herbal astringent gel which helps in wound healing, reduces inflammation and
      also alleviates pain.

    <intervention_model_description>The patients will be equally divided into three groups. (Groups A,B&amp;C) All the cases will be prepared preoperatively with scaling and root planing, oral hygeine instructions, occlusal equilibration and dietary evaluation. External bevel gingivectomy will be performed wherein the inflamed gingiva will be excised and shaped.
Group A- The Surgical site will be treated with diode laser following gingivectomy procedure, immediately and on the 1st,3rd and 7th day after surgery.
Group B- Hyaluronic acid will be applied topically to the surgical site immediately after gingivectomy, tin foil would be placed and periodontal dressing given, and on the 1st,3rd and 7th day postoperatively.
Group C- Herbal gel will be applied topically and tin foil placed over which a periodontal dressing would be given immediately after the surgery and on the 1st,3rd and 7th day postoperatively.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Gingival tissue healing will be assessed on a 10 point visual analogue scale.Score in each tooth will be taken including one full interdental papilla
Visual Analogue Scale: will be used to quantify pain levels and patient's discomfort. The VAS consists of a horizontal line of 10 cm (100 mm) with two end-points representing 'no pain' and 'worst pain imaginable'. Patients will be asked to rate their pain by placing a mark on the line corresponding to their current level of pain. The distance along the line from the 'no pain' marker is then measured with a ruler giving a pain score out of 10.
0: No pain 1-3: Slight pain 3.1-6: Moderate pain 6.1-10: Severe pain.</description>

    <description>External bevel gingivectomy will be performed on 30 patients wherein the suprabony pockets will be eliminated with the help of a Bard parker blade no 15. The incision would be given 1mm apical to the pockets which would be marked by a Crane and Kaplan pocket marker, then the incision would be given and the tissue would be removed with the help of kirkland and orbans knives and the gingiva would be shaped. After the surgical procedure the patients would be treated either with the Diode laser(Group A), Hyaluronic acid gel (Group B), or Herbal gel(Group C).</description>
