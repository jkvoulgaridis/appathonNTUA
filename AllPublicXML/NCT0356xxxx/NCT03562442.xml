    <textblock>
      The trial aims to analyse changes in the microbiome of the lower airways after smoking
      cessation. Microbiome analyses (upper airway swabs, bronchoalveolar lavage, transbronchial
      brushing) are conducted in smokers before and 6 weeks after smoking cessation. Never smokers
      serve as a control group and undergo the same sampling procedures once.

      The trial aims to analyze changes in the microbiome of the lower airways after smoking
      cessation. Microbiome analyses (upper airway swabs, bronchoalveolar lavage, transbronchial
      brushing) are conducted in healthy (and willing to quit) smokers before and 6 weeks after
      smoking cessation. Never smokers serve as a control group and undergo the same sampling
      procedures once.

      Demographic and clinical data of the study subjects are obtained, aiming for homogeneous
      groups. All personal data are encrypted according to the standard operating procedures of the
      study site. Pharyngeal and deep nasal swabs are taken.

      To avoid contamination of the lower airways from the oropharynx through the bronchoscope,
      standardized procedures are established according to the German guidelines for bronchoscopy.
      Before bronchoscopy, the endoscope is flushed with sterile saline which is analyzed for 16S
      ribosomal RNA (rRNA) to control for residual contaminating bacterial desoxyribonucleic acid
      (DNA). A 300ml bronchoalveolar lavage with warm normal saline solution is taken from the
      middle lobe. Three covered and &quot;microbiologically protected&quot; bronchial brushings are obtained
      from the right upper lobe. This sterile brush is sealed in wax and pushed through the wax
      just before taking the brushing. All samples are immediately frozen and stored at -80°C until
      further analyses. For cultivations, samples are kept at 4°C and rapidly processed.
