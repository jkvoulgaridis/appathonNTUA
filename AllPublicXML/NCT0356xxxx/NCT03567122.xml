  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to termine if a different attentional focus would alter the
      motor control in cervical muscles during the cranio-cervical test.

      Asymptomatic subjects will be recruited to this study. Superficial electromyography of the
      Sternocleidomastoid, Range of Motion (ROM) and Cranio-Cervical Flexion Test (CCFT) will be
      measured before, immediately after change in focus of attention, 2 days after training under
      a particular focus of attention, and 7 days after training the task under the same focus of
      attention.

      Subjects will be randomized into three groups: Internal focus of attention, external focus of
      attention and control group.

    <description>The Electromyography (EMG) signal amplitude will be determined by the root mean square (RMS) value computed over intervals of 1 s during each 10-s contraction. RMS will be expressed as a percentage of the maximum RMS value during the reference voluntary contraction.</description>

    <description>A neutral position and full range of active cranio-cervical flexion photograph will be taken using a digital camera. That camera will be positioned on a tripod horizontally parallel to the subject's head/neck region at a distance of 80 cm, anatomical markers positioned on the tragus of the ear, the mental protuberance of the mandible and the lateral aspect of the neck. Photos will be taken when the subject reached each level of the craniocervical flexion test. The Cranio-cervical Range of Motion will be expressed as relative percentage of degrees compared to the full range of motion.</description>

    <description>Subjects will instructed to reach each one of the five stages (22-30 mmHg) of the test and hold the pressure as steady as possible for 10s. The stage will be mark as successful if the participant reaches the stage level and hold steady the pressure during the 10-s contrition. However, the individuals that reaches the stage-aimed pressure but are unable to maintain the pressure stable during the 10s contraction or use compensating strategies will be marked as unsuccessful.</description>

    <description>30 subjects will be randomized to this arm. Only internal focus of attention feedback instructions will be given during the execution and training performing the Cranio-Cervical Flexion Test. The subjects allocated to this arm will not be allowed to use the visual feedback traditionally provided during the Cranio-cervical Flexion Test.</description>

    <description>30 subjects will be randomized to this arm. Only external focus of attention feedback instructions will be given during the execution and training performing the Cranio-Cervical Flexion Test. The subjects allocated to this arm will not be allowed to use the visual feedback traditionally provided during the Cranio-cervical Flexion Test. In addition, they will use just a laser point attached to the head to guide their cranio-cervical flexion.</description>
