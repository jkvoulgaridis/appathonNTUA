  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To date, few interventions have been designed specifically to promote physical activity in
      young adult cancer survivors, nor used novel technologies for delivery; none have been
      successful in promoting long-term adherence to PA. The purpose of this randomized controlled
      trial is to test the efficacy of a theory-based, mobile physical activity intervention with
      adaptive goal-setting and tailored feedback that is aimed at increasing physical activity
      among young adult cancer survivors.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are over half a million young adult cancer survivors in the United States. Young adult
      cancer survivors are an underserved and vulnerable subgroup of survivors that experience
      increased risk over time for obesity and chronic diseases such as diabetes and cardiovascular
      disease. Increasing physical activity is a promising behavioral intervention that has
      positive effects on physical function, body composition, cardiovascular fitness,
      health-related quality of life, and depression, and may prevent cancer recurrence, new
      cancers and improve survival. To date, few interventions have been designed specifically to
      promote physical activity in young adult cancer survivors, nor used novel technologies for
      delivery; none have been successful in promoting long-term adherence to physical activity.
      This is a randomized controlled trial to test the efficacy of a theory-based, mobile physical
      activity intervention with adaptive goal-setting and tailored feedback that is aimed at
      increasing PA among young adult cancer survivors. Young adult cancer survivors (n=280),
      diagnosed between ages 18-39, will be recruited and randomized into one of two conditions: 1)
      activity tracker + Facebook group (Self-help) or 2) activity tracker + Facebook group +
      adaptive goal-setting and tailored feedback (Intervention). Young adult cancer survivors will
      receive a 6-month intervention followed by an additional 6 months of tapered contacts.
      Assessments of objectively-measured physical activity and other outcomes will be conducted at
      baseline, 3, 6, and 12 months.

    <measure>Health-related quality of life: Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short Form (SF-36)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Change in health-related quality of life, as measured using the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short Form (SF-36), from baseline to 3, 6, and 12 months. The SF-36 asks respondents to rate their health and abilities to do their usual tasks. The SF-36 uses a variety of questions and response options and includes 8 subscales (physical functioning, role limitations due to physical health, role limitations due to emotional health, energy/fatigue, emotional well-being, social functioning, pain, and general health). Responses are coded on a scale of 0 to 100 where 0 is the worst possible health and 100 is the most favorable health score. The coded responses will be summed to yield a Physical Component Summary (PCS) score and a Mental Component Summary (MCS) score.</description>

    <measure>Health-related quality of life: Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General (FACT-G)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Change in health-related quality of life, as measured using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General (FACT-G) survey, from baseline to 3, 6, and 12 months. The FACT-G is a 27-item measure specific to cancer patients to provide insight into cancer specific factors in four dimensions (physical, social/family, emotional, functional well-being). Participants will respond to a list of statements that tend to impact people with cancer by indicating how much they are impacted on a scale of 0 (not at all) to 4 (very much). Scores for negatively worded statements are reversed so that higher scores indicate positive health. Scores from the four dimensions can be summed to create a total score. Total possible scores range from 0 to 108, with higher scores indicating increased well being.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Behavioral capability</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Change in behavioral capability, as measured by self-report questionnaire, from baseline to 3, 6, and 12 months. Participants will be asked to rate how much they agree with six different statements. Responses range from 1 (strongly disagree) to 6 (strongly agree) and are averaged. Higher scores represent higher behavioral capability.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Self-efficacy for exercise</measure>

    <description>Change in self-efficacy for exercise, as measured by the Self-Efficacy and Exercise Habits Survey, from baseline to 3, 6, and 12 months. Responses for two subscales (Sticking to it, Making time for exercise) are averaged to yield a score from 1 to 5, with higher values representing higher self-efficacy for exercise.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Self-regulation</measure>

Responses to two subscales (Exercise goal-setting, Exercise planning and scheduling), ranging from 1 (does not describe) to 5 (describes completely), are averaged to yield two subscales. Higher subscale scores represent higher self-regulation.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Social support for exercise</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Change in social support for exercise, as measured by the Social Support for Exercise Survey, from baseline to 3, 6, and 12 months. Responses for three factors (Family participation, Friend participation, Friends on social networking sites participation), ranging from 1 to 5, are summed, with higher values representing higher social support for exercise.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Mood</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Change in mood, as measured using the Profile of Mood States-Brief Form (POMS-BF), from baseline to 3, 6, and 12 months. The POMS-BF is a 30 item, self-report measure of six different mood states (such as &quot;tense&quot; or &quot;angry&quot;) are rated based on how well each item describes the respondent's mood during the past week, including today. Items are rated on a 5-point scale with response options ranging from 0 (not at all) to 4 (extremely) with a global score range of 0 to 120 or individual domain scores on Tension-Anxiety, Depression-Dejection, Anger-Hostility, Vigor-Activity, Fatigue-Inertia, and Confusion-Bewilderment. Lower scores indicate better mood state.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Depressive symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Change in depressive symptoms, as measured by the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), from baseline to 3, 6, and 12 months. The CES-D is a self-report depression scale including 20 items that relate to depressive feelings and behaviors during the past week. Response options range from 0 (rarely or none of the time) to 3 (most or almost All the Time). Scores range from 0 to 60, with high scores indicating greater depressive symptoms.</description>
