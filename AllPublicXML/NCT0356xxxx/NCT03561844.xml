  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In recent decades, following an increased longevity in Hong Kong, there is a drastic increase
      in the prevalence chronic conditions, including chronic pain, seems to be the main reasons of
      suffering for many older adults. This condition not only pose a burden to the whole family
      but also the healthcare system.

      While conventional treatment of chronic pain using pharmacotherapy and non-pharmacological
      treatments has been effective for managing symptoms, owing to the adverse side effects caused
      by anti-psychotic drugs and the short effective period incurred by non-pharmacological
      interventions, development of alternative and non-pharmacological approaches for the
      management of pain is of urgent need. Research has shown that aromatherapy (both administered
      through inhalation and therapeutic massage) has been effective in reducing showing
      pain-relieving effects. These findings support the premise that aromatherapy and the
      investigators hope to provide further evidence to support the use of aromatherapy as an
      evidence-based mainstream intervention for pain relief in older adults with chronic pain.

      Whilst there is sufficient evidence to support the effectiveness of aromatherapy, few studies
      compared the effectiveness of the use of aromatherapy by inhalation and/or therapeutic
      massage. The investigators aim to address the above research gaps on the clinical application
      of aromatherapy on chronic pain, with a focus on comparing the differential effectiveness
      between administration by inhalation and administration by therapeutic massage. The proposed
      research aims to (1) test the efficacy and effectiveness of aromatherapy on the symptom
      management of chronic pain in older adults; (2) compare the effects of aromatherapy-scent
      (i.e., inhalation) and aromatherapy-touch (i.e., therapeutic massage) in older adults with
      chronic pain. This study also explores the benefits of aromatherapy on cognitive functioning,
      functional performance and social engagement as secondary outcomes.

      A randomized, controlled, and single blinded trial is proposed. 120 older adults with chronic
      pain will be randomly assigned to aroma inhalation (intervention), aroma-touch or wait-list
      (control) treatments. Pain intensity and subjective changes in mood states (primary outcome),
      cognitive functioning, functional performance and social engagement (secondary outcome) will
      be assessed three times: pre-treatment, mid-treatment, post-treatment. If the study
      hypotheses are supported, the findings will provide empirical support for a treatment option
      that could improve manage the symptoms of patients diagnosed with chronic conditions, and
      also improve cognitive functioning, functional performance, and social engagement of older
      adults.

    <description>Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) will be used to measure the changes of pain among three time points within four months. The 11-point numeric scale ranges from '0' representing one pain extreme (e.g. &quot;no pain&quot;) to '10' representing the other pain extreme (e.g. &quot;pain as bad as you can imagine&quot; or &quot;worst pain imaginable&quot;).</description>

    <description>Cantonese Version of Mini-mental State Examination (MMSE) is a brief 30-point questionnaire used to assess the change of the cognitive functions among three time points at four months. The range of the score is from 0 point to 30 points, which a lower score indicates the worse cognitive functions.</description>

    <description>Chinese Version of the Barthel Index-100 is used to measure the change of the performance in activities of daily living (ADL) among three time points at four months. Scores range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating greater independence.</description>

    <description>The change of the social engagement among three time points at four months will be measured using the 6-item index of social engagement (ISE). Total scores on the ISE can range from 0 to 6, with a higher score indicating a higher level of social engagement.</description>

There are 40 items, where participants will rate on a scale of 0(not at all)-5(extremely) and higher score indicates more distress.</description>
