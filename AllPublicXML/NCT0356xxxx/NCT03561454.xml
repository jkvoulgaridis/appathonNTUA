      Single arm, prospective, multi-center, non-randomized study of subjects treated with single
      fraction, intra-operative radiation therapy at the time of lumpectomy for early stage breast
      cancer.To assess the rate of ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence in subjects treated with the
      Xoft Axxent Electronic Brachytherapy System when used for single-fraction, intra-operative
      radiation therapy treatment of early stage breast cancer when compared to whole breast
      irradiation (WBI) at 5 years of follow-up. The results of this single arm study will be
      compared to whole breast irradiation (WBI).

        General Inclusion Criteria

          1. Subject must have provided written Informed Consent

          2. Subject must have biopsy-proven ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or invasive ductal
             carcinoma of the breast

             a. In addition to invasive ductal carcinoma, allowable invasive carcinomas are: i.
             Adenoid cystic (or adenocystic) carcinoma ii. Low-grade adenosquamous carcinoma iii.
             Medullary carcinoma iv. Mucinous (or colloid) carcinoma v. Papillary carcinoma vi.
             Tubular carcinoma vii. Metaplastic carcinoma viii. Micropapillary carcinoma ix. Mixed
             carcinoma

          3. Subject must be female ≥ 40 years of age

          4. Subject's tumor(s) must be &lt; 3.0 cm in greatest diameter by pre-operative assessment

          5. Clinical staging of Subject's tumor(s) must meet AJCC Tumor Classification: Tis, T1 or
             T2 (&lt; 3 cm), N0, M0

          6. Subject presenting with bilateral breast cancer may be enrolled if BOTH cancers meet
             all of the inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria

          7. Women of child-bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test within one week
             of IORT treatment

          8. Women of child-bearing potential must agree to use adequate contraceptive precautions
             (defined as intrauterine devices, surgical contraceptives or a combination of condom
             and spermicide) from the time of negative pregnancy test through completion of the
             radiation treatment period

        General Exclusion Criteria

          1. Subject is pregnant or nursing

          2. Subject has significant auto-immune disease

          3. Subject has a pacemaker present in the field of radiation or quadrant of the breast
             cancer

          4. Subject has multi-focal breast cancer where the sum of the individual tumor sizes
             (greatest diameters) are &gt; 3 cm Subject has multi-centric breast cancer

          5. Subject has known lympho-vascular invasion

          6. Subject has invasive lobular cancer

          7. Subject has undergone neo-adjuvant chemotherapy or neo-adjuvant endocrine therapy for
             current breast cancer

          8. Subject has a history of recurrent breast cancer in the ipsilateral breast

          9. Subject has had previous radiation exposure of the involved breast

         10. Subject has BRCA 1 or 2 mutations. Note: Testing will only be required for subjects
             presenting with bilateral breast cancer; testing is not required for unilateral
             cancers

         11. Subject has contraindications for radiation

         12. Subject considered by the Investigator to be high-risk for breast conservation surgery
             and/or intra-operative radiation therapy

         13. Subject has participated in any other clinical investigation that is likely to
             confound study results or affect study outcome either at the time of IORT or for 3
             months prior to IORT
