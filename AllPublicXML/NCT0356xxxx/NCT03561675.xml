      Randomized, placebo controlled trial evaluating efficacy of acetazolamide in preventing acute
      mountain sickness in lowlanders older than 40 years travelling from 760 m to 3'100 m.

      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind parallel trial evaluating the efficacy
      of acetazolamide prophylaxis in reducing the incidence of acute mountain sickness (AMS) in
      lowlanders older than 40 years travelling to altitude. Participants living in the Bishkek
      area, Kyrgyzstan (760m), will be transferred by car within 4h to the Tuja Ashu high altitude
      clinic (3'100 m), and stay there for 2 days. Acetazolamide 375mg/day (or placebo), will be
      administered before departure at 760 m and during the stay at altitude. Outcomes will be
      assessed during the stay at 3'100 m.

      An interim analysis will be carried out when 80 participants will have completed the study or
      after the first year. The Peto's method will be used and the trial will be stopped when
      pre-specified futility boundaries were crossed.

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Acute mountain sickness (AMS), severity assessed by the Lake Louise score</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 to 3 at 3'100m</time_frame>
    <description>Difference between acetazolamide and placebo group in the severity of AMS during the stay at 3'100 m. The severity of acute mountain sickness (AMS) will be assessed by the Lake Louise questionnaire (LLS), a validated questionnaire about AMS. The severity will be calculated when the presence of headache and at least one of the following symptoms is present: gastrointestinal upset, fatigue or weakness, dizziness or lightheadedness and difficulty sleeping. Each of the five questions is asked with the corresponding 0 to 3 rating of the response (0 = Not present, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe). The sum of the responses on these questions is then calculated, resulting in the AMS severity.</description>

    <description>Difference between acetazolamide and placebo group in the incidence of ARAHE during the stay at 3'100 m.
ARAHE are defined as the following:
Moderate to severe AMS (Lake Louise score ≥3 and/or Environmental Symptoms questionnaire AMSc score ≥0.7) and/or any of the following:
Severe hypoxemia (SpO2 at rest &lt;80% for &gt;30 min or &lt;75% for &gt;15 min, exercise oxygen desaturation SpO2 &lt;75% for &gt;1 min accompanied by symptoms or signs of hypoxemia)
Symptomatic cardiovascular disease (arterial blood pressure systolic &gt;200 mmHg, diastolic &gt;110 mmHg not responding to blood pressure lowering drugs within 1 hr; chest pain with ECG signs of ischemia or new onset arrhythmia)
Withdrawal from the study by the decision of the independent physician for safety reasons or by the patient.</description>
