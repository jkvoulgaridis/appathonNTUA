  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Black stains (BS) are type of extrinsic discoloration of the tooth. It's characterized as
      dark lines or an incomplete coalescence of dark dots found mostly on cervical third of the
      crown. Most studies worldwide found that children with the black stained teeth have low
      caries prevalence. A study on Brazilian population also suggested that black stains might be
      protective factor against development of dental caries. A study reported that chromogenic
      bacteria were proposed as etiological factor in production of black stains.The most common
      microbiological composition of BS was found to be Actinomycetes. Dental examination and
      saliva samples collection will be done for black stained teeth children of outpatient clinic
      of Pediatric Dentistry and Dental Public Health Department, Faculty of Dentistry, Cairo
      University. This research adopts null hypothesis; it assumes that there is no effect on
      dental caries experience in children with black stained teeth.
