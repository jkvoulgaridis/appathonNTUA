  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children with cerebral palsy present early in the childhood altered muscular properties, as
      soon as structural or stiffness. In the gastrocnemius muscle, altered muscular properties are
      characterized by short muscle belly length and increased stiffness which contribute to
      contracture and limiting joint range of motion.

      This study assess efficacy of a long term stretching program of plantarflexors muscle on
      their viscoelasticity properties and maximal dorsiflexion angle gain. Stretching program is
      characterized by 3 phases: baseline, intervention and follow-up.
