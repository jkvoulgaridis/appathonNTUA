  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Motor skill training and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) have separately been
      shown to alter cortical excitability and enhance motor function in humans. Their combination
      is appealing for augmenting motor recovery in stroke patients, and this is an area presently
      under heavy investigation globally. The investigators have previously shown that the timing
      of tDCS application has functional significance, that tDCS applied prior to training can be
      beneficial for voluntary behavior, and that tDCS effects may not simply be additive to
      training effects, but may change the nature of the training effect. The investigators have
      separately reported in a randomized-controlled clinical trial, that upper limb robotic
      training alone over 12 weeks can improve clinical function of chronic stroke patients. Based
      on our results with tDCS and robotic training, the investigators hypothesize that the same
      repeated sessions of robotic training, but preceded by tDCS, would lead to a sustained and
      functional change greater than robotic training alone. The investigators will determine if
      clinical function can be improved and sustained with tDCS-robotic training and cortical
      physiology changes that underlie functional improvements.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is to evaluate whether multiple sessions of combined tDCS and
      robotic upper limb training in chronic hemiplegia, leads to clinical improvement in upperlimb
      motor impairment. In chronic stroke patients (&gt;6months post-injury, stable unilateral motor
      deficit) using a within-subjects repeated-measures design we will evaluate the effects of 12
      weeks of robotic upperlimb training (3x/week, 36 sessions, shoulder/elbow/wrist in each
      session) with real or sham tDCS before the robotic training. Clinical improvement will be
      determined by a change in upper-limb Fugl-Meyer (primary), Wolf Motor Function Test, Barthel
      Index, and Stroke Impact Scale (secondary) outcome measures following the training, and
      assessed again six months later.

      The investigators further aim to identify and compare the neurophysiological characteristics
      between intervention groups. The relationship between clinical improvement and
      neurophysiological measures pertaining to robotic motor training following stroke are
      presently not described in the literature. By measuring the EMG response from forearm
      musculature to Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation the investigators will establish: (i)
      plasticity associated with training, and (ii) the neurophysiological characteristics of
      patients who respond to training. By understanding how brain excitability changes underpin
      motor dysfunction, and motor recovery, interventions can be more effectively prescribed and
      prognoses established.
