      To compare FFR guided complete revascularization during the index procedure with usual care
      in non-STEMI patients with multivessel disease.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      Patients with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (non-STEMI), as compared with STEMI
      patients, have a higher risk profile, more often MVD and less favourable outcome. Recent
      studies showed that complete revascularization in STEMI patients is feasible and effective.
      However, there is no clear evidence regarding the role of complete coronary revascularization
      by PCI in patients with non-STEMI with MVD.

      Objective:

      To compare FFR guided complete revascularization during the index procedure with usual care
      in non-STEMI patients with multivessel disease.

      Design:

      Prospective, multicentre, 1:1 randomized, investigator initiated study.

      Hypothesis:

      FFR guided complete percutaneous revascularisation of all significant stenosis in the
      non-culprit lesion performed within the index PCI procedure will improve clinical outcomes
      compared to the usual care, guided by discretion of the physician.

Patients previous myocardial infarction versus patients with no previous myocardial infarction
The Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events (GRACE) score estimates the admission 6 month mortality for patients with acute coronary syndrome. The GRACE score ranges from 0 to &gt; 285. A higher GRACE represents a higher mortality risk, ranging from 0-2% when the GRACE is between 0 and 87, to 99% when the GRACE exceeds 285.</description>

    <description>In the ischemia driven complete revascularisation strategy group all flow limiting (FFR ≤ 0.80) lesions will receive treatment by PCI and stenting. The non-IRA PCI should be performed during the same intervention. Exceptions can be made for complex lesions where the operator estimates that the revascularisation procedure will require significant contrast overload, which may lead to deterioration of cardiac and renal function of the patient.</description>

    <description>In the randomised to usual care group the procedure will stop after the PCI of the culprit artery and the patient will be referred to his treating cardiologist and/ or heart team who will decide whether a staged PCI of the non- IRA artery should take place. If the treating cardiologist (after advise of the heart team) decides to perform the non-IRA PCI revascularisation, than such treatment should take place within six weeks from the primary PCI in order to count as a scheduled staged PCI procedure.</description>
