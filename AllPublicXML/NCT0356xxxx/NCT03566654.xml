  <brief_summary>

      Nowadays, the incidence of stroke in China has reached 1.6‰, and this disease has became a
      primary cause of death in China. One of its major risk factors is hypertension. As shown in
      the researches, the risk of stroke grows remarkably when the blood pressure increases and
      there exists a log-linear relationship between them. Systolic pressure and diastolic pressure
      relate to the risk of stroke independently. Systolic pressure decreasing 10mmHg will reduce
      the stroke risk by 31% and decrease of 1~3mmHg will reduce the stroke risk by 20~30%. As to
      diastolic pressure, 5mmHg decrease of it will reduce the stroke risk by 34% and 10mmHg
      decrease of it will reduce the stroke risk by 56%. In addition, patients with isolated
      systolic hypertension (SPB≥160mmHg, DPB≤90mmHg) or critical isolated systolic hypertension
      (SPB=140~159mmHg, DPB&lt; 90mmHg) will suffer a higher risk of stroke than people with normal
      blood pressure. The ACC has already revised its Hypertension Management Guidelines of
      standard of diagnosis for hypertension and timing of starting medical treatment in
      hypertensive patients.Because more and more reseaches shown that people with blood pressure
      between 120-139/80-89mmHg have higher risk of ASCVSD compared to those with blood pressure
      lower than 120/80mmHg; However, in China, the diagnostic criteria for hypertension has not
      been revised yet. Therefore, we still have blind spot in treating such patients who suffer
      from borderline systolic hypertension at 130~140 mmHg of blood pressure with or without ASCVD
      or those with the first stage hypertension but refusing to take anti-hypertension drugs. What
      is more, most of them are middle-aged adults, once they have stroke, it would lead terrible
      and costly consequences to both their family and the society. Thus, it is necessary to
      explore new non-pharmacological methods to control blood pressure for reducing the risk of
      stroke.

      There already have had some researchers found the phenomenon of lowing blood pressure among
      heart failure patients and pre-hypertensive individuals after a long-term of ischemic
      conditioning therapy. However, there's still lack of specific clinical trials carried out to
      confirm itspotential treatment effect of lowing blood pressure.

      The investigators designed this randomized, doubleblind, controlled clinical trial to examine
      (1) whether RIC has a beneficial effect on blood pressure; (2) whether RIC exert its
      protection effect through immunological regulation. There are 2 arms in this trial: One arm
      is RIC treatment, the other one is sham RIC treatment. Blood pressure will be measured by
      ambulatory blood pressure monitoring before and after the treatment to evaluate its exact
      effect on BP. Also, circulatory immunological factors will be tested before and after the
      treatment to illustate whether immunological regulation involved in the process.

    <description>A diagnostic technique for measuring blood pressure in daily life by means of automatic intermittent timing. Because ABPM has overcome the limitations of clinic blood pressure measurement, observation error and white coat effect, it can objectively reflect the actual level and fluctuation of blood pressure. Each patient of the two arms will use ABPM measure blood pressure before and after RIC or sham RIC treatment.</description>
