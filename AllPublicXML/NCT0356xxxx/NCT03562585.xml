  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Previous reports have suggested that ALT-immunoglobulin complex was increased according to
      the severity of the liver disease, and high concentration of mAST and this might indicate a
      severely damaged liver. Immunoassay might be useful as a screening method in the
      differ-ential diagnosis of liver fibrosis according to patients. In this study, the efficacy
      of immunoas-say in the prediction of liver fibrosis in patients with chronic hepatitis B
      (CHB) was evaluated.

      Enzymatic analysis of aspartate/alanine aminotransferase (AST/ALT) does not exactly represent
      the progression of liver fibrosis. Immunoassay for the AST (cytoplasmic [c] AST/mitochondrial
      [m] AST) and ALT (ALT1/ALT2) have been suggested as one of the alternatives for the
      enzy-matic analysis. We evaluated the efficacy of immunoassay in predicting liver fibrosis
      and in-flammation. A total of 219 patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) who underwent
      hepatic ve-nous pressure gradient (HVPG) and liver biopsy before antiviral therapy were
      recruited. Serum samples were prepared from blood during HVPG. The liver function test
      including enzymatic AST/ALT and immunological cAST, mAST, ALT1 and ALT2 were checked with
      sandwich ELI-SA immunoassay with fluorescence labeled monoclonal antibodies, and were
      compared with the METAVIR stage of live fibrosis and the Knodell grade of inflammation.

        Between January 2007 and December 2010, patients with CHB, who simultaneously underwent
        HVPG and liver biopsy for the routine check-up prior to antiviral treatment, were
        prospectively recruited.
