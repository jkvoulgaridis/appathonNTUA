  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to evaluate the improvement in overall shave
      satisfaction, the appearance of skin irritation from shaving, and the razor related
      inflammation of the hair follicles when using a new razor technology in a regular shaving
      regimen as well as a new razor technology in a shaving regimen that includes a pre-shave gel,
      cleansing brush and shaving gel.

      A secondary objective is to show improvement in the satisfaction of the shaving experience,
      symptoms such as bumps and irritation, and quality of life (QOL), when adding the 556 Razor,
      or the 556 Razor with a regimen of pre-shave gel, cleansing brush, and shave gel to the
      shaving regimen of males with shaving skin irritation. Shaving irritation severity will be
      correlated to shave satisfaction.

    <intervention_model_description>Subjects will be divided into two groups: the Razor group of 20 subjects, and the Regimen group of 20 subjects. In the Razor group, subjects will use the 556 Razor with their regular shaving products, and shave at least 5 or more times per week. In the Regimen group, subjects will use the 556 Razor, Pre-Shave Gel, Cleansing brush and Shaving Gel, and shave at least 5 or more times per week. All subjects will be given the 556 Razors during the 12-week study. The Regimen group will also be given the Pre-Shave Gel, Cleansing Brush, and Shaving Gel.</intervention_model_description>

    <measure>Change in Shaving Satisfaction and Appearance score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 4, Week 8, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Shaving Satisfaction and Appearance will be captured by the subject during 12 week time frame to document changes in severity and appearance and assessed by the Patient Global Severity Assessment. The score range is 0-30. The lower the scores; the better the outcome.</description>

    <measure>Change in Investigator Global Severity Assessment (IGA) score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 4, Week 8, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Disease severity will be assessed Investigator Global Severity Assessment (IGA). Appearance will be captured by the PI by using a scale 0 (clear) to 5 (very severe) during the 12 week time frame to document changes in severity and appearance. The score range is 0-5. The lower the scores, the better the outcome.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Disease severity assessed by lesion counts</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 4, Week 8, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Disease severity will be assessed by lesion counts of any follicular papules in the beard area (not including acne) pustules, excoriations, hyperpigmentation, and ingrown hairs. Higher scores are indicative of worse outcome because more lesions mean more involvement of the razor bumps and associated inflammation.</description>
