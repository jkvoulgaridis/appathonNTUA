  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a feasibility study aiming to generate pilot data on safety and efficacy of a novel
      anticoagulant regimen (enoxaparin bolus and prolonged infusion) compared to the local
      standard-of-care in opiate-treated patients undergoing primary percutaneous coronary
      intervention.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Delayed absorption of oral P2Y12 inhibitors in patients undergoing primary percutaneous
      coronary intervention (PPCI) may increase the risk of stent thrombosis. Parenteral treatment
      is needed mitigate this risk.

      We have recently shown a novel regimen of enoxaparin (bolus 0.75 mg/kg followed by an
      infusion of 0.75 mg/kg/6h) to provide consistent antithrombotic effects until the end of the
      infusion (1). We have also demonstrated the high prevalence of delayed platelet inhibition in
      opiate-treated patients (1).

      This is a feasibility study for a larger randomised controlled trial (RCT). We aim to assess
      recruitment rate and collect pilot data on safety and efficacy. This will be a single-centre,
      open-label RCT comparing this novel regimen of enoxaparin to the local standard-of-care which
      usually consists of unfractionated heparin and a glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor. The study
      population will be opiate-treated patients undergoing PPCI. Pre PPCI, patients will be
      allocated in 1:1 ratio using a simple randomisation method using sealed envelopes, to either
      enoxaparin 0.75 mg/kg bolus followed by 0.75 mg/kg infusion over 6 hours (n=50) or the
      standard-of-care of UFH and tirofiban (n=50).

    <intervention_model_description>Patients will be randomised (1:1) using an opaque sealed envelope methodology prior to coronary angiography.
Patients allocated to the experimental arm will receive a parenteral (IA/IV) bolus dose of enoxaparin (0.75 mg/kg) pre PPCI followed by an infusion of 0.75 mg/kg over a 6-hour period to be started as soon as possible when PPCI starts.
Patients randomised to the standard therapy arm will receive treatment as guided by the treating cardiologist in line with the local standard-of-care, usually consisting of UFH and a GPI.</intervention_model_description>
