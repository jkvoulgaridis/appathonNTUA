  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For the total knee arthrorplasty (TKA), the placement of a prosthesis is delicate and the
      correct positioning of the implants determines the result of the surgery.

      Navigation has improved surgical accuracy but remains inadequate with nearly 20% malposition.
      In the early 2010s, robot-assisted surgery solutions were born. Amongst its offers, Stryker's
      MAKO™ system appears to be the most advanced and developed due to its precision and its
      flexibility of use during surgery.

      In this study, the investigators evaluate the placement of the total knee prosthesis with the
      MAKO™ system compared to the placement of the total knee prosthesis with a conventional
      mechanical system for TKA
