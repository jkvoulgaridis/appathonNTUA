    <textblock>
      PAVE(Phased Avelumab combined with chemotherapy as first-line treatment for patients with
      advanced small-cell lung cancer) is a Greek, investigator- initiated, single arm open- label
      phase II study of Avelumab in combination with cisplatin or carboplatin/ etoposide.

      The study will include an initial safety run-in, open-label, singlearm part (Part 1), and the
      actual phase II study (Part 2). The total number of patients will not change (the safety
      run-in patients will be included in the final total number of participants). The safety
      run-in period will not alter the total study timelines, as phase II accrual will follow
      immediately after the safety run-in.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Advanced small cell lung cancer (SCLC) remains a disease with dismal prognosis and new
      therapeutics are urgently needed. SCLC is notably chemosensitive and first-line chemotherapy
      with platinum analogs and etoposide is associated with high rates of initial objective
      responses that unfortunately do not last long.

      The primary endpoint for study design is 1-year PFS rate, where according to RECIST v1.1 PFS
      is determined as the time from the date of study entry to the date of progression, death from
      any cause or date of last contact.Secondary End Point is the evaluation of efficacy of the
      study treatment in terms of Overall Survival (OS), Best Overall Response (BOR), Objective
      Response Rate (ORR) and Duration of Response (DOR).

      Evaluation of the safety of the study treatment by assessing Treatment-Emergent Adverse
      Events (TEAEs).

      Evaluation of the Quality of Life of patients receiving the study the study treatment.
      Evaluation of potential biomarkers on fresh or archival sample,of formalin-fixed paraffin
      embedded tumor tissue block or a minimum of 10 unstained tumor tissue sections. Moreover 10
      ml of EDTA-stored blood sample will be collected as well.

CR: Disappearance of all evidence of target and non-target lesions. PR: At least 30% reduction from baseline in the sum of the longest diameter (SLD) of all lesions.

    <description>The EQ-5D-5L Health Outcome Questionnaire is a measure of health status that provides a simple descriptive profile and a single index value. The EQ-5D-5L defines health in terms of mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. The 5 items are combined to generate health profiles. These profiles were converted to a continuous single index score using a one to one matching. The lowest possible score is -0.59 (unable to walk, unable to self-care, unable to do usual activities, extreme pain or discomfort, extreme anxiety or depression) and the highest is 1.00 (no problems in all 5 dimensions).</description>

    <description>EORTC QLQ-C30 is a 30-question tool used to assess the overall quality of life (QoL) in cancer subjects. It consists of 15 domains: 1 global health status (GHS) scale, 5 functional scales (Physical, role, cognitive, emotional, social), and 9 symptom scales/items (Fatigue, nausea and vomiting, pain, dyspnea, sleep disturbance, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, financial impact. The EORTC QLQ-C30 GHS/QoL score ranges from 0 to 100; High score indicates better GHS/QoL. Score 0 represents: very poor physical condition and QoL. Score 100 represents: excellent overall physical condition and QoL.</description>

    <description>EORTC QLQ-LC13 consists of 13 questions relating to disease symptoms specific to lung cancer and treatment side effects typical of treatment with chemotherapy and radiotherapy. The 13 questions comprises 1 multi-item scale for dyspnea and 10 single-item symptoms and side effects (coughing, hemoptysis, sore mouth, dysphagia, neuropathy, alopecia, and medicine for pain). Score range: 0 (no burden of symptom domain or single symptom item) to 100 (highest burden of symptoms for symptom domains and single items).</description>
