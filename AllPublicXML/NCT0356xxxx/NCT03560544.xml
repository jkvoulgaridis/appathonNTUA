  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) will examine the effect of a tailored workplace
      intervention based on interrupting sitting on work productivity, well-being and
      cardio-metabolic risk in office workers. The experimental group in the 8-week intervention
      will be prompted to alternate between sitting and standing while working. The ratio between
      sitting and standing will begin at 3:1 (two hours per day in an eight-hour day) and increase
      to 1:1 (four hours per day in an eight-hour day) by the end of the second week of the
      eight-week intervention.

    <time_frame>Change from baseline sitting time at 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) will be used to provide a subjective measure of sitting. The scale provides a measure of reported sitting time in minutes.</description>

    <measure>Change in physical activity level (subjective)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline physical activity level at 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) will be used to provide a subjective measure of physical activity level. The scale provides a measure of reported sitting time in minutes for each of three types of physical activity (vigorous, moderate, and walking).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Absenteeism</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline absenteeism at 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be asked to respond to questions on the Gaudine and Gregory questionnaire on unsanctioned absence. Self-reported absenteeism will be calculated by adding the number of days reported for all the three questions.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Presenteeism</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline presenteeism at 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Presenteeism will be measured using Work Limitations Questionnaire (WLQ). The WLQ requires employees to self-report their level of difficulty (or ability) to perform 25 specific job demands in the last 2 weeks. Answers generated for the 25 items will be grouped into four work limitation scales including Time Management; Physical Demands; Mental/Interpersonal and Output Demands. The scores for each subscale range from 0-100%, with 0 equivalent to no limitation and 100 equivalent to complete limitation.</description>

    <time_frame>Eight weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be prompted at random four times between 9am to 5pm from Monday to Friday to complete a short questionnaire which will only take them 60 seconds to complete whilst in sitting position, standing and /or in walking position to enter their level of productivity.</description>
