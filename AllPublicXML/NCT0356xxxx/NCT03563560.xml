      This study consists of 2 cohorts of the ACM regimen part for Japanese relapsed/refractory AML
      patients and 1 cohort of the A+7+3 regimen part for Japanese newly diagnosed AML patients.
      The purpose of this study are as below.

        1. To evaluate the safety of DSP-2033 (Alvocidib) in combination with
           cytarabine/mitoxantrone (ACM regimen) in Japanese patients with relapsed or refractory
           AML and to confirm its tolerability.

        2. To evaluate the safety of DSP-2033 （Alvocidib) in combination with
           cytarabine/daunorubicin (A+7+3 regimen) in Japanese newly diagnosed AML patients and to
           confirm its tolerability.
