  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a two-part study which will evaluate the PK, safety, and tolerability of a single
      1500 milligram (mg) oral dose of gepotidacin in subjects with normal hepatic function and in
      subjects with mild, moderate, and severe hepatic impairment. In Part 1, subjects with
      moderate hepatic impairment and subjects with normal hepatic function will be enrolled.
      Matching subjects with normal hepatic function in Part 1 (Group D), will be enrolled
      following the completion of all Day 3 assessments of the respective matched, hepatically
      impaired subject. In Part 2, subjects with mild (optional) and severe hepatic impairment and
      subjects with normal hepatic function will be enrolled concurrently based on the PK, safety,
      and tolerability data of Part 1. Subjects with mild hepatic impairment, may be studied if
      there is a significant difference in PK between subjects with moderate hepatic impairment and
      subjects with normal hepatic function. Subjects with severe hepatic impairment, will be
      studied in Part 2, provided that, the PK objectives are achieved in Part 1. A totals of 48
      subjects, are planned to be enrolled in the study. The study duration is approximately of 44
      days from Screening to Follow-up visit. The results from this study will enable the
      development of appropriate dosing recommendations in subjects with impaired hepatic function.

             or upon admission to the clinic. For subjects with hepatic impairment, and a positive
             drug screen result related to the use of prescription medications, is allowed per
             investigator review and approval, and tetrahydrocannabinol use is allowed per
             investigator review and approval.

          -  History of sensitivity to heparin or heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (if the clinic
             uses heparin to maintain intravenous cannula patency).

          -  Subject has used medications known to affect the elimination of serum creatinine
             (example (e.g); trimethoprim or cimetidine) or competitors of renal tubular secretion
             (e.g., probenecid) within 30 days before dosing.

             interfere with the study. Any exceptions (including subjects with hepatic impairment
             that will be on medications during the study), will be discussed with the sponsor or
             medical monitor on a case-by-case basis and the reasons will be documented.

             Fridericia formula (QTcF) of &gt;450 milliseconds (msec) and subject with hepatic
             impairment has a baseline QTcF of &gt;480 msec.

          -  Donation of blood in excess of 500 milliliter (mL) within 12 weeks prior to dosing or
             participation in the study would result in donation of blood or blood products in
             excess of 500 mL within a 56-day period.

          -  Subject is unable to comply with all study procedures, in the opinion of the
             investigator.

          -  Subject should not participate in the study, in the opinion of the investigator or

             of inflammatory bowel disease should be excluded. Subjects with a history of
             pepticulceration or pancreatitis within the preceding 6 months of screening, should be

             conduct, completion, or results of this trial or constitutes an unacceptable risk to
             the subject. Subjects with a prior history of severe encephalopathy, who are currently
             treated for this condition will receive the appropriate score for encephalopathy.

             specifically calculate the Clcr. A Clcr value &lt;=50 mL/minute via 24-hour urine
             collection is also exclusionary.

             bacterial peritonitis).

          -  Subjects with transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt placement within the past
             3 months.

      <recruitment_details>This was a Phase I, non-randomized, open-label, parallel-group, multi-center, two-part study that evaluated the pharmacokinetics, safety, and tolerability of a single 1500 milligrams (mg) oral dose of gepotidacin in participants with normal hepatic function and in participants with mild, moderate, and severe hepatic impairment.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Twenty five participants were enrolled in the study. In part 1, normal hepatic function participants were matched to moderate hepatic impaired participants.

        <description>Urine samples were collected from participants at indicated time points. Ae_total was calculated by adding all the fractions of drug collected over all the allotted time intervals. Ae (t1-t2) was the amount of drug excreted in urine in time intervals for predose, 0 to 6, 6 to 12, 12 to 24, 24 to 36, and 36 to 48 hours after dosing for participants with hepatic impairment; and predose, 0 to 2 hours, 2 to 4 hours, 4 to 6 hours, 6 to 8 hours, 8 to 12 hours, 12 to 24 hours, 24 to 36 hours, and 36 to 48 hours for participants with normal hepatic function. It was calculated by multiplication of the urine concentration for a time interval and the length of this time interval.</description>
