      PROMPT: a study of photopheresis for the treatment of erythrodermic mycosis fungoides and
      Sézary syndrome

      For this study, the investigators invite patients suffering from erythrodermic mycosis
      fungoides (MF) and Sézary syndrome (SS) whose skin symptoms have not responded to other types
      of treatment prescribed by their doctors (symptoms came back or got worse) as well as
      patients that never received any treatment.

      Patients will be treated with photopheresis every two weeks for the first three months,
      thereafter once monthly. One treatment cycle consists of 2 day treatment in a row. After 6
      months of treatment, treatment can be given every 5 to 8 weeks.

      During the photopheresis procedure, the patient's blood is collected into a specialized
      machine (THERAKOS CELLEX) that separates the white blood cells from the other blood
      components. The other blood components are returned to the patient and white blood cells are
      then treated with the drug methoxsalen, which makes them sensitive to ultraviolet light. The
      treated white blood cells are exposed to ultraviolet A (UVA) irradiation inside the machine,
      and then returned to the patient.

      As photopheresis has been used worldwide for more than 30 years, each hospital has developed
      their own guidelines (e.g. which patients, frequency, etc). Recently, experts in the field
      have developed a guidance which will now be tested in this study.
