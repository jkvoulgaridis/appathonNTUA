  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the recent excipient modification of
      Levothyrox® in France for a bioequivalent formula has clinical and biological consequence for
      the patients. The investigators also plan to describe the patient journey in terms of
      levothyroxine based drugs since this formula modification of Levothyrox®.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Levothyrox® is a levothyroxine based drug marketed in France in order to substitute a lack of
      thyroid hormones. Because of a lack of stability during time and because of wide inter-batch
      variability in terms of active molecule, the National Agency of Safety of Medicaments (ANSM)
      ask to the market authorization holder to develop a new formula without lactose. This new
      formula, which has been proven to be bioequivalent has been marketed since march 2017 in
      France. Some patients were predicted to have their thyroid function imbalance because of this
      modification. The purpose of the study is to analyse, on the patients treated by
      Levothyroxine® in how many patients this modification has clinical and biological
      consequences.
