  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis (RVVC), also known as recurrent yeast infections, is
      defined as at least 3 episodes of acute VVC in the past 12 months. Several properties of
      VT-1161 suggest that it might be a safer and more effective treatment for RVVC than other
      oral antifungal medicines.

      This study will evaluate the effectiveness and safety of VT-1161 for the treatment of RVVC
      and consists of 2 parts. The first part of the study is a 2-week period for the treatment of
      the patient's current VVC episode with 3 150mg doses of fluconazole. The 2nd part consists of
      12 weeks, when the patient will take either VT-1161 150 mg or a placebo (according to a
      random assignment), and then a 36-week follow-up period.

      In addition, at participating sites, an amendment to the study allows US patients who
      complete the initial 48 weeks without experiencing a confirmed RVVC episode to continue in a
      48-week observational extension period designed to evaluate the continued effectiveness of
      VT-1161.

      This study is identical to VMT-VT-1161-CL-011.

    <description>The primary efficacy outcome measure is the proportion of subjects with one or more culture-verified acute VVC episodes during the maintenance phase (post-randomization through Week 48) in the intent-to-treat population. An acute VVC episode during the maintenance phase (considered a recurrent episode) is defined as a positive culture for Candida species and a clinical signs and symptoms score of ≥3.</description>
