      Description of the research question

      In children undergoing unilateral alveolar cleft reconstruction, would stem cells carried on
      collagen scaffold provide bone of a good quality and quantity if compared to autogenous bone
      grafting?

      Objective of the study:

      â€¢ Research hypothesis

      The tissue engineered constructs will provide sufficient bone of a good quality and quantity
      if compared to autogenous bone graft in children undergoing unilateral alveolar cleft
      reconstruction.

        -  The objectives

      The primary objective:

      Assessment of bone volume (quantity) which will be provided by tissue engineered constructs
      compared to that provided by autogenous bone for maxillary alveolar cleft reconstruction.

      The secondary objective:

      Assessment of bone density (quality) which will be provided by tissue engineered constructs
      compared to that provided by autogenous bone for maxillary alveolar cleft reconstruction.
