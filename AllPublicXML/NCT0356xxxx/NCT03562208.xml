  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes, recently declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization, is a risk factor for
      increased mortality and morbidity. Its multi-functional complications, in the short and long
      term, are a serious problems for the global public health. Millions of patients, the world
      over, suffer Diabetes, a chronic and degenerative disease without treatments today. America,
      and particularly the Caribbean and Central America Region, is seriously affected despite the
      efforts of the Public Health Systems. Caribbean Region presented nearly twice the incidence
      and prevalence of type 1 and type 2 diabetes when compared with the rest of the Americas.
      Today stem cells are emerging as a valid alternative of treatment. In vitro experiments with
      adult stem cells demonstrated their ability to migrate and differentiate into cells of
      different lineages. The bone marrow stem cells are safe, effective and have a lot of
      scientific evidence that supports the carrying out of clinical research in phases II and III.
      Our protocol is an Autologous Bone Marrow Stem Cell Transplantation, without immune
      suppression or cell cultures. Our hypothesis is that the stem cells will act as immune
      modulators, angiogenic and in a regenerative way stimulating quiescent stem cells and
      improving the metabolic control by endogenous secretion of insulin.

      Our clinical trial, authorized and controlled by the Government of Bahamas, offer safety data
      and effectiveness that encourage continued research. We will divide the patients into a
      treatment group and into a control group. We will control insulin daly dose, c peptide, A1C
      glycated hemoglobin and specific antibodies. Follow up two years.
