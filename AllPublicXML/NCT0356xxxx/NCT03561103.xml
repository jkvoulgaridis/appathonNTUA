  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Client-Centered Representative Payee is a structural intervention that provides financial
      management support to PLWHA by modifying the implementation of a long-standing policy within
      the Social Security Administration, in which an organization is authorized to serve as the
      client's payee. The central hypothesis of this study is that by helping clients to pay rent
      and other bills on time, housing stability will improve and financial stress will decrease.
      By reducing the cognitive burden of living with chronic financial stress and frequent threats
      of housing loss, clients can devote more time and attention to medical appointments and
      medication adherence. It is further hypothesized that these changes will improve clients'
      self-efficacy for health behaviors, retention in care, medication adherence, and viral loads.
      These hypotheses will be tested via the following specific aims: (1) Conduct a randomized
      controlled trial with two randomized arms (n=160) and two non-randomized arms (n=50) to test
      the effect of Client-Centered Rep Payee on ART adherence and viral load among PLWHA who are
      economically disadvantaged and unstably housed. Clinical adherence will be compared through
      behavioral and biological measures including prescription refill data, self-reported
      appointment adherence, and viral load for patients receiving the intervention versus those
      receiving standard of care. (2) Test underlying mechanisms associated with Client-Centered
      Rep Payee that contribute to changes in medication adherence and viral suppression rates.
      This will be accomplished via use of quantitative (mediation analysis) and qualitative
      (semi-structured interview) methods to test hypothesized mediators of medication adherence
      and viral suppression including financial and housing instability, financial stress,
      self-efficacy for health behaviors, and retention in care. (3) Assess the cost and
      cost-effectiveness of the Client-Centered Rep Payee model. An economic analysis will be
      conducted to model the impact of the intervention as compared with standard of care on
      quality adjusted life years as well as new infections averted. This approach is innovative
      because it offers a structural intervention to improve adherence by addressing the effects of
      economic insecurity, requires low financial investment, and can be layered with existing
      clinical services. Further, it is highly scalable as it builds on a current policy in
      practice within the Social Security system.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Marginalized populations, including those who are unstably housed and have mental health or
      substance use disorders, demonstrate alarming rates of disparities in the incidence of new
      HIV infections and treatment outcomes. These populations have HIV viral suppression rates as
      low as 13% and mortality 3 to 5 times higher than people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) who
      have stable housing. Economic disadvantage can contribute to poor medication adherence and
      clinical outcomes through limited social resources, repeated cycles of housing instability,
      high levels of stress caused by financial insecurity, and lack of resources to cope with
      these demands. While the remediation of poverty on a broad scale is not on the near horizon,
      addressing factors that result from economic disadvantage and limit adherence is feasible and
      achievable. The investigators aim to understand whether providing financial management to
      marginalized PLWHA can improve their financial and housing stability, and in turn,
      antiretroviral therapy treatment adherence and rates of viral suppression.

      Representative payee is a structural intervention that provides financial management to
      marginalized individuals, which has already shown promise in helping marginalized populations
      achieve undetectable viral loads. Structural interventions aim to alter social, political, or
      economic contexts in order to improve health outcomes rather than focusing on proximal health
      behaviors (14). &quot;rep payee&quot; is a Social Security Administration (SSA) policy whereby an
      organization is appointed to serve as a money manager for vulnerable individuals who receive
      SSA benefits. The client and their physician complete a request for determination of a
      representative payee, and once authorized bu SSA, the rep payee establishes a checking
      account for the client into which SSA entitlements are directly deposited. The client does
      not have direct access to the account. The rep payee pays the client's bills, which improves
      regular payment of rent and utilities, and then disburses expendable funds to the client.

      In a pilot study examining associations between our &quot;Client-Centered rep payee&quot; services and
      viral load, it was found that only 7 of 18 participants had suppressed viral loads (SVL) at
      baseline, but 16 of the 18 had SVL at six-month follow-up (p = .004, McNemar's) (15). In a
      more recent analysis, investigators determined that of 40 participants who received Client
      Centered rep payee, 82% had suppressed viral loads at both 6- and 12-months follow up. The
      Open Door, Inc. (TOD), the organization that developed this intervention, has provided these
      services to 76 PLWHA over the past nine years. Though clients can terminate the rep payee
      arrangement at any time, 90% of clients has kept TOD as their rep payee indefinitely,
      demonstrating both the feasibility and acceptability of this approach. The hypothesis is that
      by helping clients to pay their rent and other bills on time, housing stability improves and
      financial stress decreases. By reducing the cognitive burden of living with chronic financial
      stress and frequent threats of housing loss, clients can devote more time and attention to
      medical appointments and medication adherence. Ultimately, it is believed that this program
      improves clients' self-efficacy for health behaviors, retention in care, medication
      adherence, CD4 counts, and viral loads. These these hypotheses will be tested via the
      following aims in a randomized controlled trial of 320 PLWHA.

      Aim 1. Conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT, n=160) with two additional non-randomized
      arms (n=50) to test the effect of Client-Centered Rep Payee on anti-retroviral (ART)
      medication adherence and viral load among PLWHA who are economically disadvantaged and
      unstably housed. Compare clinical adherence will be assessed through behavioral and
      biological measures including, self-reported appointment adherence, and viral load for
      patients receiving the intervention versus those receiving standard of care.

      Aim 2. Test underlying mechanisms associated with Client-Centered Rep Payee that contribute
      to changes in medication adherence and viral suppression rates. Quantitative (mediation
      analysis) and qualitative (semi-structured interview) methods will be used to test
      hypothesized mediators of medication adherence and viral suppression including financial and
      housing instability, financial stress, self-efficacy for health behaviors, and retention in
      care.

      Aim 3. Assess the cost and cost-effectiveness of the Client-Centered Rep Payee model. The
      investigators will conduct an economic analysis to model the impact of the intervention as
      compared with standard of care on quality adjusted life years as well as new infections
      averted.

      Client-Centered Rep Payee offers a structural intervention to improve adherence by addressing
      economic insecurity. This approach requires low financial investment and can be layered with
      existing clinical services. Further, it is highly scalable as it builds on a current policy
      in practice within the Social Security system. It is projected that by demonstrating the
      impact and cost-effectiveness of Client-Centered Rep Payee an innovative approach to
      improving viral suppression rates and reducing health disparities among marginalized PLWHA
      may be documented.

    <description>CCRP is a structural intervention wherein Social Security authorizes a representative payee to serve as financial manager for people who need help managing their money. By helping clients to consistently pay their bills including rents and utilities, CCRP may redirect the expenditure of participants' resources toward improved health behaviors. Shifting the focus of material and biopsychosocial resources may change the context in which health behaviors are produced, contributing to higher rates of adherence and viral suppression. CCRP modifies the implementation of a current policy of the Social Security Administration (SSA) to create an intervention that is highly replicable.</description>
