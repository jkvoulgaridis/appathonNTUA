  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Interstitial lung disease (ILD) is a diverse group of parenchymal lung disorders
      characterized by restrictive lung function and impaired alveolar diffusion capacity, leading
      to dyspnea on exertion, reduced exercise endurance, and poor quality of life. Patients
      usually complain of progressive breathlessness, persisting non-productive cough, which occurs
      with exercise. Hemoptysis, fever, chest pain are also seen. The most common comorbidity in
      chronic lung diseases is the progressive loss of exercise tolerance. Not only dyspnea, but
      also peripheral muscle dysfunction and cognitive deficits such as, anxiety and depression are
      responsible for the reduction of mobility in the patient. In the context of pulmonary
      rehabilitation (PR) program to be applied in interstitial lung diseases; upper and lower limb
      endurance, stretching and relaxation techniques, aerobic exercise training, respiratory
      muscle training, training of energy conservation methods, support by determining oxygen
      requirement, nutritional evaluation, prevention of weight and muscle loss, psycho-social
      support. The purpose of PR programs in this disease is; to improve muscle strength,
      endurance, and mechanical activity, to improve dyspnea sensation, to improve functional
      capacity, to inform and educate the patient about the patient's disease. The use of whole
      body vibration (TVT) is an increasingly common method of therapeutic use in order to improve
      neuromuscular performance. TVT applications have shown that increases muscle activity, muscle
      strength and muscle strength, improves lower extremity blood circulation and balance, and
      increases growth hormone production. TVT training effects have rarely been studied in
      patients with pulmonary disease. Muscle strength and performance enhancement were significant
      effects of TVT, which was emphasized as a promising exercise method for those with chronic
      obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Over the past decade, endurance and strength training
      has been established as the most important components of exercise training programs in
      patients with COPD and ILD. Therefore, inclusion of TVT into exercise training programs in
      ILD patients may lead to beneficial results.

      The investigators hypotheses are:

        1. the combination of home respiratory exercises with whole body vibration training may
           lead to more improved respiratory muscle strength, dyspnoea, functional capacity,
           balance, peripheral muscle strength and quality of life in ILD patients

        2. when applied as an isolated intervention, home respiratory exercises programme may lead
           to lower results than combination programs.

      Patients:

      All participants with ILD will be recruited from a Cerrahpasa Medical Faculty Hospital
      between January 2017 and June 2018. All treatments will performed in the same hospital.

      Sample Size:

      &quot;Power and Sample Size Program&quot; was used to calculate sample size. Power analysis was done
      with Pass 11 Home program. In the power analysis program, α = 0,05, β = 0,15 1- β = 0,84.
      When the number of samples of the groups was 30 and 30, 84% power was obtained. Using a
      two-sided two-sample t-test, the standard deviations from the 0,05 alpha value are 7.0 and
      6.0.

      Procedure:

      A list of individuals diagnosed with interstitial lung disease who are following the
      outpatient clinic of the Department of Chest Diseases of the Istanbul University Cerrahpaşa
      Medical Faculty and who meet the inclusion criteria for the study will be created. The
      created patient list will be enumerated. Two groups will be formed from the numbered persons
      by the random number table method (n = 60). Groups will receive 30 participants in the
      treatment group, whose protocol numbers end in an even number, and 30 members in the control
      group, who finished with an odd number of protocol numbers. Up to 10% of the sample size will
      be selected as a substitute, taking into account the non-participation of the selected
      individuals in the study.

      Assessments at baseline and after training will be performed by pulmonary physiotherapist.
      All the participants will be treated in the Cerrahpaşa Medical Faculty hospital by a
      physiotherapist who is experienced in pulmonary rehabilitation.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Pulmonary Function Test</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The pulmonary function test (PFT) will be performed with a portable spirometry device (Spirobank II) with the nose closed and at least three times in the sitting position. After the nose is tightened with a latch, the person breathes normally on the spirometer. After a few normal inspirations and expirations, it is desirable to take a deep breath at the end of the expiration at the level of rest, and to release the air slowly and continuously afterwards. With this application, the volumes and capacities outside the residual volume (RV), functional residual capacity (FRC) and total lung capacity (TLC) are calculated.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO)</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The single breath carbon monoxide diffusion test method will be used to calculate the diffusion capacity. Carbonmonoxide Diffusion (DLCO) measurement is an important noninvasive test that provides information on pulmonary gas exchange. The CO concentrations are measured by passing the analyzer through a breathing air analyzer of the patient, which is then exhaled into the device; the amount of CO transferred to the blood is calculated from the difference between the inspired air and the CO concentrations in the expired air.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Respiratory muscle strength</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Respiratory muscle strength will be measured using a portable electronic mouth measuring instrument (MicroRPM; Micro Medical, UK). Maximum inspiratory (MIP) and expiratory (MEP) pressures are noninvasive tests that indirectly indicate respiratory muscle strength. It is the intraoral pressure measured during maximal inspiration and maximal respiration against a valve (shutter) that closes the respiratory tract during expiration. The best of three measurements is accepted.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>6-minute walk test (6MWT)</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Functional exercise capacity was assessed using the 6-minute walk test (6MWT). Patients will be walked in a 30-meter-long corridor for 6 minutes and the maximum walking distance will be measured. Before and after the test, heart rate, blood pressure and pulse oximeter will measure O2 saturation, and according to Borg scale, dyspnea and fatigue level will be determined. Oxygen will be provided immediately following exercise for patients who desaturate (SpO2 &lt;88%), or as needed.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>6-minute pegboard and ring test (6PBRT)</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects are asked to sit straight in a chair and a pegboard with multiple peg positions is placed in front of the subject at arm's length from the body. Two pegs are positioned at the shoulder level and 2 at 20 cm above the shoulder level, and 10 rings (1/2 oz per ring) are put on each of the 2 lower pegs. The final score is the total number of rings moved during the 6-minute period. Subjects are permitted to stop and rest during the test if they feel severe dyspnea, fatigue, or other discomfort, and continue moving the pegs as soon as they can. Subjects are asked to score the perceived dyspnea and fatigue after the test by the Borg scale. Each subject performe the PBRT twice. A pulse oximeter is used to monitor heart rate (HR) and arterial oxygen saturation (Sao2), and measure blood pressure (BP) before and after each test.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Timed Up and Go Test (TUG)</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>TUG is a reliable and simple test to assess balance and functional mobility of stroke patients. The patient sited in chair and with command of physiotherapist raised from the chair, walked 3 meters, walked back to the chair and sited down again. The time of process was recorded by the physiotherapist in seconds. It was allowed to use walking aid during the test. Lower duration indicates better mobility performance.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Sit to Stand Test (STS)</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>It is a test based on crossing the patient's hands at the chest and making the most repetition possible by sitting and lifting continuously for 30 seconds. The number of sit down and stand up is recorded by the physiotherapist.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Static Posturography System (TETRAX)</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Static posturography formed with four separate plates and each force plate measures the perpendicular pressure of the anterior and posterior feet. Subjects took off their shoes, positioned their feet on the plates, and stood in a comfortable position. Eight different postures were evaluated for the test and each posture was measured for 32 seconds. For the postural variable factors, the stability index (ST), Fourier index, weight distribution index (WDI), and the synchronization index (SI) are measured.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Peripheral Muscle Strength Measurement</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Quadriceps femoris and biceps brachii isometric muscle strength will be measured by portable hand dynamometer (JTECH, Medical Commander Powertrack II, USA). Isometric muscle strength of Quadriceps femoris and biceps brachii is measured by portable hand dynamometer. Quadriceps femoris muscle force is measured in sitting position, at knee extension, and biceps brachii muscle strength at backrest position, while elbow is flexed. The measurements are repeated three times in succession and the average is recorded.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Fatigue Severity Scale is a self-administered questionnaire with 9 items (questions) investigating the severity of fatigue in different situations during the past week. Respondents answer using a Likert scale ranging from 1 to 7. ''1'' indicates strong disagreement with the statement, while ''7'' indicates strong agreement. Total score is calculated by deriving an arithmetic mean. FSS scores range from 0-63. A score of 36 or higher generally indicates severe fatigue.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The SGRQ is a standardized self-administered airways disease-specific questionnaire. It contains 50 items (covering 76 levels) divided into three subscales: ''Symptoms'' (8 items), including several respiratory symptoms, their frequency and severity; ''Activity'' (16 items), concerned with activities that cause or are limited by breathlessness; and ''Impacts'' (26 items), which covers a range of aspects concerned with social functioning and psychological disturbances resulting from airways disease. SGRQ scores range from 0-100, zero score indicating no impairment of life quality. Answers to SGRQ items are weighted and total SGRQ score and scores on the three subscales (Symptom frequency, Impact, and Activity) are calculated by adding these weights. Scores are then converted to percentages by dividing the weighted score obtained by the total possible weighted score. The higher the score the poorer the quality of life.</description>
