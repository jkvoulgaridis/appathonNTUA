    <textblock>
      A behavioral intervention called Achieving Wellness After Kancer in Early Life (AWAKE)
      focused on increasing hope in order to improve quality of life and health-promoting behaviors
      in survivors of young adult cancer. The goals of this project are to adapt the AWAKE platform
      into an intervention acceptable for use in adolescent cancer survivors and their guardians in
      order to improve survivors' hope, quality of life, and health-promoting behaviors, and to
      generate the preliminary data needed for a randomized control trial to test the efficacy of
      the AWAKE platform in this population.

      A behavioral intervention called Achieving Wellness After Kancer in Early Life (AWAKE)
      focused on increasing hope in order to improve quality of life and health-promoting behaviors
      in survivors of young adult cancer. Adaptation of this intervention to incorporate messaging
      for adolescents and their guardians has the potential to have a long-term impact on
      adolescent cancer survivors. The goals of this project are to adapt the AWAKE platform into
      an intervention acceptable for use in adolescent cancer survivors and their guardians in
      order to improve survivors' hope, quality of life, and health-promoting behaviors, and to
      generate the preliminary data needed for a randomized control trial to test the efficacy of
      the AWAKE platform in this population.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the he Children's Hope Scale score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 2 and 4 months follow up visits</time_frame>
    <description>A 6-item self-report questionnaire assessing children's dispositional hope. Two components, agency (ability to initiate and sustain action towards goals) and pathways (capacity to find a means to carry out goals), are assessed by the measure. Responses are on a 6-point Likert-scale ranging from 1=none of the time to 6=all of the time with higher scores representing increased dispositional hope.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL), 4.0 scale score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 2 and 4 months follow up visits</time_frame>
    <description>The PedsQL 4.0 scale has 23-items that are grouped into four domains: 1)Physical Functioning (eight items), 2) Emotional Functioning (five items), 3) Social Functioning (five items) and 4) School Functioning (five items). 5-point response scale is utilized across child self-report and parent proxy-report (0 never a problem; 1 almost never a problem; 2 sometimes a problem; 3 often a problem; 4 almost always a problem). Subjects are requested to rate how much problems they experienced during the past month. All items are reverse-scored and linearly transformed to a 0 100 scale (0 100, 1 75, 2 50, 3 25, 4 0), so that higher scores indicate better Health-related quality of life (HRQoL).</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, 2 and 4 months follow up visits</time_frame>
    <description>Change in number of servings of fruits and vegetables will be assessed using 9 dietary habits questions from Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS) survey</description>

    <measure>Change in PROMIS score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 2 and 4 months follow up visits</time_frame>
    <description>The PROMIS Peer Relationships, Anxiety, and Depression scales have self-report and parent-proxy versions. Each scale is scored from 0-100 with higher scores indicating better peer relationships, worse anxiety and worse depression. Questions: 8 peer relationships, 8 anxiety, 8 depression</description>

    <measure>Usability of AWAKE</measure>
    <time_frame>2 month assessment</time_frame>
    <description>Responses to four usability questions will be based on a 5-point Likert scale (1=very useless/ineffective; 5=very useful/effective) with higher ratings indicating more favorable attitudes.</description>

    <description>Behavioral intervention called Achieving Wellness After Kancer in Early Life (AWAKE) is focused on increasing hope in order to improve quality of life and health-promoting behaviors in survivors of young adult cancer. The AWAKE mobile app contains eight modules for participants to complete over 8 weeks with the ability to review prior modules. Participants receive a prompt on their mobile device weekly to complete each module and/or they will receive a text reminder. The app includes health education messaging, weekly homework assignments, the ability to track progress towards goals with self-monitoring and graphical depictions of progress, videos of inspirational materials, and a portal for interacting with their coach.</description>
