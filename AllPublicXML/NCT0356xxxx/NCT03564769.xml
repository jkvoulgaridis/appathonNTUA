    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the impact of the AAD SPOTme® skin cancer screening events on attendees'
      skin cancer prevention and detection behaviors. This study will also evaluate whether an
      educational intervention will improve post-screening engagement of attendees with
      dermatologists.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite tremendous growth in both the interest and volume of skin cancer screenings at the
      national level, the actual utility and impact of the AAD SPOT me™ skin cancer screening
      programs have not been fully evaluated. This study will address this knowledge gap. Early
      detection is vital in the fight against skin cancer, the most common cancer in the United
      States. While the effects of skin cancer can be devastating, this disease is highly treatable
      when detected early.

      This study evaluates the impact of the AAD SPOTme® skin cancer screening events on attendees'
      skin cancer prevention and detection behaviors. This study will also evaluate whether an
      educational intervention will improve post-screening engagement of attendees with
      dermatologists.
