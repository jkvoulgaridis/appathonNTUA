  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Family Navigation (FN), an evidence-based care management strategy which is a promising
      intervention to help low income and minority families access timely mental health services.
      Despite significant evidence supporting the effectiveness of FN, concerns exist about the
      ability to disseminate FN to a broad population due to inefficiency and cost. The proposed
      study employs an innovative research methodology, the Multiphase Optimization STrategy
      (MOST), a framework for developing highly efficacious, efficient, scalable, and
      cost-effective interventions. The investigators will conduct a randomized experiment to
      assess the individual components of FN and identify which components and component levels
      have greatest effect on access to, and engagement in, diagnostic and treatment services for
      children with mental health disorders. This information then guides assembly of an optimized
      FN model that achieves the primary outcomes with least resource consumption and participant
      burden

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to determine the optimal delivery of a Family Navigation (FN) model
      that increases engagement in services to address children's behavioral health. While there is
      strong evidence that navigation decreases barriers to care for low income and minority
      families, little is known about which specific components contribute to its efficacy. The
      investigators propose to use MOST, a pioneering, engineering-inspired framework, to assess
      the performance of individual intervention components and their interactions.

      Delivery of FN will be systematically varied across four components, each of which is
      represented by a separate factor in the 2x2x2x2 factorial study design. Specifically, each
      family will be randomly assigned to one of two conditions within each of four factors or
      delivery strategies, defining sixteen separate experimental conditions. Strategies include:
      (A) technology-assisted delivery of care coordination using an innovative, web-based platform
      called Act.MD (compared to usual care); (B) clinic based FN + community-based (compared to
      clinic-based only); (C) enhanced symptom tracking using more frequent behavioral symptom
      tracking (compared to standard pediatric surveillance); and (d) individually-tailored visits
      (compared to a predetermined schedule of contacts). All children will be followed through the
      EHR for 12 months, for outcomes in services access and symptom tracking.

      The main effects will be estimated of the four experimental factors and their interactions on
      the study's primary outcome - family engagement in services to address their child's
      behavioral health. This information then guides assembly of an optimized FN model that
      achieves the primary outcomes with least resource consumption and participant burden.

      Children will be enrolled if they have a positive behavioral health screen OR parent concern.
      A &quot;watchful waiting&quot; group for families of children with more mild symptoms and/or who do not
      choose to access child behavioral services at the time of the index visit with the Family
      Partner (FP) will be included. These families will be followed and child symptoms tracked at
      3, 6, 9 and 12 months. If the watchful waiting children have an increase in symptom severity,
      and/or the family later desires services, they will have the opportunity to receive FN
      services and be randomized to a study condition.

    <description>The SWYC screens for cognitive, motor, language, and social-emotional development among children up to 5½ years of age. Behavioral symptoms will be tracked using the SWYC's Preschool Pediatric Symptom Checklist (PPSC), is an 18-item questionnaire with possible scores for each item of:&quot;0&quot; for each &quot;Not at All&quot; response, &quot;1&quot; for each &quot;Somewhat&quot; response, and &quot;2&quot; for each &quot;Very Much&quot; response. The total score is summed, can range from 0 to 36, and A PPSC total score of 9 or greater indicates that a child is &quot;at risk&quot; and needs further evaluation</description>

    <measure>Change in Pediatric Symptom Checklist-17 (PSC-17)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Scores from the Pediatric Symptom Checklist-17 (PSC-17) will be used to assess child symptoms. The PSC-17 is a 17-item psychosocial screen designed to recognize cognitive, emotional, and behavioral problems. A value of 0 is assigned to &quot;Never&quot;, 1 to &quot;Sometimes,&quot; and 2 to &quot;Often&quot;. The total score is calculated by adding together the score for each of the 17 items, with a potential range of total scores of 0 to 34.. A PSC-17 score of 15 or higher suggests the presence of significant behavioral or emotional problems.. PSC-17 is embedded in the Epic (electronic health record) as a self-scoring form.</description>
