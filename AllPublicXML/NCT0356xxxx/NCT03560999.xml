  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are studying the ability of a novel rapid magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
      protocol to provide more accurate and earlier information about whether an infant with
      brachial plexus birth palsy will require nerve surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Brachial plexus birth palsy (BPBP) affects approximately 1 in 1,000 newborns, and though the
      majority of infants regain full function of the affected arm without nerve surgery, those
      with more severe nerve root injuries will require it. Currently, the best way to determine
      who will need surgery is to measure the trajectory of muscle recovery by serial clinical
      exams, but the optimal time for nerve surgery (before 3 months of age) is earlier than the
      time it usually takes to determine whether the infant needs surgery (up to 6 months.) A
      non-invasive diagnostic test that identifies the more severe injuries that require surgery
      earlier than serial exams would improve treatment timing, planning, and accuracy, and
      ultimately outcomes.

      The investigators have developed a rapid MRI sequence with high spatial resolution and soft
      tissue contrast that does not require sedation or injection of a contrast agent, and that
      appeared to accurately assess the severity of nerve injury in infants with BPBP in a pilot
      study. This pilot study demonstrated that the protocol distinguishes infants who ultimately
      needed surgery from those who recovered spontaneously. The purpose of the current study is to
      enroll 100 infants at 3 centers (Shriners Hospital for Children Northern California, Boston
      Children's Hospital, and Gillette Children's Hospital) over a 5 year period to validate this
      imaging protocol as the new &quot;gold standard&quot; to determine whether infants with BPBP need
      surgery, so that individuals who need it could have surgery earlier when it is more
      effective, and the parents of the majority who will recover spontaneously could be spared
      months of worry.

    <time_frame>by 6 months of age</time_frame>
    <description>The primary endpoint is the surgeon's decision for or against surgery, typically made by 6 months of age. Surgeons will make their decision based on all available clinical data, including the MRI, but will be blinded to the neuroradiologist's scoring of the SRS and its components.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Intraoperative Findings</measure>
    <time_frame>At time of surgery. Surgery occurs solely due to clinical reasons, so surgery timing (if it occurs at all) varies based on the clinical needs of the patient.</time_frame>
    <description>The secondary outcome will be the surgeon's intraoperative findings during brachial plexus reconstructive microsurgery. Specifically, agreement between MRI and intraoperative findings, with respect to the level(s) and extent of injury of each nerve root and the location of root injury (pre- vs. post-ganglionic) will be determined.</description>

    <measure>AMS Scores (Hospital for Sick Children Active Movement Scale)</measure>

    <description>Active Movement Scale (AMS) measures the strength of 15 different muscles based on a scale of 0-7; 0 is no motion, and 7 is full motion against gravity.</description>

    <description>The Toronto score also measures the strength of 15 different muscles based on a scale of 0-7; 0 is no motion, and 7 is full motion against gravity The Toronto score is a shorthand designation of the key AMS muscle strengths, in which these muscle strengths are combined (summed).</description>

        This is a multicenter prospective cohort study of patients with BPBP. The study takes place
        at Shriners Hospitals for Children - Northern California, Boston Children's Hospital, and
        Gillette Children's Specialty Healthcare. All infants with BPBP between 0 and 12 weeks of
        age who present for treatment to a participating site will be offered participation in this
        study. Those infants with concomitant birth injuries that would make positioning in the MRI
        scanner difficult or painful (such as a birth humerus or clavicle fracture) will have their
        enrollment deferred. If the injury heals and the MRI can be performed within the required
        age range, they may be included in the study. If not, they will be excluded. Those infants
        who attempt to complete or actually complete the MRI scan but end up with unusable images
        will continue to be followed clinically, but will be removed from participation in this
        study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of brachial plexus birth palsy.

          -  Age at consent â‰¤4 months

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Bilateral brachial plexus birth palsy.

          -  Age at MRI &lt;28 days or &gt;4 months old (patients can be enrolled prior to 28 days of
             age, but the imaging must occur in the 28 days to 4 months' time period). The lead PI
             will need to approve the enrollment of a subject who will have the MRI after 90 days
             of age.

          -  Concomitant medical conditions that would preclude performance of or confound
             interpretation of MRI or any clinical assessment.
