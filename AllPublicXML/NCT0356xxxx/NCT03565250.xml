  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Context: Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), a major public health issue, is a
      neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by disturbance of attention, pathological
      impulsivity and a variable level of psychomotor hyperactivity. In addition to medium-term
      repercussions such as school failure or family dysfunction, these children have difficulties
      in dealing with emotions, metacognition and self-awareness that have serious consequences for
      self-regulation and identity construction.

      Objective: To investigate identity building in children with ADHD and explore its links with
      the severity of the disorder and associated neuropsychological disturbances.

      Material and method: 20 childrens with ADHD and 20 controls will be recruited over a 24-month
      period. They will be administered the Damon and Hart's Self-Understanding Interview,
      exploring 7 identity domains: Physical, Active, Social, Psychological, Continuity,
      Agentivity, Distinction Self/Other. The severity of ADHD, neuropsychological functioning
      (attention, working memory, executive functions, long-term memory), self-esteem and
      internal/external attributive style (locus of control) will be assessed by validated scales.
      The overall level of identity development and in each dimension will be compared between
      patients and controls. Within patients, the correlations between level of identity
      development and the severity of ADHD will be explored, as well as with neuropsychological
      functioning, with statistical control of age.

      Assumptions: The investigators hypothesize that children with ADHD will exhibit a
      significantly lower level of identity development than controls, which will be positively
      correlated with neuropsychological functioning, and negatively correlated with the severity
      of ADHD.

      Visit 1: the physician will check inclusion and non-inclusion criteria and co-morbidities of
      patients and controls using a semi-structured interview (K-SADS-PL). He/She will also assess
      the overall functioning level of patients and controls (GAF) and will evaluate for patients
      only the severity of ADHD using ADHD-RS.

      Visits number 2 and 3: Cognitive and neuropsychological evaluations:

      2 consultations to be distributed in one month depending on the availability of patients (no
      time limit imposed between the 2 consultations) In order to investigate any cognitive
      dysfunctions, patients and controls will be referred to the neuropsychologists of the
      department concerned (pediatrics or child and adolescent psychiatry). They will perform the
      WISC-V, CPT, Wisconsin SCD, CMS Stories Test. Several questionnaires will be completed by
      parents and/or children : BRIEF, Self-esteem Questionnaire, Causal Style Questionnaire. This
      whole assessment will require a total of 2 consultations, one of 1:30 and the second of about
      1 hour. Patients on methylphenidate medication should be discontinued the same day during the
      second session of the neuropsychological check-up.

      Visit number 4: Self-Understanding Interview: 1 hour consultation The interview specifically
      assessing self-understanding will be conducted with children suffering from ADHD and control
      children. This investigation consists of an interview requiring 1h consultation for which
      patients should have taken their usual treatment by MPH if necessary. An audio recording of
      this test will be made.

      Inclusion and the first psychological assessment session (visit 1 and visit 2) can be done on
      the same day. All 3 appointments must be completed in a period of less than 3 months after
      inclusion.

    <description>Self understanding interview (Damon ahd Hart): analysis and developmental characterization of the child's discourse on himself,
Model distinguishes the two components of Self:
the me-self: aggregation of self-knowledge;
The I self: the Self-as-subject; the subjective component that performs the act of self-knowledge.
to attest to identity development:
The average level of identity development for me-self as a whole is calculated by summing the total number of segments in each developmental level multiplied by his cardinal, all divided by the total number of segments
Breakdown of segments of speech in the 4 modal levels (superficial, self-centered, interactive, codified) for each of the identity dimensions of the component of me-self (Physics, Active, Social, Psychological, Continuity, Agentivity, Distinction Self / Other) ,

    <description>The Child Perception Profile is the French adaptation (Pierrhumbert) of the Self-Perception Profile for Children (Harter).This self-questionnaire for children aged 8 to 13 explores self-esteem through 30 questions about daily life, coded on a scale from 1 to 4. First, the young person chooses the description that looks the most; he then determines how much he looks like him.
It provides an overall self-esteem score and six sub-scores: academic, social, physical, appearance, driving and self-worth.
Each dimension is explored by 5 questions, the sub-scores are obtained by adding the items, the overall self-esteem score is obtained by adding the sub-scores.
The higher the score, the higher the self-esteem</description>

    <description>The Child Causal Style Questionnaire is a self-administered questionnaire that assesses the child's &quot;locus of control&quot;, that is, how much does he attribute responsibility for his failures and successes to oneself (internal locus) or to others (external locus). It consists of 24 items describing plausible events, 12 positive and 12 negative, for which the child must choose a cause.</description>
