  <detailed_description>

      The cost-utility analysis (CUA) is an increasingly used method to help health decision-maker.
      The CUA uses the Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALY) that combines the length of life with the
      health related quality of life (HRQoL) into a single score.

      In Quebec, no QALY calculation tool has been adapted to its linguistic and socio-cultural
      context, neither for its general population nor for a particular subpopulation, like patients
      with cancer.

      The objectives will be to analyze the extent of the divergence in terms of health states
      utilities between the general population and patients with breast or colorectal cancer; to
      develop a QALY preference weights dataset for patients with cancer; to perform &quot;mapping&quot; with
      different health-related quality of life questionnaires by correlating SF6Dv2 with EQ-5D-5L,
      EORTC QLQ-C30 and FACT- G. The data will be collected with a self-administered online survey.
      Patients outcomes will be measured at the beginning of the chemotherapy treatment cycle and
      about 8 days after the start of chemotherapy. Health utilities will be measured with a hybrid
      method using the time-trade-off (TTO) and the discrete experimental choice (DCE) method using
      SF6Dv2 questionnaire for health states.

    <time_frame>Within two days before the start of a chemotherapy treatment cycle (standard treatment; each cycle is 21 days)</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D-5L included five health dimensions with five response levels of 1 to 5. A score is calculated using an already pre-established regression equation using time-trade-off method. The health utilities range from -0.148 for the worst EQ-5D-5L state to 0.949 for the best EQ-5D-5L state.</description>

    <description>The EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire were developed by the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC). Including 30items, evaluating five functions, nine symptoms, and the overall health status of patients with cancer. Scales will be calculated by averaging the items. Items and scales will be linearly transformed to a range of 0 to 100. A higher score indicate a better quality of life or higher symptoms.</description>

    <measure>Health related quality of life (HRQoL) scores from the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - General (FACT-G) questionnaires before chemotherapy</measure>
    <time_frame>Within two days before the start of a chemotherapy treatment cycle (standard treatment; each cycle is 21 days)</time_frame>
    <description>The survey assesses the impacts of cancer therapy in four domains: physical, social/family, emotional, and functional. It include 27 questions, each of which is answered using a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (Not at all) to 4 (Very much). Higher numbers indicate a better health state. The score will be calculated with the sum of items and score will be normalised on a scale from 0-100.</description>
