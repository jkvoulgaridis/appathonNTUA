  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      1. Design an educational quality improvement program to assess the most effective educational
      approach on caregiver seizure RM application. The investigators hypothesize that this
      educational program will improve caregiver comfort, knowledge of emergent seizure care, and
      time to medication application.

      Specifically, the aims include:

        1. Create an educational video reviewing RM administration

        2. Develop and validate a simulation training model/mannequin for rectal diazepam
           administration

        3. Expand training to other seizure RMs (e.g. intranasal midazolam, buccal lorazepam) and
           transition the most effective educational model back to the clinics/bedside to
           standardize caregiver teaching throughout the department/hospital
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will implement an intervention jointly with a simulation program to
      determine the most effective training model: verbal instructions, instructional video, or use
      of a mannequin. Caregivers will undergo a training curriculum, and 60 caregivers (20 assigned
      to each educational model) will be matched into three groups and assigned to participate in
      one of three educational models in the SIM Center. Pre-and post-training questionnaires will
      be distributed to assess provider knowledge and comfort level. Scoring of caregiver technique
      administering rectal diazepam to a mannequin and time to RM administration will be obtained
      to compare between the three educational arms of the study. Thirty additional patients (10
      per group) will not receive an assessment of caregiver technique administering RM to the
      mannequin prior to the educational intervention to control for exposure to the mannequin.
      Ultimately, the most effective educational method in this simulation pilot study will be
      expanded to other RM types (e.g. intranasal midazolam, buccal lorazepam), standardized, and
      brought back to the clinics/bedside throughout the hospital.

    <description>&quot;RM Score&quot; (&quot;Rescue Medication Score&quot;) assessing caregivers' ability to administer RM with proper technique before/after training. This score will determine if caregivers were able to independently give the medication or if they required a prompt at any step. There is no maximum score, but 1 point will be given for every required prompt such that 0 is a perfect score and higher scores reflect requiring more prompts to administer the medication.</description>
