  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Undifferentiated thyroid cancer is the most malignant tumor of the thyroid gland, with a
      median survival of only 3 months. Most undifferentiated cancers lose the chance of surgery
      when they are first diagnosed. The current study, Nexavar, is used only for dedifferentiated
      thyroid cancer and has not been applied to undifferentiated cancer. This study attempted to
      apply it to preoperative treatment of undifferentiated cancer to see if it would shrink the
      tumor and give the patient an opportunity for surgery.

      Undifferentiated thyroid cancer is the most malignant tumor of the thyroid gland, with a
      median survival of only 3 months. Most undifferentiated cancers lose the chance of surgery
      when they are first diagnosed. The current study, Nexavar, is used only for dedifferentiated
      thyroid cancer and has not been applied to undifferentiated cancer. This study attempted to
      apply it to preoperative treatment of undifferentiated cancer to see if it would shrink the
      tumor and give the patient an opportunity for surgery.

      We chose patients with recurrent or inoperable anaplastic thyroid cancer and used NEXAVAR for
      1 month of neoadjuvant therapy. If tumor lesions begin to resolve, they continue neoadjuvant
      therapy until the end of the second month. The total duration of preoperative treatment is
      two months.at the end of the second month, a CT scan was performed to assess whether surgery
      could be performed. If surgery is possible, NEXAVAR will continue to perform adjuvant
      radiotherapy after the surgery.
