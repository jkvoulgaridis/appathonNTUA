      Single center, Prospective, Open Label with Split-face Study Design. Face sides will be
      randomized to receive either 1064nm alone or 1064nm &amp; 585nm combination treatment.

      Each subject will receive up to 3 treatments at monthly intervals (±4 days). Follow-up visits
      will take place at 1, 3, and 6 months following the last treatment.
