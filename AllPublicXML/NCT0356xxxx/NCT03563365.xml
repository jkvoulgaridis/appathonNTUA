    <textblock>
      Acne vulgaris is a common skin problem which can be challenging to treat. Enhancing the
      efficacy and tolerability of treatment regimens can enhance compliance and outcomes thereby
      potentially decreasing the morbidities associated with acne vulgaris.

      The present study is designed to assess the ability of Power of 3 with resveratrol to improve
      efficacy and tolerability of an existing combination acne medication.
