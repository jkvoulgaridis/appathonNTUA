      The aims of the study are:

        -  To measure health literacy (HL) levels in a sample composed of members of a health
           mutual (Solidaris), and its potential associations with several determinants (health,
           health services consumption, health behaviours...)

        -  To identify potential groups at risk of a lower HL

        -  To identify the determinants of HL level

    <measure>Health Literacy</measure>
    <time_frame>At the inclusion in the study</time_frame>
    <description>The degree to which individuals can obtain, process and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. It also includes the cognitive and social skills which determine the motivation and ability of individuals to gain access to, understand and use information in ways which promote and maintain good health. It is measured by the Health Literacy Questionnaire (HLQ) (Osborne et al., 2013), composed of 44 items (9 dimensions).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>General health</measure>
    <time_frame>At the inclusion in the study</time_frame>
    <description>Measured with the EQ-5D-5L (EuroQol Group, 1990), divided into 2 parts. The first part is composed of 5 items investigating 5 dimensions (mobility, autonomy, daily activities, pain, and anxiety and depression).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>General health</measure>
    <time_frame>At the inclusion in the study</time_frame>
    <description>Measured with the EQ-5D-5L (EuroQol Group, 1990), divided into 2 parts: the second part is composed of 1 Visual Analogue Scale (VAS, from 0 to 100), investigating the perceived health.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Chronic illnesses</measure>
    <time_frame>At the inclusion in the study</time_frame>
    <description>Questions about the presence of chronic illness(es) are asked, along with their duration.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Body Mass Index</measure>
    <time_frame>At the inclusion in the study</time_frame>
    <description>Calculated with the standard formula (weight/height²)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Feeling of stigma associated with the chronic illness</measure>
    <time_frame>At the inclusion in the study</time_frame>
    <description>Measured with the Stigma Scale for Chronic Illnesses (Molina et al., 2013), which assesses enacted and internalised stigma. It is composed of 8 items. The responses for each item can be: 1 = Never, 2 = Rarely, 3 = Sometimes, 4 = Often, and 5 = Always. The raw summed score range is 8-40, with a higher score indicating a higher perceived stigma. Raw scores are then transformed into T-scores (a result of rescaling raw scores into standardized scores with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Satisfaction about health services</measure>
    <time_frame>At the inclusion in the study</time_frame>
    <description>Investigation of the participant's satisfaction about hospitals, dentists, specialised physician, general practitioners, home care and Solidaris, through 6 questions ranging from 1 (very unsatisfied) to 5 (very satisfied).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Consumption behaviors</measure>
    <time_frame>At the inclusion in the study</time_frame>
    <description>Tobacco, alcohol, fruits and vegetables consumption are investigated through 5 questions: do you smoke ? / If yes, what do you smoke? / How often do you drink alcohol? / How often do you eat fruits? / How often do you eat vegetables?</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Physical activity</measure>
    <time_frame>At the inclusion in the study</time_frame>
    <description>Investigated through 2 questions: during the last 7 days, how many days did you practice intense physical activity? / during the last 7 days, how many days did you practice moderate physical activity? For each question, answers range from 0 to 7.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Use of the Internet for health purposes</measure>
    <time_frame>At the inclusion in the study</time_frame>
    <description>Investigated through 1 question: &quot;how often do you use the Internet to search information about your health?&quot;. Answers range from 1 (never) to 5 (always).</description>
