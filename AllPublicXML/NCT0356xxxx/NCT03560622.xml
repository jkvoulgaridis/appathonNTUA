  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Focused ultrasound for Essential Tremor is an FDA approved treatment performed by
      neurosurgeons at the Ohio State Center for Neuromodulation that utilizes ultrasound
      technology to create a lesion in the thalamus of Essential Tremor patients. In order to
      improve long term effectiveness and reduce potential for side effects, brain imaging may be
      used to examine the functional connectivity of certain brain networks during the procedure.
      In order to investigate functional connectivity changes with these long term goals in mind,
      in this study neuroimaging will be taken immediately before, immediately after, and 24 hours
      after the focused ultrasound procedure for 10 Essential Tremor patients. One series of
      neuroimaging will also be conducted for 20 healthy control subjects to serve as a comparison.
      This study will not introduce any risks above standard of care, and may lead to improved long
      term outcomes of patients undergoing the Focused Ultrasound procedure.

      To calculate the connectivity correlates of tremor (CCT) by analyzing and comparing
      functional connectivity in the tremor network in ET patients and healthy controls. The fMRI
      data will be acquired in two separate conditions: t-fMRI and rs-fMRI. a. For t-fMRI, patients
      will perform simple repetitive tasks (e.g. finger tapping, hand grasping) to identify
      activation clusters within tremor network. Functional connectivity between the clusters will
      be calculated by creating cross-correlation matrices. A sensitivity analysis will then be
      performed to determine an optimal value of CCT to distinguish ET patients from controls. b.
      For rs-fMRI the hubs within tremor network will be identified with a state-of-the-art
      multimodality atlas. Cross-correlation matrices will be created to calculate measures of
      functional connectivity. A sensitivity analysis will then be performed to determine an
      optimal value of CCT to distinguish ET patients from controls. 2. To study changes in
      functional connectivity in the tremor network before, immediate postoperative and and
      24-hours after FUS-T in ET patients. a. The CCT will be calculated and compared between
      baseline, immediate postoperative and 24-hours post-operative conditions to determine the
      effect of FUS-T. For this sub-aim the connectivity data will be separately analyzed for
      t-fMRI and for rs-fMRI. b. The CCT in immediate postoperative and 24-hours post-operative
      condition among ET patients will be compared to healthy controls to determine whether FUS-T
      restored the abnormal connectivity in tremor network. For this sub-aim the connectivity data
      will be separately analyzed for t-fMRI and rs-fMRI.

The fMRI data will be acquired in two separate conditions: t-fMRI and rs-fMRI. Both t-fMRI and rs-MRI will be calculated based upon functional connectivity between the dentate nucleus, ventral intermediate nucleus, globus pallidus, motor and premotor cortex sensitivity analysis will then be performed to determine an optimal value of CCT to distinguish ET patients from controls.</description>
