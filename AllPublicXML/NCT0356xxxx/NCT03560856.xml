  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The clinical efficacy of fulvestrant and/or palbociclib in the population of patients with
      metastatic lesions harboring ESR1 mutations was reported. In the PALOMA 3 study, the
      combination of Fulvestrant+ Palbociclib seems to be active in patients whose tumour harbours
      ESR1 mutations. This study will confirm these data on this population and will allow us to
      identify if other gene alterations or a genomic signature can correlate with fulvestrant
      +palbociclib resistance.

                  significantly alter the absorption of palbociclib, such as history of GI surgery

             risk associated with study participation or palbociclib+fulvestrant administration or
             may interfere with the interpretation of study results and, in the judgment of the
             investigator, would make the patient inappropriate for entry into this study.

          7. Patients who are investigational site staff members directly involved in the conduct
             of the trial and their family members, site staff members otherwise supervised by the
