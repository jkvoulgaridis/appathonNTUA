    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate if the treatment could maximize intestinal
      absorption, minimize the inconvenience of diarrhea, and avoid, reduce or eliminate the need
      for parenteral support (PS) to achieve normal growth, to avoid parenteral nutrition
      complications and to achieve the best possible quality of life for the patient

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The short bowel syndrome (SBS) may be defined as a severe malabsorption caused by reduction
      of intestinal absorptive surface following massive resection of the small intestine.
      Teduglutide (Revestive®) is an analog of glucagon-like peptide 2 (GLP-2), a naturally
      occurring hormone that regulates the functional and structural integrity of the cells lining
      the gastrointestinal tract. The aim of the treatment is to maximize intestinal absorption,
      minimize the inconvenience of diarrhea, and avoid, reduce or eliminate the need for
      parenteral support (PS) to achieve the best possible quality of life for the patient. The
      rationale for the use of Revestive® is based on data obtained, especially in the trial in SBS
      patients.

      Treatment with 0.05 mg/kg/day was safe and well tolerated (no recorded side effects).

      Patients remained stable despite substantial reduction in parenteral nutrition (PN) supply as
      evidenced by stable body weight and height, serum electrolytes, pancreatic enzymes and renal
      function tests.

      Treatment was associated with:

        -  Reduced PN volume and calories delivered by 25 and 45% respectively with 20% of patients
           weaned off PN during the study period

        -  Increased Enteral Nutrition (EN) supply in volume and calories by 40 and 62%
           respectively

        -  Increased in plasma citrulline during the treatment period, but decreased after
           Teduglutide discontinuation The recommended dose of Revestive® in children and
           adolescents (aged 1 to 17 years) is the same as for adults (0.05 mg/kg body weight once
           daily).
