      Primary Objective The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of an interactive VMMC
      education session offered by a circumcised health worker and contribution to transport costs
      for accessing VMMC along with either (1) conditional economic compensation for wages or (2)
      lottery-based economic incentives on the uptake of VMMC.

      Hypothesis VMMC education session offered by a role model - a young male health worker who
      has been previously benefited from VMMC services in this community - addressing risks of HIV
      infection, benefits of VMMC, and the fear of pain associated with VMMC, with/without a
      conditional fixed or lottery-based financial incentives off-setting present-biased
      preferences, will improve risk perception and increase uptake of VMMC in HIV-negative young
      men.

      Study outcomes The primary outcomes for the study will be risk perception measured in a
      follow-up survey at 6 months and proportion of men taking up VMMC within 6 months measured
      through self-reports and matched to program records.

    <description>All participants will receive an education session on the risk of HIV infection and benefits from medical male circumcision. The sessions will be implemented by trained male healthcare workers who have undergone VMMC.
All participants will receive contributions towards transport costs to access medical male circumcision at participating clinics. On completing VMMC, participants assigned to receive fixed incentives will receive payment through mobile payments. In two sites a community-led intervention will also be implemented to address social obstacles and to increase support from peers, families and social structures.</description>

All participants will receive contributions towards transport costs to access medical male circumcision at participating clinics. On completing VMMC, participants will participate in a lottery with prizes equivalent in expected value to the fixed incentives. In two sites a community-led intervention will also be implemented to address social obstacles and to increase support from peers, families and social structures.</description>
