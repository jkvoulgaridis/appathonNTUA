      This study will evaluate the safety, immunogenicity, and preliminary assessment of efficacy
      of a novel vaccine encoding conserved elements (CE) of the HIV-1 Gag core protein, p24Gag, as
      a therapeutic vaccine in HIV-1 infected persons who are on antiretroviral therapy (ART).

      The study will randomly assign participants to one of three groups. Participants in Arm 1
      will receive p24CE1/2 pDNA vaccine at Weeks 0 and 4, followed by p24CE1/2 pDNA admixed with
      full-length p55^gag pDNA vaccine at Weeks 12 and 24. Participants in Arm 2 will receive
      full-length p55^gag pDNA vaccine at Weeks 0, 4, 12, and 24. Participants in Arm 3 will
      receive placebo at Weeks 0, 4, 12, and 24.

      Study visits will occur at Weeks 0, 4, 6, 12, 24, 26, and 48 and may include physical
      examinations and blood and urine collection. Some participants may undergo leukapheresis and
      stool sample collection.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  HIV-1 infection, documented by any licensed rapid HIV test or HIV enzyme or
             chemiluminescence immunoassay (E/CIA) test kit at any time prior to study entry and
             confirmed by a licensed Western blot or a second antibody test by a method other than
             the initial rapid HIV and/or E/CIA, or by HIV-1 antigen, plasma HIV-1 RNA assay. NOTE:
             The term &quot;licensed&quot; refers to a U.S. FDA-approved kit, which is required for all IND
             studies. WHO (World Health Organization) and CDC (Centers for Disease Control and
             Prevention) guidelines mandate that confirmation of the initial test result must use a
             test that is different from the one used for the initial assessment. A reactive
             initial rapid test should be confirmed by either another type of rapid assay or an
             E/CIA that is based on a different antigen preparation and/or different test principle
             (e.g., indirect versus competitive), or a Western blot or a plasma HIV-1 RNA viral
             load.

          -  Receiving a stable ART regimen for a minimum of 2 years prior to study entry and with
             no changes in the components of their antiretroviral therapy for at least 90 days
             prior to study entry. One of the agents must include an integrase inhibitor,
             non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI), or a boosted-protease
             inhibitor (PI). NOTE: Changes in the ART regimen for reasons other than virologic
             breakthrough during the 2-year period are acceptable.

          -  CD4 cell count greater than 500 cells/mm^3 obtained within 60 days prior to study
             entry at any U.S. laboratory that has a CLIA certification or its equivalent.

          -  Nadir CD4 cell count greater than 350 cells/mm^3. NOTE: Candidate recall or
             documentation is acceptable.

          -  One documented plasma HIV-1 RNA that is below the limit of detection of an
             FDA-approved assay between 24 and 36 months prior to the screening HIV-1 RNA and/or
             one documented plasma HIV-1 RNA that is below the limit of detection of an
             FDA-approved assay between 12 and 24 months prior to the screening HIV-1 RNA, and one
             documented HIV-1 RNA that is below the limit of detection of an FDA-approved assay
             collected fewer than 12 months prior to the screening HIV-1 RNA (see the protocol).

               -  NOTE: A single, unconfirmed plasma HIV-1 RNA above the limit of detection but
                  less than 400 copies/mL is allowed if followed by an HIV-1 RNA below detectable
                  limits, but not in the 6 months prior to screening.

               -  NOTE: One documented plasma HIV-1 RNA that is below the limit of detection
                  between 24 and 36 months prior to the screening HIV-1 RNA and one between 12 and
                  24 months prior to the screening HIV-1 RNA are preferred. However, in cases where
                  a plasma HIV-1 RNA is not available in one of these windows, but there has been
                  uninterrupted ART during the window and suppressed HIV-1 RNA before and after the
                  window, the participant may be enrolled.

                  Cockcroft-Gault equation. NOTE: A program for calculating creatinine clearance by
                  the Cockcroft-Gault method is available on www.fstrf.org.

               -  Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (SGPT) less than or equal to 2.5 x ULN

             cell (PBMC) specimens for T cell assays. Sites must receive confirmation from the
             processing lab via phone, e-mail, or fax that specimens have been entered into the
             ACTG Laboratory Data Management System (LDMS).

          -  Ability and willingness of participant or legal guardian/representative to provide
             informed consent

          -  Ability and willingness of participant to continue cART throughout the study.

          -  For females of reproductive potential, negative serum or urine pregnancy test within
             15 days prior to entry by any clinic or laboratory that has a CLIA certification or
             its equivalent, or is using a point of care (POC)/CLIA-waived test. NOTE: Reproductive
             potential is defined as girls who have reached menarche and women who have not been
             post-menopausal for at least 12 consecutive months with follicle-stimulating hormone
             (FSH) greater than or equal to 40 IU/mL or 24 consecutive months if an FSH is not
             available, or have not undergone surgical sterilization (e.g., hysterectomy, bilateral
             oophorectomy, tubal ligation, or salpingectomy).

          -  If participating in sexual activity that could lead to pregnancy, willingness of
             female participants to use two forms of effective contraception while receiving study
             medication and for 3 months after stopping study medication is required.

               -  NOTE A: Effective forms of contraception include:

               -  Barrier methods (condoms [male or female] with or without a spermicidal agent,
                  diaphragm, or cervical cap [with spermicide])

               -  Hormone-based contraception (oral, patch, parenteral, implants, or vaginal ring)

               -  Intrauterine device (IUD)

               -  NOTE B: If the female participant is not of reproductive potential (women who are
                  post-menopausal as defined above, or women who have undergone surgical
                  sterilization [e.g., hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, tubal ligation or
                  salpingectomy]), she is eligible without requiring the use of a contraceptive
                  method. Acceptable documentation of surgical sterilization and menopause is
                  participant-reported history.

          -  Indication of willingness to have the leukapheresis procedure. NOTE: Until 60 days
             after the last participating site is activated, each site will be limited to three
             participants in screening/enrollment at any given time. During this time period, these
             first three participants at each site will be required to agree at the screening visit
             to undergo the leukaphereses at the pre-entry and week 26 timepoints. Once the 60 day
             period after the last participating site is activated has passed, and at least 50% of
             the target accrual has agreed to undergo the leukaphereses, a study participant
             agreeing to the leukaphereses will be optional but highly recommended. The study team
             will inform the participating sites when this leukapheresis-optional period has begun.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of malignancy within the last 5 years prior to study entry or current
             malignancy requiring cytotoxic therapy. NOTE: A history of non-melanoma skin cancer
