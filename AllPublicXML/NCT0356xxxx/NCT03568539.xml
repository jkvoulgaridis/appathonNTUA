      The study is to evaluate preliminary anti-tumor activity (overall response rate, ORR) of
      IBI308 monotherapy in subjects with advanced/metastatic solid malignancies.

      Patients will be recruited for 2 cohorts:

      • Cohort 1: Advanced/metastatic cancers with TMB&gt;10 mutations per megabase (mut/Mb). This
      enrollment of this cohort has been stopped per sponsor's communication with the sites. For
      patients who have already enrolled in this cohort, treatment and monitoring will be conducted
      as stipulated by the protocol. The patients will remain on study until disease progression or
      intolerable toxicity, death, withdrawal of consent, or end of study, whichever occurs first.

      Cohort 2: Advanced/metastatic endometrial cancer (N=40)
