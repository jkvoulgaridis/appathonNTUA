  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pre-eclampsia is one of the most threatening pregnancy complications. So far neither a
      secure, competent therapy for PE nor effective biomarkers for a premature discovery has been
      achieved.The aim of our study was to identify miRNAs 136, 494 and 495 genes expression in
      exosomes of peripheral blood compared to umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells conditioned
      media released exososomes in patients with PE, as valuable markers for PE early prediction.

        PE group included 100 females with a mean age of 28.77 ± 5.72 years, while control group
        comprised of 100 females with a mean age of 28.06 ± 5.65 years. All enrolled patients were
        clinically diagnosed by physical examination and laboratory investigations.
