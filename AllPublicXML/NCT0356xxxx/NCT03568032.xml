  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Radiation-associated carotid vasculopathy is a common late sequelae in patients with head and
      neck cancer, which correlates with the incidence of stroke. Currently, little is known about
      the incidence of radiation-associated carotid vasculopahty in the context of
      intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT).

      The aim of this study is to determine whether IMRT will increase the incidence of carotid
      vasculopathy in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC).
