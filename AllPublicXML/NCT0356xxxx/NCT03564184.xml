  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Preterm birth has major medical, psychological and socio-economic consequences
      worldwide. A recent systematic review suggests positive effects of music therapy (MT) on
      physiological measures of preterm infants and maternal anxiety, but methodologically rigorous
      studies including long-term follow-up of infant and parental outcomes are missing. Drawing
      upon caregivers' inherent resources, this study emphasizes caregiver involvement in MT to
      promote attuned, developmentally-appropriate musical interactions that may be of mutual
      benefit to infant and parent. This study will determine whether MT, as delivered by a
      qualified music therapist during neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) hospitalization and/or
      in home/municipal settings following discharge, is superior to standard care in improving
      bonding between primary caregivers and preterm infants, parent well-being and infant
      development.

      Methods: Design: International multi-center, assessor-blind, 2x2 factorial, pragmatic
      randomized controlled trial. A feasibility study has been completed; ethical approval for the
      main trial is pending. Participants: 250 preterm infants and their parents. Intervention: MT
      focusing on singing specifically tailored to infant responses, will be delivered during NICU
      and/or during a post-discharge 6-month period. Primary outcome: Changes in mother-infant
      bonding until 6 months corrected age (CA), as measured by the Postpartum Bonding
      Questionnaire. Secondary outcomes: Mother-infant bonding at discharge and over 12 months CA;
      child development over 24 months; and parental depression, anxiety, and stress, and infant
      re-hospitalization, all over 12 months.

      Discussion: This study fills a gap by measuring the long-term impact of MT for preterm
      infants/caregivers, and of MT beyond the hospital context. Outcomes related to highly
      involving parents in MT will directly inform the development of clinical practice in
      Scandinavia and other contexts with similar social welfare practices. By incorporating
      family-centered care, continuity of care, user involvement, and cultural relevance, this
      study can potentially contribute to improved quality of care for premature infants and their
      parents worldwide.

    <description>Music therapy (MT) by trained music therapist, 3 times/week for 30-40 minutes/session during NICU hospitalization. Involves primary caregiver and infant in musical communication matched to infant post-menstrual age, family/cultural preferences, and infant readiness for stimulation. Music therapist assesses infant´s needs and behavior state, supports caregiver in using basic touch (e.g., hand lightly and statically on infant´s chest or back to perceive breathing pattern) and caregiver´s hummed/sung voice matched to infant behavioral responses, to promote infant state regulation and bonding. Music includes input from music therapist as needed, and multimodal aspects such as gentle dynamic touch when infant demonstrates readiness. MT may occur while infant is held in a static manner by caregiver or is resting in his/her isolette or basinet. MT may occur during skin-to-skin care, if such care is part of standard care.</description>

    <description>Music therapy offered by trained music therapist, 7 times for approximately 45 minutes/session across first 6 months following discharge from initial NICU hospitalization. Sessions include infant and caregiver, and siblings, if desired, and occur at home or in municipal settings. MT after NICU consists of a consult-to-parent model with each session including a brief verbal check-in regarding infant´s progress, musical interactions with music therapist modelling musical engagement, discussion of current challenges and strategies for using musical interactions to address needs in areas such as infant self-regulation, parent/infant interaction, and challenges with bonding. Caregivers will demonstrate techniques discussed during session, and form a brief plan for use of musical interaction in the interim before next session. Sessions will be adapted to infant developmental level and ongoing needs.</description>
