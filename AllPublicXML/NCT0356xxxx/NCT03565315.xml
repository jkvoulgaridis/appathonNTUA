      Background:

      Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is a serious disease. There is no cure or
      vaccine to prevent infection. Using antibodies might be a good way to treat or prevent HIV.
      Antibodies are naturally made by the body to fight germs. Researchers want to test if two
      antibodies made artificially in a lab can help to prevent HIV infection. The antibodies are
      10E8VLS and VRC07-523LS.

      Objective:

      To see if 10E8VLS and VRC07-523LS are safe and well-tolerated and how long they stay in the
      blood.

      Eligibility:

      Healthy adults ages 18-60

      Design:

      Participants will be screened in another protocol.

      Participants may choose to be in 1 of 4 groups:

      Group 1 will get 1 dose of 10E8VLS.

      Group 2 will get 3 doses of 10E8VLS.

      Group 3 will get 1 dose of both 10E8VLS and VRC07-523LS.

      Group 4 will get 3 doses of both 10E8VLS and VRC07-523LS.

      Participants in Groups 1 and 3 will have about 13 visits over 24 weeks.

      Participants in Groups 2 and 4 will have about 26 visits over 48 weeks.

      Participants will be weighed before each dose. Women may have a pregnancy test. They will
      have blood collected.

      A small needle will inject each dose into fatty tissue of the belly, upper arm, or thigh.
      Participants will get between 1 and 8 injections per dose depending on their weight. Heavier
      participants will get more injections.

      Participants will get a ruler and thermometer. They will check their temperature for 3 days
      after injection(s). They will measure any redness, swelling, or bruising at the injection
      site.

      At non-injection visits, participants will have blood drawn and be checked for health changes
      or problems.

      VRC 610:

      A Phase I Safety and Pharmacokinetics Study to Evaluate a Human Monoclonal Antibody (MAB)
      VRC-HIVMAB095-00-AB (10E8VLS) Administered Alone or Concurrently with MAB VRC-HIVMAB075-00-AB
      (VRC07-523LS) Via Subcutaneous Injection in Healthy Adults

      Study Design:

      This first-in-human, open-label study will evaluate MAb 10E8VLS (VRC- HIVMAB095-00-AB)
      administered alone or concurrently (i.e., at the same visit) with MAb VRC07-523LS
      (VRC-HIVMAB075-00-AB) in healthy adults ages 18 to 60. The primary hypothesis is that
      administrations of 10E8VLS alone and concurrently with VRC07-523LS will be well-tolerated in
      healthy adults. A secondary hypothesis is that both broadly neutralizing monoclonal
      antibodies (bNAbs) will be detectable in human sera with a definable half-life.

      Product Description:

      The 10E8VLS and VRC07-523LS bNAbs target the HIV-1 envelope at distinct epitopes: 10E8VLS
      recognizes the membrane proximal external region (MPER) and proximal viral membrane lipid of
      gp41, while VRC07-523LS recognizes the CD4 binding site of gp120. Both antibodies are human
      in origin, contain two amino acid modifications within the C-terminus of the heavy chain
      constant region designed to improve antibody half-life in vivo, and were developed by the
      VRC/NIAID/NIH. The 10E8VLS and VRC07-523LS bNAbs are manufactured under current Good
      Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) regulations at the VRC Pilot Plant operated under contract by
      the Vaccine Clinical Materials Program (VCMP), Leidos Biomedical Research, Inc., Frederick,
      MD.

      The 10E8VLS drug product is supplied at a concentration of 100 +/- 10 mg/mL in a sterile,
      aqueous, buffered solution of 5.25 mL in single-use 10 mL glass vials. The VRC07-523LS drug
      product is supplied at a concentration of 100 +/- 10 mg/mL in an isotonic, sterile solution
      of 6.25 +/- 0.1 mL in single-use 10 mL glass vials. Each drug product will be prepared in
      separate syringes.

      Subjects:

      Healthy adults, 18-60 years of age.

      Study Plan:

      This open-label study will include 4 dosing regimens of either 10E8VLS (5 mg/kg) alone or
      10E8VLS (5 mg/kg) and VRC07-523LS (5 mg/kg). All injections will be administered by the
      subcutaneous (SC) route. For Groups 1 and 2, 10E8VLS will be administered once or three-times
      at 12-week intervals. For Groups 3 and 4, 10E8VLS and VRC07-523LS will be administered once
      or three-times at 12-week intervals, respectively. Enrollment will begin with Groups 1 and 2,
      followed by Groups 3 and 4.

      VRC 610 Study Schema:

        -  Group 1; Study Product: 10E8VLS; Subjects per Group: 3; Dose (mg/kg) Administered SC: 5;
           Day 0

        -  Group 2; Study Product: 10E8VLS; Subjects per Group: 3; Dose (mg/kg) Administered SC: 5;
           Day 0, Week 12, Week 24

        -  Group 3 (a,b); Study Product: 10E8VLS+VRC07-523LS; Subjects per Group: 5; Dose (mg/kg)
           Administered SC: 5 of each MAb; Day 0

        -  Group 4 (a,b); Study Product: 10E8VLS+VRC07-523LS; Subjects per Group: 5; Dose (mg/kg)
           Administered SC: 5 of each MAb; Day 0, Week 13, Week 24.

        -  Total Subjects = 16 (c)

             1. Enrollment into Group 3 and 4 will commence after positive protocol safety review
                team (PSRT) review of safety data from Groups 1 and 2

             2. 10E8VLS and VRC07-523LS will be provided in separate syringes and administered at
                the same visit.

             3. The expected enrollment is 16 subjects with permitted increase to a total of 30 in
                case there are subjects who do not complete the schedule, additional
                pharmacokinetic (PK) evaluations are needed, enrollment of additional subjects is
                required for safety evaluations, or additional safety and PK data are needed to
                support potential expansion to multiple sites.

      Study Duration:

      Study participation will be approximately 24 weeks for subjects in Groups 1 and 3, and 48
      weeks for subjects in Groups 2 and 4.
