Participants sit in a straight back chair 44.5 cm high and 38 cm deep and are asked to fold their arms across their chests and to stand up from a sitting position once. If they successfully rise, they are asked to stand up and sit down 5 times as quickly as possible. Time to stand is measured using a stopwatch.

    <description>The 10 meter shuttle run assesses speed. Research staff will measure out a continuous 10 meter stretch that is free of obstacles. This test requires the person to run or walk back and forth between two parallel lines as fast as possible. Patients will start in a standing position and run or walk at their self-selected maximal rate 10 meters and back, for a total of 40 meters. The rater uses a stopwatch to keep time</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Single Leg Stance</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The single leg stance is a measure of postural stability. Participants will be asked to stand with arms crossed and pick one foot off the ground bending the knee to 90 degrees. The rater uses a stopwatch to time how long participants hold this stance, up to 60 seconds. This test is done on both legs</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Satisfaction with Physical Therapy and Recovery</measure>
    <time_frame>12 month visit</time_frame>
    <description>Satisfaction will be assessed during the final therapy visit using 3 questions designed specifically for this study:
How would you rate your satisfaction with the physical therapy you received for your injury? Please choose a number from 0 to 10 with 0 being not at all satisfied and 10 being extremely satisfied.
How satisfied are you with the progress you have made in recovering from your injury. Again, please use a number from 0 to 10 with 0 being not at all satisfied and 10 being extremely satisfied.
Would you recommend this physical therapy program to other people with injuries like yours? Would you say definitely yes, probably yes, probably no or definitely no?</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Fracture Healing</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Fracture healing will be assessed by clinical and radiographic examinations.These assessments will occur (and be recorded) at any standard of care visits that include radiographic examinations even if these visits are not part of the study schedule. Healing will be determined as &quot;healed&quot; or &quot;not healed&quot; based on orthogonal radiographs examined by the treating physician</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Integrity of Fracture Fixation and Alignment</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Evidence of fracture fixation loss (e.g. changes in alignment, loosening of screws, fracture of implants, etc.) will be assessed at each study visit. These assessments will also occur prospectively at any other standard of care visits that include radiographic examinations. Ankle fracture alignment will be assessed by measuring the medial joint space on a mortise view radiograph (with the ankle in neutral dorsiflexion) and compared to the initial postoperative radiograph. Knee fracture alignment will be assessed by measuring the anatomic alignment on an anterior-posterior radiograph and on a lateral radiograph compared to the initial postoperative radiograph</description>
