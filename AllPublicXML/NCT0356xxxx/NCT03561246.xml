      This study will evaluate the use of incline and decline treadmill training to address
      specific motor control deficits identified within different post-stroke walking patterns.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study seeks to develop a theory-based clinical decision-making framework for the
      training of walking recovery after stroke based on how different biomechanical patterns of
      walking illustrate distinct motor control deficits. Each participant will complete 12
      sessions (three times a week for four weeks) of either INCLINE, DECLINE, or CONTROL training.
      Clinical and biomechanical outcome measures will be collected pre- and post-training and
      after a one-month follow-up period. In addition, the investigators will collect a battery of
      clinical outcome measures before and after training. Spatiotemporal variables (including
      SSWS) will be collected before and after each session. All clinical and biomechanical
      assessments will be conducted by an evaluator blinded to training group allocation.

    <ipd_description>As a clinical trial, the details of this project will be entered into ClinicalTrials.gov. Clinical data from assessment sessions will be recorded on hard copies (stored in a locked file cabinet in the Ralph H. Johnson VAMC rehabilitation research space) and entered into a RedCAP electronic database by the project coordinator immediately after each session. These data will be de-identified for further analysis. Only the PI will only have access to de-identified data. Gait data will be analyzed using a custom MATLAB program, automatically populating a LabView Data Viewer from which customized data may be retrieved. The research coordinator will check the data entry, and pool all data into a group-wide de-identified spreadsheet. All data from training sessions will also be analyzed and stored using an automated MATLAB program. All electronic data will be stored on a secure server that is backed-up nightly.</ipd_description>
