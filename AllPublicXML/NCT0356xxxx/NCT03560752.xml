    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well multi-peptide CMV-modified vaccinia Ankara (CMV-MVA
      Triplex) vaccination of stem cell donors works in preventing cytomegalovirus (CMV) viremia in
      participants with blood cancer undergoing donor stem cell transplant. Giving a vaccine to the
      donors may boost the recipient's immunity to this virus and reduce the chance of CMV disease
      after transplant.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Establish the feasibility and safety of priming CMV immunity in donors by Triplex
      vaccination prior to peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) harvest.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Examine if Triplex vaccination of hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HCT) donors has an
      impact on CMV events.

      OUTLINE:

      Donors receive multi-peptide CMV-modified vaccinia Ankara vaccine injection between days -60
      and -10 prior to granulocyte colony stimulating factor mobilization. Participants undergo
      hematopoietic cell transplantation on day 0.

      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up for 1 year.

             prevent Herpes simplex virus (HSV)

          -  RECIPIENT: Prophylactic therapy with CMV immunoglobulin or prophylactic antiviral CMV
             treatment (Letermovir is permitted). EXCEPT for low risk patients [8/8 high resolution

             be discontinued if the mother is enrolled on this study

          -  RECIPIENT: Any other condition that would, in the investigator's judgment,
             contraindicate the patient's participation in the clinical study due to safety

             issues, etc

          -  RECIPIENT: Prospective participants who, in the opinion of the investigator, may not
