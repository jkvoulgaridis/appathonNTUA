  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a prospective, randomized, controlled, exploratory trail to evaluate the
      strategy of &quot;one-stop&quot; endovascular treatment for concomitant coronary artery disease and
      aortic atherosclerotic disease.

    <textblock>
      60 patients will be allocated randomly in a 1:1 ratio into one-stop strategy group or staging
      strategy group. In one-stop strategy group, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) will be
      performed on the same operating room immediately after the endovascular aortic repair (EVAR);
      In staging strategy group, PCI will be performed several days after EVAR. The safety and
      effectiveness will be assessed between two groups 1 year after the operation. The economic
      index will be evaluated as well as.
