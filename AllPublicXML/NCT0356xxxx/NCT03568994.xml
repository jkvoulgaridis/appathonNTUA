    <textblock>
      This study will test daily dosing of atovaquone at established pneumocystis jiroveci
      pneumonia (PJP) prophylaxis dosing in combination with standard induction chemotherapy for de
      novo AML. The primary objectives are to determine the frequency of omission of atovaquone
      doses due to standard induction chemotherapy toxicity, to quantify the steady-state plasma
      levels of atovaquone, and to determine the time to achievement of steady state atovaquone
      levels in this population.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Standard cytotoxic chemotherapy is based on the Medical Research Council (MRC) backbone of
      cytarabine, and daunorubicin. This combination of chemotherapy is highly myelosuppressive and
      can lead to oral aversions, dietary intolerance, and gastrointestinal infections
      necessitating holding of oral drugs. Because of the toxicity of the best currently available
      therapy, new drugs that are considered for incorporation into existing treatment regimens
      will ideally have a tolerable side effect profile. This study will evaluate the tolerability
      of incorporating the orally bioavailable drug atovaquone in combination with standard
      cytotoxic induction chemotherapy for newly diagnosed pediatric AML patients. Therefore,
      quantifying the frequency with which atovaquone is held due to a side effect of therapy is
      crucial information to gather in this population.

    <description>Patients will receive standard of care MRC based Induction chemotherapy (such as ADE 10+3+5 with daily atovaquone dosing starting on day 6. In order to accommodate potential drug shortages modifications to ADE 10+3+5 that retain the MRC based induction backbone regimen of DA are allowed (see second Arm). These include but are not limited to substitution of etopophos for etoposide, exclusion of etoposide, use of CPX-351 (VYXEOS (daunorubicin and cytarabine) liposome) only, and daunorubicin and cytarabine (DA) + gemtuzumab ozogamicin (GO).
Patients will be monitored for adherence to and tolerance of daily dosing of atovaquone. Peripheral blood (PB) and bone marrow plasma samples will be obtained to measure atovaquone concentrations.</description>

             2.2 Patients with &lt; 20% bone marrow or peripheral blood blasts are eligible if they
             have:

               -  A karyotypic abnormality characteristic of de novo AML (t(8;21)(q22;q22),

               -  The unequivocal presence of megakaryoblasts, or

               -  Biopsy proven isolated myeloid sarcoma (myeloblastoma; chloroma, including
                  leukemia cutis).

          3. Pre-existing myelodysplastic syndrome:

             Patients with a history of myelodysplastic syndrome that has progressed to AML which
             meets the criteria above are eligible.

          4. Therapy-related or secondary AML Patients with AML which is thought to be therapy
             related but meet the criteria above are eligible.

          5. Prior Therapy:

             Prior therapy with hydroxyurea, all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), corticosteroids (any
             route), and IT cytarabine given at diagnosis is allowed. Hydroxyurea and ATRA cannot
             be given concurrently with protocol therapy. There is no specific amount of time
             mandated between the last dose of hydroxyurea or ATRA and the start of protocol
             therapy.

             With the exception of infants who had previously received low dose cytarabine to
             control disease, patients who have previously received any other antileukemic therapy
             (i.e. chemotherapy or radiation therapy) are not eligible for this protocol.

          6. Organ Function Requirement:

             Adequate Liver Function Defined as:

               -  Direct Bilirubin ≤2x upper limit of normal (ULN) for age and institution (unless
                  related to leukemic involvement), and

               -  serum glutamate-pyruvate transaminase (SGPT) (ALT) ≤2.5x ULN for age and
                  institution (unless it is related to leukemic involvement)

          7. Ability to receive enteral medication:

        Eligible patients should have no contraindication to enteral administration of medication
        (e.g. oral, Nasogastric (NG), G-tube, etc) as determined by the evaluating physician.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Excluded Constitutional Conditions

                  AML Note: Enrollment and initiation of therapy may occur pending results of
                  clinically indicated studies to exclude these conditions. If a patient is found
                  to have any of these conditions they should be removed from the study once
                  results are received. Patients who are removed due to ineligibility after results
                  are received will be replaced.

          2. Other Excluded Conditions

             Patients with any of the following oncologic diagnoses are not eligible:

               -  Any concurrent malignancy

               -  Acute promyelocytic leukemia Note: Enrollment and initiation of therapy may occur
                  pending results of clinically indicated studies to exclude these conditions. If a
                  patient is found to have any of these conditions they should be removed from the
                  study once results are received. Patients who are removed due to ineligibility
                  after results are received will be replaced.
