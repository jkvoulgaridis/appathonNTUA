  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study seeks to bridge the knowledge-to-action gap regarding &quot;exercise as medicine&quot; for
      adolescents with bipolar disorder (BD). Numerous review articles attest to widespread
      recognition that aerobic exercise (AE) could be an important part of the treatment
      armamentarium to reduce the symptom burden, neurocognitive dysfunction, and cardiovascular
      disease (CVD) risk, improve quality of life (QOL), and even engage core biological treatment
      targets in BD. It appears self-evident that treatment for adolescents with BD, who experience
      high symptom burden, neurocognitive deficits, and increased CVD risk, should target their
      aerobic fitness (AF), yet there is not a single study in the world literature on this topic.
      Remarkably, there have been no intervention studies that specifically focus on aerobic
      exercise or that directly evaluate changes in AF in any BD age group. Overall physical
      activity is important, but focusing on AF offers unique potential benefits in terms of
      simultaneously ameliorating and enhancing mood, neurocognition, and cardiovascular health.
      Importantly, a recent American Heart Association (AHA) Scientific Statement confirms that it
      is the most aerobically unfit for whom even modest improvements in AF offer the greatest
      relative benefits. Nonetheless, important questions arise as to whether and how AF in this
      population can be improved. There is a clear and unmet need for effective behavior change
      counseling (BCC) interventions targeting AF that are tailored to the unique needs of
      adolescents with BD.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overarching goal of this project is to advance the field in terms of BCC approaches to
      improving AF among adolescents with BD, a group for whom improvements in AF offer multiple
      parallel benefits. This project will serve as a preliminary feasibility study, a necessary
      step in the path toward a well-powered, randomized controlled trial (RCT). If exercise is to
      achieve the same status as other evidence-based treatments for adolescents with BD, it will
      be necessary to evaluate exercise with the same level of rigor as other interventions. A
      crucial first step toward the ultimate goal of an adequately powered RCT is to demonstrate
      that adolescents with BD will enroll in, and actively participate in, an intervention study
      that accurately reflects what would be required of participants in such a study.

      Objective 1: Evaluate the feasibility of developing a 24-week BCC intervention, customized
      and personalized for adolescents with BD, focusing on increasing AF.

      Objective 2: Evaluate the feasibility of implementing the 24-week BCC intervention.

      Objective 3: Evaluate the feasibility of measuring the effects of the intervention.

      Exploratory: Examine the impact on AF of a 24-week BCC intervention, customized and
      personalized for adolescents with BD. Related hypothesis-generating analyses will examine the
      impact of specific variables (e.g., mood, medications, exercise-induced feelings, specific
      BCC modules, changes in motivation and self-efficacy) on AF changes.

    <measure>36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, week 12, week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-36 taps eight health concepts: physical functioning, bodily pain, role limitations due to physical health problems, role limitations due to personal or emotional problems, emotional well-being, social functioning, energy/fatigue, and general health perceptions. It also includes a single item that provides an indication of perceived change in health. To score, first, precoded numeric values are recoded per the scoring key given (see link). Note that all items are scored so that a high score defines a more favorable health state. In addition, each item is scored on a 0 to 100 range. Scores represent the percentage of total possible score achieved. In step 2, items in the same scale are averaged together to create the 8 scale scores. Table 2 lists the items averaged together to create each scale. Items that are left blank (missing data) are not taken into account when calculating. https://www.rand.org/health/surveys_tools/mos/36-item-short-form/scoring.html</description>

    <measure>Client Satisfaction Questionnaire-8 (CSQ-8)</measure>
    <time_frame>At weeks 12 and 24</time_frame>
    <description>The Client Satisfaction Questionnaire-8 will be used to assess intervention satisfaction. An overall score is calculated by summing the respondent's rating (item rating) score for each scale item. For the CSQ-8 version, scores therefore range from 8 to 32, with higher values indicating higher satisfaction. Scoring values range from 1-4 with 4 meaning high satisfaction and 1 meaning low satisfaction.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Stages of Change Questionnaire (SCQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, week 4, week 8, week 12, and week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The Stages of Change Questionnaire is a self-report that will provide the stage of behavior change relating to exercise status for discussion at BCC sessions. Six statements are provided and the participant is asked to select the statement that best describes them. This will then determine which stage of change they are in (precontemplation, contemplation, preparation, action, maintenance, or relapse).</description>

    <measure>Outcome Expectations for Exercise (OEE)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, week 12, week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The Outcome Expectations for Exercise tool will assess expectations of the benefits from physical activity. The Outcome Expectations for Exercise Scale contains 9 statements rated by participants using a 5-point likert scale from 1 &quot;Strongly Disagree&quot; to 5 &quot;Strongly Agree&quot;. If negative or low expectations are found, an intervention can be implemented that may increase the expectancy of exercise and therefore create a more active lifestyle.</description>

    <measure>Behavioral Regulation in Exercise Questionnaire (BREQ-3)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, week 12, week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The Behavioral Regulation in Exercise Questionnaire-3 is a 24-item self-report scale that assesses the reasons why people exercise. Questions range from 0 (not true for me) to 4 (very true for me). BREQ has been used either as a multidimensional instrument giving separate scores for each subscale, or as a unidimensional index of the degree of self-determination, known as the relative autonomy index. In order to use the BREQ as multidimensional scales, the mean scores are calculated for each set of items into categories (amotivation, external regulation, introjected regulation, identified regulation, integrated regulation, and intrinsic regulation).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Exercise Self-Efficacy</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, week 12, week 24</time_frame>
    <description>This measure will assess exercise-related self-efficacy. An 11-point scale is used with 1 indicating &quot;not at all confident&quot; and 7 indicating &quot;very confident&quot;. Participants can also endorse 0 &quot;does not apply to me&quot;. High scores indicate high levels of self-efficacy.</description>

    <measure>Quick Weight, Activity, Variety, and Excess Screener (WAVE)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, week 12, week 24</time_frame>
    <description>WAVE is a 17-item self-report instrument that ascertains 5 subscales: weight, physical activity, dietary variety, dietary excess, and household food insecurity. The scores for each question can be added to generate an overall WAVE score that provides a quick estimate of the patient's overall health habits. The WAVE score can range from 0 to 21. The scores are interpreted as follows: 0 to 5= High priority for intervention to improve health habits; 6 to 11=In need of much improvement; 12 to 16=Some good health habits but needs improvement; and 17 to 21=Good to excellent health habits.</description>

    <measure>Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, week 12, week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The PSQI is a self-rated questionnaire which assesses sleep quality and disturbances over a 1 month time interval. Each question is scored with a total score of &quot;5&quot; or greater indicating poor sleep quality. Items collect time and length of sleep. Other items look at factors affecting sleep and responses range from 0 (not during the past month) to 3 (three or more times a week).</description>

    <measure>Exercise-Induced Feeling Inventory (EIFI)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, then pre- and post-aerobic fitness testing at weeks 0, 2, 8, 12, and 24</time_frame>
    <description>The Exercise-Induced Feeling Inventory measures the intensity of 12 feeling states as they occur in relation to physical activity. Responses are rated from 0 (do not feel) to 4 (feel very strongly) for each emotion. The EIFI consists of 12 items that capture 4 distinct feeling states: revitalization, tranquility, positive engagement, and physical exhaustion. The EIFI consists of 4 distinct subscales. Subscale scores are obtained by summing or averaging the numerical values chosen for the adjectives within a particular subscale. The four subscales include: (1) Positive Engagement (items 4, 7, &amp; 12), (2) Revitalization (items, 1, 6, &amp; 9), (3) Tranquility (items 2, 5, &amp; 10), and (4) Physical Exhaustion (items, 3, 8, &amp; 11).</description>
