  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the short term effects (12 Weeks) of Lactobacillus
      plantarum PS128 (PS128) on Parkinson's disease (PD) symptoms.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to examine the extent to which L. plantarum PS128 can improve symptoms
      in PD patients. L. plantarum PS128 is a psychobiotic that regulates the level of dopamine in
      specific brain regions. Patients with PD will receive PS128 treatment for 12 weeks. Symptoms
      of PD will be clinically evaluated before and after the treatment, and the results will be
      compared.

    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The UPDRS scores is a rating tool used to gauge the course of Parkinson's disease in patients. The minimum total score possible is 0 and the maximum total score possible is 199. Higher values represent a worse outcome.</description>

    <time_frame>to Week 12 Assessed On Medication</time_frame>
    <description>NMS-Quest is a 30-item Screening tool for non-motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease. The minimum total score possible is 0 and the maximum total score possible is 30. Higher values represent a worse outcome.</description>

    <measure>Change in Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) Score From Baseline to Week 12 Assessed On Medication</measure>
    <time_frame>to Week 12 Assessed On Medication</time_frame>
    <description>The PGIC consists of one item taken from the clinical global impression and adapted to the patient. The minimum total score possible is 1 and the maximum total score possible is 7. Higher values represent a worse outcome.</description>
