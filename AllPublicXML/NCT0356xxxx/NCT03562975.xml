    <textblock>
      The investigators are measuring the effectiveness of Ocrevus™ in helping patients with hand
      or arm weakness, especially if posed by a more advanced MS patient than those included in the
      clinical trials.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ocrevus™ is the first FDA approved disease-modifying treatment for primary progressive
      multiple sclerosis (PPMS) as well as relapsing MS. In the clinical trials considered by the
      FDA (OPERA I/II, ORATORIO), the highest Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) included in
      the participants was 5.5 (OPERA I/II) and 6.5 (ORATORIO). The EDSS score is heavily weighted
      on walking ability and is not a useful measurement for UE function. The primary endpoint in
      the primary progressive MS trial with Ocrevus™ was EDSS and in the relapsing MS studies, EDSS
      was used as a secondary endpoint. The Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite (MSFC) score (Z
      score), a composite of quantitative measure of walking speed, upper limb coordinated movement
      (9 Hole Peg Test/9HPT) and cognitive function, was obtained as a secondary clinical measure
      with scores being favorably higher in patients treated with Ocrevus™ (OPERA I/II).The z
      score, however, is not very useful in delineating which of the three clinical functions was
      maintained or showed less progression given that three domains are included in the score.
      Data presented recently from the Oratorio trial analyzed the intention to treat population of
      PPMS patients and the subgroups of patients with upper extremity functional impairment using
      the 9HPT; results demonstrated reduction in risk of clinical progression in upper extremity
      disability in patients treated with Ocrevus compared to placebo. There was improvement in the
      change from baseline to week 120 in 9HPT time in treated patients. Abnormal baseline 9HPT was
      defined as &gt;25 seconds and upper extremities were defined as &quot;better hand&quot; and &quot;worse hand&quot;,
      each individually tested, with clinical progression determined at 12 and 24 weeks in 3
      sub-categories of progression: lengthened time of 9HPT &gt;15%, &gt;20% and 25%.

      In this study, investigators aim to not only replicate the results in the Oratorio trial with
      upper extremity dysfunction, but also widen the spectrum of patients that may benefit (given
      an expanded MS population of patients, not exclusive to PPMS and widen the It is anticipated
      that by using a test that better emulates activities of daily life performed with the upper
      extremity, such as the TEMPA (Test d'Evaluation de la performance des membres Superieurs e
      Personnes Agees ) more real life application of the benefits of receiving treatment with
      Ocrevus will be obtained, and it is anticipated that patients can maintain the function they
      have or potentially improve function.

    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The TEMPA consists of 9 tasks that mimic tasks of daily living that include picking up a jar, taking a spoonful of coffee from a jar, pouring water from a pitcher, handling coins, writing on an envelope and opening a pill container, tying a scarf around one's neck, shuffle and deal playing cards, and picking up and moving small objects. The tasks are assessed by a rater by measuring speed of execution (seconds) and by functional rating of the subject's independence in performing them using an ordinal scale of 0 (completed without difficulty) to -3 (could not complete the task).</description>
