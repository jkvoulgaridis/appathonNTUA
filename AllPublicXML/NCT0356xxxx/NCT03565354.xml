  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Iron deficiency anaemia is a common condition among colorectal surgical patient. Untreated
      anaemia would lead to increase in blood transfusion, surgical complications and mortality.
      Treatment with oral iron sulphate is poorly tolerated due to side effects. Intravenous iron
      supplement provides an alternative way to rapidly replace iron deficit during the
      preoperative period among surgical patients. Evidence is growing for its effect in rising
      hemoglobin level and reducing blood transfusion, at the same time supporting its safety
      profile.

      The investigators plan for a single-centered, randomized controlled trial to examine the
      effect of intravenous iron compared to standard care in terms of hemoglobin level/serum
      ferritin increment, need for blood transfusion, duration of hospital stay, quality of
      recovery and surgical complication rate, as well as safety profile among colorectal cancer
      surgical patients in Hong Kong. The investigator propose the following pilot RCT for
      exploring the effect size and study process in conducting the above-mentioned large-scale
      RCT.

    <description>intravenous iron isomaltose 3-10 weeks before operation date. The dose will be determined by the patient's body weight: &gt; 50kg: 1000mg; &lt;50kg: 20mg/kg body weight, to be infused over 30 minutes. 2 weeks after intravenous iron isomaltoside administration, blood test for hemoglobin level and iron profile would be repeated. Subjects with hemoglobin level less than 10g/dL will receive a second dose of intravenous iron isomaltoside. The second dose would be identical to the first dose</description>
