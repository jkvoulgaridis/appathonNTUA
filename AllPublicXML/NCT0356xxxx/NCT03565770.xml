  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this project is to assess the introduction of an individual follow-up distance
      coaching (phone and messages on a secure line platform) in order to optimize the health care
      of type 1 diabetes children with therapy adjustment difficulties. It is a personalized,
      multi-disciplinary, medical et paramedical. It will consist of an individual coaching for the
      children and families with therapy adjustment difficulties.

      The hypothesis is that the proposed coaching would allow to improve the patient glycemic
      control not only during this coaching, but also, to bring long lasting improvement following
      the coaching.
