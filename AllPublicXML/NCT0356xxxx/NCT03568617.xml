  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We design this pilot, single arm study to explore the safety and efficacy of repetitive
      transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) for the treatment of chronic migraine. The
      hypothetical control group is pooled sham group in latest meta-analysis. We expect a
      significant improvement of the outcome measures during and after the treatment as compared to
      the hypothetical control group.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After a 28-day prospective baseline period using a headache diary to record headache symptoms
      and any abortive medications used, subjects who meet diagnostic criteria for chronic migraine
      and don't meet the exclusion criteria will receive rTMS for 4 weeks. The outcome measure will
      be evaluated at 4 weeks. During the whole trial period, any adverse events are requested to
      be recorded in the headache diary for analyses. The primary outcome is 50% reduction in the
      number of days with headache. 50% reduction as assessed by migraine days, moderate/severe
      headache days, the mean VRS, and conversion to episodic migraine, SGIC, the change from
      baseline HALT-28, HIT-6, and MSQ v2.1, are used as secondary outcome measures for exploring
      other benefits associated with treatment.

    <description>A migraine day is defined as a day with a headache that lasts at least 4 hours; meets ICHD-III criteria C and D for migraine without aura (1.1), B and C for migraine with aura (1.2), or ICHD-III criteria for probable migraine (1.6); or a day with a headache that is successfully treated with a triptan, ergotamine, or other migraine-specific acute medication.</description>

    <measure>50% reduction in the Number of Moderate/Severe Headache Days</measure>
    <time_frame>at 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A moderate/severe headache day is defined as a day with moderate or severe pain that lasts at least 4 hours or a day with a headache that is successfully treated by an acute headache medication.</description>

    <measure>The Subject's Global Impression of Change (SGIC)</measure>
    <time_frame>at 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Global impression of change was scored using a 7-point scale for each instrument, ranging from 1 (very much improved) to 7 (very much worse), with a 4-week recall period. We'll estimate the proportion of patients who reported any improved (very much improved, much improved, minimally improved).</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline HALT-28 (Headache-Attributed Lost Time - 28 days)</measure>
    <time_frame>at baseline and 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>HALT-30 is closely based on the first five questions of MIDAS, developed by RB Lipton and WF Stewart. We modify the time interval to capture migraine-related disability with a 4-week recall period.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline HIT-6 (Headache Impact Test-6)</measure>
    <time_frame>at baseline and 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>HIT-6 is for capturing migraine-related disability with a 4-week recall period.</description>

    <time_frame>at 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects will be instructed to record the pain intensity of each day using 11-point Visual Rating Scale (VRS). The mean VRS is defined as the mean of the maximum VRS of each day with a 4-week period.</description>
