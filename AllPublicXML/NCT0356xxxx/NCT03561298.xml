    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetic interaction of effects of
      multiple doses of zanubrutinib with a &quot;Cocktail&quot; of five probe drugs for cytochrome P450
      (CYP) 3A, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, P-glycoprotein and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) in
      healthy subjects

        Inclusion Criteria: All Groups

          -  Male subjects in good health as determined by past medical history, physical
             examination, vital signs, ECG and laboratory tests at screening.

          -  Subjects must have a body mass index (BMI) between 18 and 32 kg/m2.

          -  Male subjects must agree to a highly effective method of birth control from screening
             until at least 90 days after the last dose of study drug.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with a clinically relevant history or presence of any clinically significant
             disease.

          -  History of stomach or intestinal surgery or resection that would potentially alter
             absorption and/or excretion of orally administered drugs (uncomplicated appendectomy,
             cholecystectomy, and hernia repair will be allowed).

          -  History of drug or alcohol abuse within 2 years prior to Check-In.

          -  Alcohol consumption of &gt;21 units per week.

          -  A positive urine drug screen and/or positive alcohol breath test at Screening and/or
             Check-in.

          -  A positive Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) or Hepatitis C test result and/or a
             positive human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) at screening.

          -  Use of tobacco- or nicotine-containing products within 3 months prior to Check-In.

          -  History of blood donation of 56 days prior to Screening, plasma from 2 weeks prior to
             Screening, or platelets from 6 weeks prior to Screening.
