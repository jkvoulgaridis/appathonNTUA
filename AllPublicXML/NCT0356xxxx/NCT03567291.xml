  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an otherwise open-label, single-arm study that includes a 2-week, double-blind,
      placebo controlled, randomized drug withdrawal period followed by a 3 week blinded
      maintenance or re-titration, and then a maintenance period. This study aims to evaluate the
      safety and efficacy of TEV-50717 tablets in patients with tics associated with TS who have
      previously completed participation in any of the parent studies.

      This is an otherwise open-label, single-arm study (Part A) that includes a 2-week,
      double-blind, placebo controlled, randomized drug withdrawal period (Part B) followed by a 3
      week blinded maintenance or re-titration (Part A resumed), and then a maintenance period.
      This study aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of TEV-50717 tablets in patients with
      tics associated with TS who have previously completed participation in any of the parent
      studies (SD-809-C-17 [Phase 1b], TV50717-CNS 30046 [Phase 2/3], or TV50717-CNS 30060 [Phase
      3]).

    <time_frame>Screening, day 1: and weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 15, 34, 41, 54, and 55</time_frame>
    <description>When scoring the YGTSS, the tool gives ratings in 5 domains: Total Motor Tic Score, Total Verbal Tic Score, Total Tic Score (Motor + Verbal), Overall Impairment Rating, and Global Severity Score. When calculating the Global Severity score, it is found by adding together the total motor, verbal and impairment scores. The Total Tic Severity Score has a range of 0-50, and the Global Severity Score has a range of 0- 100. A higher score on all scales suggests a more severe Tic, or a greater impact the Tic has on the person's life</description>

    <description>The TS-CGI scale is a 7-point Likert scale that allows the clinician to use all available information to assess the impact of tics on the patient's quality of life. The TS-CGI is rated as follows: 1 (normal), 2 (borderline), 3 (mild), 4 (moderate), 5 (marked), 6 (severe), and 7 (extreme).</description>

    <time_frame>Screening, day 1: and weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 15, 34, 41, 54, and 55</time_frame>
    <description>The TS-PGII is a single-item questionnaire that asks the patient to assess the degree of impact due to current tics. The TS-PGII uses a 5-point scale, ranging from not at all (1) to very much (5), to assess overall response to therapy.</description>

    <description>The C&amp;A-GTS-QOL is a 27-item questionnaire specific to TS patients that asks the patient to assess the extent to which their quality of life is impacted by their symptoms. The C&amp;AGTS- QOL contains 4 subscales (psychological, physical, obsessional, and cognitive) and uses a 5-point Likert scale ranging from no problem to extreme problem. Patients will also be asked how satisfied they feel overall with their life at that moment by using a VAS scale between 0 and 100</description>

When calculating the Global Severity score, it is found by adding together the total motor, verbal and impairment scores. The Total Tic Severity Score has a range of 0-50, and the Global Severity Score has a range of 0- 100.
