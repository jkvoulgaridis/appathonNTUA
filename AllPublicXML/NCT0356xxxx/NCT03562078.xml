  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the hypothesis that the 12-week Tai Chi Quan training would have better
      control of blood sugar, biochemistry profile, and also better quality of life and activity of
      autonomic nerve system (ANS). The subjects were randomize assigned to either Tai Chi group or
      control group. The outcome measures before and after 12-week intervention include basic
      demographic characteristics, HbA1c, fasting blood glucose(FBG), triglycerides (TG), high and
      low density lipoprotein (HDL, LDL), creatinine(Cr), eGFR, GPT, ACR, quality of life, and
      activity of automatic nerve system.

      In this study, the hypothesis that the 12-week Tai Chi Quan training would have better
      control of blood sugar, biochemistry index, and also better quality of life and activity of
      automatic nerve system. In the study, type 2 diabetes mellitus(T2DM) patients will be
      recruited as subjects. The subjects were randomized to either Tai Chi group or control group.
      Tai Chi group would take Tai Chi Quan training for 1hr, twice a week for 12 weeks. There were
      10-minute warm-up, 40-minute Tai Chi lesson, and 10-minute cool-down exercise in the
      training. In this study, the 1st section of Yang style 108 form is chosen for the experiment
      group. Both group were given diabetic patients care education and the exercise recording book
      for encouraging the daily exercise habits. The outcome measures before and after 12-week
      intervention include basic demographic characteristics, HbA1c, fasting blood glucose,
      triglycerides, high and low density lipid, creatinine, eGFR, GPT, ACR, quality of life, and
      activity of automatic nerve system.
