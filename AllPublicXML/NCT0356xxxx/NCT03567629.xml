    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, open-lable, multicenter, randomized, controlled, phase II clinical
      study. The aim is to evaluate the efficacy of Irinotecan versus Oxaliplatin in the first-line
      treatment of refractory metastatic colorectal cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This trial is conducted in patients with the refractory metastatic colorectal cancer.
      Eligible patients are randomized into two arms at 1:1 ratio to receive Irinotecan-based
      regimen or Oxaliplatin-based regimen until progress of the disease, unacceptable toxicity or
      withdrawal of consent by the patient. Study evaluation time is until death of patient or a
      deadline set by the researchers.
