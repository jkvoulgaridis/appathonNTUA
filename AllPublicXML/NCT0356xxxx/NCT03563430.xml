  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to compare these three different recovery methods following a single
      bout high-intensity interval exercise program with each other in terms of blood lactate
      clearance, muscle flexibility, muscle strength and endurance.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is very important to choose the most effective recovery method for the athletes in
      training for their next training/competition. The recovery period is very significant in
      terms of removal of blood lactate and body dynamics as soon as they return to their original
      state and achieve high performance. Neither neuromuscular electrical stimulation,
      low-intensity aerobic exercise, self-massage with foam roller methods, which have been proven
      their effectiveness in the literature, have been compared with each other.
