  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An isotonic solution, such as saline (0.9%, 300mOsm/L) or lactated ringer's (273 mOsm/L), is
      commonly used and safely proven for joint irrigation during arthroscopy. Arthroscopic fluid
      is usually pressurized to enable visualization through dilation of the joint or bursa and
      prevent bleeding from the microvasculature. It has been recommended that this pressure be
      maintained at 49mmHg or less below the systolic blood pressure to preserve the clarity of
      view. The combination of large amounts of pressurized irrigation solution and lengthy
      arthroscopic procedures may cause substantial tissue fluid retention. Thus, extravasation of
      irrigation fluid into the periarticular tissues is inevitable and may create technical
      difficulties as well as patient morbidity and complications. Previous investigators have
      reported complications including tracheal obstruction, post-operative airway edema and
      compromise leading to prolonged intubation, excess weight gain, neurologic injuries, skin
      necrosis, and fluid overload associated with excessive fluid extravasation and tissue
      retention. Furthermore, it has been shown that fluid accumulated during the operation is
      slowly released back into the systemic circulation. Although there is not a rapid change in
      circulating volume, there may be implications for elderly patients and those with multiple
      comorbidities during prolonged arthroscopic surgery. Therefore the investigators seek to
      determine if a hyperosmolar solution, similar to what is used in head trauma patients, can
      reduce the degree of fluid extravasation in knee arthroscopy. The investigators also seek to
      determine if a hyperosmolar solution has any effect on post-operative knee pain compared to
      the standard isotonic solution. The third objective is to determine if a hyperosmolar
      solution has any effect on post-operative pain medicine consumption compared to the standard
      isotonic solution.
