  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will treat patients with previously untreated high grade myleodysplastic syndromes
      (MDS) with both omacetaxine mepesuccinate and azacitidine.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, phase I/II study for previously untreated patients with high grade MDS
      using omacetaxine and azacitidine. Phase I features dose escalation, where patients will be
      assigned to one of three cohorts to receive different doses of omacetaxine with the standard
      dose and schedule of azacitidine, over a 28 day cycle. Phase II features the maximum
      tolerated dose from the Phase 1 study.
