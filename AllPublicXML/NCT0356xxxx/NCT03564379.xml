    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy on the basis of clinical laboratory tests performed at screening and Day -1.
             If the results of the serum chemistry panel including liver enzymes, other specific
             tests, blood coagulation, hematology, or urinalysis are outside the normal reference
             ranges, the participant may be included only if the investigator judges the
             abnormalities or deviations from normal to be not clinically significant or to be
             appropriate and reasonable for the population under study. This determination must be
             recorded in the participant's source documents and initialed by the investigator

          -  Healthy on the basis of physical examination, medical history, vital signs, and
             12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) performed at screening

          -  A man who is sexually active with a woman of childbearing potential, and has not had a
             vasectomy with confirmation of azoospermia, must agree to use a barrier method of
             birth control during the study and for 3 months after receiving the last dose of study
             drug, and his female partner must also use a highly effective form of birth control at
             least one month prior to the first study dose and continuing until 3 months after the
             final study dose. Acceptable barrier methods are male condoms with spermicide, and for
             the female partner a diaphragm or cervical cap with appropriate spermicidal foam,
             cream, or gel. Highly effective forms of birth control for the female partner are
             prescribed hormonal implants, contraceptive patches, contraceptive injections, oral
             contraceptives, and intrauterine device (IUD)

          -  Body Mass Index (BMI; weight/height^2 [kilogram per meter square {kg/m^2}]) between
             18.0 and 30.0 kg/m^2 (inclusive), and body weight not less than 50.0 kilogram (kg)

          -  Blood pressure (BP) (after the participant is standing for 3 minutes, supine for 5
             minutes) between 90 and 140 millimeter of mercury (mmHg) systolic, inclusive, and no
             higher than 90 mmHg diastolic (orthostatic cut-off, a fall in systolic BP of at least
             20 mmHg or diastolic BP of at least 10 mmHg when a person assumes a standing position
             is exclusionary). If BP is out of range, up to 2 repeated assessments are permitted

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Clinically significant abnormal values for hematology, clinical chemistry,
             coagulation, or urinalysis at screening (and at admission to the study center) as
             deemed appropriate by the investigator

          -  Known allergy, hypersensitivity, or intolerance to JNJ-42165279 or its excipients

          -  Any Grade 2 laboratory toxicity

          -  History of clinically significant drug and/or food allergies

          -  History of epilepsy or fits or unexplained black-outs
