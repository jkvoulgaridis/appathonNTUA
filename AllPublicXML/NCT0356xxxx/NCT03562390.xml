  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of third-line or later irinotecan
      treatment for locally recurrent or metastatic breast cancer among Chinese patients who have
      received at least two regimens containing anthracyclines and taxanes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Anthracyclines and taxanes are the most effective first-line and second-line treatments for
      breast cancer, although increased usage in early treatment lines can make it difficult to
      select a third-line or later treatment. This issue is further complicated by the fact that
      patients with metastatic breast cancer can become resistant to anthracyclines and taxanes.
      Thus, there are no consistent international guidelines regarding treatment in this setting.

      In China, the treatment procedures for metastatic breast cancer follow the National
      Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines, which recommend single-drug treatments for recurrent
      or metastatic disease, which typically involve anthracyclines, taxanes, vinorelbine,
      gemcitabine, capecitabine, and eribulin. However, there is no standard international
      recommendation for patients with metastatic breast cancer who have developed resistance to
      anthracyclines and taxanes, and there are limited options for third-line or later treatment
      in this setting.

      This trial aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of third-line or later irinotecan
      treatment for locally recurrent or metastatic breast cancer among Chinese patients who have
      received at least two regimens containing anthracyclines and taxanes.
