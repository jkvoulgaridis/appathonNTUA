  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project aims to evaluate a newly developed Internet-delivered (via e-learning modules)
      acceptance-based behavioral intervention (ABTi) for individuals who are experiencing weight
      regain after bariatric surgery. Specifically, the investigators aim to assess ABTi's efficacy
      on stopping and/or reversing weight by comparing it to a wait-list control (WLC) condition.
      The investigators also aim to evaluate its effect on targeted weight control behaviors and
      acceptance-based skills. Finally, the investigators will examine the relationship between
      weight outcomes and changes in process variables through exploratory analyses. Treatment
      outcomes (i.e., weight, maladaptive behaviors, physical activity, acceptance-based skills)
      will be measured at assessments pre-, mid-, and post-treatment, as well as at 3 months after
      treatment has ended.

      Primary Aims.

        1. To test the hypothesis that participants randomly assigned to ABTi will display greater
           weight loss from pre- to post-treatment than those assigned to WLC.

        2. To test the hypothesis those receiving ABTi, compared to WLC, will display decreased
           maladaptive eating behaviors (i.e., loss of control episodes, grazing, emotional eating,
           disinhibition), increased physical activity, and greater improvements in
           acceptance-based skills (i.e., mindfulness, defusion, food-related acceptance).

      Exploratory Aim.

      (1) To assess if changes in acceptance-based skills, maladaptive eating behaviors, and
      physical activity are associated with pre- to post-treatment weight outcomes.

    <description>Ten weekly modules will be delivered through an e-learning platform (i.e., Coursesites). Each module includes a video presentation of material synchronized with a slideshow illustrating session material with interactive features, and directed assignments to be completed throughout the week. At the end of every two weeks, a brief (i.e., 20 min) telephone call with a member of the study team will be scheduled to discuss and clarify the content of the session, discuss how the participant utilized skills demonstrated in the session, problem-solve difficulties in utilizing the skills, and review homework. Participants will be required to weigh themselves weekly (data will be transferred wirelessly to the laboratory) and feedback regarding weight losses will be provided during the phone call. The interventionist will provide individualized feedback on food records via email.</description>

    <intervention_name>Acceptance Based Behavioral Intervention</intervention_name>
    <description>This intervention focuses on acceptance-based strategies with an emphasis on willingness to experience less pleasurable internal experiences (e.g., pleasure from eating calorically-dense foods) and aversive internal experiences (e.g., hunger, food cravings). Strategies to increase this willingness will be taught, including defusion (i.e., getting psychological distance from internal experiences to allow oneself to act independently of them). Mindful decision-making, as it relates to eating and exercise, will also be emphasized. Clarification and commitment to core values is another key component, as living life in accordance with one's values (e.g., health) makes willingness to make difficult choices worthwhile. Standard behavioral techniques for weight loss (i.e., self-monitoring, stimulus control, psychoeducation) will also be included.</description>
