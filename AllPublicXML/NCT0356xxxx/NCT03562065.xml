  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a rare (prevalence: 40- 50/100 000 persons)
      heterogeneous auto-immune and auto-inflammatory disease (AD), affecting both sexes and all
      races, with a peak incidence / prevalence among black people and a predilection for women in
      the 3rd-4th decade of life. SLE is characterized by successive periods of flares and
      remission, which may all vary in duration and quality. Prognosis of severe forms of SLE,
      which affect lung, heart or brain in addition to renal involvement, has improved, but still
      evolution remains pejorative in a subset of patients whose 10 years mortality remains 10-15%,
      even in tertiary referral centers. For 20 years, no new prospective clinical trial in the
      course of SLE has demonstrated its effectiveness. New biological therapies have not yet made
      the long awaited breakthrough in the treatment of severe SLE and only anti-Blys monoclonal
      antibody has gained indication in moderately active SLE. In addition, serious adverse side
      effects (progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy) observed with several biologics in AD
      patients has dampened their expected benefits. For SLE subjects resistant to 1er or 2nd line
      conventional treatment, there is a need to develop more effective therapies with fewer long
      term side effects, based on new immunomodulatory and immunosuppressive strategies.

      According to their in vitro immunomodulatory properties and ability to induce tissue repair
      mechanisms, mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) have been proposed as a new therapy for several AD,
      including SLE. The use of allogeneic umbilical cord-derived MSC is based on experimental and
      human clinical data, particularly produced by Nanjing team (Pr Sun) in China. It is also
      logical to select SLE patients with the same severity criteria as those used worldwide to
      validate the efficacy of anti-Blys therapies. Similarly, the analysis of the expected results
      should take into account criteria similar or comparable to those used for the pivotal
      clinical trials. This trial is a unique opportunity to set up collaboration between
      Saint-Louis APHP, clinical expert center for cell therapy in AD, and University College
      London for cell manufacturing.
