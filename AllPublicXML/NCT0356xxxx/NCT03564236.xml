  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a disease with high morbidity and
      mortality worldwide. COPD exacerbations are the important contributor to disease
      deterioration and decrease in health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Since therapeutic
      options to treat exacerbations effectively are limited, many patients have persistent loss of
      vital functioning and suffer from frequent re-hospitalisations.

      Nasal high flow therapy (nHFT) is an innovative therapy that provides humidified and heated
      air through a nasal cannula. Although there is some preliminary evidence that nHFT is
      effective in stable COPD patients, there are no data at all regarding the effectiveness of
      nHFT in COPD exacerbations. A key problem in the implementation of nHFT is that the
      underlying working mechanisms are not clear and therefore the appropriate way to apply nHFT
      is unknown.

      Objective: The aim of the present study is to prove efficacy of nHFT in enhancing recovery
      from COPD exacerbations. We aim to improve the effectiveness of nHFT by developing new
      technologies to control and monitor the effect of nHFT and by providing background for
      optimal settings of nHFT.

      Study design: The study will be designed as a multicentre randomised controlled trial, with
      the University Medical Center Groningen, the &quot;Medisch Spectrum Twente&quot;, &quot;Albert Schweizer
      ziekenhuis&quot;, Rijnstate hospital, and the University of Twente, collaborating.

      Study population: One hundred thirty-six patients with known COPD GOLD stage II to IV and
      hypoxemic respiratory failure hospitalised with a COPD exacerbation will be included.

      Intervention (if applicable): Patients will be randomised to standard care or nHFT (≥ 6
      hours/day) during hospitalisation and the 90 days after discharge, as added to standard care.

      Main study parameters/endpoints: The primary outcome will be improvement in HRQoL after 90
      days.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be a parallel group 2-arms non blinded multicentre 2-phase randomised
      controlled trial comparing the effect of nHFT on subjective recovery in COPD patients
      admitted to the hospital for a COPD exacerbation as compared to the standard care. First, we
      will define the optimal setting and gain more insight in insight in mechanisms why and how
      nHFT might work in a subpopulation, then continuing with inclusion in the randomized
      controlled trial including the 136 patients in total to prove efficacy in terms of
      patient-centered outcomes. To get more insight in mechanisms why and how nHFT might work we
      incorporate: a) neuromechanical investigations and analyses; and b) anatomical
      investigations, both in patients and in experimental models, the latter in order to minimise
      patient effort.

    <time_frame>90 days</time_frame>
    <description>Subjective recovery during hospitalisation and thereafter will also be investigated by assessing the Severe Respiratory Insufficiency Questionnaire (SRI). This is a well-known and validated Health-Related quality of Life (HRQoL) questionnaire especially designed for patients with chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure containing 49 items measuring 7 conceptual domains of HRQoL: respiratory complaints, physical functioning, attendant symptoms and sleep, social relationships, anxiety, psychological well-being and social functioning, and a summary score. The domain scores are calculated by transforming the mean item score into a percentage ranging from 0 (most severely depressed health status as complaints/limitations are severe) to 100 (perfect health status with no complaints/limitations).</description>

    <measure>Clinical COPD Questionnaire (CCQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>90 days</time_frame>
    <description>Subjective recovery during hospitalisation and thereafter will be also investigated by assessing the Clinical COPD Questionnaire (CCQ). The CCQ is a disease specific but not &quot;respiratory failure&quot; specific questionnaire. It is a 10-item, self-administered questionnaire that can be completed in less than 2 minutes, and as so, is an attractive measure to be performed repeatedly during an exacerbation. Items are divided into three domains: symptom, functional state and mental state; patients are required to respond to each item on a seven-point Likert scale where 0 = asymptomatic/no limitation and 6 = extremely symptomatic/total limitation. The final score is the mean of all ten items, and scores for the three domains can be calculated separately if required.</description>

    <measure>Euroqual-5 Dimensions questionnaire (EQ-5D)</measure>
    <time_frame>90 days</time_frame>
    <description>Subjective recovery during hospitalisation and thereafter will also be investigated by assessing the EQ-5D. The EQ-5D questionnaire is made up for two components; health state description and evaluation. In description part, health status is measured in terms of five dimensions (5D); mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. The respondents self-rate their level of severity for each dimension using five-level (EQ-5D-5L) scale.
In evaluation part, the respondents evaluate their overall health status using the visual analogue scale (EQ-VAS), ranging from 0 to 100.
EQ-5D-5L health states, defined by the EQ-5D-5L descriptive system, will be converted in index values, facilitating the calculation of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) that are used to inform economic evaluations of health care interventions, according to the guideline (https://euroqol.org).</description>

    <measure>Cough and Sputum Assessment Questionnaire (CASA-Q)</measure>
    <time_frame>90 days</time_frame>
    <description>Subjective recovery during hospitalisation and thereafter will also be investigated by assessing the Cough and Sputum Assessment Questionnaire (CASA-Q). CASA-Q score is a tool for evaluating cough and sputum and their impact on patient's QOL in COPD. CASA-Q consists of two cough domains; the cough symptom domain (COUS, 11 items) and the cough impact domain (COUI, 8 items), and two sputum domains; the sputum symptom domain (SPUS, 3 items) and the sputum impact domain (SPUI, 16 items). All items will be scored from 0 to 4, such that the score was 0-12 for COUS and SPUS, and 0 to 24 for SPUI, and 0 to 32 for COUI, and each item summed and rescaled using the following algorithm: (sum rescored items)/(range of rescored item sum) x 100 (%). This results in CASA-Q scores that range from 0 to 100, with higher score associated with fewer symptoms and less impact due to cough and sputum.</description>

    <description>In addition to the standard care described above, patients in the intervention group will be treated with:
nHFT, set at 30-50 L/min flow with oxygen to achieve an adequate oxygen saturation. nHFT is prescribed for at least 6 hours, but patients are stimulated to use the device as much as possible during the hospital stay.
During periods without HFT through a standard low flow system, to maintain an adequate arterial oxygen saturation (Sa,O2) (between 90-92% if patients are concomitantly hypercapnic, and between 90-95% if patients are normocapnic). Flow rates are titrated accordingly.
After discharge patients in the nHFT arm will continue the prescribed therapy at home for 90 subsequent days.</description>

    <intervention_name>Nasal High Flow Therapy</intervention_name>
    <description>Nasal High Flow Therapy (nHFT) is an innovative therapy for patients with respiratory diseases. It supplies heated, humidified, and oxygen-enriched air at high flow rates through a nasal cannula. Because the air is provided through an open system with a nasal cannula, it is relatively easy to apply and suggested to be very comfortable for patients. The technique has been shown to be effective in the treatment of hypoxemic respiratory failure, mainly in neonates[2] and patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure on intensive care units (ICU).[3]</description>
