  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The relationship between the target effect site concentration of remifentanil and the pupil
      diameter and reactivity in response to a standard noxious stimulus in cardiac surgery during
      extra corporeal circulation will be evaluated.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Anaesthesia will be induced with propofol to obtain loss of consciousness LOC in 30 patients
      who will undergo cardiac surgery requiring extracorporeal circulation and standardized
      support will be given to them till the extracorporeal circulation period. Thereafter,
      remifentanil will be titrated by increments of 0,5, from 1 up to 5 ng ml-1 during the extra
      corporeal circulation period. In the awake state, at LOC and at each plateau level of
      remifentanil CeT, mean arterial pressure, and BIS will be recorded. Pupil size and dilatation
      after a 60 mA, 100 Hz tetanic stimulation will be measured at LOC and at each plateau level
      of remifentanil.
