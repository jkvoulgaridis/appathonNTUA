  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Today the Whipple procedure is the preferred operation for malignancy in the pancreas. In
      abdominal surgery this procedure is known for its high surgical stress-response in the
      patient, which has been attempted to be resolved with the introduction of preoperative
      high-dose steroids and goal-directed fluid therapy (GDT). Despite this effort, complications
      still occur regularly (30%) in the first weeks after the operation here at Rigshospitalet.
      Therefore there is still a challenge in the patients who have undergone the Whipple procedure
      in the acute postoperative phase. This shows in for example at Rigshospitalet, where 50% of
      the patients continue to be in the need of vasoactive medication the morning after the
      operation.

      Nevertheless, no studies have in detail described the acute (&lt;24h) postoperative phase. There
      is also an importance in the fact that there is often no description or control over other
      important factors, for example medicine with influence on the circulatory system, fluid
      treatment and response to this etc..

      The purpose of this study is to investigate what issues or complications, in particular those
      of circulatory matter that occurs in this particular group of patients 24 hours after the
      operation. Furthermore there is lacking a description of which cause-response- link there can
      be between early and later (30 days) complications, as well as when each of these
      complications occur. Therefore, there will also be collected data on complications within the
      first 30 days after the operation for the purpose of a later secondary publication with the
      same authors.
