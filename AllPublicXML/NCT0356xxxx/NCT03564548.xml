  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breakthrough cancer pain (BTcP) is a rapid onset, high intensity and short duration pain
      episode, which takes place within stable background pain control. It significantly affects
      the quality of life of patients with cancer and their ability to function normally. Rapid
      onset opioids and immediate-release oral opioids (morphine sulfate) are the standard
      treatment for BTcP. Because of the limited availability, high cost, complicated titration and
      the high risks of overdosing with rapid-onset opioids, most often the preferred choice of
      treatment is immediate-release oral opioids. However, this approach might not always offer
      optimal speed for onset of action and duration to match the rapid nature of an episode of
      BTcP. In order to seek a potential alternative to immediate-release oral opioids, we are
      proposing to test the onset of action of PPP011 to rapidly alleviate breakthrough pain in
      patients with cancer. We will also examine the safety and the efficacy on pain intensity of
      PPP011 within this population, for four weeks or longer administration.

      This is a pilot study that will be conducted at the Hassman Research Institute. It consists
      of two sub-studies; Sub-study A will be completed and analyzed prior to starting Sub-study B:

        1. Sub-study A is an open-label crossover comparison study: This will be a 12-week
           open-label randomized study to evaluate the effect of inhaled PPP011 as compared to
           morphine sulfate to improve fast onset of pain relief of BTcP. After proper screening
           and verified inclusion/exclusion criteria, 20 consecutive subjects will be recruited to
           participate in Sub-study A.

        2. Sub-study B is a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial: This will be a 7-week
           study to evaluate the effect of inhaled PPP011 or morphine sulfate to improve onset of
           pain relief when compared to placebo in subjects with BTcP. After proper screening and
           verified inclusion/exclusion criteria, 40 consecutive subjects will be recruited
           prospectively to participate in this trial. The same inclusion/exclusion criteria of the
           open-label study will be applied. The subjects recruited for this study will be
           different from those recruited for the open-label study.
