  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recently, new clinical testing of saccular and utricular function have been developed and
      validated, the so-called vestibular-evoked myogenic potentials - VEMP (Brantberg et al. 2009,
      Cornell et al. 2009, Curthoys 2010, Manzari et al. 2012). Among them, the cervical VEMP
      (cVEMP) are short-latency electromyographic (EMG) modulations of the contracted
      sternocleidomastoid muscles in responses to vibration applied on the forehead. The clinical
      literature suggests that cVEMP are almost entirely saccular in origin (Halmagyi et al 1995).

      The aim of our research is to evaluate changes in the otolith function in microgravity and
      hypergravity using this clinical test. Cervical vestibular-evoked myogenic potentials (cVEMP)
      will be recorded by surface EMG electrodes in response to bone conducted vibration to
      specifically assess saccular function (Halmagyi et al 1995). The primary measures will
      include muscle activity response amplitudes and the stimulus intensity threshold at which the
      cVEMP is detected.

      Given that there is an off-loading of the saccules in microgravity and an increased loading
      in hypergravity, we hypothesize that there will be a reduction in cVEMP amplitude in
      microgravity and an increase in cVEMP amplitude in hypregravity compared to normal gravity.
      These changes in amplitude will be accompanied by changes in the threshold of the stimulus
      level required to elicit a cVEMP.
