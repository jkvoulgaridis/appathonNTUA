      This study investigates the effect of high-intense aerobe exercise training (HIIT) and aerobe
      exercise of low intensity on clinical and physiological parameters (anxiety, activity,
      cortisol, alpha amylase, heart rate, heart rate variability, spiroergometry) in patients with
      Music Performance Anxiety (MPA). Half of the patients will receive HIIT, while the other half
      will receive aerobe exercise of low intensity.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, 20 patients with MPA will receive a high-intensive aerobe training (HIIT, 6
      HIIT-sessions of 20 minutes within a period of 12 days). Additionally, 20 MPA-patients will
      undergo a less intense aerobe training matched regarding frequency and duration of sessions.
      Prior to the first training session, after completing the training (day 12) and 10 days after
      the Training (day 22), symptoms of anxiety and will be assessed by using questionnaires.
      Moreover, heart rate and heart rate variability will be obtained and activity level is
      measured using accelerometers. Before and after the training there will be an assessment of
      saliva samples for measuring cortisol and alpha amylase.

      Furthermore, a standardized performance situation is established before and after the
      Training. Before, during and after the performance anxiety ratings, cortisol, alpha amylase,
      heart rate and heart rate variability are assessed.

      The investigators hypothesize, that patients with MPA which undergo HIIT, will show a
      stronger and more sustained improvement of both, clinical symptoms and physiological
      measures. Specifically, a decreased heart rate, higher heart rate variability and decreased
      endocrinological parameters.
