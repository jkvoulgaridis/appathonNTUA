    <textblock>
      Background: Persistent gastrointestinal symptoms have been described in patients who are
      considered in remission of their inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). These symptoms, attributed
      to Functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGID) in IBD, may have a significant impact of
      quality of life, and may be associated with fatigue, anxiety and depression. There is very
      little data regarding pediatric specificities of these FGID.

      Aims: The aim of the study is to evaluate the prevalence of FGID in pediatric patients with
      IBD in remission. Secondary aims are to investigate a possible association of FGID with
      fatigue, anxiety, depression and impacted quality of life in the patients, as well as anxiety
      and depression in the parents.

      Methods: This will be an observational, case-control study. All patients between 9 and 18
      years old , with IBD in remission will be invited to participate. Questionnaires will be
      web-based and will evaluate: presence of FGID (Fr-qPGS), fatigue (FACIT-F), anxiety
      (SCARED-R), depression (CDI), quality of life (IMPACT-III). Parents will be invited to fill
      in web-based questionnaires on their symptoms of anxiety (STAI/Y-A and STAI/Y-B) and
      depression (BDI). Clinical parameters will be retrieved retrospectively from the chart. Level
      of remission will be confirmed by most recent blood tests and fecal calprotectin. Patients
      with FGID will be compared to patients without FGID in terms of clinical characteristics,
      disease phenotype and associated psychological comorbidities.

        In the aim of recruiting a sample that will be the most representative possible of the
        population of pediatric IBD patients in remission in France, patients will be recruited for
        the study through different procedures:

          -  either during a routine visit to the pediatric gastroenterology clinic (all French
             pediatric gastroenterology clinics will be study centers)

          -  or during a routine visit to the adult gastroenterology clinic (the French adult
             gastroenterologists will be informed of the study and will be able to apply to be a
             study center)

          -  finally, the patient will be able to find information on the study through the French
             IBD patient Foundation (association Francois Aupetit) and contact the investigators in
             order to participate.
