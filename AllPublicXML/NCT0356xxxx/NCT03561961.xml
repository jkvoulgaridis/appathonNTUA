      Aim: The aim of the study is to compare the efficacy with SBRT and moderate
      hypo-fractionation in high risk and node positive prostate cancer

      PRIMARY STUDY OBJECTIVES: To assess whether extreme hypo-fractionation with SBRT in high risk
      prostate cancer is non inferior to moderately hypo-fractionated standard radiotherapy

      STUDY DESIGN: Two arm, Prospective Randomized Trial with a non-inferiority design

      TREATMENT REGIMEN: Arm 1-[standard arm] Moderate hypo-fractionated RT, total dose of 66-68
      Gray(Gy) in 25# to the primary over 5 weeks, with treatment being delivered daily. Patients
      with node positive disease will receive a dose of 50 Gy in 25# to the pelvic nodes.Boost to
      gross nodal disease will be considered based on the response to hormonal therapy to a dose of
      60-66 Gy/25# as a simultaneous integrated boost (SIB). An option of equivalent biological
      dose using 60-62.5 Gy in 20# may be allowed for multi-centric accrual in the future.

      Arm 2 -[Experimental Arm] Extreme hypo-fractionation with SBRT,course of 5 fractions of
      radiation; each of size 7-7.25 Gy. The total dose will be 35-36.5 Gy. Patients with node
      positive disease will receive a dose of 25 Gy in 5 # to the pelvic nodes. The 5 treatments
      will be scheduled to be delivered alternate day over approximately 7-10 days. An option of
      equivalent biological dose using 35-36.5 Gy in 5 weekly fractions may be allowed for
      multicentric accrual in the future.

      RECRUITMENT TARGET: 434 total (217 patients experimental arm and 217 patients standard arm)
      recruitment over 6 years, with a non-fixed follow up period and a uniform accrual rate.

      PRIMARY ENDPOINT To assess the 4 year Biochemical Failure free Survival (BFFS) between the
      two arms.

      Follow-up At 3-6 weeks from end of radiotherapy, followed by 3-6 monthly for the first two
      years and 6 monthly thereafter.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The standard duration of treatment with radiotherapy is 8 weeks in conventional
      fractionation; 5-6 weeks with moderate hypo-fractionation, while it is only 1- 2 weeks with
      extreme hypo-fractionation (SBRT).The health costs and out of pocket expenditure involved in
      the conventional hypo-fractionated radiotherapy treatment largely depends on the overall
      treatment duration. This involves expenditure not only for the patient but also the
      caretaker. Moreover most of these patients presenting to a tertiary care centre from
      different parts of the country, have logistic issues of accommodation, food, travel along
      with the treatment costs. Also for patients staying away from family, 5 weeks treatment
      without considerable family support has a psychological impact, especially on elderly group
      of patients commonly seen with prostate cancer.This further leads to a major cause of
      distress among these patients, especially in a resource limited setting as ours.

      Extreme hypo-fractionation with a total duration of 2 weeks, would offer an opportunity to
      optimize the therapeutic ratio taking advantage of the potential therapeutic gain due to low
      alpha/beta for prostate to higher dose/fraction(compared to surrounding organs at risk).
      Moreover, shortened overall treatment time,would lead to less distressing and early
      recommencement of their daily activities for the patients,with an obvious impact in improving
      the quality of life and health costs.

      Given the potential positive economic impact with shorter duration treatment with similar
      clinical outcomes and probable similar toxicity profile, SBRT (extreme hypo-fractionation) in
      prostate cancer is an attractive treatment option, especially in a limited-resource setting
      and can have a large and positive impact on the patient care.
