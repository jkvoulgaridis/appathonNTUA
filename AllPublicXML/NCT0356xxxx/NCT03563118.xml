  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a highly prevalent breathing disorder in sleep. We have
      aimed to evaluate the relationship between OSA and prolidase activity, the oxidative stress
      index (OSI), total antioxidative capacity (TAC), and total oxidative capacity (TOC) and the
      relationship between carotid intima media thickness (CIMT).

      This study was approved by the local ethics committee in accordance with the Helsinki
      Declaration. Written informed consent was received from the OSAS Subjects patients and
      control subjects before enrolment in the study. The patient and control cohorts were
      recruited from the Pulmonary Medicine Department, Medical Faculty, Yuzuncu Yıl University.
      Blood samples were analysed at the Biochemistry Laboratory of Harran University Medical
      Faculty TAC and TOS levels were measured by using an automated measurement method. TAC
      measurement method involves the production of a potent biological hydroxyl radical. Ferrous
      ion solution is mixed with hydrogen peroxide. Thus, it is possible to measure the
      anti-oxidative effect of the sample against the potent free radical reactions initiated by
      the production of the hydroxyl radical. TOS method is based on the oxidation of ferrous ion
      to ferric ion in the presence of various oxidant species in acidic medium and the measurement
      of the ferric ion by xylenol orange. mmol Trolox equivalent (equiv)/L, mmol H2O2 /L and
      mg/dL, respectively.

    <description>Prolidase activity was determined by a photometric method based on the measurement of the proline levels produced by prolidase (26). Plasma samples (100ml) were blended with 100 ml of serum physiological. A total of 25 ml of the mixture was preincubated with 75ml of the preincubation solution (50 mmol/l Tris HCl buffer pH 7.0 containing 1mmol/l glutathion, 50mmol/l MnCl2) at 37˚C for 30min.</description>
