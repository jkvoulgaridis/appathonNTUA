  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Evidence is emerging that those patients with cyanotic pathologies may be more vulnerable to
      end-organ injury during and after surgery than those patients without, because of compromised
      cardiopulmonary performances or the proinflammatory state that follows conventional hyperoxic
      cardiopulmonary bypass.

      Several clinical and basic studies have identified that controlled oxygenation during the
      initiation of bypass significantly improved the cardiac adaptation and remodeling capacity
      than hyperoxic oxygenation strategy among cyanotic patients undergoing tetralogy of Fallot
      repair, as evidenced by these reduced myocardial gene expression profiles associated with
      reoxygenation injury.

      The investigators designed the reoxygenation for pediatric cardiac surgery study to
      investigate the effect of reoxygenation during cardiopulmonary bypass on clinical outcomes in
      patients with cyanotic congenital heart disease .
