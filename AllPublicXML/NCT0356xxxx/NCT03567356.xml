    <textblock>
      To test the feasibility and acceptability of a novel approach for improving the delivery and
      effectiveness of XRNTX treatment for opioid use disorder (OUD) - the MAT-PLUS intervention.
      The components of the MAT-PLUS intervention are: XRNTX, initiated during an episode of
      inpatient/residential treatment and dosed monthly, provides opioid receptor blockade, relapse
      prevention and overdose prevention; Significant other engagement empowers family members or
      other designated concerned others, providing concrete guidance for monitoring, supervision,
      and improving adherence for their loved one in treatment; Assertive outreach incorporates
      frequent multi-channel outreach, in a model that specifically targets engagement and
      motivation for medication adherence; Counselor care coordination and case management focused
      on medication management and adherence. This objective #1 will be accomplished by conducting
      a small-scale, 2-arm, open label, RCT pilot study of 4 months of treatment with the MAT-PLUS
      intervention (significant other engagement and training, medication care coordination by
      counselors, assertive outreach) + TAU (monthly doses of XRNTX + routine counseling), vs TAU
      for n=40 (20 per arm) patients with OUD. Adult patients ages 18+ who receive an initial dose
      of XRNTX during an index episode of inpatient/residential/detox treatment for opioid
      addiction at a public-sector community treatment program treatment, with intention to
      continue in outpatient treatment. The experimental arm will receive the MAT-PLUS intervention
      for 4 months of ongoing outpatient treatment with XRNTX. The control arm will receive 4
      months of standard TAU (XRNTX + clinic-based counseling) without MAT-PLUS. At the beginning
      of the trial an additional small (N = 4 or 5) group of test patients will receive the
      MAT-PLUS intervention to test and refine the study procedures.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Residential detox is an ideal opportunity for initiation of relapse prevention medication,
      particularly XRNTX, which requires some delay after recent opioid use. But concerns from the
      field emphasize barriers to induction (as highlighted by the recent results of the CTN51 XBOT
      study), poor adherence and retention. Clarification is needed on optimal delivery, including
      a psychosocial treatment platform that is focused more specifically on medication adherence
      through engagement and empowerment of significant others, and through training and
      supervision of counselors. Adherence in non-research conditions has been a barrier. To
      address these gaps, it is proposed this robust intervention, incorporating XRNTX into a
      multi-component model of care emphasizing adherence enhancement. Assertive outreach is a
      well-described intervention that is effective in chronic illness, eg in the Assertive
      Community Treatment (ACT) model for serious and persistent mental illness, and the Integrated
      Dual Disorder Treatment (IDDT) model for co-occurring disorders. Significant other
      involvement is a well-established method of improving adherence (e.g. in Network Therapy and
      Community Reinforcement Approach and Family Training). Significant other involvement is also
      built into the standard Medication Management model (used in XBOT,COMBINE and others) but it
      has not been actually used in most implementations. Finally, the use of counselors to drive
      medication adherence takes advantage of the typically greater contact and alliance that
      counselors have with patients compared to medical staff.

      Several adherence enhancement components are combined synergistically: XRNTX, initiated
      during residential treatment and dosed monthly; significant other engagement empowers
      caregivers, providing guidance for encouragement, monitoring and supervision of medication
      adherence; Assertive outreach incorporates frequent multi-channel contact, case management;
      Counselor role clarification, training and supervision provides a clear focus on medication
      adherence.

      Primary outcome for this objective is # of doses of XRNTX received within the planned 4
      months duration of outpatient treatment. The primary analysis will be a comparison of the
      mean # of doses in the intervention compared to the control group. Additional analyses will
      include comparisons of % of subjects receiving all 4 doses, % of subjects receiving at least
      1 dose as outpatients as a demonstration of linkage from inpatient to outpatient treatment.

      Secondary outcomes for this feasibility objective include process outcomes for feasibility
      and acceptability, including: # and type of outreach attempts (phone call, email, text,
      facebook message, etc) and successful contacts with patients and significant others,
      utilization of TAU counseling, rates of return to treatment after dropout. Lastly,
      assessments of satisfaction and significant other involvement will be obtained through focus
      groups conducted separately with patients and significant others to assess qualitative
      acceptability factors, both barriers and facilitators to success.
