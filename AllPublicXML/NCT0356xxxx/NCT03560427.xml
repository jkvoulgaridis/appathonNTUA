  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Duloxetine is a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor primarily used for treatment of
      major depression and anxiety. Duloxetine also has been used in the treatment of chronic pain
      conditions, such as osteoarthritis and musculoskeletal pain. There are few studies examining
      its effect for acute pain. The objective of this study is to evaluate the analgesic effect of
      duloxetine combined with intrathecal morphine for patients subjected to major abdominal
      cancer surgery

    <description>Patients will receive duloxetine, 60 mg tablet 2 hour before operation and will be anesthetized by combined spinal-general anesthesia that includes: spinal anesthesia with morphine 0.3 mg delivered in L4-5 inter spinous space.
General anethseia: Induction of anesthesia was done by intravenous fentanyl, 2 µg / kg and propofol 1 - 2 mg / kg. Endotracheal intubation was achieved by cis-atracurium, 0.15 mg / kg. Maintenance of anesthesia was done by isoflurane and cis-atracurium, 0.03 mg / kg on demand. Additional intraoperative analgesia was consisted of administration of intravenous boluses of fentanyl, 50 µg according to the attending anesthesiologist's decision. At the end of surgery, muscle relaxation was reversed using neostigmine 0.05 mg / kg and atropine 0.01 mg / kg.</description>
