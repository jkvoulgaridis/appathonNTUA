  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the study is to compare the bioavailability of a generic product of
      paracetamol (immediate-release) with that of a reference product when administered to healthy
      volunteers under fasting condition. The test product is Fortolin Tab 500mg manufactured by
      Fortune Pharmacal Co. Ltd., and the reference product is Panadol Caplet 500mg manufactured by
      GlaxoSmithKline (Dungarvan) Ltd. The plasma pharmacokinetic data of paracetamol obtained from
      two formulations will be used to evaluate the interchangeability of the products.
