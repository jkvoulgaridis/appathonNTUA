  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Digital medicine systems (DMS) have been designed to assist individuals with the management
      of their daily health, wellness, and medication use. The DMS is being developed as a
      healthcare management tool to precisely measure medication adherence and to potentially
      enhance adherence.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The advancements in the treatment of mental health patients with DMS will enable healthcare
      professionals to assess suboptimal adherence and make more informed treatment decisions. In
      addition to these improvements, it will also provide a platform for engagement between
      participants, healthcare professionals, and caregivers/support persons.

      Participants who entered the trial were treated with one of the oral atypical antipsychotics
      defined in the trial (aripiprazole, olanzapine, quetiapine, or risperidone [though no
      participant took risperidone in this trial]). The treatment medication decision was
      determined by the healthcare professionals.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage Of Days With Good Patch Coverage</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The DMS includes a drug-device combination of a CoE product, a wearable sensor patch, and application software (smartphone) to record activity and rest and mark events through the act of ingestion. The CoE product consists of an approved antipsychotic medication enclosed with an Ingestible Sensor Pill (miniature ingestible event marker in tablet [MIT]). The sensor patch detects and records each MIT ingestion, as well as other physiologic and behavioral data. Good patch coverage for a specific day was defined as having either at least 80% patch data available (80% of the day the patch was worn and data was collected as noted via the accelerometer channel) or the MIT was detected within the 24-hour period, for each day while the participant was in the trial. The percentage of days was calculated as the number of days with good patch coverage divided by the total number of trial days for each participant. Descriptive statistics were performed for this outcome measure.</description>

    <description>The DMS includes a drug-device combination of a CoE product, a wearable sensor patch, and application software (smartphone) to record activity and rest and mark events through the act of ingestion. The CoE product consists of an approved antipsychotic medication enclosed with an Ingestible Sensor Pill (MIT). The sensor patch detects and records each MIT ingestion, as well as other physiologic and behavioral data. Participant adherence was measured as the detected MITs over the expected MITs ingested during the trial days with good patch coverage. The more the participant successfully engaged in a number of processes across the 8-week trial, the greater the measured adherence. Descriptive statistics were performed for this outcome measure.</description>

        <title>Percentage Of Days With Good Patch Coverage</title>
        <description>The DMS includes a drug-device combination of a CoE product, a wearable sensor patch, and application software (smartphone) to record activity and rest and mark events through the act of ingestion. The CoE product consists of an approved antipsychotic medication enclosed with an Ingestible Sensor Pill (miniature ingestible event marker in tablet [MIT]). The sensor patch detects and records each MIT ingestion, as well as other physiologic and behavioral data. Good patch coverage for a specific day was defined as having either at least 80% patch data available (80% of the day the patch was worn and data was collected as noted via the accelerometer channel) or the MIT was detected within the 24-hour period, for each day while the participant was in the trial. The percentage of days was calculated as the number of days with good patch coverage divided by the total number of trial days for each participant. Descriptive statistics were performed for this outcome measure.</description>

        <title>Participant Adherence</title>
        <description>The DMS includes a drug-device combination of a CoE product, a wearable sensor patch, and application software (smartphone) to record activity and rest and mark events through the act of ingestion. The CoE product consists of an approved antipsychotic medication enclosed with an Ingestible Sensor Pill (MIT). The sensor patch detects and records each MIT ingestion, as well as other physiologic and behavioral data. Participant adherence was measured as the detected MITs over the expected MITs ingested during the trial days with good patch coverage. The more the participant successfully engaged in a number of processes across the 8-week trial, the greater the measured adherence. Descriptive statistics were performed for this outcome measure.</description>

            <description>Participants had a confirmed clinical diagnosis of first episode psychosis using case note review. The duration of illness was defined as less than 3 years since presentation to the mental health team or first antipsychotic prescription. Participants were treated with at least 1 CoE oral atypical antipsychotic tablet (aripiprazole, olanzapine, or quetiapine), wearing the DMS patch, and using the associated smartphone app for a total of 8 weeks. The treatment medication decision was determined by the HCP.</description>

          <title>Participant Adherence</title>
          <description>The DMS includes a drug-device combination of a CoE product, a wearable sensor patch, and application software (smartphone) to record activity and rest and mark events through the act of ingestion. The CoE product consists of an approved antipsychotic medication enclosed with an Ingestible Sensor Pill (MIT). The sensor patch detects and records each MIT ingestion, as well as other physiologic and behavioral data. Participant adherence was measured as the detected MITs over the expected MITs ingested during the trial days with good patch coverage. The more the participant successfully engaged in a number of processes across the 8-week trial, the greater the measured adherence. Descriptive statistics were performed for this outcome measure.</description>
