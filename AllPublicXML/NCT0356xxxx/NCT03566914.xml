      This study will be conducted into two parts 1) Screening of 400 cases of cirrhosis (Child
      A,child B and child c) for the prevalence and risk factors of erectile dysfunction in
      cirrhosis.2) The part 2 is RCT as follows where 70 cases in each arm will be taken wuth child
      A and child B cirrhosis for the effect of treatment on erectile dysfunction (Tadalafil vs
      Placebo).

      After getting informed consent. Clinical, anthropometric and biochemical assessment will be
      done by candidate, co-supervisors and supervisor. Screening and selection criteria by using
      various questionnaire like Karnofsky Performance Score (KPS) , IIEF Questionnaire , ADAMS
      Questionnaire, Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7 (GAD-7) questionnaire, Patient Health
      Questionnaire (PHQ-9 for depression ; and SF-36 questionnaire).

      The informed consent will be obtained from the participants in the study. Patients-ED IIEF&lt;25
      will be included as per inclusion and exclusion criteria. Tadalfil regimen: 10 mg daily at
      any time before anticipated sexual activity on days with anticipated sexual activity On days
      with no anticipated sexual activity: 10 mg daily at night after meals. Follow-up1 week,
      2weeks, 4weeks, 12 weeks with history, clinical examination and laboratory test.
