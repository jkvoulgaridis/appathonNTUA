  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of postoperative
      intravenous ferric carboxymaltose in patients with anemia undergoing Simultaneous Bilateral
      Total knee replacement in terms of Quality of life (QOL) and objective measures (Hemoglobin
      and Iron parameters).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Both preoperative and postoperative anaemia are common in patients undergoing total knee
      arthroplasty. Allogeneic RBC (red blood cell) transfusion and anaemia are related with higher
      postoperative mortality and morbidity. It is important to have a strategy of patient blood
      management.

      Hb(hemoglobin) level of 10 g/dl will be used as a cut-off value for our study. In
      postoperative period in total knee arthroplasty for osteoarthritis, consented patients with
      postoperative anemia will be administered Ferinject® or placebo (normal saline) based on the
      results of randomization.

      Study Group: Ferinject® administration as IV drip infusion or undiluted bolus injection with
      a minimum administration time of 15minutes (for 1000mg(milligram) single administration) for
      body weight ≥50 Kg (kilogram) or 6 minutes (for 500mg(milligram) single administration) for
      body weight &lt; 50Kg( kilogram) .

      Control Group: Placebo in the form of normal saline administration as same time period as
      equivalent Ferinject® administration. IV drip infusion or undiluted bolus injection with a
      minimum administration time of 15 minutes (200mL(milliliter) as infusion or 20mL(milliliter)
      as bolus injection) for body weight ≥50 Kg ( kilogram) or 6 minutes (100mL normal as infusion
      or 10mL(milliliter) as bolus injection) for body weight &lt;50 Kg (kilogram).
