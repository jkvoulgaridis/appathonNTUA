      Background: Proper selection of anesthetic technique is important in middle ear microsurgery.
      Controlled hypotension in ear surgery decreases blood loss with improved quality of the
      surgical field, however, it is associated with resistance to vasodilators and delayed
      recovery from anesthesia. The use of local anesthetic technique alone in middle ear surgery
      decreases bleeding and reduces postoperative pain, however, pain on injection, noise, and
      head‑neck position had been reported with the increased risk of patient injuries.

      This study aimed to compare the effects of local ear block combined with general anesthesia
      versus general anesthesia alone, regarding intraoperative hemodynamics, anesthetic
      consumption, recovery characteristics, postoperative pain, adverse effects and postoperative
      complications.

      Eighty adult patients undergoing middle ear surgery (tympanoplasty with or without
      mastoidectomy) were enrolled in the study. Patients were randomized into two equal groups (40
      patients each). A standardized general anesthetic technique was used in both groups. Group I,
      received general anesthesia combined with ear block using 10 ml of 0.25% bupivacaine and
      (Group II), received general anesthesia alone combined with ear block using 10 ml saline.
      Propofol 2-3 mg /Kg was administered to induce anesthesia, which was maintained using
      isoflurane. Hemodynamic variables, surgical conditions including the quality of the operative
      field, intraoperative fentanyl, vasodilators (propranolol and nitroglycerine), isoflurane
      consumption, recovery time, postoperative pain, total analgesics consumption and
      postoperative complications were recorded

    <masking_description>The same surgeons performed all the operations to ensure consistency in the estimation of the surgical field. To eliminate the observer bias, the observing anesthetist did not attend the induction of block. Also, the operating surgeon was blinded to the pharmacological treatments, anesthesia and performance of the used techniques.</masking_description>
