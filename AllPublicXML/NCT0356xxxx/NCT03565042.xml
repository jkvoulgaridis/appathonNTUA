    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the mechanism of action on target tissue level of
      ustekinumab treatment in psoriatic arthritis patients.

      Patients who are planning to start treatment with anti-p40 therapy (ustekinumab) will be
      included in the trial.

      At week 0, 12 and 24 peripheral blood, synovial tissue and skin will be obtained and analysed
      with different techniques to assess the effect of the therapy on inflammatory pathways.

      Rationale:

      The overall aim of the study is to determine which downstream cellular and molecular pathways
      involved in psoriatic arthritis (PsA) pathogenesis are modulated by Interleukine
      23/Interleukine12 P40 subunit (IL23/12 P40) blockade. As we have ample evidence that relevant
      disease-specific pathways are found in the primary target tissues, in particular in synovial
      tissue obtained from peripheral joints, but not in peripheral blood, we will strongly focus
      on this compartment by obtaining paired biopsies before and after treatment.

      Objectives:

      The primary objective is to assess the effect of IL23/12 P40 blockade on cellular en
      molecular pathways involved in PsA disease in the synovium, in the synovial fluid and
      peripheral blood.

      The secondary objective is to compare which cellular/molecular disease pathways are affected
      by IL23/12 P40 blockade and not by tumour necrosis factor (TNF) blockade and thereby identify
      molecular biomarkers which may help to determine which patients may benefit from this
      treatment in comparison with anti-TNF treatment.

      Study design:

      Single centre, 24-week open-label study in subjects with clinically active peripheral
      psoriatic arthritis receiving treatment with ustekinumab.

      Synovial biopsies will be obtained from patients before and after 12 and 24 weeks of
      treatment with ustekinumab.

      Study population:

      Patients with a diagnosis of psoriatic arthritis according to the Classification Criteria for
      Psoriatic Arthritis (CASPAR) criteria with at least one swollen knee or ankle joint who are
      planning to receive treatment with ustekinumab at the outpatient clinic. In total 16 patients
      will be included.

      Intervention: Blood withdrawal and mini-arthroscopies at different timepoints.

      Main study parameters/endpoints:

      Primary study parameters/outcome of the study:

      • Changes in the synovial cellular infiltrate and molecular pathways influenced between
      baseline and week 12/ week24

      Secondary study parameters/outcome of the study:

      • Comparison of the synovial molecular changes induced by anti-p40 with the changes induced
      by anti-TNF (analysed in historical samples in a similar patient population and study
      setting)
