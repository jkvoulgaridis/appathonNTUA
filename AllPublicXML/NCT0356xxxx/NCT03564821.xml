  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is studying a drug as a possible treatment for IDH1-mutant myeloid
      neoplasms.

      -The drug involved in this study is ivosidenib (AG-120)

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a Phase I clinical trial, which tests the safety of an investigational
      drug and also tries to define the appropriate dose of the investigational drug to use for
      further studies. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the drug is being studied.

      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved ivosidenib as a treatment
      for any disease.

      Ivosidenib is an inhibitor of the protein IDH1. Ivosidenib is currently being studied as a
      treatment for myeloid cancers like acute myeloid leukemia or myelodysplastic syndromes with
      an IDH1 mutation. This study is examining whether or not ivosidenib is beneficial and
      well-tolerated as an agent to prevent the relapse of IDH1-mutated acute myeloid leukemia or
      other myeloid neoplasms after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. IDH1 is an enzyme
      that, when mutated, can overproduce metabolites (substances that help with metabolism) and
      compounds that contribute to the growth of tumors and cancerous cells. Ivosidenib may help
      block the over production of these substances and possibly reduce the chances of relapse.

    <description>Participants will be enrolled in standard 3 + 3 dose escalation cohorts in order to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). The first 3 participants will be started on 500mg of Ivosidenib, administered daily for 28 consecutive days (1 cycle). If the 500mg/day dose level is tolerated, an additional 10 participants will be treated at this dose level. If the 500mg/day dose is not tolerated, the dose will be decreased to 250mg/day. If 250mg daily is tolerated, then an additional 10 participants will be treated at 250mg daily. The only doses studied will be 500mg daily and 250mg daily (the latter, if necessary). If 250mg daily dosing is not tolerated, then the study will end without expansion. Dose limiting toxicities are assessed and graded using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE 4).</description>

          -  The effects of ivosidenib on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason
             female participants of child-bearing potential and male participants must agree to use
             adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence)

             and biopsy performed within 42 days prior to study entry.

          -  History of other malignancy(ies) unless

               -  the participant has been disease-free for at least 5 years and is deemed by the
                  investigator to be at low risk of recurrence of that malignancy, or

               -  the only prior malignancy was cervical cancer in situ and/or basal cell or

          -  Current or history of ventricular or life-threatening arrhythmias or diagnosis of
             long-QT syndrome

          -  QTc interval (i.e., Friderica's correction [QTcF]) ≥ 450 ms or other factors that
             increase the risk of QT prolongation or arrhythmic events (e.g., heart failure,

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness that would limit compliance with study requirements.

          -  HIV-positive participants on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because
             of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with study drug. In addition, these
             participants are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with
             marrow-suppressive therapy.
