  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Numerous studies show that remote monitoring and/or telenursing improves outcomes for
      patients especially those with chronic diseases. It is proposed that structured telenursing
      with non-invasive home monitoring of forced vital capacity and oxygen saturation in newly
      diagnosed patients with IPF will decrease hospitalizations for respiratory illness, increase
      compliance with therapies, and ultimately increase quality of life.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients undergoing evaluation for and who are diagnosed with Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis
      at Vanderbilt Medical Center from August 1, 2018, will be asked to participate. If agrees,
      and after signing the consent form, patients will be randomized into one of three arms: Usual
      Care, Usual Care with Telenursing, or Usual Care with Telenursing and Remote Monitoring.
      Patients will be asked to remain in the study for a minimum of three years.

          3. Willingness to participate in phone calls/video calls with the nurse practitioner or
             nurse case manager, if assigned to Arm 2 or Arm 3.

          4. Willingness to complete and monitor daily health assessments, if assigned to Arm 3.

          5. Willingness to share objective data via a provided electronic web-based portal,
             electronically via email, fax, or regular mail.

             pulmonary practices.
