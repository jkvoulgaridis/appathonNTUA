      INTRODUCTION: Cervical pain is a very common clinical condition in the world population, and
      can affect 70% of people at some point in life. Many of these conditions arise from
      musculoskeletal disorders, which may be caused by myofascial dysfunctions.
      Instrument-assisted soft tissue mobilization (IASTM) may be an important therapeutic tool as
      a means of treatment under these conditions. PURPOSE: To verify the effect of
      instrument-assisted soft tissue mobilization (IASTM) on pain, disability and range of motion
      (ROM) in individuals with non-specific chronic neck pain. DESIGN: Randomized Clinical Trial.
      METHODS: The sample will consist of 46 volunteers with non-specific chronic neck pain of both
      sexes, aged between 18 and 60 years, who presented pain for at least 12 weeks, without
      irradiation to the upper limbs distally to the shoulders. Of these, those that are not
      excluded, will be allocated randomly in one of the two groups present: Experimental Group
      (GE) - IASTM in the neck and Control Group (CG) - Manual myofascial release in the neck
      region. A blinded evaluator will be assigned to conduct the evaluation process for both
      groups. DESPECTS: The outcomes will be neck pain, neck disability and range of motion of the
      neck.

      -  To verify the effect of instrument-assisted soft tissue mobilization (IASTM) on pain,
           disability and ROM in individuals with non-specific chronic neck pain.

        -  Characterization of individuals with chronic nonspecific neck pain. To describe and
           compare, at the pre-intervention, post-intervention moments in a 3-week follow-up
           period, the intensity of neck pain using the numerical pain scale (NPS); the self -
           perception of disability using the Neck Disability Index (NDI) and range of motion (ROM)
           of the neck - flexion, extension, rotations and right and left slopes through a pendulum
           flexometer.

        -  Randomized unicentric clinical trial of longitudinal cut according to the
           standardization proposed by the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials - CONSORT
           statement

        -  The sample will be composed of 46 volunteers with chronic nonspecific neck pain.

        -  The subjects will be recruited through digital ads in the main social networks, as well
           as coming from the Physiotherapy service in a clinic in the city of Viamão / RS. An
           online form will be completed by the interested parties, which will include the
           eligibility criteria for participation in the study. Only the subjects that follow the
           criteria will be allocated to carry out the study.

    <description>the numerical scale of pain will be used. The Numerical Scale consists of a ruler divided into equal parts, numbered successively from 0 to 10. The study participant is meant to make the equivalence between the intensity of his pain and a numerical classification, where 0 corresponds to the classification &quot;No Pain&quot; and 10 to the classification &quot;Maximum Pain&quot; (pain of maximum intensity imaginable), that is, the higher the number the worse the score.</description>

    <measure>Disability of the neck</measure>
    <time_frame>assessment at baseline and its change in 1-week and 3-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Neck disability index. The Neck Disability Index is used to assess the functional capacity of the neck. Is composed of 10 questions regarding activities and pain. Items are organized by type of activity and followed by six different statements expressing progressive functional capacity levels. The NDI score consists of the sum of the points, from 0 to 5 of each of the 10 questions, totaling a maximum of 50 points. O value can be expressed as a percentage, on a scale of 0% (no disability) to 100% (complete disability). The score total is divided by the number of questions answered multiplied by number 5. The higher the score, the greater the patient's disability.</description>

    <description>The treatment will be performed using two pieces of Instrument Assisted Soft Tissue Mobilization (IASTM) stainless steel in the neck, bilaterally, which comprise the following muscles: Upper Trapezius, Splenius, scalenes and Sternocleidomastoid. An established time of 3 minutes will be used in each region, using an angle of 30 to 60º with the instrument. As it is observed, through the instrument, regions of greater adhesion, the researcher will use most of this time to release this condition.</description>

    <description>Treatment will be performed using manual Myofascial Release techniques. Release the upper Trapezius muscle bilaterally, sliding using roller with the dorsum of the fingers and ending with myofascial release. Sternocleidomastoid, sliding using roller with the dorsum of the fingers, ending with myofascial release. Afterwards the release of the scalenes muscles will be performed, with the fingers sliding and ending with the myofascial release. Soon afterwards techniques will be performed for the Splenius muscles, using finger slips and ending with posterior cervicothoracic release. The same time of 3 min will be used for the treatment bilaterally in each region.</description>
