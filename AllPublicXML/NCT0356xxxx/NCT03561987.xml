    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the relationship between the adipose tissue, as an active component,
      which can define metabolic phenotypes linked to cardiovascular risk modification post
      bariatric surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bariatric surgery induces a significant reduction in co-morbidities associated with obesity,
      such as Diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, liver disease, arterial hypertension, obstructive
      apnea and cardiovascular risk. However this does not happen in all obese patients, even when
      there is a weight reduction.

      It is known that the adipose tissue is actively involved in synthesis of cytokines and its
      role in metabolic phenotypes has been suggested. It is possible that the intrinsic mechanisms
      of adipose tissue participate in several benefits observed in morbidly obese patients who
      undergo to an anti-obesity surgery.

      So this study explores the involvement of adipose tissue as an active component, which can
      define metabolic phenotypes linked to cardiovascular risk modification post bariatric
      surgery.

    <description>The investigators include men and women, over 18 years old, with morbid obesity and candidates for bariatric surgery, under the routine of the treating service, with signature of acceptance of your participation, by informed consent.
The investigators exclude patients with medication with potential effect on adipose tissue or cardiovascular risk in the last month, also with severe infections in the last month or clinically unstable conditions.
Patients are eliminated in the study if they dont have the desire to continue in the study, and if the samples or the information are insufficient for an adequate analysis.</description>

    <description>There are two components to the procedure. First, a small stomach pouch, approximately one ounce or 30 milliliters in volume, is created by dividing the top of the stomach from the rest of the stomach. Next, the first portion of the small intestine is divided, and the bottom end of the divided small intestine is brought up and connected to the newly created small stomach pouch. The procedure is completed by connecting the top portion of the divided small intestine to the small intestine further down so that the stomach acids and digestive enzymes from the bypassed stomach and first portion of small intestine will eventually mix with the food.</description>
