    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the tolerability and safety profile of ASP1948 when
      administered as a single agent and in combination with nivolumab or pembrolizumab in
      participants with locally advanced (unresectable) or metastatic solid tumors; characterize
      the pharmacokinetic profile of ASP1948 when administered as a single agent and in combination
      with nivolumab or pembrolizumab and determine the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of ASP1948
      when administered as a single agent and in combination with nivolumab or pembrolizumab. This
      study will also evaluate the antitumor effect of ASP1948 when administered as a single agent
      and in combination with nivolumab or pembrolizumab.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a dose-escalation and expansion study of ASP1948 as a single agent and in combination
      with nivolumab or pembrolizumab. The study consists of 3 periods for monotherapy and
      combination therapy: screening, treatment and follow up, followed by an optional Re-treatment
      period for participants that qualify.

      The escalation cohorts will evaluate escalating dose levels of ASP1948 in participants with
      locally advanced (unresectable) or metastatic solid tumor malignancies.

      After discontinuation of study drug, all participants will complete an end-of-treatment
      visit, along with 30-day and 90-day safety follow-up visits from the last dose of study drug.

      For dose expansion, the tumor-specific cohorts will include participants with squamous cell
      carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN), non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), metastatic
      castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), ovarian cancer, pancreatic cancer and breast
      cancer, as well as any tumor types that respond to study drug treatment during dose
      escalation.

    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product. AEs will be coded using medical dictionary for regulatory activities (MedDRA) and graded using NCI-CTCAE version 4.03.</description>
