  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Along with population ageing, the association of chronic conditions such as Alzheimer's
      Disease and Related Syndromes (ADRS) and diabetes mellitus is increasing in clinical
      practice. According to ADRS severity, guidelines of diabetes care may be adapted for a
      personalized monitoring and treatment. The consequences on diabetes complications are not
      known and can also threaten dementia progression. Based on a nationwide healthcare
      reimbursement database, the present study aimed to compare diabetes care and the incidence of
      acute complications between patients with or without ADRS, in a longitudinal perspective
      focusing on the pivotal period of ADRS identification by the healthcare system.

    <description>Incidence analysis in non ADRS group. Each incident ADRS case was paired (1:1) to a beneficiary without any ADRS criteria, matched on age (same birth year), sex, residence area (based on of the 100 administrative 'départements') and insurance scheme.</description>

    <description>Incidence analysis between the 2 groups (ADRS/non ADRS). For each pair, an index date was defined as the ADRS identification date. In both groups, a 5-year period free of these three ADRS criteria was required before the index date, to ensure incident ADRS cases.</description>

        Patients included in the FRADEM study : FRADEM is a nationwide case control study conducted
        through the French national health system database administrative data, the SNDS (systeme
        national des données de santé). SNDS provies reimbursement data from the entire French
        general population, whether subjects live at home or in a nursing home, whichever their
        healthcare schemes, leading to a 97% coverage of the French population in 2011.
