      To demonstrate bioequivalence of single dose test formulation of Ibuprofen,oral suspension
      200 mg/5 ml (containing ibuprofen 200 mg) of Pharmtechnology LLC, Republic of Belarus with
      reference Nurofen® for Children, oral suspension 100 mg / 5 ml (containing ibuprofen 100 mg)
      of &quot;Reckitt Benckiser Healthcare International Ltd, .&quot;, UK in normal, healthy, adult, human
      subjects under fasting conditions.To monitor adverse events and ensure the safety

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Total 30 normal healthy adult subjects will be enrolled in the study. Subjects will be
      administered either the Test (5 ml of oral suspension containing 200 mg of ibuprofen) or the
      Reference Product (10ml of oral suspension containing 200 mg of ibuprofen) with 200 mL of
      water in each period as per the randomization schedule. Subjects will fast for at least 10
      hours prior to administration of the study drugs and for four (4) hours after administration
      of the study drugs during each study period. Standardized meals will be provided in each
      study period. Water will not be accessible to the subjects 1 hour to administration of the
      study drugs and 2 hours after administration of the study drugs in each period. A total of 20
      blood samples will be withdrawn for pharmacokinetic profiling during each study period. The
      plasma concentrations of R- and S-enantiomers of ibuprofen will be measured by a validated
      LC-MS/MS analytical method. ANOVA will be performed on log transformed pharmacokinetic
      parameters Cmax, AUC0-t and 90% confidence interval will be constructed for the ratio of
      geometric least square mean of the Test and Reference products, obtained from the
      log-transformed data. Bioequivalence will be concluded if the ratio estimate as well as its
      90% confidence interval of S-enantiomers of ibuprofen, both falls within the acceptable range
      of 80.00% to 125.00% for Cmax, AUC0-t.
