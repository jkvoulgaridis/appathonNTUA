      The purpose of this prospective, multicenter, single arm study is to confirm the long-term
      safety and effectiveness of the R3 delta Ceramic Acetabular System PMA (P150030) by
      evaluating long-term (10 years after surgery) follow-up results.

      This PAS is a long-term follow-up of the R3 delta Ceramic Acetabular System (DOD) hips
      enrolled in the study that was analyzed for the Premarket Approval Application (PMA) Study.
      The PMA Study analyzed 3 Year postoperative follow-up data on Biolox delta ceramic-on-Biolox
      delta ceramic (DOD) and Oxidized zirconium-on-Crosslinked Polyethylene (OxZr/XLPE) hips,
      enrolled and followed in a European Post-market Study (&quot;A prospective, multicenter,
      non-randomized, clinical outcome study of the R3 Acetabular System in patients with
      degenerative hip disease&quot;).

      The purpose of this prospective, multicenter, single arm study is to confirm the long-term
      safety and effectiveness of the R3 delta Ceramic Acetabular System PMA (P150030) by
      evaluating long-term (10 years after surgery) follow-up results. Hips are evaluated at the
      following intervals: 5, 7, 10 years postoperative. The primary study endpoint is implant
      survivorship at 10 years post surgery.

    <description>The PAS cohort consisted of 137 subjects who were implanted with the R3 delta Ceramic Acetabular System (DoD) in the pivotal study. These patients will continue to be followed to 10 years post-operatively.
The primary endpoint for the PAS study is implant survivorship at 10 years post study procedure.</description>
