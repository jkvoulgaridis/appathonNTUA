    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to test the effectiveness of the Patient Decision Aid for Opioid Use
      Disorder (PtDA-MAT) by conducting a stepped-wedge cluster-randomized trial in CA H&amp;SS
      (stratified by rural vs. non-rural areas) for adults with OUD. Patient outcomes will be
      tracked by (1) personal assessments (baseline, 3 months, and 6 months): drug use, overdose,
      healthcare utilization, and (2) clinical and administrative records (over approximately 24
      months): drug treatment status and retention, physical and mental health diagnoses, arrest,
      incarceration, controlled substance use, and mortality. Multilevel models will be applied to
      test the intervention effects, controlling for possible temporal trends.

      In response to RFA-DA-18-005 (Expanding Medication Assisted Treatment for Opioid Use
      Disorders in the Context of the SAMHSA Opioid STR Grants, R21/R33), this project will develop
      and test a patient decision support tool called Patient Decision Aid for Medication-Assisted
      Treatment (PtDA-MAT) for use in the CA H&amp;SS. The PtDA-MAT is designed to (1) improve patient
      knowledge and involvement and to subsequently improve treatment adherence and outcomes and
      (2) to support clinicians in informing and communicating with their patients with OUD along a
      continuum of care. The 3 year project will assess the effectiveness of the PtDA-MAT in a
      stepped-wedge cluster-randomized trial in CA H&amp;SS (stratified by rural vs. non-rural areas)
      for adults with OUD. Patient outcomes will be tracked by (1) personal assessments (baseline,
      3 months, and 6 months): drug use, overdose, healthcare utilization, and (2) clinical and
      administrative records (over an average of 24 months): drug treatment status and retention,
      physical and mental health diagnoses, arrest, incarceration, controlled substance use, and
      mortality. Multilevel models will be applied to test the intervention effects, controlling
      for possible temporal trends.

    <intervention_model_description>The Patient Decision Aid for Medication Assisted Therapy (PtDA-MAT) will be tested by patients and clinicians during actual visits with OUD patients to assess its acceptability and effectiveness. We will track patients receiving PtDAT-MAT using their clinical and administration data over a 24-month period to assess outcomes associated with PtDAT-MAT. Participating clinics will be randomly selected in sequence to implement the intervention.</intervention_model_description>
