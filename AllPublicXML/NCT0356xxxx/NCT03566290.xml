                  that study, or;

               2. any subject from 226 onwards, who was randomly assigned to any treatment group
                  and who completed the required treatment and follow-up periods of that study

                  who consent to participate in G201003 will be allowed to discontinue from that
                  study and consent to this study upon unblinding of G201002)

               2. for G201002 Subjects 226-493, within 30 days of completing both the treatment and
                  follow-up periods of G201002

          -  Agree to maintain a stable dose of any medication known to affect lower urinary tract
             function, including but not limited to anticholinergics, tricyclic antidepressants,

          -  Subject is currently taking systemic sex-hormone products (excludes intravaginal
             application of estradiol topical/tablet agents and hormones delivered via vaginal

                  Subjects with hypertension that has been treated and controlled with medication
                  for ≥ 2 weeks prior to screening are eligible for participation

               3. Cardiac-related syncopal event within the past year

               4. Cardio or cerebral vascular disease requiring surgical intervention (e.g., bypass
                  surgery, angioplasty). For subjects with previous stent placement, please contact
                  the medical monitor

               5. Congestive heart failure of Stage &gt; 2 according to New York Heart Association
