  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1b, open-label, dose-escalation cohort study. The study will consist of a
      dose escalation assessment of the safety and tolerability of Mocetinostat administered
      concurrently in combination with ipilimumab and nivolumab to patients with advanced melanoma.
      Treatment will be divided into induction and maintenance phases. It is anticipated that this
      clinical study will enable selection of the RP2D and dose schedule of this 3-drug combination
      for further clinical testing. The trial will include an assessment of the pharmacodynamic
      activity of Mocetinostat administered in combination with ipilimumab and nivolumab.

             will be allowed; mucosal melanomas are eligible.

          -  Patients must not have received prior anticancer treatment for metastatic disease (for
             example, but not limited to, systemic, local, radiation, radiopharmaceutical).

          -  Exceptions: Surgery for melanoma and/or postresection brain radiotherapy (RT) if
             central nervous system (CNS) metastases and/or prior treatment with adjuvant
             interferon (IFN) (as described in Exclusion Criterion 2).

             --All patients must have their disease status documented by a complete physical

             abdomen, pelvis, and all known sites of resected disease in the setting of Stage
             IIIb/c or Stage IV disease, and brain magnetic resonance imaging ([MRI], brain CT
             allowable if MRI is contraindicated).

          -  Prior treated CNS metastases must be without MRI evidence of recurrence for at least 4
             weeks after treatment. Patients must be off immunosuppressive doses of systemic
             steroids (≥ 10 mg/day prednisone or equivalent) for at least 14 days prior to study
             drug administration, and must have returned to neurologic baseline status
             postoperatively

               -  The 4-week period of stability is measured after the completion of the neurologic
                  interventions (ie, surgery and/or radiation).

          -  In addition to neurosurgery to treat CNS metastases, adjuvant radiation after the
             resection of CNS metastasis is allowed. Immunosuppressive doses of systemic steroids
             (doses ≥ 10 mg/day prednisone or equivalent) must be discontinued at least 14 days
             before study drug administration.

          -  Prior surgery that required general anesthesia must be completed at least 4 weeks
             before study drug administration. Surgery requiring local/epidural anesthesia must be
             completed at least 72 hours before study drug administration.

          -  All baseline laboratory requirements will be assessed and should be obtained within 14
             days of first dose of study drug. Screening laboratory values must meet the following
             criteria:

          -  White blood cells ≥ 2000/µL

          -  Neutrophils ≥ 1500/µL

          -  Platelets ≥ 100 × 10³/µL

          -  Hemoglobin ≥ 9.0 g/dL

          -  Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 × upper limit of normal (ULN) or creatinine clearance &gt; 40
             mL/minute (using Cockcroft/Gault formula)

          -  Patient Re-enrollment: This study permits the re-enrollment of a patient that has
             discontinued the study as a screen failure (ie, patient has not been dosed/has not
             been treated). If re-enrolled, the patient must be re-consented.

          -  Males and females ≥ 18 years of age.

          -  Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy
             test (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of human chorionic gonadotropin
             hormone) within 24 hours prior to the start of study drug.; Women must not be
             breastfeeding.

          -  Women of childbearing potential must agree to follow instructions for method(s) of
             contraception for the duration of treatment with study drug(s) plus 5 half-lives of
             study drug plus 30 days (duration of ovulatory cycle). The half-lives of nivolumab and
             ipilimumab is up to 25 days and 18 days, respectively. Given the blinded nature of
             this study, WOCBP should therefore use an adequate method to avoid pregnancy for a
             total of 23 weeks posttreatment completion.

          -  Males who are sexually active with WOCBP must agree to follow instructions for
             method(s) of contraception for the duration of treatment with study drug(s) plus 5
             half lives of the study drug(s) plus 90 days (duration of sperm turnover). The
             half-lives of nivolumab and ipilimumab are up to 25 days and 18 days, respectively.
             Given the blinded nature of this study, men should therefore use an adequate method of
             contraception for a total of 31 weeks posttreatment completion.

          -  Azoospermic males and WOCBP who are continuously not heterosexually active are exempt
             from contraceptive requirements. However, they must still undergo pregnancy testing as
             described in this section.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with carcinomatosis meningitis or a history of ocular/uveal melanoma are
             excluded.

          -  Patients with previous nonmelanoma malignancies are excluded unless a complete
             resection or remission was achieved at least 2 years prior to study entry and no
             additional therapy is required or anticipated to be required during the study period
             (exceptions include, but are not limited to, nonmelanoma skin cancers, in situ bladder
             cancer, in situ gastric cancer or gastrointestinal stromal tumor, in situ colon
             cancers, in situ cervical cancers/dysplasia, or breast carcinoma in situ).

          -  Patients with active, known, or suspected autoimmune disease. Patients with type I
             diabetes mellitus, residual hypothyroidism due to autoimmune thyroiditis only
             requiring hormone replacement, or skin disorders (such as vitiligo, psoriasis, or
             alopecia) not requiring systemic treatment are permitted to enroll. For any cases of
             uncertainty, it is recommended that the Principal Investigator be consulted prior to
             signing informed consent.

          -  Patients with a condition requiring systemic treatment with either corticosteroids (≥
             10 mg daily prednisone or equivalent) or other immunosuppressive medications within 14
             days of study drug administration. Inhaled or topical steroids are permitted in the
             absence of active autoimmune disease.

          -  Prior therapy for melanoma with the following exceptions which are allowed: 1) surgery
             for the melanoma lesion(s), 2) adjuvant RT after neurosurgical resection for CNS
