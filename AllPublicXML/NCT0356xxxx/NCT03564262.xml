  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Americans eat more salt than is recommended by the American Heart Association. This is
      important because consuming a high-salt diet is associated with an increased risk of
      cardiovascular events, like strokes and heart attacks. In fact, consuming one high-salt meal
      temporarily reduces blood vessel function and it is not uncommon for Americans to consume
      high-salt meals. Therefore, our laboratory is interested in determining if a single high-salt
      meal affects 1) brain blood vessel function at rest and 2) blood pressure responses during
      exercise.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Excess dietary salt increases the risk of cardiovascular events like strokes and heart
      attacks, independent of resting blood pressure. Recent data found that consuming one
      high-salt meal temporarily reduces endothelial function in the periphery. This decrease in
      endothelial function can lead to an exaggerated blood pressure response during exercise and
      may also attenuate cerebrovascular reactivity at rest. This is essential, because an
      exaggerated cardiovascular response to exercise and a decrease in brain blood vessel function
      at rest are risk factors for future cardiovascular events. The long-term goal is to determine
      how dietary salt adversely affects BP and cerebrovascular regulation. The objective of this
      proposal is to evaluate the impact of an acute dietary salt meal on BP response during
      exercise and cerebrovascular reactivity at rest. The investigators have 2 specific aims: 1)
      Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that high dietary salt will reduce cerebrovascular reactivity,
      2) Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that high dietary salt will augment blood pressure
      reactivity during exercise. The findings of this project will shed light on how acute dietary
      salt affects the risk of cardiovascular events during a bout of exercise and long-term risk
      for cardiovascular disease and stroke.

    <description>Cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) will be assessed using transcranial Doppler ultrasound with carbon dioxide as the vasoactive stimuli.
The intervention is to provide subjects with either a low sodium meal (138 mg sodium) and high sodium meal (1,495 mg sodium), in a randomized order. The CVR test will be performed prior to soup consumption as well as after soup consumption.</description>
