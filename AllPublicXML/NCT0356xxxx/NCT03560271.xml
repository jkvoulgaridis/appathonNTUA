    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group comparison study to
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of Cyclo-Z vs. placebo in adult subjects with type 2
      diabetes. Approximately 20 clinical sites may be utilized in the United States so that
      approximately 300 subjects (a potential 20% screening failure rate) may be screened for total
      28-week study period (2 weeks for screening, 24 weeks for treatment, and 2 weeks for safety
      follow-up).

    <textblock>
      Insulin degrading enzyme (IDE) is a zinc-containing enzyme that regulates degradation of
      internalized insulin and the maintenance of insulin sensitivity. Diabetic animals and humans
      are zinc deficient due to impaired intestinal zinc absorption and hyperzincuria. If endosomal
      IDE levels are inadequate, undigested insulin will remain in the cytosol and prevent insulin
      signal transduction. Cyclo-Z enhances IDE synthesis and stimulates insulin degradation.
      Although Cyclo (his-pro) (CHP) or zinc alone are somewhat effective in the control of blood
      glucose metabolism, based on the available literature and previous background studies, it is
      hypothesized that the combination of CHP and zinc in Cyclo-Z work synergistically to
      ameliorate insulin resistance in diabetic and obese subjects mainly by stimulating IDE
      synthesis.
