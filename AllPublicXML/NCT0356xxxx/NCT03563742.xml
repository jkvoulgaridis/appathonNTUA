  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of rilpivirine (RPV)-based
      regimen in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infected, antiretroviral (ARV)
      treatment-naive participants, as determined by the percentage of virologic responders defined
      as having HIV-1 ribonucleic acid (RNA) less than 400 copies/ milliliter (mL) at Week 24.
