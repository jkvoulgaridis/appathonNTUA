    <textblock>
      In this study we compared the efficacy of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) to
      differential lung ventilation, in terms of patient's oxygenation, during video assisted
      thoracoscopic lung resection.

      Background: One Lung Ventilation (OLV) is the technique used during lung resection surgery in
      order to facilitate optimal surgical conditions. OLV may result in hypoxemia due to the shunt
      created. Several techniques are used to overcome the hypoxemia, one of which is continuous
      positive airway pressure (CPAP) to the non-dependent lung. Another technique is ventilating
      the non-dependent lung with a minimal volume, thus creating differential lung ventilation
      (DLV). In this study we compared the efficacy of CPAP to DLV during video assisted
      thoracoscopic lung resection.

      Patients and Method: This is a prospective study of 30 adult patients undergoing elective
      video assisted thoracoscopic lung lobectomy. Each patient was ventilated in four modes: two
      lung ventilation, OLV, OLV+CPAP and OLV+DLV. Fifteen patients were ventilated with CPAP first
      and DLV next, and the other 15 were ventilated with DLV first and then CPAP. Five minutes
      separated each mode, during which the non-dependent lung was open to room air. We measured
      the patient's arterial blood gas during each mode of ventilation. The surgeons, who were
      blinded to the ventilation technique, were asked to assess the surgical conditions at each
      stage.
