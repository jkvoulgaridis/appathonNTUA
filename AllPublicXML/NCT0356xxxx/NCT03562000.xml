  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      After the admission in ICU, most patients have to be intubated in order to control haematosis
      in case of acute respiratory failure, to reduce the metabolic crisis during severe
      haemodynamic shock, or to protect upper airways in case of impairment of consciousness. After
      the initial phase of etiological treatment, as soon as the patients no more required the
      intubation, weanibility has to be checked (thanks to a weaning trial with or without pressure
      support) before the separation attempt is decided on an evaluation of the overall
      extubability, based in particular on a subjective assessment of cough strength. The cases of
      re-intubation can be related to several factors such as: i) a ventilatory insufficiency
      indicating an imbalance between the muscular pomp function and the mechanical constraint of
      the chest; ii) an acute cardiogenic oedema; iii) an obstruction of the superior airways,
      possibly due to an imbalance between the bronchial overload and the cough efficacy.

      Preventing extubation failure should avoid exposing such patients to an over-risk of
      morbidity and mortality due to the consequences of a prolonged invasive ventilation. This
      prevention can be implemented thanks to an early detection of the patients the most at risk
      and then a coherent intervention to manage of each risk factor involved. For example, the
      inspiratory insufficiency can be fixed by the use of Non-Invasive Ventilation (NIV), as
      proposed for patients developing a final hypercapnia at the end of the weanibility test.

      Several studies have been conducted to improve the prediction of extubation failure. As this
      is notably influenced by the cough efficacy before extubation, it has been proposed to assess
      the peak flow expiratory during voluntary cough. The Cough Peak Flow could for example
      replaced some semi-quantitative measures of cough strength associated to a low
      reproducibility. The most validated threshold for a weak cough is &lt; 60 L/min and it has
      recently been demonstrated that it remained valuable when directly assessed using the
      built-in ventilator flow-meter.

      In the meantime, new devices of mechanical cough assistance have been developed and are
      frequently used for patients presenting a chronic neuro-muscular disease affecting their
      ability to spontaneously clear their airways from an inappropriate bronchial overload.
      However, the interest of such devices for a systematic use after extubation has not been
      validated with a sufficient level of evidence to be recommended, in particular because of the
      bias of the single randomised monocentric study.

      The main objective of the study consists in demonstrating in an open multicentre randomised
      study (focused on the patients with an objective low cough strength) the superiority of a
      systematic strategy combining mechanical cough assistance and non-invasive ventilation on
      standard care (manual post-extubation physiotherapy and NIV for restrictive indications) to
      reduce the re-intubation rate at 48h.

    <description>A standardised bundle of intervention will be tested using the combination of two medical devices previously used in daily clinical practice but without guideline and objective selection criteria, namely:
A mechanical cough assistance technic using the Cough Assist device (Model E70® by Philips Respironics, Carlsbad, CA, USA) before extubation then after extubation then 3 times a day (with possible additional treatment on demand) during 7 days maximum (with a possible cessation if the patient has strictly no bronchial overload during three consecutive physiotherapy sessions)
A systematic Non-Invasive ventilation during 24h minimum to indirectly improve the clearance of bronchial overload and to reduce the overall risk of re-intubation related a relative hypoventilation associated to the weak cough.</description>

    <intervention_type>Procedure</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>control group using the current gold standard of care after extubation, namely the manual drainage by a physiotherapist and the consensual use of Non-invasive ventilation</intervention_name>
    <description>After extubation, the physiotherapy will be managed according to standard care and cough assistance will be only manual. The use of a dedicated cough assistance device will be allowed if the bronchial overload clearance is repeatedly insufficient according to the physiotherapist in charge.
Non-invasive ventilation will not be systematic and only used in case of pre-defined condition, such as: age &gt; 65 years-old, BMI &gt; 30, Chronic cardiac failure, COPD, hypercapnia at the end of the weaning trial, post-operative admissions after abdominal and thoracic surgery.</description>
