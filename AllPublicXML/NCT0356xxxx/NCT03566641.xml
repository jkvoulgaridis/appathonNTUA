  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of our study is to compare the efficacy of negative pressure wound therapy (Prevena)
      and standard clinical dressing in terms of prevention of postoperative surgical site
      infection, length of hospital stay, and total cost of hospitalization among vascular, plastic
      and general surgery patients.

    <intervention_model_description>Comparing the rate of occurrence of surgical site infection, total hospital cost and length of stay between two groups: group 1 represents patients who receive Prevena for postoperative wound care and group 2 represents patients who receive standard care dressing for the same purpose.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>Out study is a single-blinded randomized clinical trial. The patient will be informed about the type of dressing used for their wound care, but the investigator and the outcome assessor will be blinded for which type of dressing used for each participant patient.</masking_description>
