  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 1 study of HA115 capsules
      administered orally to healthy adult volunteers.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study consists of 2 parts, Part A (SAD, including fed/fasted comparison) and Part B
      (MAD). Part A will be a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, dose-escalating
      titration of up to 8 single dose levels of HA115. In each cohort, 8 participants will receive
      active compound and 2 will receive placebo in a randomized manner. Part A will include an
      assessment of the effect of a high-fat breakfast on the absorption and PK profile of HA115,
      performed in 10 participants at a single dose to be selected based on SAD results and
      predicted to be associated with therapeutic plasma concentrations.

      Part B will be a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled parallel group study of up to 3
      dose levels of HA115 given once daily. The number of days of dosing will be based on the
      results of the PK analysis from Part A. In each cohort, 8 participants will receive active
      compound fasted and 2 will receive placebo in a randomized, double blind fashion. Safety
      observations and PK evaluations will be made. Safety data will be reviewed with the SRC prior
      to each dose escalation.

    <masking_description>The participants, principal investigator, and all other study personnel involved with participant assessments will remain blinded to the actual treatment assignments of the participants. The principal investigator will be ultimately responsible for ensuring that the integrity of the blind is maintained throughout the study and will be required to notify the sponsor in the event of any breaking of the blind for any reason. An unblinded pharmacist staff will be required at the Clinical Site to comply with the study's randomization and blinding requirements. At the Clinical Site, prior to study initiation, the principal investigator will be responsible for designating a qualified pharmacy staff to serve as the unblinded pharmacy staff in the study. Unblinded pharmacy staff may not participate in any participant assessments.</masking_description>
