  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is the most common malignant tumor in women. Recurrent or metastatic breast
      cancer is incurable. High risk patients usually have the following characteristics, such as,
      non-pCR after neoadjuvant therapy, lymph nodes positive, &gt;2cm tumor size, HER2
      overexpression, etc. Intensive targeted or chemo therapy could improve prognosis. Previous
      studies have shown the efficacy and feasibility of intensive treatment of capecitabine in
      non-pCR breast cancer patients. Given the metronomic capecitabine therapy is well tolerated,
      we designed this study to compare the efficacy and safety of adding metronomic capecitabine
      to standard adjuvant therapy for high risk HER2+ breast cancer patients.
