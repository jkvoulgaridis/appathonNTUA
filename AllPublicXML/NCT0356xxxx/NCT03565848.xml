  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Colorectal resection is a standard surgical treatment of bowel deep infiltrating
      endometriosis (DIE). Nevertheless, concerns about different bowel functional outcomes related
      to radical surgery versus conservative surgery as shaving technique is a topic leading to
      much debate. Different surgical approach are used to perform colorectal resection and there
      is not a standardized technique. For the same concerns, studies have addressed the mesenteric
      vascular and nerve preservation both in oncological and benign intestinal disease with
      improved functional outcome. Therefore, the aim of this prospective study is to analyze
      feasibility and safety of mesenteric vascular and nerve Sparing Surgery in laparoscopic
      segmental colorectal resection for DIE with short and long term follow up. Women with DIE
      ,that underwent laparoscopic segmental colorectal resection, will undergo resection performed
      with inferior mesenteric artery and branching arteries preservation by dissecting adherent to
      the intestinal wall with mesenteric vascularization and innervation entirely preserved.
      Personal history, clinical data, surgical data, short and long term surgical complications
      and long term outcomes will be recorded. Symptoms and bowel function will be evaluated before
      and after surgery.

Constipation Assessment Scale includes eight items, each of which is self-rated by the patient as 'no problem' (score of 0), 'some problem' (score of 1), or 'severe problem' (score of 2). The item ratings are then summed, so the overall score may range from 0 (no constipation) to 16 (worst possible constipation).</description>
