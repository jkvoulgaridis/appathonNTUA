  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hepatitis C (HCV) is a major health problem amongst people who inject drugs (PWID) and have
      limited contact with health care services. Halfway houses (HH) serve to reintegrate former
      drug users into society. Strategies to eliminate HCV must focus on screening for HCV amongst
      HH. Linkage to care for PWID population is an issue globally.

      The aim is to determine the sero-prevalence, demographics, disease distribution and factors
      associated with the risk of HCV transmission amongst former drug users at Halfway Houses. The
      secondary aim would be to determine the best models of care that can be used to link these
      individuals to existing healthcare services in a pragmatic, randomised fashion

      Halfway Houses are invited to participate in a program of HCV education, point-of-care
      screening using Oraquick test and staging with FibroscanÂ® by a small mobile team of
      healthcare workers. A detailed survey regarding illicit drug injecting practices is
      performed. Those who are tested positive are referred to medical care.

      It is anticipated that the prevalence of Hepatitis C within the drug injecting population
      along with the stages of liver disease such that models for disease burden can be determined.

      This is a pragmatic observational study of point of care HCV screening in the halfway house
      resident /PWID population.

      In the secondary aim the HCV positive subjects are randomised to traditional referral pathway
      (HCV positive cases attend primary care facilities to get referral to specialist clinic in
      hospital) and 'direct' open access where the HCV positive cases has direct open access to
      specialist clinic as above (by passing primary care physicians). We observe the no. of
      subjects being linkage to specialist care, and HCV treatment

        Halfway House (HH) residents are largely former injecting drug users who have a high
        prevalence of Hepatitis C. Typically upon release from prisons, there are housed at HH as
        an interim step prior to re-integration back into society. The prevalence of Hepatitis C
        within this community allows the estimation of the national prevalence of Hepatitis C in
        the country.
