      SPECIFIC AIM 1: To evaluate in a multi-center, randomized trial the effectiveness of PROs
      elicited using PatientBuddy and EncephalApp on the prevention of avoidable 30 day
      readmissions in patients with cirrhosis and their caregivers compared to standard of care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cirrhosis affects more than 6 million US patients and is a major burden on patients,
      caregivers and the healthcare system. Patients with cirrhosis are prone to clinical and
      psycho-social issues that may predict hospitalization, re-hospitalizations and death.
      Important patient-reported outcomes (PRO) such as impaired daily functioning, sleep,
      cognition and pain are widely prevalent in patients with cirrhosis. These changes can
      independently impact hospitalizations, re-hospitalizations and death in cirrhotic patients.
      The investigators have studied the impact of these PRO using traditional and computerized
      scales such as PROMIS (Patient-reported outcomes measurement information system). With the
      increasing spread of health-related electronic devices, the relevance of health IT in the
      management of chronic diseases such as cirrhosis is paramount. The team has already developed
      and used several health IT advances to educate patients and their caregivers in inpatient and
      outpatient settings. These tools are Patient Buddy to define patients regarding factor
      preventing readmission, and EncephalApp Stroop to detect cognitive dysfunction in cirrhosis.
      As part of a funded AHRQ R21, PatientBuddy, which has undergone multiple refinements in
      response to feedback from patients, caregivers and administering staff, is being used by the
      study team to prevent readmissions to Virginia Commonwealth University Medical Center (VCU).
      However the evaluation of these tools in a multi-center study that adapts to the status of
      the patients and their caregivers is an important step towards improvement in
      cirrhosis-related outcomes. In addition, PROs that are elicited and monitored when the
      patients are outside the hospital will advance the field by making them integral parts of
      clinical management.
