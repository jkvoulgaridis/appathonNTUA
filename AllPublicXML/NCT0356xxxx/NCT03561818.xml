  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators aimed to compare the home-based Pulmonary Rehabilitation with the
      hospital-based pulmonary rehabilitation in terms of pulmonary rehabilitation efficiency in
      patient with bronchiectasis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      While the benefits of pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) in cases of chronic obstructive pulmonary
      disease (COPD) have been well-documented, there have been only a limited number of studies
      investigating the efficacy of PR in patients with bronchiectasis. Some of these studies have
      reported positive effects of PR also in bronchiectasis patients, but have underlined the need
      for additional studies including larger patient groups to define PR indications, and to
      ensure that exercise protocols are specific for this patient group. There are many PR
      organizational types, such as hospital-based, telephone-mentoring with home-based or tele
      monitorization programs. Hospital-based supervised programs are time-consuming and costly
      practices. For this reason, there is a need for further studies on the effectiveness and
      benefits of unsupervised programs. In this study, we will compare unsupervised home-based PR
      and supervised hospital-based PR in terms of pulmonary rehabilitation effectiveness.

      The pulmonary function tests, dyspnea perception, quality of life and exercise capacity
      assessments will performed before and after pulmonary rehabilitation.

    <description>Dyspnea perceptions during daily life activities will assess according to the modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) scale. The mMRC Dyspnea Scale is best used to establish baseline functional impairment due to dyspnea attributable to respiratory disease; tracking the mMRC over time or with therapeutic interventions is of less certain clinical utility.The severity of dyspnea is rated on a scale of 0 to 4. &quot;0&quot; means no dyspnea perception, &quot;4&quot; means severe dyspnea perception.</description>
