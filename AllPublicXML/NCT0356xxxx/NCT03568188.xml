  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the focal treatment HIFU is to destroy the cancer without causing side effects in
      contrast to radical treatments. Radical treatments (surgery or radiation therapy) are the
      standard therapies for patient with intermediate risk localized prostate cancer and good life
      expectancy (prostatectomy if life expectancy10 years) By destroying only the part of the
      gland that harbors cancer, it may indeed be possible to provide efficient cure of the disease
      while minimizing treatment-induced morbidity (incontinence and loss of potency). Around 20%
      of patients presented with a unilateral tumor: this patients are currently treated radically.
      No study published papers reported outcomes of a large population (&gt;100) with intermediate
      risk cancers treated with Focal-HIFU (conducted with the Focal One® device). Focal therapy
      must be only offer within clinical trial setting (EAU (European Association of Urology)
      Guidelines ). The aim of this cohort will be to determine the success rate of Focal-HIFU in
      this intermediate risk population. The result the study will be used for calculation the arms
      of a future random study

    <description>Evolution of the Gleason score (appearance of Gleason ≥7) will be measured and will be used to evaluate the carcinologic evolution at 12 month.
The Gleason score is a prognosis factor for prostate cancer. It is based prostate cancer cells architecture from biopsies. The more the architectures of prostate cancer cell is destroyed, the worse is the prognosis. The score grades from 3 to 5, 5 being the more destroyed, the score 1 and 2 being normal cells. When there is more than one tumor cells population in the prostate, the score is composed of the sum of the most 2 frequents grade. For example a Gleason 7 tumor could be 3+4 or 4+3, the 4+3 being more aggressive.</description>

    <description>quality of life will be assessed using the QLQC30 (Quality of Life questionnaire) questionnaire.
It is a specific questionnaire to determine the quality of life a patient with cancer. It is composed of 30 questions with 4 potential answers going from: not at all, a little, enough or a lot, within 28 questions and with a visual scale going from 1 to 7 (7 being excellent and 1 being very bad) for the last 2 questions. The raw score is established by adding the score of each question and a linear transformation range it from 0 to 100. The higher the score, the better the quality of life.</description>

    <time_frame>over the 48 months</time_frame>
    <description>urinary function will be assessed using the EPIC-26 (The Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite) questionnaire.
The EPIC-26 is a self-reported scale health-related quality of life questionnaire for prostate cancer patients . It is composed of 26 items in 4 different domains: urinary incontinence, urinary irritation/obstruction, bowel, sexual, and vitality/hormonal.
Response options for each EPIC item form a Likert scale, and multi-item scale scores are transformed linearly to a 0-100 scale. Each items as a standardized value from 0 to 100. Then the average of the standardized value is determined in each domain to crate the summary score. The higher the score, the better the quality of life.</description>

    <measure>IPSS score</measure>
    <time_frame>over the 48 months</time_frame>
    <description>urinary function will be assessed using the IPSS (International Prostate Score Symptom) questionnaire.
The IPSS questionnaire is based on the answers to seven questions concerning urinary symptoms and one question concerning quality of life. Each question concerning urinary symptoms allows the patient to choose one out of six answers indicating increasing severity of the particular symptom. The answers are assigned points from 0 to 5. The total score can therefore range from 0 to 35. The score is then categorized as follow: Mild (symptoms score less than or equal to 7), Moderate (symptom score range 8-19), Severe (symptom score range 20-35). The higher the score, the worse the symptoms.</description>

The IIEF-5 Questionnaire is composed of 5 items with 5 possible answers rating from 1 to 5 (very low, low, moderate, high, very high).
The score is the sum of the ordinal responses to the 56 items. It is then categorized as follow: 22-25: No erectile dysfunction, 17-21: Mild erectile dysfunction, 12-16: Mild to moderate erectile dysfunction, 8-11: Moderate erectile dysfunction, 5-7: Severe erectile dysfunction. The higher the score, the better the sexual function.</description>

    <description>170 patients with prostate cancer of intermediate risk receive the immediate treatment with focal HIFU. The treatment area will be defined using MRI data and 3D biopsies. A safety distance of at least 9 mm will be defined around the tumor. An intraoperative contrast echocardiographic control will be performed to evaluate the necrotic area. If necessary, additional HIFU lesions will be performed during the same session. In case of residual tumor demonstrated during control biopsies, additional treatment of this tumor with focal HIFU may be proposed. Patients will also have PSA (Prostate-Specific Antigen) dosage, MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) exam, questionnaires and prostatic biopsies during their follow up. If the patient decides to participate in the ancillary study, a blood test (for immunological analyzes and detection of CTC (circulating tumor cells)) and a urine test (for PCA3 (The prostate cancer antigen 3 gene) test) will be performed during their follow up.</description>
