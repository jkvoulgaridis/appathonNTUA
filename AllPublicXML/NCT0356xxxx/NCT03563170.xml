  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1b/2 study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of metronomic combination
      therapy in subjects with advanced, unresectable, and untransplantable HCC.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Treatment will be administered in two phases, an induction and a maintenance phase. Subjects
      will continue induction treatment for up to 1 year. Those who have a CR in the induction
      phase will enter the maintenance phase of the study. Subjects who experience ongoing SD or an
      ongoing PR at 1 year may enter the maintenance phase at the Investigator's and Sponsor's
      discretion. Subjects may remain in the maintenance phase of the study for up to 1 year.
      Treatment in the study will be discontinued if the subject experiences confirmed PD or
      unacceptable toxicity (not corrected with dose reduction), withdraws consent, undergoes liver
      transplantation or surgical resection, or if the Investigator feels it is no longer in the
      subject's best interest to continue treatment. Subjects with an initial assessment of PD may,
      at the discretion of the Investigator, continue to receive study treatment until PD is
      confirmed. The maximum time on study treatment is 2 years.

          1. Age ≥ 18 years.

          2. Able to understand and provide a signed informed consent that fulfills the relevant
             IRB or Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) guidelines.

          3. Histologically-confirmed advanced, unresectable and untransplantable HCC.

          4. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 to 1.

          5. Have at least 1 measurable lesion of ≥ 1.0 cm.

          6. Must have Child-Pugh class A only.

             following the conclusion of the most recent anticancer treatment and be willing to
             release the specimen for prospective and exploratory tumor molecular profiling. If an
             historic specimen is not available, the subject must be willing to undergo a biopsy
             during the screening period, if considered safe by the Investigator. If safety
             concerns preclude collection of a biopsy during the screening period, a tumor biopsy
             specimen collected prior to the conclusion of the most recent anticancer treatment may
             be used.

          8. Must be willing to provide blood samples prior to the start of treatment on this study
             for prospective tumor molecular profiling and exploratory analyses.

          9. Must be willing to provide a tumor biopsy specimen 8 weeks after the start of
             treatment for exploratory analyses, if considered safe by the Investigator.

         10. Ability to attend required study visits and return for adequate follow-up, as required

             non-sterile male subjects must agree to use a condom for up to 4 months after
             treatment. Effective contraception includes surgical sterilization (eg, vasectomy,
             tubal ligation), two forms of barrier methods (eg, condom, diaphragm) used with
             spermicide, intrauterine devices (IUDs), and abstinence.

             disease, or autoimmune disease associated with lymphoma).

          3. History of organ transplant requiring immunosuppression.
