  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent studies have shown positive results in the application of phototherapy for the
      improvement of performance and acceleration of the healing process of the body homeostasis.
      Among the methods used to assess the recovery post-exercise has cardiac autonomic modulation
      assessed by heart rate variability (HRV), a tool widely used in sports to evaluate medium
      global behavior of the autonomic nervous system. Objective: analyze and compare the effect of
      a special protocol of phototherapy using different light sources interacting with a combined
      training with an autonomic modulation of heart rate in different moments (baseline; tracking
      daily; recovery post-exercise and after training). Method: 45 male participants will be
      allocated from a stratified randomization into three groups: control (n=15), placebo (n=15)
      and group special protocol of phototherapy (n=15). Participants will perform a combined
      training of sprints and squats twice a week for twelve weeks divided into two phases. The
      application of phototherapy and placebo was administered in phase 2, after sprints and just
      before the squat. The phototherapy was used combine different light sources and wavelength
      (red and infrared). Was analyze HRV in five moments: baseline; traking daily; week target of
      phase I and II; after training. The weeks target consist of training sessions with greater
      energy expenditure (largest intensity). The sphericity of the data was tested by Mauchly
      test. In case of violation of the sphericity assumption, the correction of Greenhouse-Geisser
      was performed. The data was analyzed using analysis of variance for repeated measures
      (Bonferroni post-test), which provide information on the effects of time, group and
      interaction. All statistical analyzes assume the significance level of 5%.
