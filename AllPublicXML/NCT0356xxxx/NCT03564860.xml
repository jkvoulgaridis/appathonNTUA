  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm, non-randomized, non-blinded study designed to collect device data in
      patients with permanent His bundle (HB) pacing lead and an existing Abbott permanent
      pacemaker, defibrillator, or cardiac resynchronization device. Prospective data collection
      includes surface electrocardiograms, intracardiac electrograms, and pacing parameters,
      recorded during a patient visit. Additional retrospective data collection includes procedural
      data during the HB pacing lead and device implant.

      Up to 200 subjects will participate in this clinical investigation. The clinical
      investigation will be conducted at up to 8 centers worldwide.

      The total duration of the clinical investigation is expected to be 1 year, including
      enrollment and data collection from all subjects.
