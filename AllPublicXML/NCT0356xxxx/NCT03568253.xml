  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective is the longitudinal follow-up and comparison of the maintenance of the
      dental filling materials up to 24 months using the HVGIC IonoStar Plus versus Bulk X-Tra -Fil
      composite (Futurabond U adhesive system). 150 patients will be recruited in the Mafate dental
      health center. Patients with minimum 2 carious lesions (or multiple of 2, maximum 6) class I
      or II moderate not including the cusps, and touching the outside part of the middle of
      dentin. Assignment period will be 4 years: Inclusion period 18 months with 2 years following
      (6-month, 1 year and 2 years checking) and 3 months for statistical analysis and publications
      process Estimation of the parameters associated with a failure of the restoration at 24
      months will follow the FDI scores. The Secondary objectives are to evaluate the caries risk
      of isolated population thanks to Cambra application and estimate the concordance of the
      judgment of maintaining the restoration between the expert in-situ and experts based on the
      images remotely.
