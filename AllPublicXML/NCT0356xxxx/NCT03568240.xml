  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to examine whether voice acoustic properties has an influence on
      sleep apnea. Sleep apnea syndrome is defined as a sudden stop of more than ten seconds
      multiple times during sleep. The syndrome is common especially among men and occurs in 2%-4%
      of the population aged 30-60. The syndrome diagnosis is performed by an ENT (Ear, Nose and
      Throat) physician. The diagnosis is based on evaluation of anatomical structures in the sound
      path (nose and throat, jaw, pharynx and oral cavity) and a Polysomnography (PSG) test which
      quantifies the number and duration of breathing pauses during night sleep and additional
      parameters that monitor sleep. The syndrome has many negative consequences for those who
      suffer from it, including fatigue , lack of concentration, hypertension, diabetes ,heart
      disease, stroke and even death. Therefore, early diagnosis is important.
