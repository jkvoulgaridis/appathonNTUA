    <textblock>
      This study investigates the effectiveness of self-help, web-based programs to improve
      romantic relationships and related outcomes. Couples will be randomly assigned to complete
      the OurRelationship program, the ePREP program, the OurRelationship program with the addition
      of a coach, the ePREP program with the addition of a coach, or a wait-list control group and
      followed for six months.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nationwide, lower-income (LI) couples (those with household incomes &lt;200% of the federal
      poverty level) - many of whom are also African American, Hispanic/Latino, or rural couples -
      face numerous challenges to their relationships. Chief amongst those challenges are: 1)
      higher risk of relationship problems and 2) lack of access to effective relationship services
      to prevent or intervene with relationship distress. Compared to higher-income couples, LI
      married and cohabiting couples are significantly more likely to divorce or separate and
      report lower relationship quality. Unfortunately, LI couples are least likely to receive
      interventions to prevent or solve relationship problems. To overcome these barriers, we
      propose to test the effectiveness of two effective web-based curricula - OurRelationship and
      PREP Online.

      A total of 1,246 LI couples will be recruited nationwide and randomly assigned to the ePREP
      program, the OurRelationship program, the ePREP program plus a coach, the OurRelationship
      program plus a coach, or a wait-list control group and followed for six months. Once randomly
      assigned to group, couples will be assessed at one month, two months, four months, and six
      months following randomization. After couples randomized to the wait-list control group
      finish their waiting period, they will be able to select the program they would like to
      complete (OurRelationship or ePREP) but will not complete research assessments during or
      following their participation in the program.

    <intervention_model_description>The model is a partial/limited SMART design. Couples are initially randomly assigned to one of five groups - a waitlist control, the ePREP program (with and without a coach) and the OurRelationship program (with and without a coach). Following initial randomization, couples initially assigned to complete either program without a coach and who are not completing activities in a timely manner will be re-randomized to either continue without a coach or received a coach.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The ePREP program is based on the in-person Prevention and Relationship Enhancement Program. The ePREP program consists of six sections of material. In each section, new information and skills are presented, videos demonstrate real couples practicing the skills, participants are encouraged to discuss the information in the context of their own relationship, and a multiple choice quiz reiterates and summarizes the section. In addition to the core educational materials, couples are asked to complete six additional online and offline homework assignments (one per week), each lasting approximately one hour. Participants who do not complete activities in a timely manner will be re-randomized to either continue without a coach or to receive a coach.</description>

    <description>The OurRelationship program is based on Integrative Behavioral Couple Therapy and encourages couples to select, understand, and solve a relationship problem. Partners complete the majority of the web-based program on their own and come together for three key conversations with their partner. The first conversation between partners centers on discussing possible core relationship issues and jointly deciding on the problem(s) to focus on during the program. During the second conversation, both partners' previous written responses are displayed on the screen and conversation is encouraged. During the final conversation, couples share their strategies to decrease stress, improve patterns of communication, and engage in problem-solving exercises specific to their core issue(s). Couples also have four, brief video or phone calls with a coach throughout the program.</description>
