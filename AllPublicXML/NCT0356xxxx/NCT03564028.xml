  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterised by non-reversible bronchial
      obstruction associated with systemic disorders and comorbid factors. Dynamic hyperinflation
      during an exercise increase dyspnea and can reduce exercise capacity. Stair climbing is
      associated with prolonged dynamic hyperinflation and severe dyspnea in COPD patients. The aim
      of this study is to carry out the effect of an energy conservation technique on dyspnea to
      facilitate stair climbing.
