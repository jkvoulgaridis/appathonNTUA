      This is a research study designed to help identify preeclampsia in pregnant women earlier,
      and possibly lead to better treatment for women preeclampsia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is a paucity of biomarkers to predict preeclampsia and for predicting the severity of
      preeclampsia. This study was designed to identify novel biomarkers for both the prediction of
      preeclampsia in previously normal pregnancies and for the prediction of the severity of
      preeclampsia in preeclamptic women. The investigators plan to perform targeted testing for
      markers that the investigators predict based on their findings or based on available
      published evidence and the investigators also plan testing for novel markers using various
      approaches such as proteomics, lipidomics and genomics. The targeted markers will include
      Aquaporin 4 (AQP4), soluble aquaporin fragments, chemokines, and halogenated fatty acids in
      the plasma and/or spinal fluid. Aquaporin fragments and AQP4 have been hypothesized to
      correlate with severe headaches which are complications of severe preeclampsia. The
      investigators found in their murine studies that there is a correlation between the presence
      of halogenated fatty acids in the plasma and elevated blood pressure in a murine model of
      preeclampsia. The approaches will complement the targeted analyses to identify novel markers
      that have not been predicted yet.
