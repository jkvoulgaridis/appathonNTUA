  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The PROCTO trial is a double-blind randomized, placebo-controlled, 24-week, comparative,
      exploratory phase II proof of concept trial. The trial will be conducted with 2 treatment
      groups as a parallel group comparison and will serve to compare a 7500 TSO regimen vs.
      placebo for achieving clinically meaningful responses in Ulcerative Colitis.

    <description>The proportion of TSO patients, compared with placebo patients (ie. a proportional difference), who obtain a reduction of 3 or more full MAYO (not an abbreviation) score steps between the baseline visit and the end of trial visit (week 24). The full MAYO score (range 0-12) is the sum of 4 clinical scores (stool frequency, rectal bleeding, findings on endoscopy, physician's global assessment) each scored with a value 0 (normal), 1, 2, or 3 (worst).</description>

             confirmed by an index sigmoidoscopy

          5. Mayo-score between 6 and 10 and including 6 and 10 corresponding to moderately active
             disease

          6. Calprotectin ≥ 250 µg/g and an endoscopic Mayo score ≥ 2

          7. Negative pregnancy test in females of childbearing potential and the use of an
             acceptable effective method of contraception

          8. No treatment or if treated with 5-Aminosalicyl acid (5-ASA): 5-ASA ≥ 8 weeks with a
             stable dose for at least 4 weeks both oral and rectal use

          9. Tapered down from last oral steroid ≥ 4 weeks ago

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Disease extension corresponding only to E1 (proctitis), i.e. less than 15 cm from the
             anal verge

          2. Bowel surgery, except appendectomy and removal of polyps

          3. Septic complications

          7. Abnormal renal function (Creatinine &gt; ULN) at screening

          8. Any severe concomitant cardiovascular, renal, endocrine, or psychiatric disorder,
