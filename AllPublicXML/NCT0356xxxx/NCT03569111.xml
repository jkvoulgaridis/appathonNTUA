    <textblock>
      The purpose of this investigation is to characterize the safety and performance of the
      Emprint™ Ablation Catheter Kit with Thermosphere™ Technology in clinical use.

      This is a prospective, single-arm, multicenter, non-randomized study. Up to 3 sites in up to
      3 countries will enroll up to 30 subjects in total. The study is designed to characterize the
      safety and performance of the bronchoscopic ablation procedure using the Emprint™ Ablation
      Catheter Kit with Thermosphere™ Technology.

      The primary objective of this prospective, single-arm, multicenter, non-randomized study is
      to characterize the safety of the Emprint™ Ablation Catheter Kit with Thermosphere™
      Technology device in subjects undergoing lung ablation procedures.

      The primary endpoint is the composite rate of adverse events related to the Emprint™ Ablation
      Catheter Kit with Thermosphere™ Technology through 1-month follow-up.

      The following secondary endpoints will be evaluated:

        -  Composite rate of serious adverse events related to the Emprint™ Ablation Catheter Kit
           with Thermosphere™ Technology through 1-month follow-up.

        -  Composite rate of all adverse events related to the procedure or study devices through
           1-month follow-up.

        -  Composite rate of all serious adverse events related to the procedure or study devices
           through 1-month follow-up.

        -  Patient satisfaction and pain (Bronchoscopic Ablation Patient Pain and Satisfaction
           Survey)

        -  Quality of life (EQ-5D Scale)

        -  Technical success

        -  Technique efficacy

    <description>Technical success: An evaluation of whether the lung nodule was treated according to the study protocol as determined at the immediate post-procedural timepoint. This is in contrast to procedures in which the protocol could not be executed completely, either for technical reasons or for reasons related to comorbid disease.</description>
