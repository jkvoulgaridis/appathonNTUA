  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to test if treatment with the trial drug, tralokinumab, can
      affect the body's immune response to vaccines. The trial will also evaluate the efficacy of
      tralokinumab when it is given concomitantly with vaccines.

      The trial includes a screening period of 2 to 6 weeks, a treatment period of 16 weeks (Weeks
      0 to 16), and a 14-week off-treatment follow-up period for the assessment of safety (Weeks 16
      to 30). Eligible subjects may transfer to an open-label, long-term trial at Week 16 or later.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects with atopic dermatitis (AD) will be treated with either tralokinumab or dummy
      treatment (placebo) for 16 weeks. All subjects will receive 2 vaccines at Week 12. The
      vaccines are:

        1. Tetanus (lockjaw), diphtheria (infection of the nose and throat), and pertussis
           (whooping cough) vaccine. This combination vaccine is also known as the Tdap vaccine and
           is used to prevent these 3 diseases.

        2. Meningococcal vaccine. This vaccine is used to prevent meningococcal diseases (infection
           of the brain and spinal cord) and blood poisoning.

      The primary objective of the trial is to demonstrate non-inferiority of tralokinumab versus
      placebo with respect to immune responses to concomitantly administered vaccines.

      The secondary objective is to evaluate efficacy of tralokinumab concomitantly administered
      with vaccines.

    <masking_description>Neither the subject nor any of the investigator or LEO staff who are involved in the treatment or clinical evaluation and monitoring of the subjects will be aware of the treatment received. The packaging and labelling of tralokinumab/placebo will contain no evidence of their identity.
Since tralokinumab and placebo are visually distinct and not matched for viscosity, they will be handled and administered by a qualified, unblinded healthcare professional at the trial site who will not be involved in the management of trial subjects.</masking_description>

    <description>The IGA is an instrument used in clinical trials to rate the severity of the subject's global atopic dermatitis and is based on a 5-point scale ranging from 0 (clear) to 4 (severe).</description>

    <description>The EASI is a validated measure used in clinical practice and clinical trials to assess the severity and extent of atopic dermatitis.
The EASI is a composite index with scores ranging from 0 to 72, with higher values indicating more severe and/or more extensive condition.</description>
