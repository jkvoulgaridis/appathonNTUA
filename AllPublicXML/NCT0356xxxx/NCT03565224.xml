      Prospective Follow-up study of CeSPACE XP coated PEEK cages for the treatment of degenerative

      Anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) has been accepted as the standard procedure
      for the treatment of myelopathy and radiculopathy in the cervical spine. A tricortical iliac
      crest bone graft is the traditional inter-body fusion material that can show perfect bony
      fusion and maintain the patency of the neuroforamen. However, donor site complications were
      reported in fusion with an iliac bone graft, such as subcutaneous hematomas, infections, and
      chronic wound pain.

      Currently, the titanium cage and polyetheretherketone (PEEK) cage are the two most common
      cages in clinical practice. The ideal cage should lead to a high fusion rate and prevent
      complications, such as subsidence and loss of correction.

      Even though a titanium cage can provide long-term stabilization, increase lordosis, and
      increase foramina height compared with the iliac bone graft, some inferior clinical outcomes
      appeared in clinical practice. Loss of correction is a major complication of subsidence that
      may eventually affect cervical spinal function after the operation.

      A modulus of elasticity close to cortical bone might contribute to advantages in stress
      distribution and load sharing, which can contribute to a lower subsidence rate and, thus,
      better clinical results, making PEEK cages more welcomed by surgeons.

      It is supposed, that in the cervical fusion procedure, a porous coating of a PEEK cage will
      lead to favourable results. Therefore, the present study intends to show these results, in a
      larger patient cohort who received such a coated cervical cage.

    <measure>Neck Disability Index (NDI) during Follow-Up</measure>
    <time_frame>Once between 1 to 4 years postoperative</time_frame>
    <description>The Neck Disability Index(NDI) is a modification of the Oswestry Low Back Pain Disability Index . It is a patient-completed, condition-specific functional status questionnaire with 10 items including pain, personal care, lifting, reading, headaches, concentration, work, driving, sleeping and recreation. The NDI has sufficient support and usefulness to retain its current status as the most commonly used self-report measure for neck pain. The NDI can be scored as a raw score or doubled and expressed as a percent. Each section is scored on a 0 to 5 rating scale, in which zero means 'No pain' and 5 means 'Worst imaginable pain'. All the points can be summed to a total score.</description>

    <description>Patient self-reported Neck Pain measured by Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). The VAS is a psychometric response scale which can be used in questionnaires. It is a measurement instrument for subjective characteristics or attitudes that cannot be directly measured. When responding to a VAS item, respondents specify their level of agreement to a statement by indicating a position along a continuous line between two end-points.</description>
