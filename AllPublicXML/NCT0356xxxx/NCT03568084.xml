      Objective: To evaluate the effect of a multicomponent physical activity program, compared
      with the usual medical practice, to reverse prefrailty by Fried in people over 70 years, one
      year after the end of the intervention.

      Objective: To evaluate the effect of a multicomponent physical activity program, compared
      with the usual medical practice, to reverse prefrailty by Fried in people over 70 years, one
      year after the end of the intervention.

      Location: primary care setting (Madrid Region).

      Population: non-dependent and pre-frailty patients ≥ 70 years old, who attend the health
      centers included in the study.

      Design: Randomized parallel group multicenter clinical trial. Randomization unit and Unit of
      analysis: Patient.

      Intervention: multicomponent physical activity program (MEFAP) with 12 weekly sessions of an
      hour and a half which includes 1) briefing 2) exercises for improving aerobic resistance,
      muscle strength, proprioception -balance and flexibility and 3) delivery of exercise chart to
      do at home (two times per week).

      Main measures: Main variable: pre-frailty according to Fried phenotype. Secondary variables:
      sociodemographic, clinical and function variables; adherence, user satisfaction, quality of
      life.

      Analysis: It will be carried out an analysis by intention to treat comparing the
      retrogression from pre-frailty (1 or 2 Fried criteria) to robust (0 Fried criteria) at the
      end of the intervention, 6 months after the intervention and one year after the intervention.
      Cumulative incidence, Relative Risk and Number Needed to Treat with a 95% Confidence
      Interval. A Generalized Estimating Equation logit model will be adjusted to analyze the
      associated factors.
