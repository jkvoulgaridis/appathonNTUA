    <textblock>
      Study RAMES is a multicentre, double-blind, randomized Phase II study exploring the efficacy
      and evaluating the safety of the addition of ramucirumab to gemcitabine as the second-line
      treatment of patients with diffuse pleural mesothelioma. Patients will be randomly assigned
      (1:1) to receive intravenous gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 on days 1 and 8 every 21 days with
      placebo or combined with intravenous ramucirumab 10 mg/Kg (ramucirumab group) on day 1 of a
      21 day cycle until PD. Randomisation will be done via a centralized system and will
      stratified by performance status (0-1 vs 2), age (≤70 vs &gt;70), histology (epithelioid vs
      others), time to progression (TTP) after a previous treatment (first line therapy, adjuvant
      or neoadjuvant therapy) (&lt; 6 months vs ≥6 months).

               2. Patients who have had one or more components of first-line chemotherapy
                  discontinued because of toxicity, but continued to receive the other

             in Solid Tumors, Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) (Eisenhauer et al. 2009 Baseline tumor
             assessment should be performed using a high resolution computed tomography (CT) scan
             using intravenous and oral contrast unless clinically contraindicated. Magnetic

             highly effective method of birth control during the study and for 12 weeks following
             the last dose of study treatment. A highly effective method of birth control is
             defined as one that results in a low failure rate when used consistently and
             correctly.

             continues to experience elevated blood pressure (systolic &gt;160 mmHg and/or diastolic
             &gt;100 mmHg) despite medications).
