  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Feasibility (patient perspective)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0 (baseline)</time_frame>
    <description>Assess the feasibility of telehealth-delivered Cognitive Behavioral Stress Management from the patient perspective using participation rates (i.e., number of people interested and consented into the study).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Feasibility (clinician perspective)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>Assess the feasibility of telehealth-delivered Cognitive Behavioral Stress Management from the clinician perspective using the Structured Assessment of Feasibility (SAFE; 16 items). The first 8 items provide information about barriers to implementation and the second 8 items provide information about enablers to implementation. It is recommended that no overall summary score be used, as this scale is designed to highlight barriers and facilitators that future programs should consider if they decide to continue or begin implementing this intervention.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Acceptability (patient perspective 1 of 2)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>Assess the acceptability of telehealth-delivered Cognitive Behavioral Stress Management from the patient perspective using participation rates (i.e., telehealth sessions completed, dropouts).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Acceptability (patient perspective 2 of 2)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>Assess the acceptability of telehealth-delivered Cognitive Behavioral Stress Management from the patient perspective using the Acceptability Scale (12 items; 5 = strongly agree, 1 = strongly disagree), which was adapted specifically for this study. A mean acceptability score will be computed from these 12 items.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Satisfaction (patient perspective 1 of 2)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>Assess the satisfaction of telehealth-delivered Cognitive Behavioral Stress Management from the patient perspective. Satisfaction measured using the Satisfaction Scale (8 items; 5 = strongly agree, 1 = strongly disagree), which was adapted specifically for this study. A mean satisfaction score will be computed from the 8 items.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Satisfaction (patient perspective 2 of 2)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>Assess the satisfaction of telehealth-delivered Cognitive Behavioral Stress Management from the patient perspective using 4 open-ended questions designed specifically for this study. A qualitative summary will be provided based on responses to the open ended questions.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Anxiety symptom improvement</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 20</time_frame>
    <description>Assess changes in anxiety throughout study using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item Scale (GAD-7), which asks participants to rate how much they have been bothered by anxiety symptoms over the past 2 weeks (7 items, 0 = not at all, 1= several days, 2= more than half the days 3 = nearly every day). A total score will be created by summing the scores of the 7 items.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Depression symptom improvement</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 20</time_frame>
    <description>Assess changes in depression throughout study using the Patient Health Questionnaire 9-item Scale (PHQ-9), which asks participants to rate how much they have been bothered by depression symptoms over the past 2 weeks (9 items, 0 = not at all, 1= several days, 2= more than half the days 3 = nearly every day). A total score will be created by summing the scores of the 9 items.</description>

    <description>Participants randomized into the telehealth arm will receive up to 7 one-hour telehealth visits with the study psychologist. The first six sessions will focus on cognitive behavioral stress management topics and the seventh session is optional, focusing on lung transplant readiness. Participants will fill out questionnaires every other week (baseline, week 2, week 4, week 6, week 8) and during a 3-month follow-up (week 20). Participants will wear an actigraphy watch to track sleep and movement for one week at a time during baseline, week 8, and week 20.</description>

    <description>Participants randomized into the TAU arm will not receive any telehealth visits during the 8-week intervention phase. Participants will fill out questionnaires every other week (baseline, week 2, week 4, week 6, week 8) and during a 3-month follow-up (week 20).
Participants will wear an actigraphy watch to track sleep and movement for one week at a time during baseline, week 8, and week 20.</description>
