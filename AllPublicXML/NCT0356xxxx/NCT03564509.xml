  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this phase 2 dose-ranging trial is to investigate the effects of FE 999302 on
      parameters influencing pregnancy rates in women undergoing Controlled Ovarian Stimulation
      (COS) with follitropin delta in a long gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist
      protocol.

      Furthermore, the study intends:

        -  To investigate the safety of FE 999302 in women undergoing COS with follitropin delta in
           a long GnRH agonist protocol.

        -  To investigate the potential immunogenicity of FE 999302 in subjects undergoing COS with
           follitropin delta in a long GnRH agonist protocol.

        -  To estimate the impact of body weight on FE 999302 exposure in subjects undergoing COS
           with follitropin delta in a long GnRH agonist protocol.
