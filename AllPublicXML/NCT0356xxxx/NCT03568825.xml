    <textblock>
      Response Surface Pathway (RSP) design was previously developed for dose-finding studies with
      one interventional and one response variable, but RSP to higher dimensions is requested. The
      aim of this study is to introduce and evaluate the RSP design with two interventional and one
      response variable exemplified by estimating Minimum Efficacy Dose (MED) of Osteopathic Manual
      Therapy (OMT) in treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).

      15 GERD patients, divided in three design-level with three, five and seven patients. The
      study was performed as a two-dimensional randomized, between-patient RSP designed multicenter
      study with two interventional- and one response variable. The interventional variables
      &quot;Number of OMT's&quot; and &quot;Treatment Interval&quot; with common response variable formed two
      independent one-dimensional randomized between-patient RSP studies. The response variable was
      the percent reduction in sum of the five GERD score from baseline. Three GERD patients were
      allocated on the first design level given six OMT with five days' interval. Based on results
      obtained in the first and second design level, five patients were included to the second
      design level and seven to the third.

    <intervention_model_description>The study is a RSP designed multicenter study with two interventional- and one response variable. The two-interventional variable were Number of OMTs and Interval in days between each treatment. The GERD variables were degrees of Heartburn, Chest pain, Acid in mouth, Epigastric pain and &quot;Thoracic pain&quot;. The response variable were percent reduction in sum of the GERD variables from baseline in 4 categories. Each of the two RSP designs consisted of three dose levels. Three GERD patients were allocated to the first design level given six OMT with five days' interval. Based on the results obtained from the first design level, five patients were subsequently included to the second design level. The number of OMT's and interval between each treatment was separately determined. Seven patients were included to the third design level and given number of OMT's and interval between treatments calculated based on results obtained from the second design level.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The five GERD variables recorded at baseline and one week after the last treatment were degrees of &quot;Heartburn&quot;, &quot;Chest pain&quot;, &quot;Acid in mouth&quot;, &quot;Epigastric pain&quot; and &quot;Thoracic pain&quot;, each recorded on a 10 cm VAS. The response variables were percent reduction in sum of the five GERD variables from baseline.</description>
