      The purpose of this trial is to investigate the mechanisms leading to weight gain during CPAP
      treatment for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obesity and obstructive sleep apnea share a bidirectional relationship. While obesity is a
      major risk factor for OSA, OSA may contribute to weight gain. Recent evidence suggests that
      OSA treatment is associated with weight gain. The mechanisms involved in weight gain after
      OSA treatment are not known. The purpose of this study is to determine the mechanisms of
      weight gain during CPAP treatment for severe OSA leads. The investigators hypothesis is that
      CPAP leads to a decrease in energy expenditure and prevents the elimination of extracellular
      fluid that is accumulated during the day. In order to test this hypothesis, 20 patients with
      severe OSA aged between 50 and 80 years old, under regular treatment with CPAP, will be
      invited to participate. Using a cross-over design, the investigators will perform bioelectric
      impedance 5 times over 24 hours in order to assess the circadian effect of fluid accumulation
      in two different conditions: during CPAP treatment and 7 days after CPAP withdrawal. A full
      polysomnography will be performed during CPAP withdrawal to confirm severe OSA and during
      CPAP treatment to confirm adequate control of respiratory events. In addition, basal
      metabolic rate, hematocrit, serum BNP, urinary sodium, creatinine and osmolality will be
      determined in the morning during the CPAP and CPAP withdrawal periods.
