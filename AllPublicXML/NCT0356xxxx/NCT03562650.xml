      This is an intervention study designed to evaluate a text message based safety behavior
      fading treatment for people with social anxiety disorder.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study hopes to assess whether a month long text message based safety behavior fading
      protocol is effective in reducing safety behaviors and social anxiety symptoms. Over the
      course of four consecutive weeks, text messages will be sent to participants the first day of
      the study and every other day for four weeks (14 texts in total). These text messages will
      remind participants to either avoid using their three most engaged in safety behaviors
      (assessed at pre-treatment) or to stay present-focused. The past week frequency of the
      participants' safety behaviors will be assessed at the beginning of pre-treatment,
      post-treatment, and four week follow up assessments Participants will be asked to complete an
      additional online questionnaire for both a post-treatment and a 4-week post-treatment follow
      up assessment. We hypothesize that: 1) the safety behavior group will show a greater overall
      reduction in social anxiety symptoms, 2) that the safety behavior group will show a reduction
      in the frequency of safety behavior use, and 3) that the present-focused group will show an
      increase in mindfulness.
