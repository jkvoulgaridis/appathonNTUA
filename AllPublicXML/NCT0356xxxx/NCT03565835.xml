  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to find out if patients with prostate cancer being treated with the
      medications abiraterone and prednisone can discontinue hormone injections (examples include
      leuprolide, goserelin, triptorelin and degarelix). Abiraterone and prednisone are pills used
      to treat patients with prostate cancer. When abiraterone and prednisone are used, hormone
      injections are usually continued to maintain a low testosterone level in the blood. This
      study is being done to find out if testosterone in the blood will stay low while abiraterone
      and prednisone are used without continued hormone injections.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Abiraterone inhibits the CYP17A enzyme, which is a critical enzyme in androgen biosynthesis.
      Abiraterone has regulatory approval in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer
      (mCRPC) in both chemotherapy-naïve and in the post-docetaxel setting based upon results from
      two randomized phase III studies. Abiraterone is also proven to extend survival in the
      metastatic, hormone-naïve population based on two phase III studies. Abiraterone is a
      castrating agent, but, other than a small first in human study, all clinical studies have
      been done in conjunction with gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues. Maintaining
      castrate level of serum testosterone is critical in the treatment of metastatic prostate
      cancer. It is unknown if GnRH analogues must be continued to maintain castrate levels of
      serum testosterone in patients treated with abiraterone.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. The patient must be able to provide study-specific informed consent prior to study
             entry

          2. Age ≥ 18
