  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to further evaluate the effect of magnesium on the symptoms of
      menopause, specifically vasomotor symptoms (VMS) in breast cancer patients and/or women at an
      elevated risk of breast cancer.

    <textblock>
      Hot flashes are one of the most common symptoms that are experienced in women during
      perimenopause, menopause, and as a result of treatment of cancer such as breast cancer. Hot
      flashes, also known as vasomotor symptoms (VMS) may decrease a woman's quality of life due to
      discomfort, disruption of daily life, interruption of sleep, and worsening of depression.
      Previously, estrogen-based therapy was the primary treatment choice for VMS. However, in
      recent years, this has been considered less favorable due to the increased risk of breast
      cancer associated with estrogen-based therapy.

      While medications such as certain antidepressants, gabapentin and clonidine are available as
      non-hormonal treatment options, they appear to be less effective in comparison to estrogen
      therapy with reported adverse effects.

      Magnesium supplementation has been found to have very promising results in alleviating VMS in
      patients with a history of breast cancer. The goal of this study is to further investigate
      the effects of administering magnesium supplementation in reducing the effects of hot flashes
      in this targeted population. Our aim is to create a controlled trial using different dosages
      of magnesium glycinate in the management of hot flashes. Participants will be asked to
      complete surveys for data collection and analysis.

    <description>The primary endpoint of this study will be the percent change in hot flash frequency from baseline to week 8. A two independent sample z-test (assuming equal variances) or a Wilcoxon rank-sum test will be used for the analysis of this endpoint.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Average change in hot flash frequency from baseline to week 8</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The secondary analysis, we will also look at the average change in hot flash frequency from baseline to week 8 and compare these means using a two-sample t-test or a Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Adverse events (as captured using the NCI CTCAE version 4) will be compared between the two investigational arms using summary statistics. Frequencies of adverse events will be compared using chi-square tests or Fisher's exact tests. Change in QOL (as measured by the MDASI) from baseline to week 8 will be compared for each question between the investigational arms using two sample t-tests or Wilcoxon rank sum tests.</description>

    <description>Prescription for an 8 week supply (+/- 4 days) of Magnesium Glycinate will be sent to the pharmacy for patient pick up. Study Coordinator will then dispense study diaries (Supplementation Diary and Hot Flash Diary) with instructions on how to complete for the eight week study duration. Study Coordinator will discuss upcoming phone calls on Weeks 2-8 to complete the MDASI by phone and the best times to do so with the patient. Coordinator will schedule a return visit with the Patient approximately 9 weeks after the start of the study for follow-up. At follow-up, Coordinator will retrieve Patient Diaries (Hot Flash Diary and Medication Diary), perform supplement reconciliation, and exit Patient from the study.</description>
