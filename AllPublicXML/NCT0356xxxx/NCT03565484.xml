    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess efficacy of 14-day antimicrobial susceptibility test
      guided quadruple therapy for the rescue treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection, then
      comparing it with 14-day personal medication history guided therapy to tell which one has a
      better performance in both efficacy and safety.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Helicobacter pylori (H.pylori), which infects about 50% of the global population, has been
      recognized as a main risk factor of multiple gastric pathology, especially non-cardiac
      gastric cancer. Strong evidence supports that H.pylori eradication is an effective approach
      to reduce the incidence of those pathological processes. Antimicrobial susceptibility test
      can pick out sensitive drugs to kill Helicobacter pylori, and reduce secondary drug
      resistance. But, there is a lack of high quality RCT to compare its efficacy with empirical
      regimen in the rescue treatment.

      This study aims to assess the efficacy of 14-day antimicrobial susceptibility test guided
      quadruple therapy for the rescue treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection. Comparing this
      regimen with 14-day personal Medication History guided therapy to tell which one is better in
      clinic practice. Alterations in H.pylori assosicated dyspepsia and safety outcomes will also
      be evaluated.

    <description>Both intention to treat(ITT) and per-protocol(PP) analyses will be used for the assessment of the eradication rates of Helicobacter pylori infections in two groups. The ITT analysis includes all randomly assigned patients. The PP analysis is limited to patients who take over 80% of the study medications and complete follow-up.</description>

    <description>Patients will take a gastroscopy and 2 biopsies will be attained from antrum and gastric body for H.pylori culture and antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST). The susceptibility of amoxicillin, clarithromycin, metronidazole, levofloxacin, furazolidone and tetracycline will be tested.Then patients with positive culture will be treated with a 14-day quadruple therapy for the H.pylori eradication. The regimen contains rabeprazole 20mg bid, colloidal bismuth pectin 200mg bid, and two sensitive antibiotics determined by AST. Dose of two sensitive antibiotics are listed as follows : amoxicillin 1000mg bid, clarithromycin 500mg bid, tinidazole 500mg tid, levofloxacin 500mg qd, furazolidone 100mg bid, tetracycline 500mg qid.</description>

    <description>Patients will be treated with a 14-day emprical tailored quadruple therapy for the H.pylori eradication. The regimen contains rabeprazole 20mg bid， colloidal bismuth pectin 200mg bid and two antibiotics based on personal medication history. If the patient doesn't have levofloxacin history, he will be treated with amoxicillin 1000mg bid plus levofloxacin 500mg bid. Otherwise, he will be treated with amoxicillin 1000mg bid and furazolidone 100mg bid.</description>
