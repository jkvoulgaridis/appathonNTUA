  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Environmental enteric dysfunction (EED) is a poorly understood condition characterized by
      intestinal inflammation and loss of barrier function that is prevalent in regions of the
      world with inadequate sanitation and hygiene. EED is a major driver of malnourishment, poor
      neurological development, stunting, oral vaccine failure, and infection, affecting 25% of all
      children globally and causing over a million deaths each year.

      Progress towards understanding EED and developing effective interventions has been hampered
      by an inability to evaluate the intestinal mucosa of populations in impoverished regions of
      the world where this condition is endemic. In order to prevent the deleterious and permanent
      sequelae of the disease, there is a need for effective diagnosis and intervention to be
      implemented in EED patients before the age of 2. Currently, the only means for directly
      evaluating the intestine is endoscopy with mucosal biopsy. Unfortunately, endoscopy is
      untenable for the study of EED because of limited resources and the high cost. As a result,
      there is a clear, unmet need for a less invasive tool that can be used in
      low-and-middle-income-countries (LMICs) to evaluate the intestine in population with EED.

      This work is supported by a grant from The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF). The
      overall goal is to provide a minimally invasive means of obtaining detailed infantile
      intestinal tissue information that is needed for the development of effective EED
      interventions. Obtaining biopsies will play a critical role in gathering the detailed
      intestinal tissue information.

      The purpose of this study is to explore the feasibility of utilizing a cryobiopsy probe to
      obtain biopsies in adults.

      This study will test the capacity of a gastrointestinal tract cryobiopsy probe that Tearney
      Lab investigators have designed to obtain biopsies from the upper GI tract.

      A total of twenty (20) subjects, adults 18 years of age and older, scheduled for elective
      esophagogastroduodenoscopy with biopsy will be enrolled in this study.

      A maximum of 3 cryobiopsies per subject will be collected. After each cryobiopsy is complete,
      the endoscopist will then take 1 standard forceps biopsy from the area adjacent to where
      cryobiopsy was performed. A maximum of 3 standard forceps biopsies for research purposes only
      will be taken. Biopsy collection will be performed at the discretion of the endoscopist. The
      standard forceps biopsy sites will also be monitored directly throughout the entire
      experimental procedure. The total experimental procedure time will not exceed 15 minutes.
