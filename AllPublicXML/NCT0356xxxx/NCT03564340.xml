  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objectives of the Dose Escalation Phase are to assess the safety and
      pharmacokinetics (PK) in order to determine a maximally tolerated dose (MTD) or recommended
      phase 2 dose (RP2D) of REGN4018 as monotherapy and in combination with cemiplimab. In the
      Dose Expansion Phase, the primary objectives are to assess the preliminary efficacy of
      REGN4018 as monotherapy and in combination with cemiplimab, (separately by cohort) as
      determined by the objective response rate (ORR) by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
      Tumors (RECIST) 1.1.

      The secondary objectives of the Dose Escalation Phase are to assess the preliminary efficacy
      of REGN4018 as monotherapy and in combination with cemiplimab (separately by cohort) as
      determined by ORR by RECIST 1.1. In the Dose Expansion Phase, the secondary objectives are to
      characterize the safety profile in each expansion cohort and characterize the PK of REGN4018
      as monotherapy and in combination with cemiplimab. In both the Dose Escalation and Dose
      Expansion Phases, secondary objectives are to assess preliminary efficacy of REGN4018 as
      monotherapy and in combination with cemiplimab (separately by cohort) as measured by ORR
      based on immune based therapy RECIST (iRECIST), best overall response (BOR), duration of
      response (DOR), disease control rate, and progression-free survival (PFS) based on RECIST 1.1
      and iRECIST, to assess efficacy of REGN4018 as monotherapy and in combination with cemiplimab
      as measured by CA-125 level and immunogenicity of REGN4018 and cemiplimab.
