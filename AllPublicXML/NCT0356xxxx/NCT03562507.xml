        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologic diagnosis of renal cell carcinoma (any histology except medullary carcinoma
             or collecting duct carcinoma is acceptable) with radiologic or histologic evidence of
             metastatic disease.

          -  Prior treatment with up to one (and only one) anti-VEGF or VEGFR inhibitor (small
             molecule or antibody).

          -  Must have measurable disease as per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors,
             version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) criteria.

          -  Must be of age ≥ 18 years at time of informed consent.

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent.

          -  Karnofsky Performance Status ≥60. (The Karnofsky Performance Status Scale is an
             assessment tool for functional impairment. It can be used to compare effectiveness of
             different therapies and to assess the prognosis in individual patients. In most
             serious illnesses, the lower the Karnofsky score, the worse the likelihood of
             survival.)

          -  Most recent systemic therapy or most recent radiation therapy ≥ 2 weeks of first study
             drug dose.

          -  Recovery to baseline or &lt; Grade 1 CTCAE v.4.03 from toxicities related to any prior
             treatments, unless AE(s) are clinically non-significant and/or stable on supportive
             therapy.

          -  Uncontrolled hypertension defined as blood pressure &gt;150/90 despite at least 2
             anti-hypertensive medication(s) as assessed by 2 blood pressure readings taken at
             least 1 hour apart during screening.

          -  Major surgical procedure or significant traumatic injury within 6 weeks prior to study
             registration (&gt; 6 weeks prior to registration is permitted as long as they have fully

          -  History of gastrointestinal perforation or fistula in the past 6 months, or while
             previously on antiangiogenic therapy, unless underlying risk has been resolved (e.g.

          -  The patient has known hypersensitivity to gelatin or lactose monohydrate.

          -  The patient has received any investigational drug within 28 days prior to registration

             menometrorrhagia not responding to hormonal treatment) ≤ 6 weeks before Cycle 1 Day1.

          -  The patient is on a chronic daily medication known to be a severe or moderate
             inhibitor or inducer by Micromedex of CYP1A2, CYP2C8, or CYP3A4 at registration.

             therapy) or other immunosuppressive agents (such as cyclosporine or methotrexate) and
             any other medications that could potentially impact the efficacy or safety of the
             study as judged by the treating investigator are NOT permitted from time of

          -  Have any condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would compromise the
             ability of the subject to meet or perform study requirements.
