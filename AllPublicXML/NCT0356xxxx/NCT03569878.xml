    <textblock>
      This study evaluates two readily implementable approaches to the delivery of transitional
      care for injured patients treated emergently in US trauma care systems. The two approaches to
      be compared are a multidisciplinary team collaborative care intervention that integrates
      front-line trauma center staff with peer interventionists to trauma surgical team
      notification of patient emotional distress with recommended mental health consultation. The
      collaborative care intervention will be supported by a novel Emergency Department (ED) health
      information exchange technology platform.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Collaborative care models are an established standard of care for treating combined mental
      health and chronic medical conditions in acute and primary care medical settings. However,
      very few interventions exist for the acute injury population transitioning between settings.
      While peer interventionist programs have been instituted for care delivery in many
      conditions, they have not yet been comprehensively integrated into acute post-injury
      interventions. Literature reviews support the need for comparative effectiveness trials of
      health care system interventions targeting high need injured patients with multiple complex
      mental health and medical comorbidities who are at risk for fragmented post-injury health
      service utilization. This study evaluates two readily implementable approaches to the
      delivery of transitional care for injured patients treated emergently in US trauma care
      systems. The two approaches to be compared are a multidisciplinary team collaborative care
      intervention that integrates front-line trauma center staff with peer interventionists to
      trauma surgical team notification of patient emotional distress with recommended mental
      health consultation. The collaborative care intervention will be supported by a novel
      Emergency Department (ED) health information exchange technology platform.

    <time_frame>Baseline injury admission to 12-months post-injury follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Number of emergency visits will be assessed using the Emergency Department Information Exchange (EDIE). More emergency visits are indicative of a worse outcome.</description>

    <measure>Change in Posttraumatic Concern Severity</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline injury admission and 1-, 3-, 6-, 9- and 12-months post-injury follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The severity of patient described post-injury concerns as rated by patients on a 1 through 5 scale; 1 being not at all concerning and 5 being extremely concerning. Higher scores are indicative of a worse outcome. The concern outcome can either be represented as a mean severity score or as a percentage of patients with one or more severe concerns.</description>

    <measure>Change in Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline injury admission and 1-, 3-, 6-, 9- and 12-months post-injury follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will use the PTSD Checklist - Civilian (PCL-C). The scoring of the scale ranges from a minumum of 17 to a maximum of 85, with higher scores indicating a worse outcome. The measure can also provide a rating of symptoms consistent with a diagnosis of PTSD.</description>

    <measure>Change in Functional Status</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline injury admission and 1-, 3-, 6-, 9- and 12-months post-injury follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will use the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form healthy survey (MOS SF-12/36) physical components summary to assess physical function. The minimum and maximum scores are 0-100 with higher scores representing a better outcome.</description>

    <description>The peer-integrated collaborative care intervention includes front-line trauma center staff (e.g., nursing and masters in social work), joined by injured peer interventionists and supervised by an MD (psychiatrist). The collaborative care team will provide case management, behavioral intervention elements, psychopharmacologic medication recommendations as well as 24/7 cell phone coverage for approximately 6 months post-injury. The intervention will be supported by a novel emergency department health information technology platform.</description>
