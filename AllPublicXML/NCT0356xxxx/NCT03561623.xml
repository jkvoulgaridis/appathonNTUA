    <textblock>
      This is a longitudinal, observational study with the aims of comparing spinal cord gray
      matter areas in patients with Post-Polio Syndrome to age and sex matched healthy control
      subjects and to correlate atrophy with metrics of clinical disability.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Post-Polio syndrome (PPS) is characterised by new muscle weakness, pain, and fatigue several
      years to decades after the acute polio infection. Pathomechanisms are not yet fully
      understood.

      This is a longitudinal, observational study. The aims are (a) to detect spinal cord gray (and
      possibly) white matter atrophy in patients with Post Polio Syndrome in comparison to healthy
      age and sex matched control subjects both cross-sectionally and longitudinally and (b) to
      correlate spinal cord gray and white matter atrophy to metrics of clinical disability.

      Investigators will assess 20 patients with Post-Polio syndrome and 20 control subjects at
      baseline and 48 weeks by MRI and clinically including quantitative muscle strength
      assessments.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior paralytic poliomyelitis with evidence of motor neuron loss. This is confirmed by
             history of the acute paralytic illness, signs of residual weakness and atrophy of
             muscles on neuromuscular examination, and signs of motor neuron loss.

          -  a period of partial or complete functional recovery after acute paralytic
             poliomyelitis, followed by an interval (usually 15 years or more) of stable
             neuromuscular function.

          -  slowly progressive and persistent new muscle weakness or decreased endurance, with or
             without generalized fatigue, muscle atrophy, or muscle and joint pain. Symptoms that
             persist for at least a year.

          -  Exclusion of other neuromuscular, medical, and skeletal abnormalities as causes of
             symptoms.

          -  Patients older than 18 years at time of screening

          -  Ambulant

          -  Ability to walk 150 m in the 6 min walking distance (6MWT) with or without one or two
             walking sticks.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Previous (3 months or less) or concomitant participation in any other therapeutic
             trial

          -  known or suspected malignancy

          -  Other chronic disease or clinical relevant limitation of renal, liver, heart function
             according to discretion of investigator
