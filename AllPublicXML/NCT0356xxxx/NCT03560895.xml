  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study will be to test the accuracy of Sonography in determining the
      endotracheal tube size in pediatric patients whether cuffed or un-cuffed.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      -  Children's tracheas have traditionally been intubated with un-cuffed tracheal tubes (TT)
           due to differences between adult and pediatric sub-glottic anatomy and fears that cuffs
           may lead to mucosal damage and subglottic stenosis. Despite this, cuffed TTs are
           increasingly used in pediatric anesthesia. Over the last 20 years, evidence suggests
           that cuffed TT may have advantages over un-cuffed, and are associated with at least
           similar, if not superior, airway outcomes when compared with un-cuffed TT in children.

        -  Formulas based on age and height often fail to reliably predict the proper endotracheal
           tube (ETT) size in pediatric patients. Visualization of the pediatric sub-glottic airway
           diameter by ultrasonography (USG) can enable a practitioner to better predict ETT size,
           preventing unnecessary tube changes and airway trauma. Although ultrasonography is an
           operator-dependent technique, it is relatively simple to learn. A total of approximately
           15 procedures are required for operators to obtain reliable and reproducible
           measurements. Recent reports suggest that the diameter of the subglottic upper airway
           can be determined by ultrasonography in healthy young adults and pediatric patients.
           However, the extent to which ultrasonography can predict optimal ETT size in pediatric
           patients remains under investigation.
