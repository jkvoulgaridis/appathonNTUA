    <textblock>
      Consenting subjects with Bipolar depression will remain under the care of their local
      (psychiatric) care provider and be randomized to a six week course of one of two forms of
      oxcarbazepine (extended release or immediate release. Study outcomes will be assessed based
      on outcome measures administered to the subject at home by a computer simulated rater. Local
      care providers will receive &quot;pre-assessment&quot; reports ahead of each clinical visit, rate the
      Clinical Global Impression for Severity, and evaluate adverse effects. The primary outcome
      variable is &quot;treatment effectiveness&quot; operationally defined as the response rate X the
      completion rate.

      This study will use the CCI Engaged Practice platform (EngagedPractice.Com) and will be
      conducted by a central &quot;meta-site&quot; reviewing eligibility, obtaining consent, randomizing
      subjects to treatment groups, training local care providers (LCP) to function as sub-
      investigators and monitoring outcomes.

      Subjects will be randomized to six weeks of treatment with extended release oxcarbazepine or
      immediate release oxcarbazepine,while remaining under the care of their existing LCP.

      LCP's will receive sub-investigator training for Good Clinical Practice, Human subjects
      protection, and all protocol specified assessments and procedures.

      A computer simulated rater will collect outcomes (including MADRS, YMRS, PHQ-9, and adverse
      effects) ahead of each routine clinical visit and provide Measure-based Guidance o the LCP in
      the form of pre-assessment reports. The primary outcome variable is &quot;treatment effectiveness&quot;
      operationally defined as the response rate X the completion rate.

    <description>Tolerability is defined as the rate of completion without severe adverse effects reported by subject or clinician. The subject will complete an adverse effects self-report module as part of their &quot;Online Pre-assessment&quot; 1-3 days prior to each clinical visit. The clinician will review the pre-assessment and complete their own adverse effect report at each visit. Items rated as severe by either the subject or the clinician will will be counted as severe. Subjects who remain on study medication for 6 weeks without severe adverse effects will be scored as tolerating treatment.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria: The protocol is designed to collect evidence from subjects during the
