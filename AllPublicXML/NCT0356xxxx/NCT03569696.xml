      This trial is designed as a unicenter, single arm phase II trial. The aim of the trial is to
      test whether prognosis of high-risk Aggressive B cell Lymphoma (ABCL) patients who are in
      complete remission (CR) post immunochemotherapy can be improved by 2year nivolumab
      maintenance therapy. Participants will be recruited from Chaim Sheba Medical Center as well
      as from other medical centers in Israel through the Israeli lymphoma group. Therapy will be
      treated in Chaim Sheba Medical Center.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The rationale for prolonged nivolumab therapy in high-risk ABCL patients in CR following 1st
      line standard therapy is based on the hypothesis that the stimulation of immune system by
      Programmed cell death protein 1 (PD1) blockade will also facilitate the eradication of
      minimal residual disease (MRD), that is not apparent by positron emission tomography (PET)
      imaging, and eventually will prevent relapse and improve survival. The Study will include
      adult patients, age ≥18, with high risk (IPI≥3) ABCL, in CR according to PETCT, as defined by
      the Lugano Criteria, following first-line rituximab (R) and anthracycline-containing regimen.
