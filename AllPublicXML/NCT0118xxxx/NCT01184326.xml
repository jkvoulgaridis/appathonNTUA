  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is evaluating the combination of pazopanib and everolimus in patients
      that have a malignancy that is metastatic or unresectable and for which standard curative or
      palliative measures do not exist or are no longer effective, or metastatic or locally
      advanced unresectable kidney cancer. In this research study the investigators are testing the
      safety of the combination of pazopanib and everolimus and finding the appropriate doses to
      use for further studies.

    <textblock>
      This protocol has two parts, Phase I Dose Finding and Phase 1 Expansion. Once the maximum
      tolerated dose has been identified in the Phase I Dose Finding portion, a Phase I expansion
      cohort of patients with metastatic or locally advanced unresectable kidney cancer will be
      enrolled.

    <measure>Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) [Phase I Dose Finding]</measure>
    <time_frame>Participants were assessed for adverse events on days 1 and 15 for cycles 1-2 and every cycle thereafter; The observation period for MTD evaluation was the first 28 days of treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>The MTD of Pazopanib in combination with Everolimus 5 mg PO QD was determined by the number of patients who experience a dose limiting toxicity (DLT). See subsequent primary outcome measure for the DLT definition. The MTD is defined as the highest dose at which fewer than one-third of patients experience a DLT. If no DLTs are observed, the MTD is not reached.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) [Phase I Dose Finding]</measure>
    <time_frame>Participants were assessed for adverse events on days 1 and 15 for cycles 1-2 and every cycle thereafter; The observation period for DLT evaluation was the first 28 days of treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>A DLT was defined as an adverse event (a) with treatment attribution of possible, probable, or definite, and (b) occurs during cycle 1, and (c) meets any of the following criteria: Grade 3 or 4 non-hematologic toxicity excluding: nausea/vomiting controlled with antiemetics, Grade 3 hypertension that resolves to ≤150/90 within 7 days with supportive care, and Grade 3 asymptomatic, clinically insignificant laboratory abnormalities (LDH, alkaline phosphatase due to bone metastases, and asymptomatic hypophosphatemia). Hematologic toxicity: Grade 4 thrombocytopenia, Grade 3 thrombocytopenia with bleeding, Grade 4 neutropenia which persists for &gt;7 days, Grade 4 neutropenia associated with fever &gt;38.5C; Hematologic toxicity excluded lymphopenia or anemia of any grade. Missing more than 5 days of planned doses for drug-related intolerable grade 2 toxicity;Toxicity related to therapy severe enough to require a dose-reduction.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Objective Response Rate [Expansion]</measure>
    <time_frame>TDisease was evaluated radiologically at baseline and every 8 weeks on treatment; Treatment duration was up to 6 cycles in the Dose Level 0 cohort, 14 cycles in the Dose Level -1 cohort and 10 cycles in the expansion cohort (1 cycle=28 days).</time_frame>
    <description>The objective response rate (ORR) was defined as the percentage of participants achieving complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) based on RECIST 1.1 criteria on treatment. Per RECIST 1.1 for target lesions: CR is complete disappearance of all target lesions and PR is at least a 30% decrease in the sum of longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference baseline sum LD. PR or better overall response assumes at a minimum incomplete response/stable disease (SD) for the evaluation of non-target lesions and absence of new lesions.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Grade 4 Treatment-Related Toxicity Rate [Dose Finding]</measure>
    <time_frame>Participants were assessed for adverse events on days 1 and 15 for cycles 1-2 and every cycle thereafter; Treatment duration was up to 6 cycles in the Dose Level 0 cohort and 14 cycles in the Dose Level -1 cohort (1 cycle=28 days).</time_frame>
    <description>Grade 4 treatment-related toxicity rate is the percentage of participants experiencing at least one treatment-related grade 4 adverse event (AE) with treatment attribution of possibly, probably or definite based on NCI Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events version 4 (CTCAEv4) as reported on case report forms.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Median Progression-Free Survival [Expansion]</measure>
    <time_frame>Disease was evaluated radiologically at baseline and every 8 weeks on treatment; PFS follow-up was up to 9.2 months in the expansion cohort.</time_frame>
    <description>Progression-free survival based on the Kaplan-Meier method is defined as the duration of time from study entry to documented disease progression (PD) or death. Participants alive without PD are censored at date of last disease assessment. Per RECIST 1.1 for target lesions: PD is at least a 20% increase in sum longest diameter (LD), taking as reference the smallest sum on study with at least 5 mm absolute increase or the appearance of one or more new lesions. For non-target lesions, PD is appearance of one or more new lesions or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Duration of Response [Expansion]</measure>
    <time_frame>Disease was evaluated radiologically at baseline and every 8 weeks on treatment; PFS follow-up was up to 9.2 months in the expansion cohort.</time_frame>
    <description>Duration of response was calculated as the time from achieving complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) based on RECIST 1.1 criteria on treatment until disease progression. Per RECIST 1.1 for target lesions: CR is complete disappearance of all target lesions and PR is at least a 30% decrease in the sum of longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference baseline sum LD. PR or better overall response assumes at a minimum incomplete response/stable disease (SD) for the evaluation of non-target lesions and absence of new lesions. For target lesions: PD is at least a 20% increase in sum longest diameter (LD), taking as reference the smallest sum on study with at least 5 mm absolute increase or the appearance of one or more new lesions. For non-target lesions, PD is appearance of one or more new lesions or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions.</description>

        <title>Objective Response Rate [Expansion]</title>
        <description>The objective response rate (ORR) was defined as the percentage of participants achieving complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) based on RECIST 1.1 criteria on treatment. Per RECIST 1.1 for target lesions: CR is complete disappearance of all target lesions and PR is at least a 30% decrease in the sum of longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference baseline sum LD. PR or better overall response assumes at a minimum incomplete response/stable disease (SD) for the evaluation of non-target lesions and absence of new lesions.</description>
        <time_frame>TDisease was evaluated radiologically at baseline and every 8 weeks on treatment; Treatment duration was up to 6 cycles in the Dose Level 0 cohort, 14 cycles in the Dose Level -1 cohort and 10 cycles in the expansion cohort (1 cycle=28 days).</time_frame>

          <description>The objective response rate (ORR) was defined as the percentage of participants achieving complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) based on RECIST 1.1 criteria on treatment. Per RECIST 1.1 for target lesions: CR is complete disappearance of all target lesions and PR is at least a 30% decrease in the sum of longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference baseline sum LD. PR or better overall response assumes at a minimum incomplete response/stable disease (SD) for the evaluation of non-target lesions and absence of new lesions.</description>
