  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diagnosis of diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) for decades has relied on imaging
      studies and clinical findings. Histologic confirmation has been absent with surgical biopsy
      of brainstem tumors not believed to have acceptable safety. The prognosis of DIPG has
      remained quite poor and novel therapeutic strategies are needed. This DIPG Biology and
      Treatment Study (DIPG-BATS) study incorporates a surgical biopsy at presentation using strict
      preoperative neurosurgical planning and stratifies participants to receive FDA-approved
      agents chosen on the basis of specific biologic targets. This is the first prospective
      national clinical trial to examine the feasibility and safety of incorporating surgical
      biopsy into potential treatment strategies for children with DIPG.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to estimate the overall survival of children and young
      adults with DIPG in the context of a molecularly based treatment strategy, compared to
      historical controls (COG ACNS0126). Secondary objectives were to determine the safety and
      potential morbidity associated with biopsy of classic DIPGs based on imaging and clinical
      history as well as ability to perform biologic analyses on the biopsy material obtained to
      guide therapy. At study entry, a MRI-guided frameless or frame-based stereotactic biopsy will
      be performed approaching the pontine termentum through a trans-cerebellar or trans-frontal
      route. The exact biopsy location will be determined by the treating neurosurgeon at the
      designated participating site with the goal of minimizing procedural risk. Treatment directed
      based on tumor biopsy results requires classification of patients into 1 of 4 potential
      cohorts: O^6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation status (negative
      versus positive) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) overexpression status (negative
      versus positive).

    <description>Counts any participant experiencing at least one treatment-related grade 3 or 4 adverse event (AE) with treatment attribution of possibly, probably or definite based on NCI Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events version 4 (CTCAEv4) over chemoradiation therapy as reported on case report forms.</description>

    <measure>Median Progression Free Survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Disease assessments using a standard CNS imaging protocol occurred chemoradiation cycles 1 and 2, every other maintenance cycle, every 3 months post-treatment year 1 then annually until PD or therapy change; In this study cohort, follow-up was up to 34m.</time_frame>
    <description>PFS based on the Kaplan-Meier method is defined as the duration of time [months (m)] from study entry to documented disease progression (PD) or death. Participants alive without PD are censored at the date of last disease assessment. For intrinsic pontine brainstem gliomas, only one lesion/mass is present at diagnosis. Comparisons of maximal 2-dimensional measurements, TxW (product of the longest diameter [width (W)] and its longest perpendicular diameter [transverse (T)]) are used to assess response for this target lesion. PD is 25% or more increase, taking as reference the smallest product observed since the start of treatment, or the appearance of one or more new lesions.</description>

          6. Female patients of childbearing potential must have negative serum or urine pregnancy
             test. Patient must not be pregnant or breast feeding.

             treated on this study.

          8. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients must not have any significant medical illnesses that in the investigator's
             opinion cannot be adequately controlled with appropriate therapy or would compromise
             the patient's ability to tolerate this therapy.

          2. Patients receiving any other anticancer or experimental drug therapy.

          3. Patients with disseminated intrinsic diffuse brainstem gliomas in either brain or
             spine (can be based on clinical evaluation).

             inhibitors or inducers of Cytochrome P450 (CYP450), Cytochrome P3A4(CYP3A4) or
             Cytochrome 1A2 (CYP1A2) are ineligible. Lists including medications and substances
             known or with the potential to interact with the CYP450 CYP3A4 or CYP1A2 isoenzymes
             are provided in Appendix I.

          5. Use of hematopoietic growth factors within the 2 weeks prior to initiation of therapy.

          6. Patients with evidence of spontaneous hemorrhage greater than 0.5cm unrelated to
             surgery.

          7. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.

          8. Pregnant women are excluded from this study because bevacizumab, temozolomide and
             erlotinib can have potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there
             is an unknown but potential risk of adverse events in nursing infants secondary to
             treatment of the mother with these agents, breastfeeding should be discontinued.

        <title>Median Progression Free Survival (PFS)</title>
        <description>PFS based on the Kaplan-Meier method is defined as the duration of time [months (m)] from study entry to documented disease progression (PD) or death. Participants alive without PD are censored at the date of last disease assessment. For intrinsic pontine brainstem gliomas, only one lesion/mass is present at diagnosis. Comparisons of maximal 2-dimensional measurements, TxW (product of the longest diameter [width (W)] and its longest perpendicular diameter [transverse (T)]) are used to assess response for this target lesion. PD is 25% or more increase, taking as reference the smallest product observed since the start of treatment, or the appearance of one or more new lesions.</description>
        <time_frame>Disease assessments using a standard CNS imaging protocol occurred chemoradiation cycles 1 and 2, every other maintenance cycle, every 3 months post-treatment year 1 then annually until PD or therapy change; In this study cohort, follow-up was up to 34m.</time_frame>
        <population>The analysis population is comprised of the subset of participants who underwent surgical biopsy, obtained a molecularly-based treatment assignment and started assigned chemoradiation therapy. The PFS was aggregated across cohorts per statistical analysis plan to evaluate the effect of the &quot;molecular strategy&quot;.</population>

            <description>Protocol treatment lasts approximately 52 weeks including a 4-week interim period once radiation therapy is completed and a maintenance phase (cycle duration=28 days).
Treatment directed based on tumor biopsy results requires classification of patients into 1 of 4 potential cohorts: O^6-methylguanine–DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation status (negative versus positive) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) overexpression status (negative versus positive).</description>
