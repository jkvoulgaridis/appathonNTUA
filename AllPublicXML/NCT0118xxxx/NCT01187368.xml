  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multi-center, unblinded, randomized, controlled, and non-inferiority
      study comparing the EVA2 LVAS to the most recent magnetically levitated centrifugal LVAS (HM3
      LVAS).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adult (&gt;18 years old), advanced heart failure NYHA Class IV patients who are refractory to
      advanced heart failure management and meet study Inclusion/Exclusion criteria will be
      enrolled.

      The objective of the study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the EVA2 by
      demonstrating non-inferiority to commercially approved LVADs when used for the treatment of
      refractory NYHA Class IV heart failure.

      Subjects will be followed for 6 months (short-term cohort) and 24 months (long-term cohort)
      after EVA2/HM3 LVAS implantation or until outcome events of transplantation, explantation,
      death or withdrawal, whichever occurs first. Whereas subjects experiencing the outcome events
      of &quot;Severe RHF&quot; and &quot;Disabling stroke&quot; will remain in study follow-up.
