  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This protocol is a single arm phase II multi-center trial evaluating the efficacy of
      Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT) in patients with oligometastatic non-small cell
      lung cancer (NSCLC) with response or stable disease after 4 cycles of first-line
      chemotherapy. The core hypothesis tested is that SBRT after 4 cycles of first-line
      chemotherapy is feasible, safe, provides durable local control of treated lesions and
      improves time to progression compared to historical controls. Patients are eligible for
      enrollment if they have metastatic NSCLC with ≤5 lesions amenable to SBRT.

    <measure>Progression-free Survival</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Actuarial progression-free survival will be determined using the product-limit method of Kaplan and Meier and will be reported with an exact 95% confidence interval. Using the RECIST criteria including progression of the protocol treated tumors, non-protocol treated tumors and the development of new metastatic disease. Only protocol treated tumors will be determined by RECIST defined as complete lesion disappearance or &lt;25%or original size; partial &gt;30% decrease of target lesion; stable &lt;30% decreased of target lesion and; local failure increase &gt;20% of target lesion. Non-protocol tumor progression will be determined by the treating physician. Measured by imaging every 3 months.</description>

    <measure>To Assess Physical Function for This Cohort of Patients</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 3 months after treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Using the Vulnerable Elders Survey (VES-13) A 13-item self-reporting questionnaire includes age, self-rated health, limitations in physical function and disability to assess for deterioration of physical function/health. Scoring for the VES-13 is as follows: Total scores are summed together based on self-rated health (0-1), physical function (0-2), functional disability (0-4), (range from 0 to 7). A total score of 3 or more identifies participants as vulnerable to the risk of decline of physical function.</description>

        <description>Actuarial progression-free survival will be determined using the product-limit method of Kaplan and Meier and will be reported with an exact 95% confidence interval. Using the RECIST criteria including progression of the protocol treated tumors, non-protocol treated tumors and the development of new metastatic disease. Only protocol treated tumors will be determined by RECIST defined as complete lesion disappearance or &lt;25%or original size; partial &gt;30% decrease of target lesion; stable &lt;30% decreased of target lesion and; local failure increase &gt;20% of target lesion. Non-protocol tumor progression will be determined by the treating physician. Measured by imaging every 3 months.</description>

        <title>To Assess Physical Function for This Cohort of Patients</title>
        <description>Using the Vulnerable Elders Survey (VES-13) A 13-item self-reporting questionnaire includes age, self-rated health, limitations in physical function and disability to assess for deterioration of physical function/health. Scoring for the VES-13 is as follows: Total scores are summed together based on self-rated health (0-1), physical function (0-2), functional disability (0-4), (range from 0 to 7). A total score of 3 or more identifies participants as vulnerable to the risk of decline of physical function.</description>
