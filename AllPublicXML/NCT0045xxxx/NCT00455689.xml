  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to examine the impact of hot flushes on sleep, mood, and
      well-being. The investigators will cause hot flushes by giving study participants the hormone
      medication, leuprolide (Lupron), which is a manufactured (artificial) hormone that makes the
      body think that it has reached menopause temporarily. Most women begin to have hot flushes
      within 4 weeks after taking leuprolide and resume menses 3 months later. The investigators
      will administer questionnaires to evaluate changes in sleep and mood over the course of the
      study.

Leuprolide is a widely used gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRHa) that is indicated for treatment of endometriosis, uterine fibroids, precocious puberty, and prostate cancer, and is used off-label for in-vitro fertilization and premenstrual syndrome. In this protocol, leuprolide will be administered once during the mid-luteal phase of the menstrual cycle at a dose routinely used for treatment of endometriosis and uterine fibroids in women.</description>

            <description>Subjects who developed hot flashes after receiving leuprolide acetate (3.75 mg intramuscular injection)
Leuprolide acetate: Leuprolide acetate (Lupron Depot®) 3.75-mg intramuscular injection
Leuprolide is a widely used GnRH agonist that is indicated for treatment of endometriosis, uterine fibroids, precocious puberty, and prostate cancer, and is used off-label for in-vitro fertilization and premenstrual syndrome. In this protocol, leuprolide will be administered once during the mid-luteal phase of the menstrual cycle at a dose routinely used for treatment of endometriosis and uterine fibroids in women.</description>
