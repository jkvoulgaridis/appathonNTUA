      Prior to the implementation of Amendment 1/UK3 the study consisted of 3 phases -
      pre-randomization up to 35 days, up to 84 days placebo-controlled treatment and a 28-day
      observational follow up. After the implementation of Amendment 1/UK3, the study consisted of
      4 phases - pre-randomization up to 35 days, up to 84 days treatment in the placebo controlled
      treatment phase, up to 84 days treatment in the active treatment extension phase and a 28 day
      follow up. Participants who completed the treatment phase prior to implementation of
      amendment 1/UK3 did not have the option of entering the extension phase.

    <measure>Number of Participants With Adverse Events During the Treatment Phase</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The severity of each adverse event (AE) was graded based upon the participant's symptoms according to National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Toxicity Criteria (CTCAE, Version 3.0), on a scale from 1 (Mild AE) to 5 (Death due to AE). Severe AEs are defined as NCI CTCAE grade 3 or higher. AEs related to study drug are those determined by the investigator as suspected to be related to study drug where a temporal relationship of the adverse event to study drug administration made a causal relationship possible, and other medications, therapeutic interventions, or underlying conditions did not provide a sufficient explanation for the observed event. A serious adverse event (SAE) is any AE which: - Resulted in death - Was life-threatening - Required inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization - Resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity - Was a congenital anomaly/birth defect - Constituted an important medical event.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The Medical Outcome SF 36-Item Health Survey, Version 2 is a self-administered instrument that measures the impact of disease on overall quality of life and consists of 36 questions in eight domains (physical function, pain, general and mental health, vitality, social function, physical and emotional health). The summary physical health score included the following subscales: physical functioning, role-physical, bodily pain, and general health. The summary mental health score included other subscales: vitality, social functioning, role-emotional, and mental health. Norm-based scores were used in analyses, calibrated so that 50 is the average score and the standard deviation equals 10, where higher scores are associated with better functioning/quality of life. Each domain is scored by summing the individual items and transforming the scores into a 0 to 100 scale. A higher change from baseline indicates an improvement in better health results or functioning.</description>

DAS28-CRP(3) is derived from the following 3 variables: • 28 tender joint count, (does not include the DIP joints, the hip joint, or the joints below the knee) • 28 swollen joint count • C-reactive protein (CRP) according to the formula: DAS28-CRP(3) = [0.56*√(TJC28) + 0.28*√(SJC28) + 0.36*ln(CRP+1)] * 1.10 + 1.15. DAS28 scores range from 0 to 9.4, where higher scores indicate more disease activity. A EULAR response reflects an improvement in disease activity based on the DAS-28 score. A Good Response is defined as an improvement (decrease) in the DAS28 &gt; 1.2 from Baseline and attainment of a DAS28 score ≤ 3.2. A Moderate Response is defined as either: • an improvement (decrease) in the DAS28 &gt; 0.6 and ≤ 1.2 and a DAS28 score ≤ to 5.1 or, • an improvement (decrease) in the DAS28 &gt; 1.2 and a DAS28 score &gt; 3.2</description>

    <description>Enthesitis is inflammation of the entheses, the sites where tendons or ligaments insert into the bone. Enthesitis is characterized by swelling, pain, and tenderness around the calcaneous, and occasionally by effusion in the bursa associated with this joint. The enthesitis assessment is an evaluation of inflammation at the insertions of the Achilles tendon into the calcaneous and of the plantar fascia into the calcaneous. Inflammation at 1 or more insertions on either the right or left side constituted a positive assessment.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1), Week 12 (Day 85) and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The Medical Outcome SF 36-Item Health Survey, Version 2 is a self-administered instrument that measures the impact of disease on overall quality of life and consists of 36 questions in eight domains (physical function, pain, general and mental health, vitality, social function, physical and emotional health). The summary physical health score included the following subscales: physical functioning, role-physical, bodily pain, and general health. The summary mental health score included other subscales: vitality, social functioning, role-emotional, and mental health. Norm-based scores were used in analyses, calibrated so that 50 is the average score and the standard deviation equals 10, where higher scores are associated with better functioning/quality of life. Each domain is scored by summing the individual items and transforming the scores into a 0 to 100 scale. A higher change from baseline indicates an improvement in better health results or functioning.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Participants were enrolled across 38 sites in Canada, Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Participants were randomized 1:1:1 to either apremilast 40 mg once daily, 20 mg twice daily, or placebo. On Day 85 participants originally randomized to placebo were re-randomized to receive apremilast; participants randomized to apremilast continued on the same dose regimen. Randomization was stratified based on methotrexate use at baseline.</pre_assignment_details>

        <description>The severity of each adverse event (AE) was graded based upon the participant's symptoms according to National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Toxicity Criteria (CTCAE, Version 3.0), on a scale from 1 (Mild AE) to 5 (Death due to AE). Severe AEs are defined as NCI CTCAE grade 3 or higher. AEs related to study drug are those determined by the investigator as suspected to be related to study drug where a temporal relationship of the adverse event to study drug administration made a causal relationship possible, and other medications, therapeutic interventions, or underlying conditions did not provide a sufficient explanation for the observed event. A serious adverse event (SAE) is any AE which: - Resulted in death - Was life-threatening - Required inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization - Resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity - Was a congenital anomaly/birth defect - Constituted an important medical event.</description>

        <description>A PsARC response is defined as improvement from Baseline in at least 2 of the following 4 measures, at least 1 of which must be tender joint count or swollen joint count, and no worsening in any of the 4 measures, according to the following: • At least 30% improvement in the 78 tender joint count, • At least 30% improvement in the 76 swollen joint count, • At least 20% improvement in the patient global assessment of disease activity, measured on a 100 mm visual analog scale (VAS), where 0 mm = lowest disease activity and 100 mm = highest; • At least 20% improvement in the physician global assessment of disease activity, measured on a 100 mm VAS, where 0 mm = lowest disease activity and 100 mm = highest. Participants with no post-baseline PsARC scores were considered non-responders.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Good or Moderate European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) Response Based on Disease Activity Score (DAS28)-CRP(4) at Week 12</title>
        <description>The DAS28 measures the severity of disease at a specific time. DAS28-CRP(4) is derived from the following 4 variables: • 28 tender joint count, (TJC; does not include the DIP joints, the hip joint, or the joints below the knee) • 28 swollen joint count (SJC) • C-reactive protein (CRP) • Patient's global assessment of disease activity (GH) according to the formula: DAS28-CRP(4) = 0.56*√(TJC28) + 0.28*(SJC28) + 0.36*ln(CRP+1) + 0.014*GH + 0.96. DAS28 scores range from 0 to 9.4, where higher scores indicate more disease activity. A EULAR response reflects an improvement in disease activity based on the DAS-28 score. A Good Response is defined as an improvement (decrease) in the DAS28 &gt; 1.2 from Baseline and a DAS28 score ≤ 3.2. A Moderate Response is defined as either: • an improvement (decrease) in the DAS28 &gt; 0.6 and ≤ 1.2 and a DAS28 score ≤ to 5.1 or, • an improvement (decrease) in the DAS28 &gt; 1.2 and a DAS28 score &gt; 3.2</description>

          <title>Percentage of Participants With DAS28-CRP(3) Score of Mild Disease Activity or In Remission at Week 12</title>
          <description>The DAS28-CRP(3) measures the severity of disease derived from the following 3 variables: • 28 tender joint count (does not include the DIP joints, the hip joint, or the joints below the knee) • 28 swollen joint count • C-reactive protein (CRP) DAS28-CRP(3) scores range from 0 to 9.4, where higher scores indicate more disease activity. Mild disease severity is defined as a DAS28-CRP(3) score of ≤ 3.2. In remission is defined as a DAS28-CRP(3) score of ≤ 2.6.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Enthesitis</title>
        <description>Enthesitis is inflammation of the entheses, the sites where tendons or ligaments insert into the bone. Enthesitis is characterized by swelling, pain, and tenderness around the calcaneous, and occasionally by effusion in the bursa associated with this joint. The enthesitis assessment is an evaluation of inflammation at the insertions of the Achilles tendon into the calcaneous and of the plantar fascia into the calcaneous. Inflammation at 1 or more insertions on either the right or left side constituted a positive assessment.</description>

        <title>Time to Relapse of Psoriatic Arthritis During the Observational Follow-up Phase</title>
        <description>Relapse of psoriatic arthritis was defined as a 50% loss of the maximal ACR improvement during the Observation Phase in participants who received apremilast and achieved at least an ACR 20 at their Final Treatment Phase/Early Termination Visit. The time to relapse during the Observational Phase was calculated from the time of maximum ACR reduction and from the date of the Final Treatment Phase visit. Participants classified as responders who did not relapse were censored at the day of the last follow-up.</description>

        <description>The Medical Outcome SF 36-Item Health Survey, Version 2 is a self-administered instrument that measures the impact of disease on overall quality of life and consists of 36 questions in eight domains (physical function, pain, general and mental health, vitality, social function, physical and emotional health). The summary physical health score included the following subscales: physical functioning, role-physical, bodily pain, and general health. The summary mental health score included other subscales: vitality, social functioning, role-emotional, and mental health. Norm-based scores were used in analyses, calibrated so that 50 is the average score and the standard deviation equals 10, where higher scores are associated with better functioning/quality of life. Each domain is scored by summing the individual items and transforming the scores into a 0 to 100 scale. A higher change from baseline indicates an improvement in better health results or functioning.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-DI) at Week 12</title>
        <description>The HAQ-DI is a self-administered instrument consisting of 20 questions in eight categories of functioning which represent a comprehensive set of functional activities - dressing, rising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and usual activities. Each item asks over the past week whether a particular task can be performed. For each item, there is a four-level difficulty scale that is scored from 0 to 3, representing normal (no difficulty) (0), some difficulty (1), much difficulty (2), and unable to do (3). The eight category scores are averaged into an overall HAQ-DI score on a scale from zero (no disability) to three (completely disabled).</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Adverse Events During the Extension Phase</title>
        <description>The severity of each adverse event (AE) was graded based upon the participant's symptoms according to National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Toxicity Criteria (CTCAE, Version 3.0), on a scale from 1 (Mild AE) to 5 (Death due to AE). Severe AEs are defined as NCI CTCAE grade 3 or higher. AEs related to study drug are those determined by the investigator as suspected to be related to study drug where a temporal relationship of the adverse event to study drug administration made a causal relationship possible, and other medications, therapeutic interventions, or underlying conditions did not provide a sufficient explanation for the observed event. A serious adverse event (SAE) is any AE which: - Resulted in death - Was life-threatening - Required inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization - Resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity - Was a congenital anomaly/birth defect - Constituted an important medical event.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With a Psoriatic Arthritis Response Criteria (PsARC) Response at Week 24</title>
        <description>A PsARC response is defined as improvement from Baseline in at least 2 of the following 4 measures, at least 1 of which must be tender joint count or swollen joint count, and no worsening in any of the 4 measures: • At least 30% improvement in the 78 tender joint count, • At least 30% improvement in the 76 swollen joint count, • At least 20% improvement in the patient global assessment of disease activity, measured on a 100 mm visual Analog scale (VAS), where 0 mm = lowest disease activity and 100 mm = highest; • At least 20% improvement in the physician global assessment of disease activity, measured on a 100 mm VAS, where 0 mm = lowest disease activity and 100 mm = highest. Participants with missing data were considered non-responders.</description>

        <description>A modified ACR 70 response was defined as a participant who met the following 3 criteria for improvement: • ≥ 70% improvement in 78 tender joint count (includes 10 additional joints often involved in psoriatic arthritis: the first carpometacarpal [CMC] and the distal interphalangeal [DIP] joints of the fingers); • ≥ 70% improvement in 76 swollen joint count; and • ≥ 70% improvement in at least 3 of the 5 following parameters: ◦ Patient's assessment of pain (measured on a 100 mm VAS); ◦ Patient's global assessment of disease activity (measured on a 100 mm VAS); ◦ Physician's global assessment of disease activity (measured on a 100 mm VAS); ◦ Patient's self-assessment of physical function (Health Assessment Questionnaire - Disability Index [HAQ-DI]); ◦ C-reactive protein. Response at Week 24 was measured as improvement from Baseline (Day 1). Participants with no post-baseline ACR scores were considered non-responders.</description>

        <description>The DAS28 measures the severity of disease at a specific time. DAS28-CRP(4) is derived from the following 4 variables: • 28 tender joint count, (does not include the DIP joints, the hip joint, or the joints below the knee) • 28 swollen joint count • C-reactive protein • Patient's global assessment of disease activity according to the formula: DAS28-CRP(4) = 0.56*√(TJC28) + 0.28*(SJC28) + 0.36*ln(CRP+1) + 0.014*GH + 0.96. DAS28 scores range from 0 to 9.4, where higher scores indicate more disease activity. A EULAR response reflects an improvement in disease activity based on the DAS-28 score. A Good Response is defined as an improvement (decrease) in the DAS28 &gt; 1.2 from Baseline and attainment of a DAS28 score ≤ 3.2. A Moderate Response is defined as either: • an improvement (decrease) in the DAS28 &gt; 0.6 and ≤ 1.2 and a DAS28 score ≤ to 5.1 or, • an improvement (decrease) in the DAS28 &gt; 1.2 and a DAS28 score &gt; 3.2</description>

        <description>Enthesitis is inflammation of the entheses, the sites where tendons or ligaments insert into the bone. Enthesitis is characterized by swelling, pain, and tenderness around the calcaneous, and occasionally by effusion in the bursa associated with this joint. The enthesitis assessment is an evaluation of inflammation at the insertions of the Achilles tendon into the calcaneous and of the plantar fascia into the calcaneous. Inflammation at 1 or more insertions on either the right or left side constituted a positive assessment.</description>

        <title>Time to Relapse of Psoriatic Arthritis After Extension Phase</title>
        <description>Relapse of psoriatic arthritis was defined as a 50% loss of the maximal ACR improvement during the Follow-up Phase in participants who achieved at least an ACR 20 at their Final Extension Phase (Week 24)/Early Termination Visit. The time to relapse during the Follow-up Phase was calculated from the time of maximum ACR reduction and from the date of the Final Extension Phase visit. Participants classified as responders who did not relapse were censored at the day of the last follow-up.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline and Week 12 in SF-36 at Week 24</title>
        <description>The Medical Outcome SF 36-Item Health Survey, Version 2 is a self-administered instrument that measures the impact of disease on overall quality of life and consists of 36 questions in eight domains (physical function, pain, general and mental health, vitality, social function, physical and emotional health). The summary physical health score included the following subscales: physical functioning, role-physical, bodily pain, and general health. The summary mental health score included other subscales: vitality, social functioning, role-emotional, and mental health. Norm-based scores were used in analyses, calibrated so that 50 is the average score and the standard deviation equals 10, where higher scores are associated with better functioning/quality of life. Each domain is scored by summing the individual items and transforming the scores into a 0 to 100 scale. A higher change from baseline indicates an improvement in better health results or functioning.</description>

        <description>The DLQI is a validated, self-administered, 10-item questionnaire that measures the impact of skin disease on participants' quality of life, based on recall over the past week. Domains include symptoms, feelings, daily activities, leisure, work, personal relationships, and treatment. Each question is answered on a scale from 0 (not at all) to 3 (very much) The total score ranges from 0 to 30 where a higher score indicates that a participant's dermatological condition has a greater impact on their daily life.</description>

        <description>The HAQ-DI is a self-administered instrument consisting of 20 questions in eight categories of functioning which represent a comprehensive set of functional activities - dressing, rising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and usual activities. Each item asks over the past week whether a particular task can be performed. For each item, there is a four-level difficulty scale that is scored from 0 to 3, representing normal (no difficulty) (0), some difficulty (1), much difficulty (2), and unable to do (3). The eight category scores are averaged into an overall HAQ-DI score on a scale from zero (no disability) to three (completely disabled).</description>
