  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to provide long-term follow-up care of patients previously enrolled in a
      vaccine study that involved poxviral vectors. Vectors are sequences of genetic material that
      can be used to introduce specific genes into genetic makeup. The study does not involve the
      use of any drug or biologic agent. Participants will undergo an annual health history.
      Because certain viruses enter into cells and create proteins from the viral genes, the type
      of vaccine treatment used is referred to gene therapy. The genes expressed by poxviral
      vectors do not become part of the genetic material left behind. Because gene therapy is a
      somewhat new technology, a prolonged monitoring of patients' health status is necessary,
      according to new specific reporting requirements for harmful events in patients who undergo
      such gene therapy studies. The risk of any long-term negative effects from the gene therapy
      that patients had received is quite small. Still, it is important that there be updates at
      least annually. This annual monitoring of health status will extend for 15 years, according
      to guidelines from the Food and Drug Administration, or for as long as patients are willing
      to participate.

      Patients who received poxviral vectors (vaccinia or fowlpox, or both) at the National Cancer
      Institute, through a trial affiliated with the Laboratory of Tumor Immunology and Biology,
      may be eligible for this study.

      Participants will be involved in the following forms of data collection:

        -  Annual medical history and physical examinations for the first 5 years following the
           last vaccine.

        -  Annual telephone contact during the last 10 years.

        -  Health status check, including primary cancer status, secondary malignancies, neurologic
           disorders, autoimmune disorders, and hematologic disorders.

        -  Blood tests for the presence of HIV antibodies.

        -  Reporting of medical problems, including information on unexpected hospitalizations and
           medications.

      If a participant has died, the study will document the cause of death and autopsy information
      if available.

      This protocol aims to provide long-term follow-up and continued use of research specimens of
      patients previously enrolled on gene transfer or other immunotherapy studies at the National
      Cancer Institute as well as follow-up of subjects at extramural sites receiving these agents
      as part of a multi-site trial. Subjects will undergo an annual health history for up to 15
      years.
