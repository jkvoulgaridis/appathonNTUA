      Objectives

      Noninvasive stimulation of the central and peripheral nervous system, including transcranial
      magnetic stimulation (TMS), transcranial direct and alternating current stimulation (tDCS and
      tACS, respectively) and cutaneous/peripheral nerve stimulation (C/PNS) alone or paired with
      TMS (paired associative stimulation, PAS), has been increasingly used in the investigation of
      cortical plasticity and as a possible adjuvant strategy in neurorehabilitation. It has been
      shown that TMS, tDCS, tACS and C/PNS can modulate motor function in healthy volunteers, as
      well as in patients with neurological disorders such as stroke.

      One fundamental problem is that the optimal parameters of stimulation to modulate motor
      function by all of these techniques are not known. The purpose of this protocol is to explore
      within safe guidelines, the effects of different stimulation parameters on motor cortical
      function, on oscillatory brain dynamics measured with magnetoencephalography (MEG) and
      electroencephalography (EEG), on eye movements, and on fMRI activation. In addition, this
      protocol will be used to train new fellows coming to NINDS Human Cortical Physiology Section
      (HCPS) in the use of TMS, tDCS, tACS and C/PNS techniques.

      We expect that information emerging from these studies will allow us to 1) optimize
      experimental protocols or stimulation parameters to collect pilot data in healthy volunteer
      for future patient-oriented hypothesis-driven protocols,2)to collect pilot data for power
      analysis for future patient-oriented hypothesis driven protocols, and 3) to train new fellows
      in the use of these different methods.

      Study Population

      Up to 1500 healthy volunteers, age 18 and older.

      Design

      Healthy volunteers will receive one or more of the following types of stimulation alone or in
      combination: (1) single- and paired-pulse TMS with inter-stimulus intervals of greater than
      1s and up to 20s and intensities of up to 100% of stimulator output; (2) 1 Hz TMS for up to
      30mins and up to 115% of resting motor threshold (RMT) intensity; (3) tDCS applied at an
      intensity of up to 4 mA for a duration of up to 60mins, as long the total charge does not
      exceed 7.2 C; (4) tACS applied at a peak-to-peak intensity of up to 4 mA for a duration of up
      to 60 minutes, minutes, as long the total charge does not exceed 7.2 C; (5) C/PNS applied
      alone with intensities below 130% of the peripherally-elicited-motor-threshold for up to 2
      hours, or intensities up to 300% of sensory threshold when C/PNS is paired with TMS. All of
      these parameters of stimulation and procedures have safely been used as previously reported
      in the literature. Sham stimulations will be delivered for each modality as scientifically
      needed. Some substudies may involve recording of behavior or brain activity only (such as
      behavioral testing, MRI, and MEG) if brain stimulation targets are unknown. This information
      can help design future brain stimulation protocols.

      Each subject may participate in up to 20 sessions. A single session may last no longer than 8
      hours to allow for initial testing paradigm followed by retests or performing other
      components of the same substudy later in the day. Appropriate rest breaks and meal breaks
      will occur during long sessions. Subjects participate in one experimental session per day
      under this protocol. The 20 experimental sessions will be scheduled over a twenty-year
      period. CTDB is used to track the number of sessions per subject so it does not exceed 20
      sessions. The AIs are responsible for entering the subjects/sessions into CTDB.

      We will test the effects of these different forms of stimulation on motor cortical
      excitability, cognitive and motor behavioral tasks, and brain state measures derived from
      neuroimaging data (i.e. - MRI, fMRI, MEG and EEG). Stimulation may be applied before, after,
      or during physiological (i.e. motor evoked potentials, M-wave, F-wave, or H-Reflexes),
      neuroimaging or behavioral measures.

      Under this protocol, we conduct:

      Exploratory Sub-studies: These substudies are exploratory in nature and are conducted in
      order to develop information to generate better informed future hypotheses and/or power
      analyses. We have set an upper limit of 40 subjects per sub-study.

      Hypothesis-Testing Sub-studies: Hypothesis-testing sub-studies are studies with specific
      hypotheses to be tested. These sub-studies undergo statistical and PIRC review after 6
      subjects per group (e.g., after 12 subjects, 6 per arm, if two groups are studied), before
      additional subjects can be recruited. Together, the P.I. and PIRC will decide whether to
      continue the sub-study with more subjects without an amendment or whether an amendment or
      protocol would be necessary. A memo requesting a review of hypothesis-testing sub-studies for
      possible additional enrollment (beyond 6) will be sent to PIRC and the statistical reviewer.

      for power analysis for future patient-oriented hypothesis driven protocols, and 3) to train
      new fellows in the use of these different methods.

      As instructed, we had stopped recruitment under this protocol at the time we were informed by
      the NIH IRB that they determined this to be a thematic protocol (August 6, 2019). The four
      specific aims addressed under this protocol are:

        1. Aim 1. To identify resting behavioral and physiological substrates for neuromodulation
           of motor behavior

        2. Aim 2. To identify task-dependent behavioral and physiological substrates for
           neuromodulation of motor behavior

        3. Aim 3. To understand variability, rigor or/and reproducibility of brain stimulation
           effects.

      As instructed, the purpose of this amendment is to request authorization to proceed with data
      analysis and publication. No new experiments will be carried out under this protocol.

      Study Population

      Up to 1500 healthy volunteers, age 18 and older.

      Design

      No new experiments will be carried out under this protocol. Previously, healthy volunteers
      receive one or more of the following types of stimulation alone or in combination: (1)
      single- and paired-pulse TMS with inter-stimulus intervals of greater than 1s and up to 20s
      and intensities of up to 100% of stimulator output; (2) 1 Hz TMS for up to 30mins and up to
      115% of resting motor threshold (RMT) intensity; (3) tDCS applied at an intensity of up to 4
      mA for a duration of up to 60mins, as long the total charge does not exceed 7.2 C; (4) tACS
      applied at a peak-to-peak intensity of up to 4 mA for a duration of up to 60 minutes, as long
      the total charge does not exceed 7.2 C; (5) C/PNS applied alone with intensities below 130%
      of the peripherally-elicited-motor-threshold for up to 2 hours, or intensities up to 300% of
      sensory threshold when C/PNS is paired with TMS. All of these parameters of stimulation and
      procedures have safely been used as previously reported in the literature. Sham stimulations
      were delivered for each modality as scientifically needed. Some sessions included recording
      of behavior or brain activity (such as behavioral testing, MRI, and MEG) if brain stimulation
      targets were unknown. This information was used to inform the design of brain stimulation
      protocols.

      Each subject was able to participate in up to one experimental session per day, and up to 20
      total sessions over a twenty year period under this protocol. A single session lasted no
      longer than 8 hours. Appropriate rest breaks and meal breaks occured during long sessions.
      CTDB was used to track the number of sessions per subject to ensure they did not exceed 20
      sessions. Protocol AIs are were responsible for entering the subjects/sessions into CTDB.

      We previously tested the effects of different forms of stimulation on motor cortical
      excitability, cognitive and motor behavioral tasks, and brain state measures derived from
      neuroimaging data (i.e. - MRI, fMRI, MEG and EEG). Stimulation was applied before, after, or
      during physiological (i.e. motor evoked potentials, M-wave, F-wave, or H-Reflexes),
      neuroimaging or behavioral measures.

      Outcome Measures

      No new outcome measures are proposed. Changes in motor cortical excitability were previously
      measured as the change in the average peak-to-peak amplitude of a motor

      evoked potential (MEP) as measured with EMG. Neuroimaging measures included

      changes in oscillatory brain activity power as measured with EEG or MEG, changes in

      BOLD fMRI activation or changes in functional connectivity (i.e. - covarying fluctuations

      in BOLD or spectral power across the brain). Behavioral outcome measures focused on

      changes in performance as a function of learning, or as a function of applied brain

      stimulation.

The recording might have occurred while participants were sitting quietly or performing a cognitive or motor behavioral task. The electrodes were removed once the EEG was complete. A device consisting of computer hardware and digital signal processing software might have used to enable triggering of a stimulator system in response to a pre-defined EEG-signal. The device was used according to the Collaboration Agreement with University Neurology Hospital T(SqrRoot) bingen and Hertie Institute for Clinical Brain Research. The new device controls the timing of the stimuli based on pre-set parameters. Additional electrodes might have been placed on the scalp or limbs for offline removal of physiological artifacts from MEG or EEG data. Individual MEG or EEG sessions lasted up to 4 hours in length.</description>
