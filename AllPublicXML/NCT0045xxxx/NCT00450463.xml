  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

        -  Flutamide is an approved drug for prostate cancer that blocks the effects of
           testosterone on prostate cancer cells and may slow the progression of the disease.

        -  The vaccine in this study consists of a priming vaccine called PROSTVAC (rilimogene
           galvacirepvec/rilimogene glafolivec) -V/TRICOM (triad of costimulatory molecules), made
           from vaccinia virus, and a boosting vaccine called PROSTVAC-F/TRICOM, made from fowlpox
           virus. DNA (Deoxyribonuceic acid) is inserted into the priming and boosting vaccine
           viruses to cause production of proteins that enhance immune activity and also to produce
           prostate specific antigen (PSA) a protein that is normally produced by the patients
           tumor cells.

        -  GM-CSF (granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor), given along with the vaccine,
           is a chemical that boosts the immune system. It is used in this study to try to increase
           the usefulness of the vaccine by increasing the number of immune cells at the
           vaccination site.

      Objectives:

      -To determine if treatment with a prostate cancer vaccine plus flutamide is more effective
      than flutamide alone in delaying disease progression in patients with prostate cancer.

      Eligibility:

        -  Patients 18 years of age and older with androgen-insensitive prostate cancer that has
           not spread beyond the prostate gland.

        -  Patients with a rising PSA (prostatic specific antigen) who have already been treated
           with anti-iandrogen therapy (either bicalutamide or nilutamide).

      Design:

        -  There are two treatment groups in this study. Group A receives only flutamide; group B
           receive flutamide plus vaccine.

        -  Patients in both groups receive flutamide by mouth three times a day.

        -  Patients in group B receive PROSTVAC-V/TRICOM on day 1 and PROSTVAC-F/TRICOM on day 29
           and again every 4 weeks. All vaccines are given as injections under the skin.

        -  Patients have blood tests for PSA levels every month and scans every 3 months until the
           disease worsens.

        -  After 3 months of therapy, patients receiving in group A (flutamide alone) may cross
           over to receive vaccine if they develop a rising PSA and scans show no sign of disease
           spread. Patients in group B (flutamide plus vaccine) stop flutamide and may continue
           vaccine therapy. At this point patients may continue to receive treatment until the
           disease progresses or PSA levels rise....

      Background:

        -  There is no standard of care for prostate cancer patients progressing on hormone therapy
           with a rising serum PSA (prostatic specific antigen) level without evidence of
           metastatic disease.

        -  We have completed a phase II trial in which men with this stage of disease were
           randomized to receive a pox vector PSA vaccine vs. the antiandrogen nilutamide.

        -  The median time to treatment failure on nilutamide was 7.6 months.

        -  12 patients on the vaccine arm had nilutamide added at the time of PSA progression.

        -  The median time for treatment failure after the addition of nilutamide was 13.9 months,
           for a total of 25.9 months from initiation of vaccine therapy.

        -  This suggests that the combination of hormone therapy with vaccine therapy may lead to
           an improved clinical benefit compared to hormone therapy alone.

        -  Due to the increased toxicity of nilutamide compared to other antiandrogens and the
           patients prior exposure to bicalutamide therapy, we plan to use flutamide as a second
           line hormonal manipulation in the below study.

      Objectives (Primary):

      -To determine if use of a combination of vaccine plus flutamide may be associated with a
      trend toward improvement in time to treatment failure compared to flutamide alone.

      Eligibility:

        -  Must have non metastatic androgen insensitive prostate cancer with a rising PSA with
           castrate levels of testosterone and no evidence of metastatic disease on CT (computed
           tomography) scan or bone scan.

        -  Hgb (hemoglobin) greater than or equal to 9 g/dL.

        -  Lymphocyte count greater than or equal to 500/mm(3).

        -  Hepatic function: Bilirubin less than or equal to 1.5 mg/dL, OR patients with Gilbert's
           syndrome, a total bilirubin less than or equal to 3.0 mg/dL, AST (aspartate
           aminotransferase) and ALT (alanine aminotransferase) less than 2.5 times upper limit of
           normal

      Design:

      -Flutamide will be administered at a dose of 250 mg PO (by mouth) tid (three times a day)
      every day in both arms A and B.

      rV-PSATRICOM will be administered s.c. (subcutaneous) on day 1 in Arm B.

      rF-PSATRICOM will be administered s.c. on day 29 &amp; every 4 weeks in Arm B.

        -  For patients with declining PSA no restaging will be done unless they develop symptoms
           consistent with metastatic disease.

        -  For patients with rising PSA, once 2 consecutive PSA rises are seen, a CT will be done
           at their next scheduled visit. They will then be re-staged (CT and bone scans) at 3
           month intervals as long as PSA continues to rise.

        -  After 3 months of therapy, patients receiving the flutamide alone (arm A) may cross over
           to receive vaccine if they develop a rising PSA and scans are without metastatic
           disease. The vaccine may commence 4 weeks after flutamide is stopped if the PSA
           continues to rise. If there is an antiandrogen withdrawal response (a decline in PSA 28
           days after the discontinuation of flutamide), PSA serum levels will be checked every 28
           days and vaccine may commence when the serum PSA levels begin to rise (if scans are
           negative for metastatsis). Patients on arm B will have flutamide discontinued and may
           continue vaccine therapy. At this point patients may continue to receive treatment on
           study until the development of disease on scans or a second occurrence of clinical
           progression.

        -  Patients who have been on study for 2 years or more with stable disease and who are not
           getting vaccine, clinic visits may be scheduled every 8 weeks. (Patients receiving
           monthly vaccine will continue to have monthly visits.)

        -  For patients who have stable disease and attend clinic every 8 weeks, once 2 consecutive
           PSA rises are seen, a CT and bone scan will be done at their next visit in 4 weeks. They
           will then be restaged (CT and bone scans) at 3 month intervals as long as PSA continues
           to rise.

    <description>Here is the count of participants with serious and non-serious adverse events assessed by the Common Terminology Criteria in Adverse Events (CTCAE v4.0). A non-serious adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence. A serious adverse event is an adverse event or suspected adverse reaction that results in death, a life threatening adverse drug experience, hospitalization, disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, congenital anomaly/birth defect or important medical events that jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the previous outcomes mentioned.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Prostatic Specific Antigen (PSA) Response</measure>
    <time_frame>Median potential follow-up for all patients is 46.7 months</time_frame>
    <description>Complete response is PSA &lt;0.2 confirmed by a second reading at least 4 weeks later. All patients with a PSA decline of &gt;50% (confirmed by a second value at least 4 weeks after the first) and who have no other evidence of disease progression will be reported with both PSA decline only and PSA decline and stable disease on scans. A 25% increase in PSA over nadir is progressive disease with or without evidence of metastatic disease, and/or development of disease on scans or a second occurrence of rising PSA levels in the absence of clinical progression.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <pre_assignment_details>Primary focus of this study compares flutamide with/without vaccine. While patients could get vaccine alone after flutamide progression, this was not a primary focus of the study. With only 11 patients, this group was an exploratory endeavor and there was no statistical plan for comparison to the primary groups.</pre_assignment_details>
      <group_list>
        <group group_id="P1">
          <title>Flutamide Alone</title>
          <description>Patients receive flutamide orally 3 times a day on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After 3 months of treatment, patients who do not develop clinical progression, but develop biochemical recurrence (e.g., rising prostatic specific antigen (PSA) levels) without metastatic disease (as evidenced on scans), may receive vaccine treatment as defined in arm II beginning 4 weeks after flutamide therapy is discontinued.
Flutamide (Eulexin): Orally administered, nonsteroidal, competitive antagonist of testosterone and other androgens at androgenic receptors and may alter the nuclear translocation of the androgen/receptor complex.</description>

          <title>Flutamide + Vaccine + Sargramostim</title>
          <description>Patients receive flutamide orally 3 times a day on days 1-28. Patients also receive recombinant vaccinia PSA vaccine subcutaneously (SC) on day 1 of course 1 only and recombinant fowlpox PSA vaccine SC on day 1 of all subsequent courses. Patients receive sargramostim (GM-CSF) SC on days 1-4. Treatment repeats every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After 3 months of treatment, patients who do not develop clinical progression, but develop biochemical recurrence (e.g., rising PSA levels), discontinue flutamide but may continue to receive vaccine treatment.
Sargramostim (GM-CSF, Leukine): A recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) produced by recombinant DNA technology in yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae). Sargramostim is a 127 amino acid glycoprotein, altered from the native, natural human GM-CSF molecule; the position 23 arginine has been replaced with a leucine to facilitate the expression of the protein in yeast</description>

        <title>Time to Treatment Failure</title>
        <description>Time to treatment failure is defined as a rising Prostatic Specific Antigen (PSA) (Bubley criteria, JCO 1999), development of metastatic disease, or removal from treatment due to excessive toxicity) compared to patients receiving flutamide alone. Normal PSA is 4.0 ng/mL or lower.</description>

        <population>Although patients without radiographic progression were allowed to get vaccine after progression on flutamide, the primary comparison in the two groups of this study was Flutamide alone vs. Fluatmiade + vaccine simultaneously. Thus the data on TTF presented is for progression on flutamide alone.</population>
