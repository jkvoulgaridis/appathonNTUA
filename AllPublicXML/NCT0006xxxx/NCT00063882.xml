      RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays and other sources to damage tumor cells.
      Interstitial brachytherapy uses radioactive material placed directly into or near a tumor to
      kill tumor cells. Combining interstitial brachytherapy with external-beam radiation therapy
      may kill more tumor cells. It is not yet known whether interstitial brachytherapy is more
      effective with or without external-beam radiation therapy in treating prostate cancer.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of interstitial
      brachytherapy with or without external-beam radiation therapy in treating patients who have
      prostate cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Compare the 5-year freedom from progression in patients with intermediate-risk prostate
           cancer treated with interstitial brachytherapy with or without external beam
           radiotherapy (EBRT).

        -  Compare biochemical (i.e., prostate-specific antigen) failure, biochemical failure by
           the Phoenix definition, disease-specific survival, local progression, and distant
           metastases in patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare morbidity and quality of life of patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Determine the feasibility of collecting Medicare data in a large Radiation Therapy
           Oncology Group (RTOG) prostate cancer clinical trial for cost effectiveness and cost
           utility analysis of combined treatment with interstitial brachytherapy and EBRT.

        -  Prospectively collect diagnostic biopsy samples from these patients for future biomarker
           analyses.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      disease stage (T1c vs T2a or T2b), Gleason score (≤ 6 vs 7), prostate-specific antigen (&lt; 10
      ng/mL vs 10-20 ng/mL), and prior neoadjuvant hormonal therapy (yes vs no). Patients are
      randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients undergo external beam radiotherapy 5 days a week for 5 weeks. Within 2-4
           weeks of radiotherapy, patients undergo interstitial brachytherapy with iodine I 125 or
           palladium Pd 103 seeds.

        -  Arm II: Patients undergo interstitial brachytherapy only, as in arm I. Quality of life
           is assessed at baseline, at 4, 12, and 24 months, and then annually for 3 years.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 3-5 weeks, at 4, 6, 9, and 12
      months, every 6 months for 4 years, and then annually thereafter.

    <measure>5-Year Freedom From Progression Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>From randomization to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>A Freedom from Progression (FFP) failure includes biochemical failure, local failure, distant failure, or death due to any cause. Patients who are failure free with less than 5 years of follow-up or who receive any secondary salvage therapy are censored. Freedom from Progression rates are estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Biochemical Failure Rate (Protocol Definition)</measure>
    <time_frame>From randomization to last follow-up. Analysis occurs after all patients have been potentially followed for 5 years. Maximum follow-up at time of analysis was 13.9 years.</time_frame>
    <description>Biochemical failure is defined as having 3 consecutive rises of post-treatment PSA or starting hormones after one or more elevations in post-treatment PSA but before 3 consecutive elevations are documented. The sum of the 3 consecutive rises must exceed 1 ng/mL above the nadir. If 3 consecutive PSA rises occur during the first 24 months followed by a subsequent non-hormonal induced PSA decrease, patients will not be considered PSA failures. Three consecutive rises with any of the 3 PSA values occurring more than 24 months after the implant procedure will constitute a failure. Time to biochemical is defined as time from randomization to the date of first biochemical failure, last known follow-up (censored), or death without biochemical failure (competing risk). Biochemical failure rates are estimated using the cumulative incidence method. Five year rates are reported.</description>

    <time_frame>From randomization to last follow-up. Analysis occurs after all patients have been potentially followed for 5 years.Maximum follow-up at time of analysis was 13.9 years.</time_frame>
    <description>Biochemical Failure is defined as an increase of 2 ng/ml or more in PSA over the nadir PSA after 24 months from the start of treatment or the start of salvage hormones. Time to biochemical is defined as time from randomization to the date of first biochemical failure, last known follow-up (censored), or death without biochemical failure (competing risk).

    <measure>Prostate Cancer Death</measure>
    <time_frame>From randomization to last follow-up. Analysis occurs after all patients have been potentially followed for 5 years. Maximum follow-up at time of analysis was 13.9 years.</time_frame>
    <description>Prostate cancer death is defined as death due to prostate cancer or complications of treatment or death associated with any of the following: 1) further clinical tumor progression occurring after initiation of salvage androgen suppression therapy; 2) a rise that exceeds 1.0 ng/ml in the serum PSA level on at least two consecutive occasions that occurs during or after salvage androgen suppression therapy; and 3) disease progression in the absence of any anti-tumor therapy. Time to prostate cancer death is defined as time from randomization to the date of prostate cancer death, last known follow-up (censored), or death without prostate cancer (competing risk). Prostate cancer death rates are estimated using the cumulative incidence method. Five year rates are reported.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Local Failure</measure>
    <time_frame>From randomization to last follow-up. Analysis occurs after all patients have been potentially followed for 5 years. Maximum follow-up at time of analysis was 13.9 years.</time_frame>
    <description>Failure is defined as progression (increase in palpable abnormality) at any time, failure of regression of the palpable tumor by two years, and redevelopment of a palpable abnormality after complete disappearance of previous abnormalities. Histologic criteria for local failure are presence of prostatic carcinoma upon biopsy and positive biopsy of the palpably normal prostate more than two years after the start of treatment. Time to local failure is defined as time from randomization to the date of first local failure, last known follow-up (censored), or death without local failure (competing risk). Local failure rates are estimated using the cumulative incidence method. Five year rates are reported.</description>

    <description>Failure is defined as the appearance of any distant metastases. Time to distant metastases is defined as time from randomization to the date of first distant metastases, last known follow-up (censored), or death without distant metastases (competing risk). Distant metastases rates are estimated using the cumulative incidence method. Five year rates are reported.</description>

    <measure>Overall Survival</measure>
    <time_frame>From randomization to last follow-up. Analysis occurs after all patients had been on study for at least 5 years. Maximum follow-up at time of analysis was 13.9 years.</time_frame>
    <description>Failure is defined as death due to any cause. Overall survival time is defined as time from randomization to the date of death or last known follow-up (censored). Survival rates are estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Five year rates are reported.</description>

    <time_frame>From 181 days after the start of radiation to last follow-up. Maximum follow-up at time of analysis was 13.9 years.</time_frame>
    <description>Late toxicities are scored according to the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG)/European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Late Radiation Morbidity Scoring Scheme and will be defined as the worst severity of the toxicity occurring &gt; 180 days from radiation start. Grade 3+ GU/GI and overall were analyzed. RTOG/EORTC Late Radiation Morbidity Scoring Scheme assigns Grades 1 through 5 with unique clinical descriptions of severity for each toxicity based on this general guideline: Grade 1 Mild, Grade 2 Moderate, Grade 3 Severe, Grade 4 Life-threatening or disabling, Grade 5 Death related to toxicity. Time to late grade 3+ toxicity is defined as time from randomization to the date of first late grade 3+ toxicity, last known follow-up (censored), or death without late grade 3+ toxicity (competing risk). Late grade 3+ toxicity rates are estimated using the cumulative incidence method. Five year rates are reported.</description>

    <measure>Change in Health-related Quality of Life From Baseline to 4-Months as Measured by Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 4 months after start of radiation</time_frame>
    <description>The EPIC form is a 50-item, validated tool to assess disease-specific aspects of prostate cancer and its therapies and comprises of four summary domains (bowel, urinary, sexual, and hormonal function). The urinary domain summary score can be separated into 2 distinct subscales: urinary incontinence and urinary irritative. Hormonal domain was excluded as concurrent use of hormones was exclusionary and prior neoadjuvant hormone use was low. Response options for each EPIC item form a Likert scale and multi-item scale scores are transformed linearly to a 0-100 scale, with higher scores representing better health related quality of life. The change score was calculated as the value at 4 months minus the value at baseline. A negative change reflects a decline at 4 months and a positive change reflects an improvement at 4 months.</description>

          <title>Combined Gleason Score (GS)</title>
          <description>Gleason score describes prostate cancer based on how abnormal the cancer cells in a biopsy sample look under a microscope. Cells are scored 1-5 with 1 indicating &quot;low-grade&quot; looking similar to normal cells and 5 indicating &quot;high-grade&quot; barely resembling normal cells due to mutation. A pathologist assigns a Gleason grade to the first and second most predominant patterns in the biopsy. The two grades are added together to calculate the Gleason score (between 2 and 10). Cancers with lower scores tend to be less aggressive, while cancers with higher scores end to be more aggressive.</description>

        <title>Biochemical Failure Rate (Protocol Definition)</title>
        <description>Biochemical failure is defined as having 3 consecutive rises of post-treatment PSA or starting hormones after one or more elevations in post-treatment PSA but before 3 consecutive elevations are documented. The sum of the 3 consecutive rises must exceed 1 ng/mL above the nadir. If 3 consecutive PSA rises occur during the first 24 months followed by a subsequent non-hormonal induced PSA decrease, patients will not be considered PSA failures. Three consecutive rises with any of the 3 PSA values occurring more than 24 months after the implant procedure will constitute a failure. Time to biochemical is defined as time from randomization to the date of first biochemical failure, last known follow-up (censored), or death without biochemical failure (competing risk). Biochemical failure rates are estimated using the cumulative incidence method. Five year rates are reported.</description>
        <time_frame>From randomization to last follow-up. Analysis occurs after all patients have been potentially followed for 5 years. Maximum follow-up at time of analysis was 13.9 years.</time_frame>

        <description>Failure is defined as progression (increase in palpable abnormality) at any time, failure of regression of the palpable tumor by two years, and redevelopment of a palpable abnormality after complete disappearance of previous abnormalities. Histologic criteria for local failure are presence of prostatic carcinoma upon biopsy and positive biopsy of the palpably normal prostate more than two years after the start of treatment. Time to local failure is defined as time from randomization to the date of first local failure, last known follow-up (censored), or death without local failure (competing risk). Local failure rates are estimated using the cumulative incidence method. Five year rates are reported.</description>

          <title>Local Failure</title>
          <description>Failure is defined as progression (increase in palpable abnormality) at any time, failure of regression of the palpable tumor by two years, and redevelopment of a palpable abnormality after complete disappearance of previous abnormalities. Histologic criteria for local failure are presence of prostatic carcinoma upon biopsy and positive biopsy of the palpably normal prostate more than two years after the start of treatment. Time to local failure is defined as time from randomization to the date of first local failure, last known follow-up (censored), or death without local failure (competing risk). Local failure rates are estimated using the cumulative incidence method. Five year rates are reported.</description>

        <title>Time to Late Grade 3+ Toxicities [Genitourinary (GU), Gastrointestinal (GI), and Overall]</title>
        <description>Late toxicities are scored according to the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG)/European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Late Radiation Morbidity Scoring Scheme and will be defined as the worst severity of the toxicity occurring &gt; 180 days from radiation start. Grade 3+ GU/GI and overall were analyzed. RTOG/EORTC Late Radiation Morbidity Scoring Scheme assigns Grades 1 through 5 with unique clinical descriptions of severity for each toxicity based on this general guideline: Grade 1 Mild, Grade 2 Moderate, Grade 3 Severe, Grade 4 Life-threatening or disabling, Grade 5 Death related to toxicity. Time to late grade 3+ toxicity is defined as time from randomization to the date of first late grade 3+ toxicity, last known follow-up (censored), or death without late grade 3+ toxicity (competing risk). Late grade 3+ toxicity rates are estimated using the cumulative incidence method. Five year rates are reported.</description>

        <title>Change in Health-related Quality of Life From Baseline to 4-Months as Measured by Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC)</title>
        <description>The EPIC form is a 50-item, validated tool to assess disease-specific aspects of prostate cancer and its therapies and comprises of four summary domains (bowel, urinary, sexual, and hormonal function). The urinary domain summary score can be separated into 2 distinct subscales: urinary incontinence and urinary irritative. Hormonal domain was excluded as concurrent use of hormones was exclusionary and prior neoadjuvant hormone use was low. Response options for each EPIC item form a Likert scale and multi-item scale scores are transformed linearly to a 0-100 scale, with higher scores representing better health related quality of life. The change score was calculated as the value at 4 months minus the value at baseline. A negative change reflects a decline at 4 months and a positive change reflects an improvement at 4 months.</description>

        <title>Change in Health-Related Quality of Life From Baseline to 24-Months as Measured by EPIC</title>
        <description>The EPIC form is a 50-item, validated tool to assess disease-specific aspects of prostate cancer and its therapies and comprises of four summary domains (bowel, urinary, sexual, and hormonal function). The urinary domain summary score can be separated into 2 distinct subscales: urinary incontinence and urinary irritative. Hormonal domain was excluded as concurrent use of hormones was exclusionary and prior neoadjuvant hormone use was low. Response options for each EPIC item form a Likert scale and multi-item scale scores are transformed linearly to a 0-100 scale, with higher scores representing better health related quality of life. The change score was calculated as the value at 24 months minus the value at baseline. A negative change reflects a decline at 24 months and a positive change reflects an improvement at 24 months.</description>
