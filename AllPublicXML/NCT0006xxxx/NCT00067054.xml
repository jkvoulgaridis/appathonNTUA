  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study collects specimens from volunteers for use in studies by NIAID's Vaccine Research
      Center. A number of different types of specimens or samples can be collected, including
      blood, urine, body fluids or secretions, skin swabs, or skin biopsies. The samples are used
      for medical research, including the study of HIV, hepatitis, and other diseases; immune
      system responses, such as responses to vaccinations or infections; and for research on
      vaccine development.

      Blood samples may be collected either by ordinary blood drawing (phlebotomy) or by apheresis,
      a procedure for collecting a larger quantity of blood cells or plasma than would be possible
      through simple blood drawing. For this procedure, the subject lies on a recliner or couch.
      Blood is removed through a needle in the vein of one arm and spun in a machine that separates
      out the desired component (plasma or white blood cells). The remainder of the blood is
      returned either through the same needle or through a needle in the other arm. The procedure
      takes about 1 to 3 hours.

      Volunteers who are 18 years of age and older, including participants in other NIH research
      protocols, may be eligible. Individuals who have a condition that the research staff
      considers a reason not to make a sample donation will be excluded from the study.

      Participants may have only one sample collected or may be asked to undergo repetitive sample
      collection procedures, depending upon the requirements of the particular research project for
      which the samples are being collected. Each individual's enrollment is for a 1-year period,
      which can be extended.

      Protocol Design: This protocol is designed to perform collection of human specimens, such as
      blood, mucosal secretions, skin swabs, skin biopsy, or body fluids to support research
      studies. These samples will be used by researchers in their work on the development of
      vaccines, to study the correlates of immunity related to infectious diseases and in
      laboratory work related to the development and/or validation of immunological assays.
      Standard phlebotomy and apheresis procedures will be utilized to safely obtain necessary
      quantities of blood and cells.

      Objectives: Obtain human biological specimens such as blood (via phlebotomy), plasma or PBMC
      samples (via apheresis), mucosal secretions, skin swabs, body fluids or skin biopsy to
      support medical research.

      Study Population: Adults ages 18 years and older.

      Protocol Plan: Subjects, including healthy volunteers and infectious disease patients who
      consent to participate in this study, will undergo standard medical procedures to obtain
      biological specimens for research purposes only. The signed informed consent is valid for one
      year; at least once per year, the subject must re-consent and eligibility should be
      re-confirmed.

      Study Duration: Individual subjects may donate samples as often as permitted by their
      institution s guidelines. The IRB-approved protocol will remain open and undergo annual
      continuing review by the IRB as long as there continues to be a need for human biological
      specimens for research studies.

      Endpoints: There is no analysis plan for this protocol. This protocol will be conducted in
      accordance with Good Clinical Practices for human research solely for the purpose of
      obtaining samples for research laboratories. Samples will be identified only by subject
      identification number. Subject data, such as demographic information, aspects of medical
      history, laboratory parameters, recent immunizations or medications, HLA type, genetic tests
      and other medical information may be provided (identified by study number, but not subject
      name) to researchers if needed to support the objectives of the laboratory research.

        Participants may be subjects participating solely in this protocol or may be subjects in
        other VRC studies from whom more cells are needed for research than can be collected by
        routine phlebotomy.At the VRC site, NIH employees and members of their immediate families
        may participate in this protocol. The UPR MSC site will only enroll subjects from the
        community. Children are not eligible to participate in this clinical trial.
