      This study offers evaluation and treatment of patients with a variety of neurological
      disorders that may require surgery. The protocol is not designed to test new treatments;
      rather, patients will receive standard care. The study is designed to: 1) allow NINDS s
      Surgical Neurology Branch staff to learn more about changes that cause nervous system
      disorders, 2) train physicians in the evaluation and treatment of these disorders; and 3)
      establish a pool of patients who may be eligible for other NINDS protocols. (Participants in
      this protocol will not be required to join another study; the decision will be voluntary.)

      Patients of all ages with a disorder of the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) or
      pituitary gland that may require surgery for diagnosis or treatment may be eligible for this
      study. In some cases surgery will not be needed. Candidates will be screened with a medical
      history and physical examination.

      Participants may undergo tests, medial treatment, or surgical treatment to help diagnose or
      treat their condition. In most cases, care provided at the NIH will be limited to evaluation
      and surgery. Procedures may include laboratory tests, imaging tests, such as magnetic
      resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT) scans, angiograms, and other procedures to
      confirm the patient s diagnosis or help guide treatment. Patients who require surgery will be
      offered standard surgical care at NIH. Those whose procedure includes removal of tissues or
      fluids for diagnostic studies will be asked to allow a portion of the tissue to be used for
      research purposes, including analysis for gene and protein abnormalities that may be involved
      in causing the disorder or in influencing the patient s response to treatment. Blood samples
      will also be drawn for research.

      Objective: This protocol is designed to allow evaluation of participants neurosurgical
      disorders that receive care within the Surgical Neurology Branch. The participants will
      receive standard-of-clinical-care evaluation and treatment. The clinical data and samples
      generated during standard of care treatment will be collected as a part of this study.

      Study Population: Participants 4 years of age and older with neurosurgical-related conditions
      seeking care from, or referred to the Surgical Neurology Branch for evaluation are eligible
      for this protocol.

      Study Design: This is an observational study. Participants will receive standard-of-
      clinical-care evaluation and treatment for their neurosurgical condition. Clinical evaluation
      may include laboratory and radiological studies designed to aid in diagnosis or differential
      diagnosis of the participant s condition or to facilitate treatment. The evaluations may take
      place in the outpatient clinic areas or in the inpatient units. Some participants will
      receive standard-of-care medical or surgical treatment for their disorder. Clinical data,
      tissue samples or body fluids obtained during standard of care treatment, may be used for
      research. Additional genetic testing may be performed on subjects and their blood relatives
      if a genetic mechanism underlying the neurological disorder is suspected.

      Outcome Measures: No additional research outcome measures will be tracked in this study, as
      this study is collecting data for potential future use. All outcomes will be those of
      standard clinical evaluation and treatment. A clinical and research database will be kept of
      patient s diagnosis, progression, and treatment. Clinical database information may be
      reported or be used in other studies.
