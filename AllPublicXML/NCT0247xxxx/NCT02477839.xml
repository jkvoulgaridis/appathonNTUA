    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to assess the efficacy, safety and tolerabilty of lacosamide
      administered as add-on therapy with 1 to 3 anti-seizure medications. This trial is for
      children aged 1 month to less than 4 years with epilepsy who currently have uncontrolled
      partial-onset seizures.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The trial consists of a 7-day Baseline Period, a 20-day Titration Period, a 7-day Maintenance
      Period, and a 12-day Transition Period for subjects who complete the study and choose to
      enter the extension study. Subjects who will not enter the extension study will continue
      after the Maintenance Period with a 16-day Taper Period followed by a 30-day Safety Follow-Up
      Period. The Taper Period and Safety Follow-Up are also applicable for subjects not eligible
      for continuation and therefore ending the study earlier.

      If subjects meet the eligibility criteria, they will be randomized to receive either
      lacosamide 8 mg/kg/day to 12 mg/kg/day, or placebo during the Maintenance Phase. The dose of
      lacosamide will be titrated from 4 mg/kg/day at study start to maximum of 12 mg/kg/day at
      4-day intervals of 1-2 mg/kg/day.

      All subjects who complete the 20-day Titration Period will enter the 7-day Maintenance
      Period. No dose adjustment is allowed during the Maintenance Phase. The Treatment Phase is
      defined as the combined Titration and Maintenance Phases.

          -  Subject has &gt;=2 partial-onset seizures with or without secondary generalization during
             the End-of-Baseline video-EEG. Electrographic seizures are defined as recognizable

             continua, primary generalized epilepsy, Dravet Syndorme, or seizures that are not of
             partial-onset origin

          -  Subject has a history of generalized convulsive status epilepticus &lt;=2 months prior to
             Screening (Visit 1)

          -  Subject has been treated with felbamate and has experienced any serious toxicity
             issues (defined as liver failure, aplastic anemia) with this treatment. Subjects
             treated with felbamate for &lt;12 months are excluded. Subjects treated with felbamate
             for &gt;=12 months prior to Visit 1 and who have not experienced serious toxicity issues
             are eligible

          -  Subject has an acute or subacutely progressive central nervous system disease. Subject
             has epilepsy secondary to a progressing cerebral disease or any other progressively
             neurodegenerative disease (malignant brain tumor or Rasmussen Syndrome)

          -  Subject has a known cardiac sodium channelopathy, such as Brugada syndrome
