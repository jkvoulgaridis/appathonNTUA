      Multicenter, prospective, non-controlled study in a pediatric cohort (&lt;6 years-old) with
      severe Von Willebrand Disease (VWD).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, prospective, open-label, and single-arm study. The study population is
      planned to include 8 pediatric subjects (&lt;6 years of age) with severe VWD without inhibitors
      and with no active bleeding at the time of inclusion. Eligible subjects will receive a single
      dose of Fanhdi for a PK evaluation and will be followed for 12 months for which the efficacy
      and safety of Fanhdi will be assessed. In addition, the type 3 VWD subjects, after 6 months
      of follow-up of the first infusion, will receive the second dose as in the 1st PK evaluation
      and undergo a 2nd PK evaluation.

      The study will consist of 2 phases:

        -  PK profile evaluation in which all eligible subjects will receive a single dose of 80
           IU/kg von Willebrand factor: Ristocetin cofactor activity (VWF:RCo) of Fanhdi. In
           addition, after 6 months of follow-up of the first infusion, type 3 VWD subjects will
           receive the second dose of Fanhdi and undergo a 2nd PK evaluation with a reduced
           sampling schedule.

        -  A 12-month Follow-up period during which the safety and efficacy of Fanhdi will be
           assessed in the prevention and management of bleeding episodes and/or management of
           perioperative hemostasis during surgery and/or invasive procedures.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects diagnosed with severe hereditary VWD (VWF:RCo&lt;15-20 IU/dL) of any type

          2. Subjects less than 6 years of age

          3. Subjects that do not adequately respond to treatment with desmopressin (DDAVP) or had
             a previous treatment failure with DDAVP

          4. Signed informed consent form provided by an authorized representative on behalf of the
             subject in accordance with local law and institutional policy.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject has been diagnosed of acquired VWD

          2. Subjects bleeding at the time of the first infusion or the 10 days prior to the
             infusion

          3. Subjects treated with DDAVP or another FVIII containing VWF concentrate during the 5
             days prior to the infusion of the Fanhdi. This may be reduced to 3 days for subjects
             with type 3 VWD.

          4. Subject is known or suspected to have present or past inhibitor activity (antibodies)
             directed against FVIII or VWF

          5. Subject is known to have history of intolerance to any Fanhdi® containing substance

          6. Subject is known to have history of anaphylactic reaction(s) to blood or blood
             components

          7. Subjects presenting with severe platelet dysfunctions due to drugs (aspirin, other
             NSAIDs, etc.) or other pathologies (uremic thrombopathy, hematological diseases)

          8. Subjects with known previous infection with Hepatitis A Virus (HAV), Hepatitis B Virus
             (HBV), Hepatitic C Virus (HCV), or HIV or clinical signs and symptoms consistent with
             current HAV, HBV, HCV or HIV infection.

          9. Subjects presenting with anemia (hemoglobulin &lt;11 g/dL)

         10. Subjects diagnosed with metabolic diseases that are not clinically controlled, such as
             diabetes mellitus, that could potentially interfere with the interpretations of the
             study

         11. Subjects participating in another clinical study within 30 days prior to screening or
             has received any investigational treatment within 3 months prior to screening

         12. If it is anticipated that the subject will be treated with other products containing
             FVIII or VWF different from Fanhdi® during a period of one year

         13. The subject is unlikely to adhere to the protocol requirements of the study
