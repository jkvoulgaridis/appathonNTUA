    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of ruxolitinib in
      HIV-positive adults who were virologically suppressed and who were on antiretroviral therapy
      (ART).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ruxolitinib is a medication approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat
      myelofibrosis, a disorder in which bone marrow is replaced by scar (fibrosis) tissue. Many of
      the cytokines affected by myelofibrosis are also affected by HIV. Because of this,
      ruxolitinib may also be a possible treatment for HIV. The purpose of this study was to
      evaluate the safety and tolerability of ruxolitinib in HIV-positive adults who were on ART
      and who were virologically suppressed. Researchers evaluated the effect ruxolitinib had on
      inflammation and immune activation.

      This study enrolled HIV-positive adults who were on select ART regimens and who had viral
      suppression. ART was not provided by the study; participants continued to receive ART from
      their own health care providers. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either
      ruxolitinib (Arm A) or no study treatment (Arm B) in 2:1 ratio. Participants in Arm A
      received ruxolitinib twice a day for 5 weeks. All participants attended study visits at entry
      (Day 0) and Weeks 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, and 12. These visits included physical examinations,
      clinical assessments, blood collection, adherence assessments, oral swab collection, and
      pregnancy testing for female participants. At Weeks 1 and 4, participants in Arm A took part
      in pharmacokinetic (PK) sampling, which involved having blood drawn several times over 6 to 8
      hours.

Baseline is defined as the geometric mean of the Pre-entry and Entry values. Week 4/5 is defined as the geometric mean of the Week 4 and Week 5 values. Fold change was calculated as the value at Week 4/5 divided by the value at Baseline.</description>

Data are not available as of April, 2019 for soluble markers of immune activation and inflammation in the peripheral blood. Please note that these secondary outcomes were not included in the primary analysis report. There are many outcomes in this study and the labs had to give priority to the assays planned to be included in the primary manuscript (e.g. IL-6 and sCD14).</description>

Data are not available as of February, 2019 for cellular markers of immune activation and inflammation in the peripheral blood. These data are based on assays which are to be tested in batch to minimize variability.

        <description>Level of CMV shedding will be summarized by study week and arm as the frequency and percentage of those above and below the assay limit of detection. The proportion of participants with detectable CMV at any on-treatment time point (ever shedding at weeks 1, 2, 4, or 5) and any post-treatment time point (ever shedding at weeks 10 or 12) will be contrasted between study arms via using a two-sided mid-p Fisher's exact test with 10% type-I error.
