      This study aims to determine if the 595nm Pulsed dye laser, the combined 595/1064nm Multiplex
      laser or no treatment results in a better outcome in the quality of the surgical scar using
      the multiplex cynergy laser, starting treatment the day of suture removal.

      This study aims to determine if the 595nm Pulsed dye laser, the combined 595/1064nm Multiplex
      laser or no treatment results in a better outcome in the quality of the surgical scar using
      the multiplex cynergy laser, starting treatment the day of suture removal.

      Patients will be offered the opportunity of enrolling in the trial before their surgery. If
      they qualify and agree to participate they will sign informed consent and Health Insurance
      Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) form.

      The surgical defect should be closed primarily, with the minimal scar length being 3cm. The
      scar will be randomized into 3 equal thirds, each third will randomly receive either: no
      treatment, 595nm PDL, or 595/1064nm Multiplex laser. A total of 3 laser treatments will be
      performed over a period of 3 weeks (one treatment session performed every week), and the
      patient will come in for a final follow up visit, for a final assessment of the scar using
      the Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale (POSAS) system.

595/1064nm Multiplex Laser: The multiplex cynergy laser will be used for this study. A third of the scar will solely be treated with the 595nm PDL.</description>
