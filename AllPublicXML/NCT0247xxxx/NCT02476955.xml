      An Open-label Phase 1b Study of ARQ 092 in Combination with other Antineoplastic Agents in
      Subjects with Selected Solid Tumors
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label Phase 1b, dose escalation study of oral ARQ 092 administered in
      combination with carboplatin plus paclitaxel (Carboplatin Plus Paclitaxel Arm) or in
      combination with paclitaxel alone (Paclitaxel Arm), in subjects with advanced, inoperable
      metastatic and/or recurrent solid tumors, or in combination with anastrozole (Anastrozole
      Arm) in subjects with ovarian or endometrial cancer.

      Enrollment in the Carboplatin plus Paclitaxel Arm and Paclitaxel Alone Arm is now closed.
      Enrollment in the Expansion Cohort for the Anastrozole Arm continues for patients with
      Endometrial cancer.
