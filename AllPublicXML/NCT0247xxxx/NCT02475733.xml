    <textblock>
      This study will assess the safety , efficacy and pharmacokinetics of ceftazidime avibactam
      and metronidazole versus meropenem in paediatric population (from 3 months to less than 18
      years of age )with complicated intra-abdominal infections (cIAIs)

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicentre, multinational, single blind, randomised and active controlled trial of
      intravenous ceftazidime avibactam in combination with metronidazole versus meropenem.
      Patients will receive intravenous (IV) treatment for a minimum of 72 hours (3 full days, ie,
      9 doses) before having the option to switch to an oral therapy. The decision to switch to
      oral therapy is entirely at the Investigator's discretion, if the patient has good or
      sufficient clinical response, and the patient is tolerating oral fluids or food.Patients will
      be assessed for safety and efficacy throughout the study, and blood samples will be taken for
      pharmacokinetic (PK) assessment. The duration of each patient's participation in the study
      will be a minimum of 27 days to a maximum of 50 days after start of study treatment (defined
      as the time point at which first dose of study treatment is administered) at which time there
      will be a late follow up (LFU) assessment visit. The LFU is to be performed 20 to 35 days
      after the last dose of any treatment.The assessments at the test of cure (TOC) visit should
      be performed in person 8 to 15 days after last dose of any study drug (IV or oral). The
      maximum duration of IV study drug or oral switch therapy is up to Day 15.

             not having reached menarche) (refer to Appendix E for further details on Tanner
             staging), the patient is authorised to participate in this clinical study if the
             following criteria are met:

        At screening:

        (i) Patient reports sexual abstinence for the prior 3 months or reports use of at least 1
        of the acceptable methods of contraception, including an intrauterine device (with copper
        banded coil), levonorgestrel intrauterine system (eg, Mirena®), or regular
        medroxyprogesterone injections (Depo-Provera®); or (b) Patient agrees to initiate sexual
        abstinence from the time of screening until 7 days after end of treatment with study drug;
        and (ii) Patient is advised to avoid conception from the time of screening until 7 days
        after receipt of study drug and agrees not to attempt pregnancy from the time of screening
        until 7 days after end of treatment with study drug; and (iii) Patient is provided

             beyond the gallbladder wall

          3. Acute gastric or duodenal perforations, only if operated on &gt;24 hours after singular
             perforation occurs

          4. Traumatic perforation of the intestines, only if operated on &gt;12 hours after
             perforation occurs

          5. Secondary peritonitis (but not spontaneous bacterial peritonitis associated with
             cirrhosis and chronic ascites)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Involvement in the planning and/or conduct of the study (applies to both AstraZeneca
             staff and/or staff at the study site)

          2. Previous enrolment or randomisation in the present study

          3. Participation in another clinical study with an investigational product (IP) during
             the last 30 days before the first dose of IV study drug or have previously
             participated in the current study or in another study of CAZ-AVI (in which an active
             agent was received)

          4. History of hypersensitivity reactions to carbapenems, cephalosporins, penicillin,
             other β lactam antibiotics metronidazole or to nitroimidazole derivatives

          5. Concurrent infection, that may interfere with the evaluation of response to the study
             antibiotics at the time of randomisation

          6. Patient needs effective concomitant systemic antibacterials (oral, IV, or
             intramuscular) in addition to those designated in the 2 study groups (CAZ-AVI plus
             metronidazole group or meropenem group) (see Section 7.8)

          7. Receipt of non-study systemic antibacterial drug therapy for cIAI for a continuous
             duration of more than 24 hours during the 72 hours preceding the first dose of IV
             drug, except in proven resistant organisms and/or worsening of the clinical condition
             for more than 24 hours. More than 2 consecutive doses are not permitted if the
             individual doses are expected to give &gt;12 hours' cover (ie, giving a total cover of
             &gt;24 hours.) For patients enrolled after a surgical procedure, only 1 dose of non study
             antibiotics is permitted postoperatively

          8. Patient is considered unlikely to survive the 6 to 8 week study period

          9. Patient is unlikely to respond to 7 to 15 days of treatment with antibiotics

         10. Patient is receiving haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis

         11. Diagnosis of abdominal wall abscess confined to musculature of the abdominal wall or
             ischaemic bowel disease without perforation, traumatic bowel perforation requiring
             surgery within 12 hours of perforation, or perforation of gastroduodenal ulcers
             requiring surgery within 24 hours of perforation (these are considered situations of
             peritoneal soiling before the infection has become established)

         12. Simple (uncomplicated), non-perforated appendicitis or gangrenous appendicitis without
             rupture into the peritoneal cavity identified during a surgical procedure OR presence
             of primary peritonitis (ie, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis) or peritonitis
             associated with cirrhosis or chronic ascites

         13. At the time of randomisation, patient is known to have a cIAI caused by pathogens
             resistant to the study antimicrobials planned to be used in the study

         14. Presence of any of the following clinically significant laboratory abnormalities:

               1. Haematocrit &lt;25% or haemoglobin &lt;8 g/dL (&lt;80g/L , &lt;4.9 mmol/L)

               2. Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) &gt;3×the
                  age-specific upper limit of normal (ULN), or total bilirubin &gt;2×ULN (except known
                  Gilbert's disease) For a) to b): unless if these values are acute and directly
                  related to the infectious process being treated.

         15. Creatinine clearance&lt;30 mL/min /1.73 m2 calculated using the child's measured height
             (length) and serum creatinine within the updated &quot;bedside&quot; Schwartz formula (Schwartz
             et al, 2009):

             CrCl (mL/min/1.73m2)=0.413×height (length) (cm)/serum creatinine (mg/dL)

         16. History of seizures, excluding well-documented febrile seizure of childhood

         17. Any situation or condition that would make the patient, in the opinion of the
             Investigator, unsuitable for the study (eg, would place a patient at risk or
             compromise the quality of the data) or may interfere with optimal participation in the
             study

         18. If female, currently pregnant or breast feeding
