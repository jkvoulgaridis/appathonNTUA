  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The benefit of dose escalation in radiotherapy (RT) for biochemical control of prostate
      cancer is a clearly established fact based on the results of different published prospective
      trials. This benefit, acquired with three-dimensional conformal radiation technique is
      counterbalanced by an increase in urinary and gastrointestinal toxicity. The joint progress
      of dose planning systems and multileaf collimators (MLC) technology have enabled the
      Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT). Recently the contribution of &quot;spacers&quot;
      positioned in the septum between the rectum and the prostate could improve the functional
      results of IMRT in terms of rectal toxicity.

      The aim of the investigators study is to assess the dosimetric gain from the contribution of
      the implantable BioProtect balloon on organs at risk.

      Patients eligible for the trial and having signed their consent to participate will undergo a
      scan to verify the possibility of implantation of the balloon. Before and after implantation
      of the balloon, a dosimetric scan will be performed. Radiotherapy will be administered
      according to the habits of each centre : Intensity modulated radiotherapy : 2 Gy / session, 5
      weekly sessions, total dose of 74-80 Gy (+/- associated with an hormone therapy).

      Patients will have a clinical examination :

        -  prior to the start of treatment

        -  once a week during the radiotherapy

        -  at the end of the radiotherapy

        -  and at the end of the study.

      They will also complete quality of life questionnaires :

        -  prior to the start of treatment

        -  at mid-treatment

        -  at the end of the radiotherapy

        -  and at 3, 6, 12 and 24 months after the end of the radiotherapy.

      Finally, patients will undergo a laboratory examination :

        -  prior to the start of treatment

        -  3 months after the end of the radiotherapy

        -  and then every 6 months.
