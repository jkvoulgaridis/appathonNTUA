  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well donor cytotoxic T lymphocytes work in treating patients
      with malignancies with BK and/or JC virus. Cytotoxic T lymphocytes are made from donated
      blood cells that are grown in the laboratory and are designed to kill viruses that can cause
      infections in transplant patients and may be an effective treatment in patients with
      malignancies with BK and/or JC virus.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To assess the efficacy, feasibility and safety of administering most closely human
      leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched BK specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) lines (BK-CTLs)
      generated by ex vivo expansion to mediate antiviral activity in patients with any type of
      malignancies, and/or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome
      (AIDs), and/or history of solid organ transplant with BK and JC infections.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To assess the persistence of the administered BK-CTLs generated by ex vivo expansion in
      patients with any type of malignancies, and/or HIV/AIDs, and/or history of solid organ
      transplant with BK and JC infections.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive allogeneic BK-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocytes intravenously (IV) over 30
      minutes. Patients achieving partial response, stable disease, or progressive disease are
      eligible for 7 additional infusions of CTL occurring at least 2 weeks after the previous CTL
      infusion if they meet the eligibility criteria for subsequent therapy.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically for 12 months.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with any type of malignancies; and/or HIV/AIDs; and/or history of solid organ
             transplant; and/or Merkel polyoma-virus related Merkel cell tumor(s) with measurable
             disease on imaging per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria

             study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients receiving prednisone &gt; 0.5 mg/kg/day at time of enrollment, or have received
