      The investigators will compare tumor marker levels, including PSA, in samples taken from a
      peripheral upper limb vein and the internal iliac veins. These will be collected from
      patients who are scheduled for prostatectomy as part of their standard of care for prostate
      cancer. A selective internal iliac vein sampling procedure will be performed in
      Interventional Radiology. Venous samples will be correlated with prostatectomy specimens. The
      aim is to predict the side of the prostate containing tumor.
