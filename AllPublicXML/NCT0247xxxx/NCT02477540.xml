    <textblock>
      If the participant voluntarily agrees to participate in the clinical trial before
      registration, the investigator conducts a screening test to evaluate the participant's
      suitability.

      A participant that satisfies all inclusion and exclusion criteria is assigned a test
      group(2-time injection group).

      Participants conduct cell therapy within 30 days after bone marrow aspiration, and will
      re-inject autologous mesenchymal stem cells within 30 days after first injection.

      Participants will make a total of 5 hospital visits after registration, and Safety and
      Efficacy will be evaluated based on a fixed procedure on every visit.

    <description>Use Student's paired t-test or Wilcoxon's signed rank test to compare the difference of pre and post Visual Analogue Scale(VAS).
Visual Analogue Scale(VAS):
Using a ruler, the score is determined by mea-suring the distance (mm) on the 10-cm line between the &quot;no pain&quot; anchor and the patient's mark, providing a range of scores from 0-100. A higher score indicates greater pain intensity.
the following cut points on the pain VAS have been recommended: no pain (0-4 mm), mild pain(5-44 mm), moderate pain (45-74 mm), and severe pain (75-100 mm)</description>
