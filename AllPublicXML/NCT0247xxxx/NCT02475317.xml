  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the relative potency of multiple oral doses of LUM001
      and SHP626 administered for 7 days as assessed by fecal bile acid excretion in overweight and
      obese adult subjects. This study is designed to address the relative potency question for the
      first time in the same.

             12 oz cup of tea, and three 1 oz [85 g] chocolate bars. Decaffeinated coffee, tea, and
             cola are not considered to contain caffeine.)
