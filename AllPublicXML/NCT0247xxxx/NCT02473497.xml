  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label expanded access protocol for the treatment of up to approximately 40
      adult or pediatric (defined as age &lt;18 years) patients with tumors harboring either a
      chromosomal translocation or activating mutation involving the ALK or ROS1 gene or an
      activating genetic alteration involving the cMET gene who cannot swallow the crizotinib
      capsule but may be able to derive benefit from treatment with an alternative oral formulation
      of crizotinib.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Crizotinib is indicated in the U.S. for the treatment of patients with metastatic non-small
      cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors are anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive as
      detected by an FDA-approved test. Commercially available dosage forms are 250 mg and 200 mg
      capsules. This expanded access protocol (EAP) is designed to provide access to an alternative
      oral formulation of crizotinib for those patients who are unable to swallow capsules.

    <description>For adult patients, crizotinib 250 mg BID will be administered orally at approximately the same time each day on a continuous daily dosing schedule, ie, without break in dosing. For pediatric patients, crizotinib 280 mg/m2 BID will be administered orally at approximately the same time each day on a continuous daily dosing schedule, ie, without break in dosing.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically or cytologically proven diagnosis of a primary or metastatic malignancy
             that is positive for a chromosomal translocation or activating mutation involving the
             ALK or ROS1 gene or an activating genetic alteration involving the c MET gene, as
             determined by local clinical testing that is appropriately validated in accordance
             with applicable regulatory guidelines and/or practice standards (patients with tumors
             harbouring other genetic alterations that may potentially benefit from treatment with
             crizotinib eg NTRK3 ETV6 fusion gene may be considered on a case by case basis subject
             to approval by the sponsor).

          -  Inability to swallow crizotinib capsules, adult patients of whom must either have a
             feeding tube in place or have completed clinical evaluation of dysphagia without any
             reversible causes identified.

          -  At least 12 months of age (patients &lt;12 months of age will be evaluated on a case by
             case basis and discussed with the sponsor).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Currently receiving crizotinib, another ALK inhibitor, or an investigational product.

          -  Adult patients who have been previously treated with crizotinib.
