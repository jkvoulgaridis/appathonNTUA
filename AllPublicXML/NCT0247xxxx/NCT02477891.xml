      The objective of this study is to provide early access to daratumumab treatment and collect
      additional safety data while the medication is not commercially available or available
      through another protocol for subjects with multiple myeloma who have received at least 3
      prior lines of therapy including a proteasome inhibitor (PI) and an immunomodulatory agent
      (IMiD) or whose disease is double refractory to both a PI and an IMiD.

      This is a multicenter, open-label, early access treatment protocol of single-agent
      daratumumab in subjects with multiple myeloma who have received at least 3 prior lines of
      therapy including a PI and an IMiD or whose disease is double refractory to both a PI and an
      IMiD, who reside in areas where daratumumab is not commercially available or available
      through another protocol, who have not been enrolled in another daratumumab study, and who
      are not eligible for or who do not have access to enrollment in another ongoing clinical
      study of daratumumab. The study will have three phases: Screening phase (30 days prior to
      first dose of study drug), treatment phase (until documented progression, unacceptable
      toxicity, or study end), End of Treatment (30 days after last dose of study drug).
      Participants will receive daratumumab (16 milligram per kilogram [mg/kg]) as intravenous
      infusion. Participants will primarily be assessed for overall response rate. Safety will be
      monitored throughout the study.

    <description>Participants will receive daratumumab (16 milligram per kilogram [mg/kg]) as intravenous infusion on Day 1, 8, 15, and 22 of Cycles 1 and 2 (weekly dosing), on Day 1 and 15 of Cycles 3 to 6 (every 2 weeks dosing), and on Day 1 of Cycle 7 and subsequent cycles (every 4 weeks dosing) until documented progression, unacceptable toxicity, or study end. Each cycle is of 28 days.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject must be at least 18 years of age

          -  Subject must have documented multiple myeloma and have evidence of disease progression
             on or after the most recent prior treatment regimen as defined by IMWG criteria:
             Subjects who have received at least 3 prior lines of therapy including a proteasome
             inhibitor (greater than or equal to [&gt;=] 2 cycles or 2 months of treatment) and an
             IMiD (&gt;= 2 cycles or 2 months of treatment) in any order during the course of
             treatment (except for subjects who discontinued either of these treatments due to a
             severe allergic reaction within the first 2 cycles/months) OR Subjects whose disease
             is double refractory to a proteasome inhibitor (PI) and an immunomodulatory agent
             (IMiD). For subjects who have received more than 1 type of PI, their disease must be
             refractory to the most recent one. Similarly, for those who have received more than 1
             type of IMiD, their disease must be refractory to the most recent one

          -  Subject must have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status
             score of 0, 1, or 2

          -  A woman of childbearing potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test
             at Screening

          -  A man who is sexually active with a woman of childbearing potential and has not had a
             vasectomy must agree to use a barrier method of birth control during the study, and
             all men must also not donate sperm during the study and for 6 months after receiving
             the last dose of study drug

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Ever enrolled in another daratumumab study or eligible for enrollment in another
             ongoing clinical study of daratumumab

          -  Subject receives any other anti-myeloma therapy while receiving daratumumab

          -  Enrolled in another interventional clinical study with therapeutic intent

          -  Subject has known chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with a Forced
             Expiratory Volume in 1 second (FEV1) less than 50% of predicted normal

          -  Subject has known moderate or severe persistent asthma within the past 2 years, or
             currently has uncontrolled asthma of any classification

          -  Prior exposure to any anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody
