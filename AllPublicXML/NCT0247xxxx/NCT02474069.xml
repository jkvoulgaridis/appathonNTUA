      This study is designed to support the optimal use of secukinumab by providing data to refine
      guidance on dosing flexibility in patients with psoriasis. The purpose of the study is to
      explore the effects of dosage interval shorteng to achieve PASI 90 at week 32 for patients
      who had less than almost clear skin at week 16.

    <intervention_model_description>This was a multicenter, double-blind, randomized study in 772 patients with moderate to severe chronic plaque-type psoriasis. Patients were enrolled at 89 study sites in Germany. The study was divided into 3 phases: screening, selection phase (SP), and comparative dosing phase (CDP). In the screening phase, inclusion and exclusion criteria were confirmed. Eligible patients rolled over into a selection phase (SP) where all patients received 300 mg s.c. open-label secukinumab at baseline, Weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, and 12. At Week 16, PASI response was assessed as a basis for further treatment: 300 mg s.c. secukinumab treatment every 4 weeks vesus 300 mg s.c. secukinumab treatment every 2 weeks.
Patients who achieved at least clear or almost clear skin (≥ PASI 90) at Week 16 discontinued the study</intervention_model_description>

         10. Active ongoing inflammatory diseases other than psoriasis that might confound the
             evaluation of the benefit of secukinumab therapy. Patients with psoriatic arthritis
             are not excluded.

             hepatic, pulmonary, neurologic, endocrine, cardiac, infectious or gastrointestinal)
             which in the opinion of the investigator significantly immunocompromises the subject
             and/or places the subject at unacceptable risk for receiving an immunomodulatory
             therapy.

         12. Subjects with preexisting or recent-onset central or peripheral nervous system
             demyelinating disorders at discretion of the investigator.

             respiratory and/or urinary tract infections or evidence of tuberculosis infection as
             defined by a positive QuantiFERON TB-Gold test at screening. Subjects with a positive
             or indeterminate QuantiFERON TB-Gold test may participate in the study if further full
             tuberculosis work up (according to local practice/guidelines) completed at least 12
             weeks prior to first study drug administration establishes conclusively that the
             subject has no evidence of active tuberculosis. If presence of latent tuberculosis is
             established, then treatment must have been initiated and maintained according to local
             country guidelines for at least 4 weeks prior to screening.

         18. Past medical history record of infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV),

             evidence of recurrence in the past 12 weeks; carcinoma in situ of the cervix or
             non-invasive malignant colon polyps that have been removed).

         20. Current severe progressive or uncontrolled disease which in the judgment of the
             clinical investigator renders the subject unsuitable for the trial or puts the subject
             at increased risk.

         21. Inability or unwillingness to undergo repeated venipuncture (e.g. because of poor
             tolerability or lack of access to veins).

         22. Any medical or psychiatric condition which, in the investigator's opinion, would
             preclude the participant from adhering to the protocol or completing the study per
             protocol.

         23. History or evidence of ongoing alcohol or drug abuse, within the last six months
             before screening.

         24. Plans for administration of live vaccines during the study period or 6 weeks prior to
             screening.

        No additional exclusions may be applied by the investigator, in order to ensure that the
        study population will be representative of all eligible subjects.

        <title>Number of Participants With PASI 90 Response at Week 32</title>
        <description>Number of participants with at least 90% improvement from baseline. PASI is a combined assessment of lesion severity and affected area into a single score: 0 (no disease) to 72 (maximal disease). Body is divided into 4 areas for scoring (head, arms, trunk, legs; each area is scored by itself and scores are combined for final PASI. For each area, percent of skin involved is estimated: 0 (0%) to 6 (90-100%), and severity is estimated by clinical signs, erythema, induration and desquamation; scale 0 (none) to 4 (maximum). Final PASI = sum of severity parameters for each area* area score weight of section (head: 0.1, arms: 0.2 body: 0.3 legs: 0.4).</description>

        <description>Number of participants with at least 90 or 100% improvement from baseline. PASI is a combined assessment of lesion severity and affected area into a single score: 0 (no disease) to 72 (maximal disease). Body is divided into 4 areas for scoring (head, arms, trunk, legs; each area is scored by itself and scores are combined for final PASI. For each area, percent of skin involved is estimated: 0 (0%) to 6 (90-100%), and severity is estimated by clinical signs, erythema, induration and desquamation; scale 0 (none) to 4 (maximum). Final PASI = sum of severity parameters for each area* area score weight of section (head: 0.1, arms: 0.2 body: 0.3 legs: 0.4).</description>

        <title>Comparative Dose Phase: Summary of PASI Total Score</title>
        <description>PASI is a combined assessment of lesion severity and affected area into a single score: 0 (no disease) to 72 (maximal disease). Body is divided into 4 areas for scoring (head, arms, trunk, legs; each area is scored by itself and scores are combined for final PASI. For each area, percent of skin involved is estimated: 0 (0%) to 6 (90-100%), and severity is estimated by clinical signs, erythema, induration and desquamation; scale 0 (none) to 4 (maximum). Final PASI = sum of severity parameters for each area* area score weight of section (head: 0.1, arms: 0.2 body: 0.3 legs: 0.4).</description>

        <title>Number of Patients Achieving Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) Scores of 0 or 1 by Visits in the CDP</title>
        <description>The DLQI is a ten item general dermatology disability index designed to assess health-related quality of life in adult participants with skin diseases such as eczema, psoriasis, acne and viral worts. It is a self-administered questionnaire which includes domains of daily activity, leisure, personal relationships, symptoms and feelings, treatment and school/work activities. Each domain has 4 response categories ranging from 0 (not at all) to 3 (very much). &quot;Not relevant&quot; is a valid score also and is scored as 0. The DLQI total score is a sum of all 10 responses. Scores range from 0 to 30 with higher scores indicating greater health-related quality of life impairment.
The DLQI was designed to assess health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in adult patients with skin diseases including psoriasis.</description>

Each domain has 4 response categories ranging from 0 (not at all) to 3 (very much). &quot;Not relevant&quot; is a valid score also and is scored as 0. The DLQI total score is a sum of all 10 responses. Scores range from 0 to 30 with higher scores indicating greater health-related quality of life impairment.</description>
