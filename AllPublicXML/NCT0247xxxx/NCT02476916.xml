    <textblock>
      Study AG348-C-003 is a multicenter study designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of
      different dose levels of AG-348 (mitapivat) in participants with PK deficiency.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, open label, two arm, multicenter, randomized, dose-ranging study during
      which adult participants with PK deficiency will receive multiple doses of AG-348 for up to
      24 weeks (Core Period); eligible participants may enter an Extension Period to receive AG-348
      for up to 8 additional years. Data will be reviewed on a regular basis and study design, dose
      and schedule will be adapted based on these reviews. The study will evaluate the safety and
      tolerability of multiple doses of AG-348, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic (PD) profile of
      AG-348 and early indicators of clinical efficacy.

    <description>Participants with PK deficiency were randomized to either receive AG-348, 50 or 300 mg, as initial doses, BID for the Core Period (Week 24). At the Week 24 visit, Core Period participants who had safely tolerated AG-348 and demonstrated clinical activity in response to AG-348 were potentially eligible to immediately roll over to the Extension Period for continued treatment. Participants were assigned to initial doses, however, over the course of the core period were treated across a range of doses due to treatment emergent adverse events (AEs) and hemoglobin (Hb) levels exceeding mid-point of sex-adjusted ranges.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Participants were recruited in the core period of the study at 14 investigative sites in the 6 countries from 13 July 2015 to 14 July 2017 (data cut-off date). The core period is completed, and results of this period are reported. The extension period is ongoing.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>A total of 52 participants were enrolled in the Core Period of the study. Out of 52 participants, 9 discontinued during the core period, and 43 completed the core period. Out of these 43, 36 entered the extension period, and 7 did not enter the extension period and were followed up to 4 weeks after their last dose of AG-348 in the core study.</pre_assignment_details>

          <title>AG-348 50 mg BID</title>
          <description>Participants with Pyruvate Kinase (PK) deficiency received AG-348, 50 milligrams (mg), as initial dose, twice daily (BID) for 24 weeks (Core Period). Participants were assigned to initial doses, however, over the course of the Core Period were treated across a range of doses due to treatment emergent adverse events (AEs) and hemoglobin (Hb) levels exceeding mid-point of sex-adjusted ranges. At the Week 24 visit, Core Period participants who had safely tolerated AG-348 and demonstrated clinical activity in response to AG-348 were potentially eligible to immediately roll over to the Extension Period for continued treatment. If participants chose not to enroll, they were followed up to four weeks after the last dose of AG-348.</description>

            <description>Participants with PK deficiency received AG-348, 300 mg, as initial dose, BID for 24 weeks (Core Period). Participants were assigned to initial doses, however, over the course of the Core Period were treated across a range of doses due to treatment emergent AEs and Hb levels exceeding mid-point of sex-adjusted ranges. At the Week 24 visit, Core Period participants who had safely tolerated AG-348 and demonstrated clinical activity in response to AG-348 were potentially eligible to immediately roll over to the Extension Period for continued treatment. If participants chose not to enroll, they were followed up to four weeks after the last dose of AG-348.</description>

            <description>Participants with PK deficiency received AG-348, 300 mg, as initial dose, BID for 24 weeks (Core Period). Participants were assigned to initial doses, however, over the course of the Core Period were treated across a range of doses due to treatment emergent AEs and Hb levels exceeding mid-point of sex-adjusted ranges. At the Week 24 visit, Core Period participants who had safely tolerated AG-348 and demonstrated clinical activity in response to AG-348 were potentially eligible to immediately roll over to the Extension Period for continued treatment. If participants chose not to enroll, they were followed up to four weeks after the last dose of AG-348.</description>
