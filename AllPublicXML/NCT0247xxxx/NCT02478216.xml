  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The patients were allocated randomly to receive remote preconditioning group (RIPC group, R)
      or not (Control group, C) using sealed envelopes with the options inside the sealed envelope
      of R and C before anaesthesia induction. The registered nurse who did not participate in
      patient care and was blind to the study performed the all randomization process. All medical
      staffs who involved the patient care were blind to the study. All data were collected by
      trained observers who were blind to the study and did not participate in patient care

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      RIPC was performed just after anesthesia induction and before the tourniquet application for
      the operation site. The tourniquet was applied at the opposite site of thigh in the both
      groups. The thigh was covered with blanket to conceal the tourniquet inflation and deflation.
      For R group, 3 cycles of tourniquet inflation for 5 minutes with 2 × systemic systolic
      arterial blood pressure of arrival at operation room and deflation were performed. For C
      group, the tourniquet was applied with same manner for R group except inflation pressure of 0
      mmHg. The tourniquet pressure according to the randomization was set by the registered nurse
      who participated in the patients' allocation. The monitor of tourniquet pressure was sealed
      for blindness.
