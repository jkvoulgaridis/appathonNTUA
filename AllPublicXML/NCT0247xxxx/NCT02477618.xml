    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, designed to evaluate the
      efficacy and safety of SAGE-547 administered as a continuous intravenous infusion to subjects
      in Super-Refractory Status Epilepticus (SRSE).

    <measure>Number of Participants Able to be Weaned Off All Third-Line Agents Prior to End of Double-Blind SAGE-547 or Placebo Infusion, and Remain Off All Third-Line Agents for ≥ 24 Hours Following the End of SAGE-547 or Placebo Infusion</measure>
    <time_frame>7 days</time_frame>
    <description>Third-line agents were anesthetic agents that were administered in order to reach a seizure or burst suppression electroencephalogram (EEG) pattern. For this study, third-line agents were defined as continuous intravenous infusions of pentobarbital/thiopental, midazolam, propofol, and ketamine at maintenance doses alone or in combination sufficient to produce a burst or seizure suppression pattern on the EEG. A responder was a participant who was able to be weaned off all third-line agents prior to the end of the SAGE-547 or placebo infusion and remain off all third-line agents for &gt;=24 hours after the end of the study drug infusion. The primary analysis was a comparison between SAGE-547 and placebo of the proportion of responders.</description>

    <measure>Change in Clinical Global Impression Scale (CGI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 21 days</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI scale was used to integrate several sources of information into a single rating of a participant's condition. The CGI was rated on a 7-point scale, from a minimum of 0 to a maximum of 7, where 0 = Not assessed; 1 = Normal, not at all ill; 2 = Borderline physically ill; 3 = Mildly ill; 4 = Moderately ill; 5 = Markedly ill; 6 = Severely ill; 7 = Among the most extremely ill participants. A negative change from baseline indicates improvement. A positive change from baseline indicates worsening. Here, study visits followed by &quot;R&quot; indicate the Open-label Treatment Period.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects two (2) years of age and older

          -  Subjects who have:

               -  Failed to respond to the administration of at least one first-line agent (e.g.,
                  benzodiazepine or other emergent initial anti-epileptic drug [AED] treatment),
                  according to institution standard of care, and;

               -  Failed to respond to at least one second-line agent (e.g., phenytoin,
                  fosphenytoin, valproate, phenobarbital, levetiracetam or other urgent control
                  AED), according to institution standard of care, and;

               -  Not previously been administered a third-line agent but have been admitted to an
                  intensive care unit with the intent of administering at least one third-line
                  agent for at least 24 hours; or who have previously failed zero, one or more wean
                  attempts from third-line agents and are now on continuous intravenous infusions
                  of one or more third-line agent and in an EEG burst or seizure suppression
                  pattern; or who have previously failed one or more wean attempts from third-line
                  agents and are now either not on a continuous intravenous infusion of at least
                  one third-line agent or are on a continuous intravenous infusion of one or more
                  third-line agent but not in an EEG burst or seizure suppression pattern

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with SRSE due to anoxic/hypoxic encephalopathy with highly malignant/
             malignant EEG features

          -  Children (subjects aged less than 17 years) with an encephalopathy due to a rapidly
             progressing underlying neurological disorder

          -  Subjects who have any of the following:

               1. a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) low enough to warrant dialysis but for
                  whatever reason, dialysis is not planned or non-continuous dialysis planned (that
                  would not adequately remove Captisol®);

               2. severe cardiogenic or vasodilatory shock requiring two or more pressors that is
                  not related to third-line agent use;

               3. fulminant hepatic failure;

               4. no reasonable expectation of recovery (for instance, a likely outcome is
                  persistent vegetative state) or life-expectancy, in the experience of the
                  investigator, is less than 30 days.

          -  Subjects who are being administered more than three third-line agents concomitantly or
             in whom the qualifying wean cannot be completed per protocol

      <pre_assignment_details>Participants 2 years of age and older with Super-Refractory Status Epilepticus were eligible. One participant in the placebo group was erroneously given SAGE-547 and was, therefore, included in the SAGE- 547 group.</pre_assignment_details>

        <description>Third-line agents were anesthetic agents that were administered in order to reach a seizure or burst suppression electroencephalogram (EEG) pattern. For this study, third-line agents were defined as continuous intravenous infusions of pentobarbital/thiopental, midazolam, propofol, and ketamine at maintenance doses alone or in combination sufficient to produce a burst or seizure suppression pattern on the EEG. A responder was a participant who was able to be weaned off all third-line agents prior to the end of the SAGE-547 or placebo infusion and remain off all third-line agents for &gt;=24 hours after the end of the study drug infusion. The primary analysis was a comparison between SAGE-547 and placebo of the proportion of responders.</description>

        <title>Change in Clinical Global Impression Scale (CGI)</title>
        <description>The CGI scale was used to integrate several sources of information into a single rating of a participant's condition. The CGI was rated on a 7-point scale, from a minimum of 0 to a maximum of 7, where 0 = Not assessed; 1 = Normal, not at all ill; 2 = Borderline physically ill; 3 = Mildly ill; 4 = Moderately ill; 5 = Markedly ill; 6 = Severely ill; 7 = Among the most extremely ill participants. A negative change from baseline indicates improvement. A positive change from baseline indicates worsening. Here, study visits followed by &quot;R&quot; indicate the Open-label Treatment Period.</description>
        <time_frame>Up to 21 days</time_frame>
        <population>The Intent-to-Treat Analysis Set included all participants who had an infusion of blinded study drug initiated. Here, number of participants analyzed (N) indicates participants with available data at each time point for this outcome measure.</population>
