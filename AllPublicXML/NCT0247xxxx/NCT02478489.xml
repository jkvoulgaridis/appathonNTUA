    <textblock>
      The specific aims of this pragmatic randomized controlled trial are to compare initiating
      injectable extended release naltrexone (XR-NTX) or oral naltrexone (PO-NTX) at the time of
      discharge from a medical hospitalization for patients with alcohol use disorder (AUD) on: 1)
      alcohol consumption and consequences, and 2) acute healthcare utilization (including hospital
      readmission and emergency visits) and cost-effectiveness. In exploratory analyses, the
      investigators will assess moderators of medication effects including demographic, behavioral,
      and genetic factors.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hospitalization for medical illness is a unique and missed opportunity for intervention for
      alcohol use disorders (AUDs). Referrals can help link patients from hospitals to alcohol
      treatment. But most patients return to heavy drinking after hospital discharge and do not
      follow-up with alcohol treatment, risking hospital readmission. Pharmacotherapy has efficacy
      for AUD, but adherence to these medications is poor. Furthermore, these medications are
      rarely prescribed in general medical settings, during or after hospitalization. Beginning
      treatment for AUD during a hospitalization for medical illness could broaden the reach of
      effective treatment and is likely to be more effective than delaying treatment until a
      specialist visit or treatment program entry. Hospital discharge is a time of both risk (i.e.,
      for drinking and non-adherence to medical care) and opportunity (i.e., to begin alcohol
      treatment and complete medical treatments). Interventions that work quickly and improve
      adherence could improve medical and alcohol-related outcomes.

      Oral naltrexone (PO-NTX), and the more-costly-per-dose long-acting injectable extended
      release naltrexone (XR-NTX) are Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved efficacious
      treatments for AUD. The XR-NTX half-life is 5-10 days and is dosed monthly, whereas the
      PO-NTX half-life is 13 hours and is dosed daily. The longer half-life of XR-NTX translates
      into patients receiving effective pharmacotherapy for a longer time without having to adhere
      to a daily dose. Thus, although more costly per dose, greater effectiveness could mean
      overall reduced costs of care (including alcohol-related health consequences and healthcare
      utilization). Despite potential differences in costs and patient preferences, PO-NTX and
      XR-NTX have not been directly compared in a randomized controlled trial (RCT), they have not
      been studied as treatments at medical hospital discharge, and their effectiveness in real
      world practice settings compared with standard care is unknown.

      This trial is significant because it will address the clinically relevant comparative
      effectiveness question and lead to greater adoption of the most effective and cost-effective
      approach for treating AUD with pharmacotherapy in general hospitals.

    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The primary alcohol use outcome will be percent heavy drinking days (%HDDs). %HDDs is the most likely (and most sensitive) to be affected by NTX and is clinically important (any reduction means less risk of harm). We chose self-report because biological testing is not sufficiently valid for detecting drinking levels and changes of clinical importance. The self-report tool is valid, particularly so when staff are well trained, and when the context for the subject is: they are informed they are being tested for consumption (breath alcohol and carbohydrate deficient transferrin (CDT), there are no consequences related to consumption levels, and that results are being recorded confidentially.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Acute care hospital utilization</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Any acute hospital utilization (emergency department visit or inpatient stay) over the past 90 days assessed at 3-month follow-up by the Form 90. Self-report for short-term high impact, memorable health utilization such as emergency and hospital stays is valid and can measure utilization at any site. Using the clinical data warehouse at one site (Boston Medical Center (BMC)) and statewide data, we will compare self-report to the utilization databases. But, self-report data will remain primary, with databases used to provide a descriptive frame of reference.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Medication adherence</measure>
    <time_frame>1, 2 and 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>High adherence to XR-NTX will be defined as administration of XR-NTX by the study nurse 3 times. Medium adherence will be defined as 1 or 2 injections. For PO-NTX, high adherence will be defined as participant self-report of taking PO-NTX for 90 out of the past 90 days at the 3 month study visit, and medium adherers as participant self-report of taking PO-NTX for 30-89 out of the past 90 days at the 3 month study visit (Form 90). We will also assess the presence of detectable beta-naltrexol to confirm reports of recent pill taking.</description>

    <measure>Alcohol consequences via questionnaire</measure>

    <description>Alcohol consequences over the past 3 months will be measured by collecting participant self-report data via the Short Inventory of Problems (SIP-2R) at 3-month follow-up. The SIP-2R is a validated 15-item measure for assessing recent adverse consequences associated with alcohol use.</description>

    <description>Healthcare utilization cost data will be collected via the Form 90 for self-reported outpatient and emergency visits, hospitalizations, and specialty addiction treatment. Utilization episodes will be converted to costs by use of Medicare relative value units (RVUs) for acute inpatient care, Resource Based Relative Value System (RBRVS) units for Medicare reimbursement of outpatient visits, and the average daily rate for long-term care.</description>
