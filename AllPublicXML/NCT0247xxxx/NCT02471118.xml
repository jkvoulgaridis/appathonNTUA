      This is a Canadian randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study designed
      to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of adalimumab versus placebo when used to treat
      subjects with a diagnosis of osteoarthritis of the knee, and with clinical features of
      inflammation, whose pain persists despite receiving maximum tolerated doses of conventional
      therapy.

      This is a Canadian randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study designed
      to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of adalimumab versus placebo when used to treat
      subjects with a diagnosis of osteoarthritis of the knee, and with clinical features of
      inflammation, whose pain persists despite receiving maximum tolerated doses of conventional
      therapy. A total of 100 subjects will be entered into the study.

      Subjects will be randomized (1:1) at baseline to receive either adalimumab 40 mg every other
      week or placebo for 16 weeks. The study drug will be self-administered via subcutaneous
      injection. Efficacy will be assessed at week 16 while the safety of the study drug will be
      monitored throughout the study. At week 16 all subjects will begin to receive open label
      adalimumab 40 mg every other week.
