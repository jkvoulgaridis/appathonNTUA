  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of study Part A is to assess the safety of talacotuzumab (formerly
      CSL362) monotherapy and confirm the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) in participants with
      acute myeloid leukemia (AML) for whom experimental therapy is appropriate. The primary
      objective of study Part B are to assess complete response (CR) rate and overall survival (OS)
      in participants with AML who are not eligible for intense induction chemotherapy and who are
      randomly assigned to receive decitabine plus talacotuzumab at the RP2D or decitabine alone.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a 2-part, open-label, multicenter, Phase 2/3 study conducted in participants with AML
      who are suitable for experimental therapy (Part A) and in participants with untreated AML who
      are not eligible for intense induction chemotherapy or hematopoeitic stem cell
      transplantation (HSCT) (Part B). In Study Part A, the safety, pharmacokinetic (PK) and
      pharmacodynamic (PD) profile will be assessed to confirm the RP2D of 9 milligram per kilogram
      (mg/kg) talacotuzumab. In Study Part B, participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio into
      either decitabine + talacotuzumab (arm 1) or decitabine alone (arm 2). Blood and bone marrow
      sampling will be done in Part A and B for disease assessment, PK, PD, and biomarkers will be
      collected in all participants. Safety will be monitored throughout the study.
