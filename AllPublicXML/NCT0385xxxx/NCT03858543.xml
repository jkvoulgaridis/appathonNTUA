  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the efficacy of treatment of striae distensae using the combined
      modality of fractional laser and poly-L lactic acid (Sculptra).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Striae Distensae (SD) is a form of scarring that can oftentimes be quite disfiguring and
      emotionally distressing to individuals.

      Fractional laser therapy has been used by doctors to treat stretch marks by stimulating
      collagen growth.

      Poly-L lactic acid also promotes collagen growth in the areas injected.

      The combination of laser and poly-L lactic acid might provide the optimal treatment modality
      for SD by decreasing the appearance of atrophic scars.

    <description>Modified Manchester Scar Scale was used to assess stretch mark reduction compared to pre-treatment photographs. The range of each subscale is between 4-26. A higher value represents a worse outcome. A value of 26 is the maximum score and represents the worst outcome. A value of 4 is the minimum score and represents the best outcome. Subscales are then summed to compute a total score.</description>

    <description>Modified Manchester Scar Scale was used to assess and judge whether erbium-YAG fractionated laser therapy plus Sculptra is superior to laser therapy alone. The range of each subscale is between 4-26. A higher value represents a worse outcome. A value of 26 is the maximum score and represents the worst outcome. A value of 4 is the minimum score and represents the best outcome. Subscales are then summed to compute a total score.</description>
