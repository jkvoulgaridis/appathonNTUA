  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the TearCare System will be compared with the LipiFlow Thermal Pulsation
      System in patients with dry eye disease. The objective is to demonstrate that the TearCare
      System is safe and effective in relieving the signs and symptoms of dry eye disease.

    <measure>Meibomian Gland Secretion Score</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>The Meibomian Gland Secretion score is the measure of the quality of the secretions in the meibomian glands. Secretions are scored on a scale from 0-3, with 0 indicating no secretion and 3 indicating clear secretions. Fifteen glands are scored in each lower eyelid. Total score ranges from 0-45.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>The OSDI is a questionnaire that measures the severity of symptoms of dry eye disease. Total score can range from 0-100. A score of 0-12 is normal, 13-22 is mild, 23-32 is moderate, and 33-100 is severe dry eye.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Corneal staining score</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>This scores the amount of staining observed on the surface of the cornea using the NEI Scale. Five regions of the cornea are scored on a scale from 0-3, with 0 being no staining and 3 being the most staining. The total score can range from 0-15.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Conjunctival staining score</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>This scores the amount of staining observed on the surface of the conjunctiva using the NEI scale. Six regions of the conjunctiva are scored on a scale from 0-3, with 0 being no staining and 3 being the most staining. The total score can range from 0-18.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>SANDE</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>Symptom Assessment iN Dry Eye (SANDE) questionnaire is a visual analog scale the measures the severity and frequency of dry eye symptoms. The scale ranges from 0 to 100 with 0 being the least and 100 being the worst.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Eye Dryness Score</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>Eye Dryness Score is a visual analog scale the measures the level of discomfort related to eye dryness. The scale ranges from 0 to 100 with 0 being the least and 100 being the worst.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Meibomian glands yielding clear secretions</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>This is a count of the number of glands scored as having clear secretions. Fifteen glands are scored. Total score ranges from 0-15 with 15 being the best.</description>
