  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal (or purpose) of this study is to evaluate (study) a new way to stabilize (steady)
      the activity between the fat deposits surrounding the heart and the left atrium.

      To reduce the amount of EAT, this study will use a medication called Liraglutide. This
      medication is known to work on fat deposits and produce weight loss. The investigator is
      conducting this study to find out if Liraglutide will reduce the fat deposits surrounding the
      participant's heart, and stabilize (and perhaps reduce or eliminate) atrial fibrillation
      activity.

    <description>A structured risk factor modification (RFM) program currently offered to all patients who are overweight or obese undergoing an ablation procedure for atrial fibrillation.The RFM program is already offered through our Center for Atrial Fibrillation and is managed by a nurse practitioner. The RFM program will provide patient teaching and education on weight, fitness,blood pressure control, glucose control, cholesterol, sleep apnea, smoking, and alcohol.</description>

    <arm_group_label>RFM plus Liraglutide</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>In addition to RFM, Liraglutide will be administered. Liraglutide is an FDA approved medication used as an adjunct to a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity for chronic weight management of obese adults with weight-related comorbid conditions.</description>
  </arm_group>
  <intervention>
    <intervention_type>Drug</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>Liraglutide</intervention_name>
    <description>Liraglutide will be administered with a starting dose of 0.6 mg once daily and subsequent increments to 1.2 mg once daily (after at least one week) and to 1.8 mg once daily (after at least a week on 1.2 mg). This will be taken for 3 consecutive months in conjunction with RFM program prior to catheter ablation. Treatment will resume post ablation and will be continue for 6 months.</description>

    <description>The program involves weight management and exercise regimen (30 minutes for 2 to 4 times a week), hyperlipidemia management (lifestyle measure changes and initiation of statins and fibrates if necessary), management of obstructive sleep apnea (initiation of Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) if necessary), management of hypertension (reduction of salt intake, initiation of Angiotensin Converting Enzyme Inhibitor (ACEI) or Angiotensin II Receptor blockers (ARB) medications if necessary), diabetes management (lifestyle measure changes, endocrine review and initiation of metformin if necessary) and smoking cessation and alcohol abstinence or reduction. This program will be performed at start of study participation all throughout the follow up period.</description>

    <description>The choice of antiarrhythmic drug will be at the discretion of the managing physician, but will generally include either a class IC or class III antiarrhythmic drug. If necessary, and clinically indicated, amiodarone may be used. Therapy will be initiated at the start of study participation and will be discontinued 6-12 weeks after the ablation, as deemed clinically appropriate by the managing electrophysiologist.</description>

    <intervention_name>Afib Catheter Ablation</intervention_name>
    <description>The procedure will be performed according to usual clinical practice. The primary approach will be antral pulmonary vein isolation (PVI), preferably performed by cryoballoon ablation, though radiofrequency may be used as deemed necessary by the operator for clinical reasons. This will be performed after 3 months of RFM or RFM + Liraglutide program.</description>
