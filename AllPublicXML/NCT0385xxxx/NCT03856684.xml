  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite the existence of an effective screening test (pap smear), cervical cancer is, every
      year in France, the cause of more than 3,000 new cases and 1,100 deaths. But, in France, 4 in
      10 women are not screened or not often enough (nearly 7 millions women). It is therefore
      necessary to develop new strategies to reach these women. The etiological factor of this
      cancer is persistent infection with High-Risk Human PapillomaVirus (HR-HPV). Thereby,
      HPV-based tests could be alternative screening tests. Vaginal self-sampling with HR-HPV test
      is simpler and less intrusive than the pap smear. It has been shown that sending vaginal
      self-sampling kit (with HPV test) to unscreened women's home is a powerful means to increase
      the participation rate of cervical cancer screening. It seems interesting to explore methods
      to increase the efficiency of this strategy by optimizing the ratio of the number of kits
      used compared to the number of kits sent. Two approaches will be tested: a system &quot;available
      on request&quot; of the kit and / or the addition of an SMS reminder.
