    <textblock>
      Poor posture have historically been blamed for pain and disability in the general population.
      A treatment-strategy that have gain popularity in recent years is the use of a posture shirt
      which is a compressive shirt designed and marketed to the general public and health service
      providers as a way to improve posture and consequently alter muscle activity, reduce

    <description>Posture will be determined by measuring head and shoulder angles during a functional task</description>

    <measure>Experienced pain</measure>
    <time_frame>Within session (2hr)</time_frame>
    <description>Any potential pain during the functional tasks will be monitored using a 0-11 numeric rating scale (NRS) with 0 being no pain and 10 being worst imaginable pain.</description>

    <measure>Concentration during task</measure>
    <time_frame>Within session (2hr)</time_frame>
    <description>Two questions regarding concentration during task was asked: (Q1: I had to concentrate to do the task, Q2: My concentration was constant throughout the task) were scores using a 5 point Likert scale (1: Strongly disagree; 2: Disagree; 3: Neither agree nor disagree; 4: Agree; 5: Strongly agree).</description>

    <measure>Consciousness of posture during task</measure>
    <time_frame>Within session (2hr)</time_frame>
    <description>Two questions regarding consciousness of posture during task was asked (Q1: I was conscious about how I was sitting in the beginning of the task , Q2: I was conscious about how I was sitting at the end of the task) was scored using a 5 point Likert scale (1: Strongly disagree; 2: Disagree; 3: Neither agree nor disagree; 4: Agree; 5: Strongly agree).</description>
