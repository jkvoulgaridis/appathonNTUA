  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hip-related groin pain is common in sports that involves change of direction, kicks and
      sprint accelerations such as football, ishockey, tennis and basketball. Groin pain symptoms
      either pre- or post-treatment may be load-related, there is limited information on how
      different sporting activities affect hip joint loading. Thus, the purpose of this explorative
      cross-sectional study is to investigate hip peak torque in running and jumping activities in
      healthy active subjects.

      Such information may guide furture rehabilitation strategies and return to sport sport
      criteria.

      Twenty healthy subjects from the Capital Region of Denmark with an age of 18-40 will be
      included.

      Hip joint kinetics and kinamatics will be obtained during the following activities for each
      subjects:

        1. Walking

        2. Jogging (8-11 km/h)

        3. Maximal 6 meters sprint acceleration

        4. Single leg drop jump from 35 cm height

        5. Horizontal jump with single leg landing with a distance of 100% and 150% of leg length

        6. Maximal change of direction at 45, 135, 180 degrees

        7. Single-leg cross-country skiing exercise
