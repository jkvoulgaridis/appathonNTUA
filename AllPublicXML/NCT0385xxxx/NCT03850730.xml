  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Investigators will test the value of very low dose Pazopanib administered to patients with
      hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia for the reduction in the severity of nose bleeds in
      those with frequent and long duration bleeding episodes.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Based on frequency and nose bleed duration, a non-randomized, single arm, open label study of
      30 hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia patients will be treated with very low dose
      Pazopanib [25mg-similar] for between 16 and 24 weeks.. The primary endpoint is a reduction in
      bleeding duration of 50% or more, along with multiple secondary related endpoints, including
      bleed frequency, blood counts and quality of life; as compared to 6-12 weeks of baseline
      characteristics. If after the first 8 weeks of therapy benefit is suboptimal, dose advance to
      50mg-similar daily can be considered.

    <intervention_model_description>After at least a 6 week baseline, patients will be placed on very low dose Pazopanib [25mg-similar], for 8 weeks.. If the primary bleeding duration endpoint is achieved, than the patient will continue for another 8wks, or a total of 16 weeks on the same dose. Lack of any response will result in a dose advance to 50mg for another 3mths. If a moderate change has occurred, than the 25mg dose will be continued for another 4 weeks, and if primary endpoint achieved, continue for another 12 weeks... Lack of endpoint achievement, will augment dose to 50mg and extend study for 12 weeks, or a total of 24 weeks.</intervention_model_description>

                  4. Participant agrees not to undergo cautery of nasal telangiectasias or take any
                  experimental therapies for hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia other than the

         16. Alanine Transaminase &gt;2x upper limit of normal.

         17. Bilirubin &gt;1.5x upper limit of normal (isolated bilirubin &gt;1.5x upper limit of normal
             is acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated and direct bilirubin &lt;35%).

         18. Participant has poorly controlled hypertension [defined as systolic blood pressure
             (SBP) ≥ 140 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) ≥90 mmHg. Initiation or adjustment
             of antihypertensive medication(s) is permitted prior to study entry [between screen
             and baseline]. At Screening, blood pressure must be assessed three times and the mean
             SBP/DBP must be &lt;140/90 mmHg in order for a participant to be eligible for the study.]
