  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal of this project is to identify, measure, and influence fear of cardiac event
      recurrence, a candidate mechanism of change in medication adherence in patients with
      suspected acute coronary syndrome (ACS). An intervention will be tested that has been used to
      reduce fear of cancer recurrence by changing emotion-related patterns of attention allocation
      and interpretation of neutral stimuli. Secondarily, the study will test whether a reduction
      in fear of cardiac event recurrence improves medication adherence.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acute coronary syndrome (ACS; myocardial infarction or unstable angina) is a leading cause of
      morbidity and mortality in the U.S., with &gt;1 million cases per year. Survivors are at high
      risk for recurrent cardiovascular disease (CVD) events, particularly if they do not adhere to
      risk-reducing medications. Unfortunately, nonadherence among ACS patients is very common
      (~50%), and no effective, scalable interventions exist. Addressing medication nonadherence in
      ACS patients requires an experimental medicine approach to identify specific mechanisms of
      behavior change in populations for whom those mechanisms are most relevant and modifiable.

      Accumulating evidence suggests that the many patients who develop post-traumatic stress
      disorder (PTSD) symptoms following ACS view their medications as reminders of their cardiac
      event and their future CVD risk. Ironically, although it has rarely been studied outside of
      cancer survivors, this fear of recurrence (FoR) may undermine medication adherence in ACS
      patients. This project will use the Science of Behavior Change (SOBC) experimental medicine
      approach to investigate FoR as a putative mechanism of behavior change with respect to heart
      medication adherence among ACS patients with early PTSD symptoms at hospital discharge. The
      study will test a cognitive-affective intervention that has been shown to reduce FoR in
      cancer survivors, that is delivered electronically (electronic tablet) in the patient's home.
      The intervention has been adapted in this study for ACS to be tested using a double-blind
      randomized controlled design. One hundred suspected ACS patients will be enrolled who
      reported at least mild to moderate threat perceptions at the time of their initial visit to
      the emergency department. FoR and future time perspective will be assessed within six weeks
      of the initial visit to the emergency department, and then participants will be trained on
      the tablet intervention. Participants will complete the intervention over four weeks in eight
      half-hour sessions, twice each week. Medication adherence will be measured electronically
      using eCAP devices. FoR and future time perspective will be reassessed 1 month after the
      baseline session, and cognitive-affective change will be assessed electronically throughout
      the intervention period.

      In addition to investigating FoR as the primary mechanism of behavior change, the study also
      investigates a secondary potential mechanism that is a distinct, but related, construct:
      future time perspective. Furthermore, in addition to examining medication adherence as the
      primary health behavior of interest, the study also examines a secondary health behavior that
      is reduced in fearful cardiac patients: physical activity. Collectively, the three aims below
      address these two putative mechanisms (FoR, future time perspective) and these two health
      behaviors (medication adherence, physical activity) in the randomly assigned groups
      (intervention, control).

      Objectives

      Aim 1 (main purpose of the trial):

      The study will determine whether a tablet-based CBMT intervention influences the two putative
      mechanisms of FoR and future time perspective. Of primary importance within this first aim,
      it will test whether the intervention reduces cardiac-related FoR relative to control. The
      trial is statistically powered to test the first aim as it relates to FoR. Secondarily, it
      will also test whether the intervention increases an expansive future time perspective
      relative to control.

      Aim 2 (exploratory):

      The study will determine the extent to which the two potential mechanisms of behavior
      change—FoR and future time perspective—are each associated with health behaviors. Of primary
      importance within this second aim, it will test associations between these two potential
      mechanisms of behavior change and objectively measured and self-reported adherence to heart
      medications (antiplatelets to reduce risk of blood clotting, antihypertensive drugs to reduce
      blood pressure, or statins to lower cholesterol). Of secondary importance, it will test
      whether these two potential mechanisms of behavior change are associated with self-reported
      physical activity.

      Aim 3 (exploratory):

      The study will test whether the intervention improves the two health behaviors of interest.
      Of primary importance within this third aim, it will test whether the intervention relative
      to control is associated with higher heart medication adherence (objectively measured or
      self-reported) in the two months after the baseline visit and whether any such beneficial
      effects are mediated by reductions in the putative mechanisms of FoR or future time
      perspective. Secondarily, it will test whether the intervention relative to control is
      associated with greater increases in self-reported physical activity in the two months after
      the baseline visit and whether any such beneficial effects are mediated by reductions in the
      putative mechanisms of FoR or future time perspective.

    <measure>Change in Total Score for Concerns about Recurrence Scale [Adapted for Acute Coronary Syndrome]</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-Training/Time 1, Post-Training/Time 2 (approximately 4 weeks apart)</time_frame>
    <description>This 19-item self-report scale measures fear of recurrence of ACS events. It uses a 5-point Likert scale (0 to 4). It has three subscales: health worries (items 1-11; subscale range: 0-44), role worries (items 12-17: subscale range: 0-24), and death worries (items 18-19: subscale range: 0-8). The total score is computed as the sum of all items in the scale (total score range: 0 to 76). Higher total scores indicate greater fear of recurrence. The study will test whether there is a larger Time-1-to-Time-2 reduction in Concerns about Recurrence total scores for the intervention group relative to the control group. This is the sole primary outcome because the trial design was statistically powered to reduce FoR.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Total for self-reported extent of nonadherence to medication from the Extent of and Reasons for Nonadherence Scale [Adapted]</measure>
    <time_frame>Post-Training/Time 2 (approximately 4 weeks after Time 1)</time_frame>
    <description>The self-reported scale called the Extent of and Reasons for Nonadherence Scale [Adapted] measures how often participants do not take their prescribed medication and the reasons that they were nonadherent (e.g., forgot, out of routine, feeling down or upset). The measure of extent of nonadherence is the total of 3 items in the extent portion of the scale such that higher scores represent greater nonadherence (total score range: 3-15). The study will test whether there are lower self-reported extent of nonadherence scores for the intervention group relative to the control group at time 2. (Because not all participants are expected at time 1 to have been already taking the particular heart medication assessed in the study, the self-reported questions about medication adherence are only administered at time 2.)</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in total score for the International Physical Activity Questionnaire in MET minutes/week</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-Training/Time 1, Post-Training/Time 2 (approximately 4 weeks apart)</time_frame>
    <description>This 7-item self-report scale measures the extent to which participants engaged in physical activity at a variety of intensity levels during the last week. Higher scores represent greater total metabolic equivalent of task (MET) minutes of physical activity per week based on the following estimates: 3.3 MET units for walking, 4.4 MET units for moderate activity, 8 MET units for vigorous activity. The study will test whether there is a larger Time-1-to-Time-2 increase in total scores on the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (units: MET minutes/week) for the intervention group relative to the control group.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in cue presence score for the Context Sensitivity Index</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-Training/Time 1, Post-Training/Time 2 (approximately 4 weeks apart)</time_frame>
    <description>This self-report scale measures participants' ability to identify information about stressful situations that may be helpful for successfully and flexibly regulating unpleasant feelings of distress. In particular, the cue presence score reflects the sensitivity to the presence of meaningful contextual cues. This cue presence score is calculated as the sum of 10 relevant items from the scale. Greater cue presence scores indicate greater context sensitivity (cue presence score range: 10-77). The study will test whether there is a larger Time-1-to-Time-2 increase in cue presence scores on the Context Sensitivity Index for the intervention group relative to the control group.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in total score for Future Time Perspective Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-Training/Time 1, Post-Training/Time 2 (approximately 4 weeks apart)</time_frame>
    <description>This 10-item self-reported scale measures participants' perceptions of their own futures as either limited (lower scores) or expansive (higher scores). The total score is the sum of all 10 items after three of the items (8-10) have been reverse-coded (total score range: 10-77). The study will test whether there is a larger Time-1-to-Time-2 increase in Future Time Perspective total scores for the intervention group relative to the control group.</description>

    <measure>Proportion of adherent days to medication (aspirin, beta-blocker, or statin)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 months (starting after Pre-Training/Time 1 and extending for approximately 4 weeks after Post-Training/Time 2)</time_frame>
    <description>Participants' post-hospitalization medication adherence is measured objectively through electronically recorded pill bottle openings using the eCAP device (Information Mediary Corp., Ottawa, Canada). The measure is operationalized as the proportion of adherent days. The study will test whether there is a higher proportion of adherent days across the entire study monitoring period for the intervention group relative to the control group.</description>

    <description>Participants in this intervention group complete two tasks, each repeated 8 times over the course of 4 weeks (twice per week). The first task is Cognitive Bias Modification Training for Attention. It is designed to reinforce attention away from ACS threat-related stimuli (e.g., &quot;death,&quot; &quot;chest pain&quot;) and toward neutral stimuli (e.g., &quot;curve,&quot; barn doors&quot;). The second task is Cognitive Bias Modification Training for Interpretation. It is designed to train participants to appraise ambiguous information that is potentially related to ACS threat as benign.</description>

    <description>Participants in this placebo control group complete two tasks, each repeated 8 times over the course of 4 weeks (twice per week). The first task is the placebo version of Cognitive Bias Modification Training for Attention. It is designed NOT to train attention toward or away from threatening or neutral information. The second task is the placebo version of Cognitive Bias Modification Training for Interpretation. It is designed NOT to train the interpretation of information as either threatening or benign.</description>

    <description>In task 1, participants view a pair of threat-neutral words and then a single letter (E or F). Participants' task is to tap a button as quickly and accurately as possible to indicate whether they see E or F. The letter appears in the neutral location on 90.6% of trials, thereby reinforcing participants' attending away from threat. In task 2, participants view a word or phrase corresponding to a threatening (e.g., &quot;dying&quot;) or benign (e.g., &quot;sleep&quot;) interpretation of a sentence (e.g., &quot;You have been waking up tired recently&quot;). They are asked to tap a button to indicate whether the word or phrase was related to the sentence. Positive feedback (&quot;Correct&quot;) is given for rejected threat interpretations and for benign interpretations. Otherwise, negative feedback (&quot;Incorrect&quot;) is given.</description>

    <description>In task 1, participants view a pair of threat-neutral words and then a single letter (E or F). Participants' task is to tap a button as quickly and accurately as possible to indicate whether they see E or F. The target letter is equally likely to appear in the threat location as the neutral location. Thus, participants' patterns of attention are not trained toward or away from threat. In task 2, participants view a word or short phrase corresponding to either a threatening or benign interpretation of a sentence that follows it. They are asked to tap a button to indicate whether the word or phrase was related to the sentence. Positive feedback and negative feedback are equally likely to be given regardless of whether participants endorse the threatening or benign interpretations.</description>
