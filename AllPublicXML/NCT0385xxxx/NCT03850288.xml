  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Executive functions are part of the high-level cognitive processes essential to the proper
      functioning of human cognition. They consist mainly of flexibility, updating and inhibition.
      Some studies have shown a correlation between executive disorders (impaired executive
      function) and psychiatric disorders such as obsessive-compulsive disorder or phobias. These
      executive disorders are related to dysfunctions of the fronto-striatal loops.

      In addition, other studies have investigated the link that may exist between eating disorders
      such as anorexia or bulimia nervosa and executive functioning. Anorexia nervosa, bulimia
      nervosa and binge eating disorders are eating disorders characterized by a dysfunction in
      food intake with restriction of food or compulsions as well as strong concerns about the body
      schema. Concerning the executive functioning, these studies highlight a lack of cognitive
      flexibility for patients with anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa but also dysfunctions
      depending on the type of pathology (anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa). These studies also
      highlight the beneficial effects of cognitive remediation on people with eating disorders.

      However, the investigation of the inhibitory control has not yet been specifically studied.
      Moreover, since eating disorders are structurally different, a comparison between several
      pathologies would be interesting to consider.

      The aim of this study is to determine if a dysfunction of inhibitory control can be
      highlighted in people with eating disorders. This study would also allow further researches
      about cognitive remediation suitable for the specific difficulties encountered in these
      diseases.

    <description>Patients with a diagnosis of anorexia nervosa (According to the DSM-V criteria). These patients are characterized by a restriction of food intake leading to weight loss or a failure to gain weight resulting in a &quot;significantly low body weight&quot; of what would be expected for someone's age, sex and height. Moreover, there is a fear of becoming fat or of gaining weight.Then, these patients have a distorted view of themselves and of their condition.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Bulimia Nervosa</arm_group_label>
    <description>Patients with a diagnosis of bulimia nervosa. According to the DSM-V criteria, these patients are characterized by recurrent episodes of binge eating (eating, in a discrete period of time, an amount of food that is definitely larger than most people would eat during a similar period of time and under similar circumstances), a sense of lack of control over eating during the episode, recurrent inappropriate compensatory behaviour in order to prevent weight gain, such as self-induced vomiting, misuse of laxatives, diuretics, or other medications, fasting, or excessive exercise.
The binge eating and inappropriate compensatory behaviours both occur, on average, at least once a week for three months. Moreover, there is a self-evaluation influenced by body shape and weight.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Binge Eating Disorder</arm_group_label>
    <description>Patients with a diagnosis of Binge Eating Disorder. These patients are characterized by recurrent episodes of binge eating (eating, in a discrete period of time (e.g. within any 2-hour period), an amount of food that is definitely larger than most people would eat during a similar period of time and under similar circumstances), a sense of lack of control over eating during the episode. The binge eating episodes are associated with three or more of the following: eating much more rapidly than normal, eating until feeling uncomfortably full, eating large amounts of food when not feeling physically hungry, eating alone because of feeling embarrassed by how much one is eating, feeling disgusted with oneself, depressed or very guilty afterward,marked distress regarding binge eating is present. Moreover, binge eating occurs, on average, at least once a week for three months</description>

    <description>Stroop task is an interference task assessing cognitive inhibitory control. This &quot;paper-and-pencil&quot; task aims to evaluate the inhibition of an automated process such as reading by asking participants to name the color of color names written in a different color ink.
This test is non-invasive.</description>
