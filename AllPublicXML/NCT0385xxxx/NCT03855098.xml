  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Assessment of dietary intake is key for understanding the links between diet and health.
      Here, researchers will study molecules in urine samples to give them an insight into what
      people have eaten. These new molecules are called dietary biomarkers. This study will help to
      identify new molecules that can act as biomarkers of commonly consumed foods. These can then
      be used in the assessment of diet, identification of diet-related diseases and used how to
      explain how a dietary intervention (programme) will work, thereby adding to scientific
      knowledge.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For biomarker discovery a cross-over study where participants will visit the Human
      Intervention Centre (in UCD) on 3 occasions (3 study days) with a minimum one week between
      each visit. The order of consumption of the test foods will be randomized. The test foods are
      mixed vegetables (spinach and lettuce), green beans and mixed berried (strawberries and
      blueberries). For each study day, the participants will arrive fasting and provide a urine
      sample (0h sample). For 24h prior to the study day participants will avoid the test foods.
      Participants will consume the food and urine samples will be taken at 2, 4, 6 and 24 h post
      consumption . Standard portions of the test food will be eaten on each occasion. Between the
      visits, participants will consume their habitual diet.

      The samples will be analysed using the metabolomics platforms LC-MS and NMR spectroscopy.
      Both NMR and LC-MS data generated will undergo statistical analysis such as principal
      component analysis (PCA) and supervised analysis such as partial least squares-discriminant
      analysis (PLS-DA). Validation of such models will be performed using permutation testing.

    <intervention_model_description>Each participant is asked to eat a test food (mixed vegetables (spinach and lettuce), green beans and mixed berries (strawberries and blueberries). They are asked for urine samples for up to 6 hours after eating each food. They are also asked for a urine sample one day after eating the foods. The samples are then analysed for dietary biomarkers.</intervention_model_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Urinary biomarker changes following consumption of specific foods will be measured using metabolomic approaches in post consumption samples.</measure>
    <time_frame>2, 4 and 6 hours post consumption of the test food. Urine samples are taken postprandially to determine how the biomarkers behave post consumption, which is standard practice in dietary biomaker identification studies.</time_frame>
    <description>A number of biomarkers will be identified for the test foods. These biomarkers will be measured using LC/MS and NMR spectroscopy and will be reported in relative units. An untargeted approach will be applied to measure the biomarkers, of which hundreds will be measured. These biomarkers will be from different classes of compounds such as amino acids, fatty acids, lipids and carbohydrates for example.
Note: A list of biomarkers has not been added as the investigators are using an untargeted metabolomics approach, which will be used to identify biomarkers from different compound classes.</description>

    <description>Cross-over study where participants will visit the Human Intervention Centre (in UCD) on 3 occasions (3 study days) with a minimum one week between each visit. The order of consumption of the test foods will be randomized. The test foods are mixed vegetables (spinach and lettuce), green beans and mixed berried (strawberries and blueberries). The following definition of portion sizes will be used; green beans (120g), lettuce (20g), spinach (90g), strawberries (96g) and blueberries (75g).
For each study day, the participants will arrive fasting and provide a urine sample (0h sample). For 24h prior to the study day participants will avoid the test foods. Participants will consume the food and urine samples will be taken at 2, 4, 6 and 24 h post consumption.</description>
