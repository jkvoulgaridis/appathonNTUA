  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In last years it has been demonstrated that photobiomodulation therapy (PBMT) has ergogenic
      effects, improving muscular performance and accelerating post-exercise recovery. However,
      many aspects related to these effects and its' clinical applicability remain unknown.
      Therefore, the aim of this project is to evaluate the ergogenic effects of PBMT in detraining
      after a strength training protocol.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It will be carried out a randomized, triple-blind, placebo-controlled trial.

      Forty-eight volunteers will be randomly allocated to four experimental groups:

        1. PBMT before the strength training sessions and PBMT during the detraining period;

        2. PBMT before the strength training sessions and placebo during the detraining period;

        3. Placebo before the strength training sessions and PBMT during the detraining period;

        4. Placebo before the strength training sessions and placebo during the detraining period .

      The individuals randomly allocated to the different groups will be subjected to 12
      consecutive weeks of dynamic strength training involving leg-press and knee extension
      exercises in leg-press and leg-extension machines, respectively, 2 times a week.After the
      12-week training period, the volunteers will receive the application of PBMT or placebo
      depending on the group to which they are allocated for 4 weeks (2 times a week) without
      training.

      The data will be collected by a blind assessor. It will be analyzed the muscular strength and
      the structural properties of quadriceps before starting the study (baseline), at 4, 8, and 12
      weeks after starting the training period, and at 4 weeks after completing the training
      (detraining period), in both lower limbs.

      The findings will be tested for their normality using the Shapiro-Wilk test. Parametric data
      will be expressed as mean and standard deviation and non-parametric data as median and
      respective upper and lower limits. Parametric data will be analyzed by two-way repeated
      measures analysis of variance (ANOVA; time versus experimental group) with post-hoc
      Bonferroni correction. Non-parametric data will be analyzed using the Friedman test and,
      secondarily, the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Data will be analyzed in terms of both their
      absolute values and their relationship to the percentage change based on the values
      established in the baseline tests. The significance level will be set at p&lt;0.05.

Therefore, the researcher responsible for the treatment will be blinded to the type of treatment being administered to the volunteers.

    <description>PBMT will be applied bilaterally using the direct contact method with light pressure on the skin to 6 sites of the anterior thigh (2 medial, 2 lateral, and 2 central). A 12-diode cluster, with 4 905-nm laser diodes (12.5W peak power for each diode), 4 875-nm LED diodes (17.5 mW mean power for each diode), and 4 640-nm LED diodes (15 mW mean power for each diode), manufactured by Multi Radiance Medical® (Solon, OH, USA), will be used to apply the PBMT. The dose used for applications during the training and/or detraining periods will be 30 Joules (J) per site (180 J per thigh). PBMT will be applied before each workout and during the detraining period, depending on the group to which the volunteers are allocated.</description>
