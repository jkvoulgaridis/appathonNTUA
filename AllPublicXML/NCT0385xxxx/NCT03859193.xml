  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to find out if watching an educational video about
      nutrition helps participants learn about how different foods affect their blood sugar and how
      Gestational Diabetes affects pregnancy.

      -  Patients diagnosed with gestational diabetes receive standard nutritional counseling at
           their first high risk clinic visit. All patients agreeing to participate in the study
           will at this visit fill out a knowledge questionnaire prior to receiving counseling.

        -  Patients will be randomized into standard counseling or standard counseling plus
           educational video using sealed envelopes that have been randomized by a computer
           generator and labeled for example #1 - #100 based on order enrolled in study. The
           envelope will have a piece of paper with video or no video

        -  At the next High risk clinic visit one week later patients randomized to the educational
           video will watch the video on a clinic designated computer after being checked in by
           nursing. They will then fill out the same questionnaire. Patients that are randomized to
           no video will only refill out the questionnaire

        -  English-speaking patients will view the English version of the video, and
           Spanish-speaking patients will view the Spanish version of the video in either English
           or the dubbed Spanish version.

        -  A Spanish version of the patient hand-out will be provided in an amendment, prior to
           their use with Spanish- speaking patients.
