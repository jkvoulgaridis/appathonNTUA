      This study will evaluate the effectiveness of a computerized training program (called
      Personalized Computerized Inhibitory Training, or PCIT) coupled with cognitive behavioral
      therapies (CBT) consisting of Exposures and Response Prevention in treating obsessive
      compulsive disorder (OCD) in patients who previously underwent CBT, but still have residual
      symptoms.

    <description>Measured by Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (YBOCS), considered the gold standard assessment tool.
Y-BOCS comprises a Symptom Checklist and Severity Scale to consecutively rate obsessions and compulsions. The Checklist includes 54 common obsessions and compulsive behaviors, which are grouped according to thematic content. Symptoms that are endorsed over the past week are then globally rated by the clinician using a five-point scale ranging from 0 (none) to 4 (extreme) across five dimensions: (1) time/frequency, (2) interference, (3) distress, (4) resistance, and (5) degree of control. Obsessive and compulsive symptom severity are rated separately (scores range from 0 to 25) with these scores summed to create a total OCD severity score (range, 0-50).
Symptom severity scores: mild symptoms (0-13), moderate symptoms (14-25), moderate-severe symptoms (26-34), and severe symptoms (35-40).26</description>
