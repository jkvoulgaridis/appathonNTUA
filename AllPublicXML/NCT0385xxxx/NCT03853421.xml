      A Double-blind, Placebo-controlled study in Healthy Volunteers to Determine the Safety and
      Tolerability of Single, Ascending Subcutaneous Doses of Sevuparin

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, sequential cohort, single escalating
      dose study to explore the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of
      sevuparin in healthy volunteer adult male and female subjects. The study will consist of
      three subcutaneous dose cohorts (3, 6 and 9 mg/kg sevuparin). Each dosing cohort will consist
      of 8 subjects who will be randomized to receive either a single dose of sevuparin or matching
      placebo in a 3:1 ratio (6 active/2 placebo).
