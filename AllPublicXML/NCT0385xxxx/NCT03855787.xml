  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The rationale for this study is to determine if there is a difference in complications among
      patients undergoing ureteroscopy for renal stones who receive a stent compared to not
      receiving a stent postoperatively.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Kidney stones affect 9% individuals within the United States, and the prevalence is
      increasing. Over the last few decades, ureteroscopy has become the most commonly performed
      stone procedure. However the complication rate after ureteroscopy is not insignificant.
      Reducing morbidity after ureteroscopy would improve patient outcomes and reduce health care
      utilization.

      A major contributor to patient morbidity after ureteroscopy is the ureteral stent, which is
      placed at the time of surgery and left in place 1-2 weeks after surgery. The rationale for
      utilizing stents is to prevent urinary obstruction from edema or stone fragments. On the
      other hand, stents cause hematuria, pain, and lower urinary tract symptoms. Additionally,
      stent-related symptoms are often misdiagnosed as urinary tract infections leading to
      unnecessary antibiotic use.

      The clinical utility of ureteral stents after ureteroscopy has not been well studied,
      specifically a stone located in the kidney. Prior studies on stent-less ureteroscopic
      procedures have focused on treatment of ureteral stones and not stones located in the kidney,
      have had restrictive inclusion and exclusion criteria, are primarily from single center
      institutions, and most being performed ~15 years ago. Surgical techniques and device
      innovations have changed the procedure since that time. To date, there have been only 2
      studies that included stone located in the kidney showing no difference in unplanned hospital
      revisits, however both combined analyses with ureteral stones and selection bias was an issue
      for both studies. In addition, there is a lack of studies assessing opiate use, impact of
      quality of life with stent placement, and loss of work related to stent placement

    <description>This survey assesses self-reported consequences of pain on relevant aspects of one's life, including engagement with social, cognitive, emotional, physical, and recreational activities. There are 6 questions on the survey. The survey score uses at T-score metric with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10 in a referent population. A higher score denotes greater pain interference in one's life.</description>

    <description>This is a disease specific quality-of-life instrument designed to assess the impact on patients of stones in the urinary tract. The survey is a 28-item instrument with a 5-point LIkert scale for each item. There are a total of 140 points total, and a difference of 10 points can be considered clinically significant.</description>
