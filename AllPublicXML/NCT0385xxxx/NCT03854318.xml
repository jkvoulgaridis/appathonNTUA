  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inherited mutations in RUNX1 are responsible for familial platelet disorder with associated
      myeloid malignancies (FPDMM, or simply FPD), an autosomal dominant disease characterized by
      defective megakaryocytic development, low platelet counts, prolonged bleeding times, and a
      life-long risk of developing hematological malignancies. Disease penetrance and clinical
      presentations vary among families with different germline RUNX1 mutations, and even among
      affected individuals within a single family. Currently there are no biomarkers or assays to
      predict which patients will progress to malignancy, and some patients present with AML as
      their initial manifestation of the germline syndrome. We propose to characterize the etiology
      and natural history of patients with RUNX1 mutations, both known and yet-to-be discovered. In
      so doing, we will expand our knowledge about this disorder and provide access to patients of
      interest for research, teaching, and clinical experience. The knowledge gained through this
      study will lead to better understanding of the disease progression, both clinically and at a
      molecular level, which may result in the development of better diagnosis, monitoring, and
      innovative therapies.
