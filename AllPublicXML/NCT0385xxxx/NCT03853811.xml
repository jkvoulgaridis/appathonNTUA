  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the use of a novel customized Ankle Foot Orthosis (AFO), created
      using 3D scanning, with children being treated for clubfoot. The AFO is inserted in the
      standard Mitchell shoe during bracing, following Ponseti casting. The investigators
      hypothesize that following Ponseti casting, the implementation of customized AFOs with
      Ponseti bracing will improve patient compliance and functional outcomes as well as lead to
      fewer relapses in comparison to the standard bracing with Mitchell shoes.

    <time_frame>Collected when visit where cast is applied, visit when cast is removed, then at 2 weeks, 12 weeks, 24 weeks of bracing</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed using changes in Dimeglio Scores. The Dimeglio scoring system uses a 20-point system (20 being the most severe and &lt;5 as benign) by assessing four parameters. The severity of the deformity is then assigned a grade of I-IV with IV being the most severe. (A score of &lt;5 is given a grade of I, =5&lt;10 is grade II, =10&lt;15 is grade III, and =15&lt;20 is grade IV)</description>
