  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to evaluate the efficacy of Bulevirtide administered subcutaneously for 48
      weeks at a dose of 2 mg or 10 mg once daily for treatment of chronic hepatitis delta in
      comparison to delayed treatment.

      This study is designed to assess the long-term efficacy and safety of Bulevirtide in patients
      with chronic hepatitis Delta (CHD). Primary efficacy and safety data will be assessed at week
      48, when Bulevirtide at 2 and 10 mg daily doses will be compared with delayed treatment.
      After week 48 patients of delayed treatment arm in this study will be switched to Bulevirtide
      at 10 mg daily dose for additional 96 weeks. The total duration of treatment period in this
      phase 3 study will be 144 weeks.

      The period of 48 weeks of no-treatment in this phase 3 study is justified by the absence of
      any approved therapy or an effective treatment regime for the respective indication;
      furthermore, patients of the delayed treatment arm shall receive a 96 weeks treatment of the
      10 mg Bulevirtide after the assessment of the primary endpoint.

      After the analysis of the primary endpoint, the treatment will be continued for the period of
      up to 3 years to investigate the optimal therapy duration. During the treatment free follow
      up period, the possibility of the sustained virologic response shall be assessed. Whereas the
      study is not powered to investigate the difference in clinical outcomes such as death,
      cirrhosis decompensation or liver transplantation, those endpoints will be captured, and the
      information will be used in the overall concept of the clinical confirmation.
