  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to conduct the initial clinical investigation of the Foldax
      Polymer Aortic Valve to collect evidence on the device's safety and performance. The study is
      anticipated to confirm successful clinical safety and clinical effectiveness with significant
      improvements in clinical hemodynamic performance.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Foldax Polymer Aortic Valve is indicated as a replacement for a diseased, damaged, or
      malfunctioning native aortic heart valve via open heart surgery. This is a first in human
      study conducted under US FDA's Early Feasibility Investigational Device Exemption and will
      enroll up to 15 patients. These patients will be followed up to 5 years after implantation.
