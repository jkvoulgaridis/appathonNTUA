      This is a multi-site study to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics of repeated doses of
      IV SHR0410 in participants who are undergoing hemodialysis. Twenty-four eligible participants
      will be enrolled into 3 dose cohorts. SHR0410 will be administered after dialysis session.
      Safety assessments, PK assessments and efficacy evaluations will be performed.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Able to understand the study procedures, the risks involved and obtain written
             informed consent before any study related activity.

          -  Male or female between the ages of 18 and 75 years, inclusive.

          -  Male subjects with a partner of childbearing potential must be willing to use a condom
             when sexually active, throughout the study period and for 28 days following last study
             drug dosing. Female subjects must be post-menopausal for at least 1 year, permanently
             sterilized (e.g., tubal occlusion, hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy) or, if of
             childbearing potential, must be willing to use a highly effective method of
             contraception throughout the study period and for 28 days following last study drug
             dosing.

          -  Negative drug screen (including alcohol, amphetamines, cocaine, marijuana, opiates,
             phencyclidine, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, methadone, methamphetamines, tramadol,
             and tricyclic antidepressants) at screening and on admission to study site.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Anticipated to receive a kidney transplant during the study.

          -  Known history of allergic reaction to opiates such as hives (Note: side effects
             related to the use of opioids such as constipation or nausea would not exclude the
             participants from the study).

          -  Within 12 months prior to screening, known or suspected history of drug abuse or
             dependence according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth
             Edition (DSM-5).
