      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of tazemetostat and how well it
      works when given together with pembrolizumab in treating patients with urothelial carcinoma
      that has spread to nearby tissue or lymph nodes or other places in the body (locally
      advanced/metastatic). Tazemetostat may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the
      enzymes needed for cell growth. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as
      pembrolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with
      the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving tazemetostat and pembrolizumab may work
      better in treating patients with urothelial carcinoma compared to pembrolizumab without
      tazemetostat.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To conduct a safety lead-in phase that identifies the safe recommended phase II dose for
      combination tazemetostat and MK-3475 (pembrolizumab).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the safety and tolerability of MK-3475 (pembrolizumab) in combination with
      tazemetostat.

      II. To evaluate the objective disease response rate of combination tazemetostat and MK-3475
      (pembrolizumab) in patients with advanced urothelial carcinoma that is cisplatin resistant
      (Arm A) or cisplatin ineligible (Arm B).

      III. To evaluate the progression free survival to combination tazemetostat and MK-3475
      (pembrolizumab) inhibitor in patients with advanced urothelial carcinoma that is cisplatin
      resistant (Arm A) or cisplatin ineligible (Arm B).

      IV. To evaluate immune-related response using tumor response by immune-related Response
      Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (irRECIST) in combination tazemetostat and MK-3475
      (pembrolizumab) inhibitor in patients with advanced urothelial carcinoma that is cisplatin
      resistant (Arm A) or cisplatin ineligible (Arm B) based on irRECIST criteria.

      CORRELATIVE OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine if EZH2 and H3K27me3 chromatin methylation determines disease response to
      EZH2 and PD1 inhibition in metastatic urothelial carcinoma by analyzing baseline tissue
      samples.

      II. To determine if mutations in genes associated with histone methylation determine disease
      response to EZH2 and PD1 inhibition in metastatic urothelial carcinoma by analyzing baseline
      tissue samples.

      III. To identify the immune response (T cell phenotypes), T-cell clonality with comparison to
      T-cell infiltrating lymphocytes and neoantigen profile of responsive and resistant urothelial
      carcinoma treated with combination anti-PD1 and EZH2i by analyzing blood and tissue samples
      throughout the study.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive tazemetostat orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-21 and pembrolizumab
      intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Cycles repeat every 21 days for up to 2 years in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 1 year.

                  pregnancy test within 72 hours prior to receiving the first dose of study
                  medication. If the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a
                  serum pregnancy test will be required

               -  Female patients of childbearing potential must be willing to use an adequate
                  method of contraception for the course of the study through 120 days after the
                  last dose of study medication. Note: abstinence is acceptable if this is the
                  usual lifestyle and preferred contraception for the patient

               -  Male patients of childbearing potential must agree to use an adequate method of
                  contraception starting with the first dose of study therapy through 120 days
                  after the last dose of study therapy. Note: abstinence is acceptable if this is

                  with other agents, and what to do if new medications need to be prescribed or if
                  the patient is considering a new over-the-counter medicine or herbal product

          -  Patients who are unable to take oral medication OR have malabsorption syndrome or any
             other uncontrolled gastrointestinal condition (e.g., nausea, diarrhea, vomiting) that
             might impair the bioavailability of tazemetostat are not eligible

          -  Patients with uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing
             or active infection, interstitial lung disease or active, non-infectious pneumonitis,
             symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia,
             uncontrolled arterial hypertension, stroke within 6 months prior to starting study
             treatment, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements are not eligible

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because MK-3475 and tazemetostat are
             agents with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is
             an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to
             treatment of the mother with MK-3475 and tazemetostat, breastfeeding should be
             discontinued if the mother is treated with MK-3475 or tazemetostat

               -  MK-3475 may have adverse effects on a fetus in utero. Furthermore, it is not
                  known if MK-3475 has transient adverse effects on the composition of sperm.
                  Patients are excluded from this study if pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting
                  to conceive or father children within the projected duration of the trial,
                  starting with the screening visit through 120 days after the last dose of trial
                  treatment

          -  Patients who are human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive may participate IF they
             meet the following eligibility requirements:

               -  They must be stable on their anti-retroviral regimen, and they must be healthy
                  from an HIV perspective

               -  They must have a CD4 count of greater than 250 cells/mcL

               -  They must not be receiving prophylactic therapy for an opportunistic infection

          -  Patients with a known history of hepatitis B (defined as hepatitis B surface antigen
             [HBsAg] reactive) or known hepatitis C virus (defined as HCV ribonucleic acid [RNA]
             [qualitative] is detected) infection are not eligible

               -  Note: no testing for hepatitis B and hepatitis C is required unless mandated by
                  local health authority

          -  Patients who have received a live vaccine within 30 days of planned treatment start
             are not eligible

               -  Note: seasonal flu vaccines that do not contain live virus are permitted

          -  PD-L1 ELIGIBILITY (ARM B ONLY):

          -  Patients in Arm B must have positive PD-L1 status as confirmed by central analysis
             prior to second step registration and treatment initiation

               -  NOTE: positive PD-L1 expression is defined as a combined positive score (CPS) &gt;=
                  10 and will be confirmed in a report from HistoGeneX.

        Alternatively, patients who previously have had PD-L1 testing performed as standard of care
        via the FDA-approved Dako PD-L1 IHC 22C3 PharmDx Assay companion diagnostic test and who
        have a combined positive score (CPS) of &gt;= 10 may be eligible. In these cases, PD-L1
        testing does not need to be repeated, and tissue does not need to be sent for central
        analysis
