  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Transgender women (TW) have unique challenges related to HIV prevention medication adherence.
      Left unaddressed, these challenges will prevent TW from accessing the promising long-acting
      HIV prevention tools in the development pipeline. This study will develop a replicable
      process to tailor the delivery of these tools and an adherence intervention (that will
      include an mHealth app) to the needs of TW, using the example of inert injectable
      cabotegravir. Work builds on a pilot study to identify tailored methods to deliver injectable
      cabotegravir in TW, such as self-injection and injection by a healthcare provider at at
      &quot;drop-in&quot; clinic. The investigators will use qualitative methods (e.g., interviews, group
      discussions called &quot;Design Sessions&quot;) to design the adherence intervention and the mHealth
      app. Then, investigators will execute a partially randomized patient-preference trial to
      determine if TW are able to use tailored injection strategies (self-injection or injection by
      a healthcare provider at &quot;drop-in clinics&quot;) to improve adherence, compared to a control group
      of TW who will engage a protocol based on HPTN-083/084. This will serve as a &quot;proof of
      concept&quot; for the future R01 that will test this on a larger scale. Research and training will
      take place at NYSPI/Columbia, in affiliation with, 1) Project AFFIRM, a study of transgender
      identity (R01HD079603; PI: Bockting), that will provide infrastructure for critical research
      activities (e.g., recruitment), and 2) SLAP-HIV, a clinical trial to produce a long-acting
      form of cabotegravir (e.g., injection; UM1 AI120184; PI: Hope). SLAP-HIV will provide
      clinical oversight (e.g., ensure tailored delivery strategies are feasible).

    <description>Participants will be trained on how to self-inject (intramuscular, gluteal muscle) an inert version of injectable cabotegravir. The inert substance is intended to mimic injectable cabotegravir as closely as possible (e.g., injection equipment, location of injection, volume of injection is identical to injectable cabotegravir). Specifically, participants will self-inject their choice of 300mg vitamin B12 or saline (3ml fluid) every 2 months for a total of 6 months (for a total of 4 injections). Participants will complete interviews and brief surveys on their experience. Additionally, they will be given access to an mHealth app to improve adherence, which will contain informational content such as instructions on how to self-inject, FAQs about self-injection, study contact information, etc..</description>

    <description>Participants will report to a &quot;drop-in&quot; clinic, where a healthcare provider will inject them with an inert version of injectable cabotegravir. &quot;Visits will take &lt;10 minutes, and participants will be able to come whenever they want (when their injection is due) during clinic &quot;drop-in&quot; hours, which will be staggered in 2-hour windows during each week day. The inert substance that will be injected is intended to mimic injectable cabotegravir as closely as possible (described above). Participants will complete interviews and brief surveys on their experience. Additionally, they will be given access to an mHealth app to improve adherence, which will contain informational content such as &quot;drop-in&quot; clinic hours, directions to the &quot;drop-in&quot; clinic site, study contact information, etc...</description>
