  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute adenoviral conjunctivitis is a highly contagious, widespread endemic disease associated
      with frequent outbreaks, significant patient discomfort, lost productivity, and in some cases
      permanent visual compromise from long-term immune mediated sequelae. OKG-0301 is a novel
      ophthalmic solution with a potent ribonuclease that has broad-spectrum antiviral properties
      relevant for the treatment of acute adenoviral conjunctivitis. This randomized, double
      masked, multi-center Phase 2 study is being conducted entirely within Australia and is
      designed to support the safety and efficacy of OKG-0301 for the treatment of acute adenoviral
      conjunctivitis. The study intends to show superiority of OKG-0301 Ophthalmic Solution
      compared to vehicle for the primary efficacy endpoint of mean change from baseline in viral
      titre in patients with acute adenoviral conjunctivitis. Secondary efficacy endpoints
      including adenoviral eradication, clinical cure of acute adenoviral conjunctivitis,
      subepithelial infiltrates, other clinical signs and symptoms, and rate of cross-over
      infection to the other eye will also be assessed. Safety will also be evaluated.
