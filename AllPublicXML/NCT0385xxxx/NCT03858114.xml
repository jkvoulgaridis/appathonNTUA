  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: 36% of the Italian population will have more than 65 years in 2050. The European
      Union has indicated among its priorities to increase research on active aging. Physical
      activity contrasts disability linked to chronic diseases, has positive effects on the quality
      of life and on biological rhythms, prevents the decline of motor functions, improves the
      immune response, and prevents / positively affects metabolic disorders. It also provides
      valuable support in coping with cognitive decline and memory, and acts on depressive
      symptomatology.

      The literature on active aging is based, to date, on studies with small samples, rarely
      conducted with a randomized controlled method, whose outcomes often appear contradictory.

      The multidisciplinary project the investigators propose is an opportunity to address the
      issues mentioned above and to acquire further knowledge in the field of active aging.

      Objectives: the main objective of the study is to evaluate the effects of mild-to-moderate
      physical activity in a sample of over-65 years-old persons, on Quality of Life, and on
      biomechanical parameters (static-dynamic balance, mobility). The secondary objectives are
      aimed at assessing whether a protocol of mild-to-moderate physical activity can improve:

        -  Metabolic functions

        -  Cognitive performance

        -  Perception of pain

        -  Social rhythms and psychological wellbeing

        -  Inflammatory state Design: randomized controlled trial (RCT), single-blinded, with
           follow-up.

      Sample: participants will be ≥ 65 years old, of both genders, sedentary, enrolled in two arms
      through a random assignment (treatment/control) with ratio of 1:1, as following:

        -  about 60 subjects who will carry out a light-to-moderate physical activity intervention
           (experimental group);

        -  about 60 subjects in the control group, who will participate in group cultural
           activities (active comparison group).

      Assessment: the assessment will include socio-demographic variables; variables of
      psychophysical wellbeing; cognitive variables; variables related to physical health;
      biomechanical variables; assessment of skin integrity; lab tests on blood samples.

      Times of evaluations: both groups will be subjected to the measurements of the present study
      according to the following schedule:

        -  T0 (baseline): before the start of the intervention

        -  T1: 12 weeks after T0 (at the end of the intervention)

        -  T2: after 20 weeks from T0 (follow up 1)

        -  T3: 48 weeks after T0 (follow-up 2).

    <description>According to ACSM guidelines, mild-to-moderate Physical Activity (PA) will be established as ≤ 60% of the Heart Rate Reserve (HRR). Baseline HR will be registered for all participants for three days, and the mean data will be utilized. PA intervention will consist of three phases:
warm up (10 minutes), up to 40% of HRR, with slow, dynamic movements and stretching for principal muscular groups;
Active phase (45 minutes), from &gt;40% to 60% HRR, with static and dynamic exercises for postural control and spine mobility, and balance exercises, with activation of core muscles;
cool down (10 minutes), &lt; 40% of HRR, with cardiorespiratory cool-down exercises followed by relaxation, and post-stretch exercises to return muscles to a pre-exercises length.</description>
