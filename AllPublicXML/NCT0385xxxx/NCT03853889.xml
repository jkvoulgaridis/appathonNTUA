  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Depending on the physiology of pregnancy, the risk of increased aspiration, difficult airway,
      increased oxygen consumption and reduced functional residual capacity, breathing problems
      make general anesthesia application risky. In obstetric operations, neuraxial anesthesia is
      preferred because of both maternal and maternal mortality and morbidity. Epidural area has
      decreased due to pregnancy physiology. Previous studies have shown that the blood given to
      the epidural area increases the intracranial pressure by compressing the dura mater.Optic
      nerve diameter measurements ultrasound guided is a non-invasive and reliable method for
      detecting intracranial pressure increase.

      In this study, aimed to compare the optic nerve sheath diameter before and after epidural
      anesthesia with USG.

      Epidural anesthesia will be performed at L2 level and sitting position in all patients.
      Patients will be measured and recorded for optic nerve sheath diameter at 15 min (T2), 30 min
      (T3) and 60 min (T4) immediately after epidural anesthesia (T0) and after epidural
      anesthesia.. Measurement of the optic nerve sheath diameter will be done with the help of a
      linear probe without applying high pressure to the eyeball while the patient is in supine
      position and the eyelids are closed. The optic nerve sheath diameter will be measured 3 mm
      beyond the optical disc. The measurements shall be applied in both transverse and sagittal
      planes for both eyes and the arithmetic mean of the four measured values.
