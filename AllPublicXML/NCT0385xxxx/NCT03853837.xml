      Define and determine the prevalence of pulmonary vascular disease and diastolic dysfunction
      as assessed by the gold standard of invasive hemodynamic cardiopulmonary exercise testing.
      Subjects with Fontan palliation will undergo cardiac catheterization during exercise. The
      investigators hypothesize that invasive hemodynamic assessment during supine exercise will
      enable identification of early stage pulmonary vascular disease and diastolic dysfunction
      that is not apparent from invasive studies performed at rest.

      Determine the role of rest-exercise echocardiography for the assessment hemodynamics in
      Fontan physiology. Transthoracic echocardiography will be performed at rest and during
      exercise simultaneously with catheterization in the subjects participating in Aim #1 to
      determine correlations between invasive and noninvasive hemodynamics and identify noninvasive
      alternatives to assess functional reserve.

      Evaluate the clinical impact of pulmonary vascular disease and ventricular diastolic
      dysfunction. Multi-organ function and patient reported outcomes will be evaluated at
      baseline, 12 months (optional), and 24 months (optional) in subjects participating in Aims #1
      and #2. The investigators hypothesize that subjects with poorer ventricular-vascular reserve
      will display more clinical and end-organ deterioration in longitudinal follow up.
