  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Radiotherapy is a standard definitive treatment for men with localized prostate cancer.

      Recent improvements in technology allow high doses of radiation to be delivered to the
      prostate in less days with lower doses to surrounding healthy tissues, trying to reduce side
      effects.

      This study is being proposed to evaluate the use of moderate hypofractionated volum√®tric
      radiotherapy in localized prostate cancer patients and assessing treatment -related later
      adverse events using the CTCAE 4.0

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recent evidence suggests that the same or better outcomes might be achieved in prostate
      cancer by ussing a higher dose of radiation per fraction ( 3Gy) with the consequent decrease
      in total days Quality of life outcomes as well as gastrointestinal and genitourinary late
      toxicities will be analyzed.

      It is thought that this regimen will produce comparable findings and would result in
      substantial health care cost savings, as well as, be more convenient for patients.
