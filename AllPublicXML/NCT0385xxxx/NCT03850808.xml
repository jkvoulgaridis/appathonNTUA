  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Several studies have confirmed the link between chronic RV apical pacing and the development
      of heart failure and LV systolic dysfunction in some patients 1,2. However, questions
      continue to remain unanswered in regard to the adverse effects of RV pacing such as the exact
      amount of RV pacing that is detrimental to cardiac function and which subsets of patients are
      most at risk for developing cardiac dysfunction from chronic RV pacing. Rates of permanent
      pacemaker implantation have been increased over the last twenty years with expanding
      indications to include permanent pacing after AV node ablation for the treatment of drug
      refractory atrial fibrillation and other atrial tachy-arrhythmias. The current standard of
      practice is to minimize RV pacing however in patients that have had an AV node ablation right
      ventricular pacing cannot be avoided therefore it is important to identify if this particular
      group of patients is at an increased risk for developing worsening cardiac function. The
      purpose of this study is to compare cardiac function over time between patients that have
      undergone AV node ablation versus patients that have had pacemaker implantation for AV node
      dysfunction.

      Study Design This is a retrospective chart review of patients that have undergone permanent
      pacemaker implantation by the electrophysiology group at Oregon Health and Sciences
      University Hospital during the period between 01/2003 and 01/2013 for chronic RV pacing after
      AV node ablation or for AV node dysfunction.

      Goal The goal of this study is to determine if patients requiring RV pacing after AV nodal
      ablation are at increased risk for developing worsening cardiac function secondary to chronic
      RV pacing compared to patients requiring RV pacing for AV node dysfunction.

      Specific Objectives

        -  To determine the number of patients that have a permanent pacemaker implanted after AV
           node ablation and for AV node dysfunction within the last 10 years at OHSU Hospital.

        -  To determine the number of patients that have a biventricular pacemaker implanted with
           or without an implantable cardiac defibrillator within the last 10 years at OHSU
           Hospital (control group).

        -  Amongst those patients identified determine (1) left ventricular ejection fraction prior
           to permanent pacemaker or biventricular pacemaker implantation and over time (2) left
           ventricular volume and/or diameter prior to permanent pacemaker placement and over time
           (3) all cause mortality

        -  Amongst those patients identified determine incidence of new onset atrial fibrillation
           after permanent pacemaker or biventricular pacemaker implantation

        -  Amongst those patients identified determine incidence of inpatient admission of heart
           failure exacerbation defined as presenting symptoms of dyspnea, orthopnea, paroxysmal
           nocturnal dyspnea, increased lower extremity edema requiring IV diuretics

      Methods

      This is a retrospective chart review of patients that have undergone permanent pacemaker
      medical record system used at OHSU Hospital) with the help of an EPIC representative. If the
      patient was referred for permanent pacemaker or biventricular pacemaker implantation from a
      physician or medical group outside of OHSU records will be requested from that physician or
      medical group.
