    <textblock>
      Individuals with chronic pelvic pain will be identified, consented and enrolled in this study
      in which acupuncture will be offered in addition to current standards of care. The primary
      outcome will assess if there is a reduction of pain intensity from the baseline to 6 months
      as a result of treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic pelvic pain as defined by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists is
      &quot;noncyclic pain of 6 or more months duration that localizes to the anatomic pelvis, anterior
      abdominal wall at or below the umbilicus, the lumbosacral back or the buttocks and is of
      sufficient severity to cause functional disability or lead to medical care&quot;. This has
      devastating consequences both monetarily as well as emotionally and can lead to opioid
      addiction, depression and even suicide.

      Acupuncture has been used to treat pain in China for millenniums and was one of the more
      effective ways to treat pain before morphine was discovered. Acupuncture is feasible,
      economic and a safe way to treat chronic pain.

      Patients with chronic pelvic pain will be identified and offered participation in the study.
      After the consent process is completed, patients will undergo a brief physical exam to rule
      out acute symptoms. The patient will be asked to complete a baseline pain inventory and
      genitourinary pain index survey before proceeding with acupuncture treatment. Qualified
      patients will be requested to accept acupuncture treatments twice weekly for 12 consecutive
      weeks. Each week the patient will be asked to report their current medications and changes in
      the dosage as well as their narcotic (opioid) doses and any changes in the dosages. Patients
      will be followed up monthly for up to 3 months after treatment completion by phone to record
      their pain inventory as well as their genitourinary pain index survey.

    <description>Subjects will report baseline pain scores using the Genitourinary Pain Index (GUPI). The index is used to quantify the severity of pelvic pain experienced by the patient. It is a self-reporting condition specific questionnaire (gender specific) that is scored based on information provided by the patient. The scale is 0 to 5 with 0 indicating never experienced and 5 indicating being always present. The same index will be used at the end of treatment to determine the post-treatment scores and compared to baseline scores.</description>

    <description>Subjects will report initial baseline pain scores using the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI). The BPI assesses the severity of pain experienced by the patient and calculates pain's impact on daily functioning. It is self-reported and uses a numerical scale where 0 indicates no pain and 10 indicating pain as bad as the patient can image. The patient will report again using the BPI at the end of treatment and the values obtained will be compared to the baseline scores.</description>
