      Given the difficulty visualizing lymph node involvement with pre-operative imaging alone, and
      the potential to miss metastatic nodal involvement on template PLND, radioguided surgery has
      been proposed as a technique to improve intra-operative detection and clearance.
      99mTechnetium (99mTc) is a frequently used radioisotope in nuclear medicine, with favourable
      radiation properties and commercial availability[11]. It has a 6-hour half-life, and is
      suited to allow target tissue accumulation, while minimizing patients and investigator
      radiation exposure. Novel molecule-targeted radiopharmaceuticals using 99mTC and other
      radioisotopes in the setting of PC have increasing potential for diagnostic imaging,
      monitoring of therapeutic interventions and directed surgery[11, 12]. In relation to
      radioguided surgery, 99mTC -based PSMA-radioguided surgery (99mTc-PSMA-RGS) was deployed in a
      feasibility study. Using a specifically designed 99mTc based tracer,
      99mTc-mas3-y-nal-k(Sub-KuE), or in short Tc-99m-PSMA I&amp;S, combined with a gamma probe,
      guidance of the surgical resection of recurrent PC lymph node metastases was undertaken in
      132 patients, yielding a sensitivity of 84% and specificity of 100% and detecting metastases
      as small as 3mm[15, 16]. This raises the question as to whether a combination of PSMA PET/CT
      imaging and PSMA-radioguided surgery may increase the cure rate in patients undergoing
      operative management of PC, by increasing detection sensitivity and specificity of nodal
      metastases.
