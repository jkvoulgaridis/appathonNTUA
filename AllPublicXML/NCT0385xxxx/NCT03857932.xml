      The investigatorsconduct the precise sentinel lymph node biopsy using preoperative computed
      tomographic lymphography in breast cancer. The investigators aimed to summarize the law of
      lymphatic drainage of breast, and to conduct the accurate surgical treatment of breast
      cancer.

      AIM:Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is the standard technique for patients with early stage
      breast cancer. The investigators conduct the precise sentinel lymph node biopsy using
      preoperative computed tomographic lymphography in breast cancer. And The investigators
      identify the true sentinel lymph nodes(SLNs) followed by lymphatic ducts during operation.
      The investigators aimed to identify the non-sentinel lymph node, and to investigate the
      relationship between upper extremity lymphatic drainage. The SLNB procedure could avoid
      unnecessary lymph node resection and reduce treatment-related sequela.

      Arm1：

        1. Participants received preoperative computed tomographic lymphography

        2. Participants received sentinel lymph node biopsy（SLNB）

        3. Participants received stained non-sentinel lymph node resection during SLNB

        4. Participants received axillary reverse mapping dissection Arm2： Participants receive
           sentinel lymph node biopsy
