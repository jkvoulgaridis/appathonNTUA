  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study's primary objective is to perform a randomized controlled pilot study to assess
      the feasibility of using EEG-based neurofeedback to reduce the severity of
      treatment-resistant auditory verbal hallucinations ('hearing voices') in patients diagnosed
      with schizophrenia. Patients will be randomized to receive either EEG-based neurofeedback or
      treatment-as-usual.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Auditory verbal hallucinations (AVH) are experienced by up to 80% of patients diagnosed with
      schizophrenia, where they can cause significant occupational and social impairment. Current
      treatments are incompletely effective. Around 25-30% of AVH are refractory to antipsychotic
      drugs, and cognitive behavioural therapy only shows a small-medium effect size. Initially
      promising studies of neurostimulation have shown smaller effect sizes as better controlled
      trials have been conducted. There is hence the need for innovative new treatments. One
      potential option is neurofeedback training. The primary objective of study is to perform a
      randomized, controlled, rater-blinded pilot trial (n=40) of EEG neurofeedback for AVH in
      patients with treatment-resistant schizophrenia, to assess trial process, which will then
      inform a future definitive trial. The secondary objective is to calculate a 95% confidence
      interval that will allow interpretation of statistical difference between neurofeedback and
      treatment-as-usual groups to assess neurofeedback for reducing auditory verbal
      hallucinations. Participants will be randomly allocated to either a neurofeedback (plus
      treatment-as-usual) or treatment-as-usual alone condition. Neurofeedback will employ Z-score
      based LORETA (Low Resolution Brain Electromagnetic Tomography). After a baseline assessment,
      twenty sessions of personalized neurofeedback training will be delivered over a period of
      approximately four months. This is the first registered trial of EEG neurofeedback for
      hallucinations. The primary focus of the pilot trial is on feasibility. However, a 95%
      confidence interval will be determined for the difference on PSYRATS-AH and AHRS scores
      between neurofeedback and treatment-as-usual to help inform a future definitive trial.

    <measure>Auditory Hallucination Subscale of the Psychotic Symptom Ratings Scale (PSYRATS-AH)</measure>
    <time_frame>End of intervention (~4 months)</time_frame>
    <description>The Auditory Hallucination Subscale of the Psychotic Symptom Ratings Scale (PSYRATS-AH; Haddock et al., 1999) is an 11-item measure of the severity of auditory verbal hallucinations. Total scores can range from 0 to 44 with higher scores indicating greater severity of auditory verbal hallucinations. The PSYRATS-AH has been found to have a four-factor structure (Woodward et al., 2014). These are Emotion (range 0-20), Physical (range 0-12), Cognitive (range 0-8) and Loudness (range 0-4). Higher scores on each of these subscales represents more severe auditory verbal hallucinations. We will assess between group differences in both the total and four factor scores of the PSYRATS-AH at end of therapy.</description>

    <measure>Auditory Hallucinations Rating Scale (AHRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>End of intervention (~4 months)</time_frame>
    <description>The Auditory Hallucinations Rating Scale (AHRS; Hoffman et al., 2003) is a seven-item structured clinical interview, which assesses the severity of auditory verbal hallucinations in the past week. Its items assess frequency, reality, loudness, number, length, attentional salience (how demanding of attention the voice is) and distress level. Items are rated on unique scales. Total scores on this measure can range from 0 - 41 . Higher scores represent more severe auditory verbal hallucinations.</description>

    <measure>Delusions Subscale of the Psychotic Symptom Ratings (PSYRATS-D).</measure>
    <time_frame>End of intervention (~4 months)</time_frame>
    <description>Delusions will be assessed by the Delusions Subscale of the Psychotic Symptom Ratings Scale (PSYRATS-D; Haddock et al., 1999). This is a 6-item structured clinical interview. Total scores can range from 0-24, with higher scores representing more severe delusions. It has been found to have two factors (Woodward et al., 2014), namely Distress (distress amount, distress intensity) and Frequency (preoccupation amount, preoccupation duration, conviction, disruption). Total scores on these factors can range from 0-8 and 0-16 respectively, with higher scores representing more severe delusions. Both total PSYRATS-D and factor scores will be employed.</description>

    <measure>Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale</measure>
    <time_frame>End of intervention (~4 months)</time_frame>
    <description>The Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale (HADS; Zigmund &amp; Snaith, 1983) is a 16-item self-report measure of both anxiety and depression. Eight items assess depression and eight items assess anxiety. Depression scores can range from 0-24 with higher scores representing higher levels of depression. Anxiety scores can range from 0-24 with higher scores representing higher levels of anxiety.</description>

    <description>Quality of life will be assessed by the short-form of the self-report Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire (QLESQ; Endicott et al., 1993). Total scores on 16-item measure can range from 14 to 70, with higher scores representing greater quality of life.</description>

    <description>In the first session, Low Resolution Brain Electromagnetic Tomography (LORETA) will be used in combination with Z-scores to identify participants' resting state EEG differences relative to a database of norms of their demographic. EEG abnormalities which are consistent with the research literature on neural changes associated with AVH will then be targeted for normalization using neurofeedback training using LORETA in combination with Z-scores.</description>
