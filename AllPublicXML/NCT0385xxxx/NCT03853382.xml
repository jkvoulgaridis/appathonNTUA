  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) is when somebody engages in self-harm, such as cutting,
      without meaning to end his or her life. A large number of people engage in NSSI for lots of
      reasons, for example to cope with emotions. However, currently there are large waiting lists
      to access psychological therapy through the NHS. Therefore, it is important to research brief
      therapies so that individuals who engage in NSSI can receive treatment quicker. One
      potentially helpful therapy suggested is Cognitive Analytic Therapy (CAT), which focuses on
      patterns in relationships. NSSI can be understood as a way in which people relate to
      themselves, which suggests that CAT would fit well in terms of understanding and working with
      these difficulties.

      This study aims to evaluate a brief two-session CAT therapy for people who engage in NSSI.
      The project aims to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of the therapy, using
      interviews and questionnaires. This means looking at whether participants stick with the
      therapy, and how they find taking part in the therapy.

      All participants will meet with a researcher for an initial session to complete baseline
      questionnaires about their current difficulties, thoughts and feelings. Participants will
      then be randomly allocated to a condition: either the therapy condition or the
      treatment-as-usual (TAU) condition. Participants in the therapy condition will receive two
      therapy sessions, whilst participants in the TAU condition will not receive any therapy
      sessions. All participants will attend a final session to complete more questionnaires.
      Participants will be asked to complete online surveys weekly. Some participants will be
      invited to take part in interviews about their experience of the therapy. All participants
      will receive a shopping voucher as compensation for their time. Using the data collected from
      this study, future work can be done to provide better treatment for people who engage in
      NSSI.

    <time_frame>Five weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Safety will be assessed via an Adverse Effects in Psychotherapy (AEP) self-report measure (Hutton, Byrne &amp; Morrison, 2017; unpublished). Items rated as greater than &quot;a little&quot; will be classified as notable adverse experiences. Adverse events occurring during the course of the trial (identified through discussion with the participant or clinical team) will also be monitored and recorded. These will include hospitalisation (related to mental health), medically serious self-harm (i.e. requiring medical intervention), and suicidal ideation where a plan and intent are present.</description>

    <description>Feasibility will be based upon (i) &gt; 70% of participants attending the post-therapy follow-up point and (ii) a rate of missing data per outcome measure of &lt; 25% (this rate of missing data has been used to indicate high risk of bias within systematic reviews; Hutton et al., 2015).</description>

    <time_frame>Five weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Self-Compassion Scale (SCS; Neff, 2003), assesses levels of self-compassion. The SCS includes 26 items rated on a scale of 1 (almost never) to 5 (almost always) as to how often participants engage in a range of thoughts or behaviours. The SCS includes six subscales including self-criticism (scores range from 5 to 25), self-kindness (scores range from 5 to 25), isolation (scores range from 4 to 20), common humanity (scores range from 4 to 20), over-identification (scores range from 4 to 20) and mindfulness (scores range from 4 to 20). Higher scores indicate greater self-compassion.</description>

    <description>Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ9; Kroenke et al., 2001).The PHQ9, used to assess depression, includes nine items and determines the extent to which participants have been bothered by difficulties over the last two weeks by rating on a scale of 0 (not at all) to 3 (nearly every day). Scores range from 0 to 27, with higher scores indicating greater symptom severity.</description>

The PSQ includes 8 items rated on a five-point scale with opposite ends representing agreement with an unstable or stable sense of self. Scores range from 0 to 40 with greater scores indicating greater instability</description>

The ABUSI asks participants to rate their urges to self-injure over the last week on frequency, strength, time thinking of self-injuring, and ability to resist. Score range from 0 to 30 with higher scores indicating more severe urges to self-injure</description>

    <description>The brief CAT-informed therapy will take place over two sessions. Session one will last around 90 minutes. In session one, we will discuss with the participant their experience of self-harm and begin to support them to make sense of patterns in their self-harming behaviour. This will be done by thinking about the events that come before or follow self-harm, as well as thoughts and emotions associated with self-harm; it will also be done by thinking about ways that the participant relates to him/herself and other people. By the end of the first session, the researcher and the participant will have collaboratively developed a written diagram which shows patterns in the participant's self-harm.
Session two will involve revisiting the mapping of patterns. The researcher and participant will the collaboratively develop 'exits' or ways to break patterns and cycles of thinking, feeling and behaviour. Both sessions will have structured endings.</description>
