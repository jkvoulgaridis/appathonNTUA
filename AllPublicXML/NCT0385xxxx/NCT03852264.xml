  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study investigates the roles of oxytocin and vasopressin in human-animal interaction.
      Children will participate in three conditions involving friendly interactions with dogs, or
      play with toys at a university laboratory.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Oxytocin (OT) and arginine vasopressin (AVP) are neuropeptides that play critical roles in
      social behavior, cognition, stress physiology, and physical health. OT is released in adult
      humans and dogs during affiliative forms of human-animal interaction (HAI), and HAI
      attenuates AVP release in dogs. Thus, HAI may provide a safe and effective approach for
      stimulating endogenous OT release, and inhibiting endogenous AVP activity. The investigators
      will recruit a sample of typically developing 8-10 year old children who will engage in
      structured HAI sessions with a familiar companion dog or unfamiliar dog, compared to a
      nonsocial control condition.
