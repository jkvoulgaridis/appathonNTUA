  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, observational, non-interventional study of patients scheduled to
      receive surgical intervention either via XEN or trabeculectomy for open-angle glaucoma. The
      decision to treat patients with a particular surgical procedure will not be influenced by the
      study as the treatment decision will continue to be made by the patient and the clinician.
      There will be no study mandated visits or treatments.

    <description>Visual function and local eye symptoms using the Glaucoma Symptom and Health Problem Chart (SHPC-18)
SHPC-18 is an eighteen question survey to assess local eye and visual function symptoms caused by glaucoma or its treatments. The tool is comprised of 7 questions related to local eye symptoms, and 11 related to visual function problems. The 2-domain tool is a psychometrically validated measure of patient-reported, glaucoma-related symptoms that is responsive to treatment and discriminates the severity of glaucoma to better understand the influence of glaucoma symptoms on patients' daily life.</description>

    <description>Work productivity using the Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire: Specific Health Problem v2.0 (WPAI:SHP)
The WPAI is a six question survey to quantitatively assess the amount of absenteeism, presenteeism, and daily activity impairment attributable to specific health problems. Participants will be asked about their employment status, the amount of hours they have missed due to their health problems, the amount of hours they have missed due to non-health problems, how many hours they worked, how much their health problems affected work productivity, and how much their health problems affected their regular daily activities for the recall period of one week</description>
