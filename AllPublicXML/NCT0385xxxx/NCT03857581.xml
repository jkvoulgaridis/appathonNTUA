      The purpose of this trial is to determine if patients with comorbid psychotic disorder and
      substance use disorder will continue in treatment longer if treated with clozapine than with
      olanzapine, and will have greater reductions in psychosis and in substance use if treated
      with clozapine than treated with olanzapine. The specific aims and hypotheses of this trial
      are: 1. To compare the enduring effectiveness and tolerability of clozapine and olanzapine,
      as measured by time to all-cause treatment discontinuation, over 12 weeks of follow-up; The
      investigators hypothesize that patients assigned to clozapine treatment will have
      significantly longer times to all cause treatment discontinuation, 2. To compare the total
      psychosis items scores between patients treated with clozapine and patients treated with
      olanzapine over 12 weeks of follow-up; The investigators hypothesize that patients treated
      with clozapine will have significantly lower total psychosis items scores than patients
      treated with olanzapine, and 3. To compare the frequencies of positive urine drug screens and
      blood alcohol levels (obtained weekly throughout 12 weeks of follow-up) between patients
      treated with clozapine and patients treated with olanzapine; The investigators hypothesize
      that patients treated with clozapine will have significantly fewer positive urine drug
      screens and blood alcohol levels than patients treated with olanzapine.

    <description>BPRS scale is used to measure and monitor for symptoms of schizophrenia. For the purpose of the study, we will be measuring 4 items to monitor for positive psychopathology. The items are
Suspiciousness
Hallucinations
Unusual thought content
Conceptual disorganization
Each item is rated on a scale of 1 to 7. 1 being condition not present and 7 being extreme form of the condition present. The maximum score a participant can score is 28 and minimum score is 4.</description>
