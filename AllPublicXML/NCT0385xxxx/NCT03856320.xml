  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is the second leading cause of death in the U.S. The treatment of obesity and its
      related health issues, including cardiovascular disease and diabetes, exceeds $150 billion
      annually. &quot;Morbidly&quot; or &quot;severely&quot; obese patients - defined by a body mass index [BMI] of &gt;35
      kg/m2 or greater - are especially high risk for serious complications due to their weight.
      Within the Veterans Health Administration (VA) system, nearly 600,000 patients are severely
      obese. These Veterans create significant costs for the VA system, experience poorer quality
      of life, and have shortened lifespans. Bariatric surgery is the most effective treatment for
      severe obesity for weight loss, resolving weight-related health issues, and quality of life.
      Bariatric surgery is supported as a treatment option by many national societies, including
      those representing primary care and endocrinology. However, less than 1% of Veterans who
      qualify for bariatric surgery undergo it. Reasons for low utilization are unclear, although
      the investigators' preliminary research suggests that there are various patient, provider and
      system level barriers to severe obesity care. The goal of this study is to pilot-test an
      educational video that aligns patient preferences with treatment options to improve the care
      that severely obese Veterans receive.

      Obesity is the second leading cause of death in the U.S. The treatment of obesity and its
      related comorbidities, including cardiovascular disease and diabetes, exceeds $150 billion
      annually. &quot;Morbidly&quot; or &quot;severely&quot; obese patients - defined by a body mass index [BMI] of &gt;35
      kg/m2 or greater - are especially high risk for serious complications due to the metabolic
      and physiologic derangements that occur with severe obesity. Within the Veterans Health
      Administration (VA) system, nearly 600,000 patients are severely obese. These Veterans exert
      significant costs on the VA system, experience poorer quality of life, and have shortened
      lifespans. Bariatric surgery is the most effective treatment for severe obesity for weight
      loss, comorbidity resolution, and quality of life. Bariatric surgery is supported as a
      treatment option by many national societies, including those representing primary care and
      endocrinology. However, less than 1% of Veterans who qualify for bariatric surgery undergo
      it. Reasons for low utilization are unclear, although the investigators' preliminary research
      suggests that there are various patient, provider and system level barriers to severe obesity
      care. The goal of this study is to pilot-test an educational video that aligns patient
      preferences with treatment options to optimize the care that severely obese Veterans receive.
