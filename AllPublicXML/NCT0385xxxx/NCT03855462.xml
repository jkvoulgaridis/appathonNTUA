  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background : Surgery is needed in order to flatten and position a detached retina onto the
      choroid, to allow sealing of the tears and to prevent or reverse vision loss. In case of
      complex retinal detachment vitrectomies followed by ocular endotamponade - non-solid implants
      used in ophthalmology - is the most common treatment. Despite several options used by
      surgeons were not entirely satisfactory, no innovation were marketed in the ocular
      endotamponade field since decades.

      Purpose : Regarding comparative physico-chemical properties of medium-chain triglycerides
      (MCT) with current tamponading agents (silicone oil or gases), it will be proposed to
      evaluate the MCT as an ocular endotamponade product.

      Previously a nonclinical study has provide an assessment of the safety and the local tissue
      effects of the Medium-Chain Triglyceride (MCT) tamponade agent manufactured by the company
      Arcadophta : There were no histopathologic findings or irritation events that were directly
      attributable to the MCT device. In conclusion, under the conditions of the study, the MCT
      device did not induce any adverse local tissue effects compared to a control tamponading
      agent silicone oil.

      The present clinical study is the first use of MCT tamponade agent which assigns human
      participants. The MCT tamponade agent studied is manufactured by the company Arcadophta and
      designed as a Class IIb medical device in Europe.

      Tamponment efficacy and human eye safety of the device are supported by a flatten retina
      observation and a healthy eye fundus exam respectively as long as the tamponade agent is
      present.

      The patient treatment is the classical surgical procedure which is used for retinal
      detachment with silicone oil.

        -  Vitrectomy, then flattened retina, and finally MCT injection in place of the vitreous.

        -  MCT ablation after 4 to 6 weeks (after effective retinopexy) The patient follow-up
           begins 4 days before treatment , then 3 time-points exams are performed before MCT
           ablation and 4 time-points exams are performed after MCT ablation for a total patient
           follow-up duration of 6 months.
