  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with tics will be asked to complete a series of validated questionnaires (in
      electronic and/or paper format) regarding symptoms and conditions often associated with
      Tourette syndrome, including premonitory urges, sensory experiences, inattention,
      obsessive-compulsive tendencies, anxiety, and depression. Participants will also be asked to
      complete a quality of life assessment. This series of questionnaires will be administered
      annually.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with tics will be recruited to participate in an observational study assessing
      extent and variation in non-motor features of Tourette syndrome over time. Each participant
      will complete a battery of validated questionnaires and scales online or in paper format (per
      patient preference), including the Premonitory Urge to Tic Scale (PUTS), the Sensory Gating
      Inventory (SGI), the Sensory Perception Quotient, the World Health Organization ADHD
      Self-Report Screening Scale, and others. These questionnaires will be administered annually
      to patients.

    <description>Validated instrument assessing anomalous sensory experiences. Scale consists of 35 items screening patients for hyper- or hypo-sensitivity to each of the sensory domains (touch, sight, sound, smell, and taste). Each scale item is a statement to which participants provide a ranking:
0 = strongly agree
= agree
= disagree
= strongly disagree The minimum score on the short from is 0; the maximum score is 140. Higher scores indicate more abnormal sensory experiences.</description>

    <measure>Change in Sensory Gating Inventory score at 2 years</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Validated instrument assessing anomalous sensory experiences. The scale consists of 36 items screening patients for hyper- or hypo-sensitivity to several of the sensory domains (primarily sight and sound). Each scale item is a statement to which participants provide a ranking:
= never true
= infrequently true
= sometimes but infrequently true
= sometimes true
= true
= always true The minimum score on the scale is 36; the maximum score is 216. Higher scores indicate more abnormal sensory experiences.</description>

    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Validated instrument assessing type and extent of premonitory sensations. The scale consists of 9 scored items and 1 non-scored item, all assessing degree of abnormal sensations and urges preceding a tic. The scored scale items are ranked 1-4, with 4 being the most abnormal. The minimum score on the scale is 9; the maximum score is 36. Higher scores indicate more frequent and severe premonitory urges.</description>
