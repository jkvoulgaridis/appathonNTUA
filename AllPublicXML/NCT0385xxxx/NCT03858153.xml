  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a highly prevalent and severe
      side-effect of taxane chemotherapy, often used to treat breast cancer. Unfortunately there
      are very limited treatments for CIPN. This is a phase II randomized controlled trial to test
      the preliminary efficacy of exercise vs. nutrition education on CIPN, to systematically
      investigate the potential roles of inflammation and interoception, and to obtain data with a
      more accurate effect size to inform a future study.

        Exclusion criteria (subjects must not…)

          1. Be in the active or maintenance stage of exercise behavior (i.e., subjects must be
             sedentary)

          2. Have physical limitations (e.g., cardiorespiratory, orthopedic, central nervous
             system) that contraindicate participation in maximal physiological fitness testing and
             a low/moderate intensity home-based walking and progressive resistance exercise
             program.

        Additional exclusion criteria only for patients performing the MRI scanning (40 of 80
        enrolled subjects)

        pregnancy, chest expander from breast reconstruction, etc.—note that most port-a-caths are
