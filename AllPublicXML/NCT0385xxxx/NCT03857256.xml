  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the effects of adding beta-glucan (1.5 g, 3 g or 6
      g daily) administered three times a day (TID) in divided doses, to atorvastatin (10 mg - 20
      mg) once a day or an equivalent dose of another statin on heart disease lipid risk factors.

    <textblock>
      Male and female subjects ≥ 18 years of age with an elevated LDL-C &gt; 3.37 mmol/L (130 mg/dL)
      treated with a stable dose of statin for at least 6 weeks (atorvastatin (10-20mg daily) or
      equivalent dose of another statin), including subject with previous cardiovascular (CV)
      events, with partial statin intolerance defined as an inability to tolerate statin therapy in
      the form and dosages required to achieve treatment goals.

      Following signature of informed consent, approximately 264 subjects (66 subjects per
      beta-glucan treatment group and 22 subjects per matching placebo group) meeting all inclusion
      criteria and no exclusion criteria will be randomized to receive one of the three doses of
      beta-glucan (1.5 g, 3 g or 6 g daily) administered TID in divided doses or a matching placebo
      as an add-on therapy to atorvastatin (10- 20 mg administered once daily) or an equivalent
      dose of another statin.

      The subjects will be assigned to the 3 different doses of beta-glucan or placebo in a tiered
      fashion as follows:

        -  The first set of 88 subjects randomized will receive either 1.5 g beta-glucan daily (1
           tablet of 500 mg TID) or a matching placebo in a 3:1 ratio,

        -  The next set of 88 subjects randomized will receive either 3 g of beta-glucan daily (2
           tablets of 500 mg TID) or a matching placebo in a 3:1 ratio,

        -  The last set of 88 subjects randomized will receive either 6 g of beta-glucan daily (4
           tablets of 500 mg TID) or a matching placebo in a 3:1 ratio.

      During the treatment period, subjects will return to the study site at Visit 3 (Week 6) and
      at the End of Treatment Visit (Week 12) for laboratory tests and clinical assessments,
      including Adverse Events (AEs), dietary guidance and study product compliance. At the Safety
      Follow-up Visit (Week 14), subjects will be contacted via telephone for an assessment of AEs.
