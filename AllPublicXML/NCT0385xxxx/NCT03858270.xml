  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lewy Body Dementia (LBD), is the second most common form of dementia after Alzheimer's
      Disease. Dementia is defined as a serious loss in cognitive ability due to damages or disease
      in the brain beyond what is normal aging. With Lewy Body Dementia, protein deposits, or Lewy
      Bodies, accumulate in nerve cells throughout the brain, affecting motor control, memory and
      thinking. LBD can also form with the progression of Parkinson's disease (PD). PD is a
      degenerative nervous system disorder that affects movement ability. Using more sensitive MRI
      imaging techniques the investigators are attempting to see if disease progression can be
      monitored more closely. At the same time, the study medication Memantine will be compared to
      a placebo to determine if it can be used to slow the progression of PD. The purpose of this
      study is to assess if disease progression can be better monitored through brain imaging and
      if Memantine will help slow disease progression.

    <measure>Change in the Intracellular volume (ICV), as measured by MRI NODDI sequence, in multiple brain regions, baseline to year-1.</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to year-1 of ICV for each brain region mentioned above.</time_frame>
    <description>ICV component is calculated from the NODDI MRI, using available software, for dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, precuneous, anterior cingulate, posterior cingulate, hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, thalamus, caudate, putamen, association visual cortex, and primary visual cortex. The change in ICV fro each region will be calculated from baseline to year-1, and would constitute a regional outcome measure, but due to the number of regions, they have all been described under outcome#5, since they have the same unit of measurement. Group comparisons (i.e. placebo v. memantine for each region) will be corrected for multiple comparisons as appropriate (E.g Bonferroni )</description>
