      To healthy subjects of thirty-six (36), following treatments are administered dosing in each
      period and wash-out period is a minimum of 7 days.

      Reference drug: D569 Tab. / Test drug: CKD-374 5mg Tab. Pharmacokinetic blood samples are
      collected up to 12hrs. The pharmacokinetic characteristics and safety are assessed
