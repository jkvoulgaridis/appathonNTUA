  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HCT) is an aggressive treatment for life-threatening
      cancers. HCT improves survival, but most HCT patients experience significant physical
      disability, which is exacerbated by persistent symptoms. Pain, fatigue, and psychological
      distress are the most prevalent and debilitating symptoms. HCT patients experience a
      significant increase in disability as their pain, fatigue, and distress increase. This
      disability and symptom burden interferes with patients' ability to engage in recommended
      physical activity that can improve disability, symptoms, and other outcomes. Disability and
      symptoms also complicate an already challenging recovery course; HCT patients return home,
      often far from their medical team, are restricted from normal activities and socially
      isolated. These disability, symptom and activity challenges increase the risk for
      post-transplant complications and may compromise life expectancy. Teaching HCT patients to
      cope with symptoms and activity is critical to helping them increase activity and reduce
      disability. Cognitive behavioral coping skills training protocols can enhance HCT patients'
      ability to cope with symptoms (pain, fatigue, distress) that interfere with physical
      activity. However, the application of these protocols to HCT patients is limited by in person
      sessions, delivery of sessions in a medical center setting, and/or lack of tailoring to HCT
      patients' specific needs. Mobile health (mHealth) technologies can improve and extend
      intervention strategies to cope with symptoms and physical activity upon return home.
      Behavioral intervention strategies are needed to enable HCT patients to effectively cope with
      symptoms to improve their ability to engage in physical activity that can improve physical
      disability.

      The investigators aim to develop and test a combined coping skills training and activity
      coaching protocol that: first, is feasible and acceptable, and second, improves physical
      disability, as well as pain, fatigue, distress, and physical activity in HCT patients.
      Specifically, the investigators will develop and test an in-person and mHealth HCT Coping
      Skills Training for Symptom Management and Daily Steps (HCT Symptoms and Steps) intervention
      protocol. To do this, the investigators will develop a mobile app, conduct focus groups,
      complete user testing, and conduct a small randomized controlled trial (RCT) to examine
      feasibility, acceptability, and outcome patterns suggesting intervention efficacy of the
      developed HCT Symptoms and Steps protocol. Following the development phase of the study
      (i.e., focus groups), the investigators will conduct user testing with 10 cancer patients who
      have undergone HCT; all 10 patients will receive the HCT Symptoms and Steps intervention.
      Next, the investigators will randomly assign 40 cancer participants who have undergone HCT
      and report pain, fatigue and stress to receive either HCT Symptoms and Steps or HCT
      Education. The investigators will test whether HCT Symptoms and Steps is feasible and
      acceptable to HCT patients, and improves physical disability, as well as other important
      outcomes. The investigators expect that HCT Symptoms and Steps will be feasible and
      acceptable to HCT patients and, compared to HCT Education, will be more likely to lead to
      improvements in physical disability, as well as pain, fatigue, distress, physical activity,
      and self-efficacy for symptom management.

      The investigators' goal is to demonstrate the feasibility, acceptability, and positive impact
      of a hybrid in-person and mHealth coping skills training and activity coaching intervention
      that reduces physical disability by concurrently and synergistically decreasing symptom
      burden and increasing physical activity. This project has the potential to lead to future
      research that can redesign existing modes of behavioral intervention delivery, improve
      continuity and coordination of care, and ultimately enhance patient outcomes.
