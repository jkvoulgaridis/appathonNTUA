  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic cough is a common presenting problem which has a significant impact on quality of
      life. Gastro-oesophageal reflux (GOR) is a common cause of chronic cough and reflux of
      stomach contents into the airways has been implicated in the pathogenesis of a number of
      respiratory diseases. Clinical history in patients with suspected reflux can aid in the
      diagnosis but traditional investigations for GOR including 24hr oesophageal pH monitoring or
      endoscopy are not reliable diagnostic tools since the reflux may be non acidic.

      The detection of pepsin in the sputum, saliva or bronchial biopsy has been found to be an
      accurate marker of reflux into the airways. Pepsin is solely produced by parietal cells in
      the stomach. The presence of pepsin in the upper airways therefore indicates reflux. Studies
      have demonstrated that pepsin was frequently found in laryngeal biopsies and sputum of
      patients with signs and symptoms of airways reflux and that Nissen fundoplication resulted in
      a decrease in pepsin detection alongside an improvement in symptoms. The Peptest™ lateral
      flow device has been shown to be effective in the detection of pepsin in sputum and saliva of
      patients with chronic cough and gastro-oesophageal reflux. The investigators have detected
      pepsin in expectorated saliva during episodes of cough, apparently supporting a diagnosis of
      airways reflux. Critics, however, have suggested that the act coughing itself is responsible
      for the reflux.

      This study aims to identify if cough induced by inhaled citric acid in healthy adult
      volunteers leads to detectable pepsin in expectorated saliva.
