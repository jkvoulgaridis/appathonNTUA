    <textblock>
      In this study, researchers want to learn more about the effect of dexpanthenol cream on skin
      recovery and reduction of skin rash after a dermatological procedure (ablative laser) on the
      face for treatment of fine wrinkles, scars and open pores in adult women.

      After the dermatological procedure, participants will return within 3 weeks for 4 visits to
      the study center to investigate the skin conditions such as redness, irritation, softness and
      possible side effects. In addition, study participants will be asked about their general
      acceptance of dexpanthenol cream.

      The primary objective is to evaluate the efficacy of the test product to aid skin recovery
      and reduction of erythema after ablative lasering on the face.

      Secondary objectives comprise clinical efficacy with respect to skin hydration, softness,
      vitality, appearance etc. and skin recovery, consumer judgement of product performance and
      acceptability, and safety.
