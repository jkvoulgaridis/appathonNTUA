  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this prospective, intervention study, participants with diagnosed Parkinson's disease will
      be instructed to follow a Mediterranean diet for five weeks. Gut permeability will be
      assessed using food-grade sugar molecules. Participants will provide urine and stool samples
      to assess gut permeability and microbial communities.

    <description>The primary outcome is the change in gastroduodenal permeability induced by the Mediterranean diet. Gastroduodenal permeability will be assessed by measuring sucrose concentration in the 0 to 5-hour urine collection (end of intervention minus baseline)</description>

    <measure>Gastrointestinal Symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 1; Week 5</time_frame>
    <description>Weekly GI symptoms assessed using the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS). The GSRS consists of 15 questions related to 5 syndromes, constipation, diarrhea, reflux, abdominal pain, and indigestion. Symptoms are scored 1=no discomfort to 7=very severe discomfort. Scores from each of the 15 questions are summed for the total GSRS score.</description>

    <description>Participants will be given individualized diet education on the Mediterranean diet and instructed to follow the diet for the 5-week intervention period. Individualized diet education will be administered by a licensed, registered dietitian nutritionist (RDN) followed by weekly phone calls to ensure compliance, improve adherence to the diet and monitor for adverse events.</description>

For usual drinkers, the main source of alcohol should be wine.</description>
