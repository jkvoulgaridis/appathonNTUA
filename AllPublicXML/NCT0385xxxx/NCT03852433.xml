      This is Phase 2b Clinical Study to Assess Efficacy and Safety of Bulevirtide in Combination
      with Pegylated Interferon alfa-2a in Patients with Chronic Hepatitis Delta

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A Multicenter, Open-label, Randomized Phase 2b Clinical Study. Approximately 25 study sites
      in approximately 4 countries globally which may include Russia, France, Moldova, Romania.

      There is currently no approved drug for treatment of chronic hepatitis Delta (CHD). Pegylated
      interferon alfa -2a (PEG-IFN alfa) is approved for treatment of chronic hepatitis И virus
      (HBV) infection which is required for the propagation of hepatitis Delta virus (HDV), and
      used to treat patients with HDV infection with evidence of some virologic efficacy.
      Interferon has a complex mode of action, whereas direct antiviral effects and
      immunomodulatory mechanisms have been described. Bulevirtide is an entry inhibitor has
      demonstrated significant virologic and biochemical activity in patients with HDV infection
      during the Phase 2 clinical trials. A combination of the both drugs demonstrated significant
      synergistic effects in the 201 clinical trial. It is therefore warranted to further
      investigate the combination therapy with the aim of improvement of sustained virologic
      response rates.
