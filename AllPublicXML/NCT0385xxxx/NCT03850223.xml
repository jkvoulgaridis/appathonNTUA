  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Congenital Heart Disease (CHD) is the most common birth defect in the United States,
      affecting approximately 0.8% of live births. Improved treatment strategies and interventions
      have increased survival such that 85% to 90% of affected children are expected to live well
      into adulthood, thereby causing a demographic shift in which adults now outnumber children
      with CHD, and more people with complex CHD are living longer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CHD may be defined as an anatomic malformation of the heart or great vessels which occurs
      during intrauterine development, irrespective of the age at presentation. The cause of most
      congenital heart defects is still unknown. Many cases of congenital heart disease are
      multifactorial and result from a combination of genetic predisposition and an environmental
      stimulus. A small percentage of congenital heart lesions are related to known chromosomal
      abnormalities, in particular, trisomy 21, 13, and 18 and Turner syndrome. Of all cases of
      congenital heart disease, 2-4% are associated with known environmental or adverse maternal
      conditions and teratogenic influences, including maternal diabetes mellitus, phenylketonuria,
      systemic lupus erythematosus or congenital rubella syndrome; and maternal ingestion of drugs
      (lithium, ethanol, warfarin, antimetabolites, vitamin A derivatives, anticonvulsant agents).
