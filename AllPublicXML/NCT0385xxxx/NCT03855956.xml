  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized, double-blind, controlled, clinical food study aims to explore KB174, a novel
      mixture of oligosaccharides, and maltodextrin, an easily digestible polysaccharide, on gut
      microbiome structure and function in subjects with well-compensated cirrhosis.
