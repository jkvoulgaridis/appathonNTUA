    <textblock>
      Phantom Limb Pain ( PLP) is pain that is perceived and referred to a region of the body that
      is no longer present. in most patients, severity and frequency of phantom pain attacks
      gradually decrease over several weeks to 2 years following amputation, however in 5-10%
      significant pain remains a serious problem.

      It has been hypothesized, that deprivation of various inputs from the limbs to the brain
      cause an abnormal neuro-signature to be produced generating cortical maladaptive
      neuroplasticity and reorganization. Areas representing the amputated body part are taken over
      by neighboring representational zones in both the somatosensory and motor cortex generating
      pain in absence of stimuli.

      A seminal paper published by Lotze et al &quot;Phantom movements and pain: a functional magnetic
      resonance imaging (fMRI) study in upper limb amputees. - participants had to pucker their
      lips at a metronome-paced speed while functional magnetic resonance images were taken. Only
      in amputees with phantom-limb pain did a shift of the mouth representation into the hand
      representation occur; those without pain and the healthy control do not display a similar
      shift.

      Scarce reports have been made on a similar phenomenon- micturition induced lower limb phantom
      pain.

      We speculate that a similar maladaptive central nerve system (CNS) plasticity in which this
      genital representation would invade cortical areas with somatotopic affiliation to the lower
      extremity could be implicated in the pathophysiology of this phenomenon.

      The present study was there for devised to examine this hypothesis utilizing fMRI imaging of
      temporo-spatial cortical activation during micturition and pain generation.

      We hypothesis that in amputees with phantom-limb pain a shift of the genital representation
      into the leg representation will occur; and will be demonstrated as an uni-hemispheral
      activity on fMRI during micturition and pain suggesting maladaptive CNS plasticity. Moreover,
      we speculate that healthy volunteers will not display a similar shift.

      During the study, standard motor and sensory paradigms will be performed to establish
      anatomical and functional patterns in the non-painful state. The patient will then be asked
      to urinate (to an external collecting tube system).

      All anatomical data will be examined by a certified clinical imaging specialist to exclude
      concomitant brain pathology.
