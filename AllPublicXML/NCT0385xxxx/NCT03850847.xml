  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Given how central Substitute Decision Makers (SDMs) are to the process leading to end of life
      decisions and sometimes, organ donation, it is striking how poorly understood this
      decision-making process is. A 2017 scoping review on the topic of soliciting SDM consent to
      organ donation reported on more than 168 studies covering a broad range of topics, including:
      SDM characteristics and predictors of consent; the process of soliciting consent; and the
      effect of the decision on subsequent process of care and on family well-being. An unexplored
      area, however, is factors - including modifiable factors - that influence SDM decision making
      at the end of life, which organ donation is part of, such as: responses to stress, support
      from extended families and friends, and personal beliefs about the ongoing medical
      conditions. This project seeks to fill this clear and important gap.

      In the ICU, at the end of life, SDMs are under incredible emotional distress, have often not
      eaten or slept properly for days preceding discussions about end of life and organ donation,
      and are also in the midst of grieving for their loved one. The time pressure poses challenges
      for SDMs' decision making. Thus, this study will investigate novel, potentially modifiable
      reasons for end of life decision so that we may better support this personally challenging
      and important decision, especially if organ donation decision interferes with the decision
      process.

      Primary objective: To investigate beliefs and experiences of SDMs involved in the
      decision-making process around withdrawal of life sustaining therapies .

      Secondary objective: To inform efforts to improve support for SDMs with the aim of improving
      the decision-making process end-of-life decisions, including when organ donation is involved.

      A national multicenter multi-methods study with SDMs will be conducted in two steps. In Step
      1, a semi-structured interviews with SDMs will be conducted. The sampling frame will balance
      interviews with those that were approached or not for organ donation, and consented or not to
      organ donation. Interviews will be informed by two complementary theoretical frameworks.
      Building on Step 1 results, in Step 2 a national telephone survey of SDMs will be conducted
      to test which factors are associated with end-of-life decisions.

        Surogate decision makers of critically ill deceased patients, potential organ donors. Are
        included all SDMs, whether the patient donated organs or not, or were approached for organ
        donation or not, thus providing a global view of the decision making at the end of life and
        how it is affected by organ donation, or how it affects organ donation when appropriate.
