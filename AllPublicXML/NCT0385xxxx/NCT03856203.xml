  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Conduct a prospective, longitudinal study to evaluate nutritional status in adults with
      phenylketonuria (PKU) before and during treatment with pegvaliase (Palynziq™).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will compare intra-subject change in adults with PKU who follow a
      protein-restricted diet (protein intake less than the RDA for protein based on weight (0.8
      g/kg/day) with or without a PKU medical food) within 90 days of starting pegvaliase
      (baseline) and 9 and 15 months later. The investigators will collect laboratory measures of
      nutrition status, anthropometrics, Dual-Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry (DXA) to measure body
      composition and bone mineral density (BMD), and indirect calorimetry to measure resting
      energy expenditure (REE). In addition, three-day food records will be obtained to assess
      protein intake and overall diet quality.

    <description>Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire (TFEQ)-18 is an 18-item questionnaire measured on a four-point scale cognitive restraint (6 items), uncontrolled eating (9 items) and emotional eating (3 items). Responses are measured on a four-point scale and the raw scores for each subscale are transformed to correspond to a 0-100 point scale. Higher scores in the respective scales are indicative of greater cognitive restraint, emotional eating, and uncontrolled eating.</description>

        This study will recruit adults with PKU who are starting therapy with pegvaliase and
        currently following a protein-restricted diet with or without medical food.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of phenylketonuria

          -  Aged 18-65 years

          -  Following a protein-restricted diet with or without medical food within the last 30
             days

          -  Routine natural protein intake from food is less than the RDA for protein based on
             weight (0.8 g/kg/day).

          -  If not consuming animal proteins, recommended protein intake is 115% RDA due to lower
             bioavailability of plant proteins.

          -  Within ±90 days of starting treatment with pegvaliase at time of study enrollment

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Unable to consent to study

          -  Under age 18 or over age 65 years

          -  Routine natural protein intake is greater than the RDA for protein (0.8 g/kg/d) within
             the last 30 days.

          -  Females who are currently pregnant or lactating
