  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fluoropyrimidines are the backbone of chemotherapy regimes used to treat metastatic
      colorectal cancer (CRC). These drugs act in different pathways of folate metabolism altering
      DNA synthesis mainly by inhibition of the tymidylate synthase. For this reaction the
      5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate acts as cofactor. It has been demonstrated that A1298C and
      C677T polymorphisms in the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene result in reduced
      enzyme activity that leads to reduced availability of this important cofactor. Hence, we
      hypothesized that the presence of these polymorphisms are related to the efficacy and
      toxicity of fluoropyrimidines in patients with CRC.

      Patients with metastatic colorectal cancer are invited to join this study at the start of
      treatment with any fluoropyrimidine used alone or in combination with oxaliplatin and/or
      irinotecan +/- bevacizumab, panitumumab or cetuximab. DNA extraction will be done from blood
      and tissue samples to determine the C677T (rs1801133) and 1298 A&gt;C (rs18011131) polymorphisms
      of the MTHFR gene.

      The patient will be followed at least for one year during treatment to determine any toxicity
      related to the therapy and to determine the overall survival, progression-free survival and
      response rate. Patients will be categorized into different categories according to the
      genetic status of each polymorphism.
