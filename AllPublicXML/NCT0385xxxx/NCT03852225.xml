  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Individual optimization of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) in real time may increase the
      success rate of the procedure. End-tidal CO2 (EtCO2) levels reflect cardiac output induced by
      CPR. Other potential marker of haemodynamic efficacy of CPR is direct measurement of the
      extent of induced compression of left ventricle (LV), right ventricle (RV) and inferior caval
      vein (IVC) by ultrasound. We plane to evaluate whether these ultrasound parameters correlate
      with EtCO2 levels during CPR for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) of non-traumatic
      origin.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pre-hospital observational study will be realized in the setting of physician-based Emergency
      Medical System in the Czech republic. 20 patients resuscitated for OHCA of nontraumatic
      origin are planned to be included to the study. Transthoracic echocardiography will be
      performed from subcostal view during ongoing chest compressions in all of them and in the
      time of this investigation EtCO2 level will be recorded. This will be repeated three times
      during CPR in each patient if possible. Later on, maximal and minimal diameter of LV, RV and
      IVC will be obtained from the recorded loops and compression index (%) of LV (LVCI), RV
      (RVCI) and IVC (IVCCI) will be calculated as (maximal-minimal/maximal cavital diameter)x100.
      Correlations between EtCO2 and LVCI, RVCI and IVCI and CImax will be expressed as Spearman's
      correlation coefficient.

      The results of the study will answer the question whether echocardiographic evaluation of
      compression of heart cavities during CPR reflect haemodynamic efficacy of CPR. If so, this
      study will be followed by an interventional clinical trial evaluating the effect of
      compression depth changes as a response to measured compression of the heart.
