  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Muscle atrophy may occur in individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI) as a result of
      diminished physical activity and alterations in glucose metabolism and body composition may
      be seen. In a few studies, it has been suggested that spasticity may have a positive impact
      on glucose metabolism by preventing muscle atrophy and alterations in body composition in
      individuals with motor complete SCI. Investigators aimed to assess the effects of spasticity
      on glucose metabolism and body composition in participants with complete and incomplete SCI.

    <textblock>
      Investigators plan a prospective clinical trial. Participants with SCI were included to study
      if times from injury were at least one year. Participants had an AIS grades of A-D with
      spasticity. Spasticity was assessed with Penn Spasm Frequency Scale (PSFS), Spinal Cord
      Assessment Tool for Spastic Reflexes (SCATS) and Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS). Hip adductor
      and extensor spasticity, knee extensor and flexor spasticity and ankle plantar flexor
      spasticity were assessed by using MAS. Body composition was measured by dual-energy x-ray
      absorptiometry. All participants underwent a 75 gram (g) oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT).
      Insulin sensitivity was assessed by calculating Matsuda index and HOMA-IR. Investigators
      assessed the effects of spasticity on glucose metabolism and body composition in participants
      with SCI.

    <description>Modified Ashworth Scale is used to asses muscles spasticity on a 6-point scale. 0: No increase in muscle tone 4: Affected part(s) is (are) rigid in flexion or extension.</description>

    <measure>Penn Spasm Frequency Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>One day</time_frame>
    <description>The Penn Spasm Frequency Scale measures self assessed global spasm frequency on a 5-point scale. 0: no; 5: = spasms occurring more than 10 times per hour.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Spinal Cord Assessment Tool for Spastic Reflexes (SCATS)</measure>
    <time_frame>One day</time_frame>
    <description>The SCATS assesses the severity of the 3 spasticity components: clonus, flexor spasm, and extensor spasm. These 3 subscales measured with a score of 0 to 3. Clonus is measured by rapid passive dorsiflexion of the ankle. clonic burst was timed and scored as follows: 0, no reaction; 1, the duration was &lt;3 seconds; 2, clonus persisted between 3 and 10 seconds; and 3, clonus lasted &gt;10 seconds. Flexor spasm was measured by applying a pinprick stimulus to the medial arch of the foot. 0, no reaction to stimulus; 1, &lt;10 degree flexion at the hip and knee, or extension of the big toe; 2, 10 to 30 degree flexion of the hip and knee; and 3, &gt;30 degree hip and knee flexion. SCATS extensor spasm was measured by visible quadriceps muscle contraction. This evaluation is same the SCATS clonus.</description>

    <description>In the morning after 12 hours overnight fast, all individuals underwent a 75 gram (g) oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Blood samples were taken before loading glucose and then 30, 60, 90 and 120 minutes after taking glucose solution in order to measure serum glucose and insulin levels. Glycohemoglobin (HbA1c) was measured in blood samples taken before the OGTT. We calculated the Matsuda index and Homeostasis model assessment index (HOMA-IR) using glucose and insulin levels.</description>
