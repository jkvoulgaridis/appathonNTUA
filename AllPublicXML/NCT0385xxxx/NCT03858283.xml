  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mindfulness Based Health Care (MBHC) includes meditation techniques to help caregivers of
      Alzheimer patients to be made more aware of their experience in the present moment. Half of
      the caregivers will learn the practice of mindfulness meditation once a week through 8
      classes, and the other half will not receive any therapy. The primary purpose of this study
      is to explore the effects of this mindfulness program for caregivers on the neuropsychiatric
      symptoms in Alzheimer patients, as well as on anxiety and depression symptoms in their
      caregivers. Secondarily, to examine the effect of this program on cognitive function, daily
      activity living and quality of life in Alzheimer patients, as well as on the burden of
      caregiving, quality of life, psychological well-being, occupational balance, executive
      function and self-compassion in their caregivers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Alzheimer's disease is a progressive brain disorder that involves the loss of the ability to
      live independently, functional capacity and safety. Thus, patients often suffer
      neuropsychiatric disorders and need help from another person to live every day. Due to the
      burden of caregiving, the main caregivers can have anxiety and depression symptoms. With this
      scenario, we will conduct this randomized controlled trial aimed to evaluate the effect of
      mindfulness program for caregiver's vs control group on: 1) neuropsychiatric disorders,
      cognitive function, daily activity living and quality of life in Alzheimer patients; 2)
      anxiety and depression symptoms, burden of caregiving, quality of life, psychological
      well-being, occupational balance, executive function and self-compassion in their caregivers.

    <measure>Changes in Neuropsychiatric disorders of Alzheimer patients measured with Neuropsychiatric inventory</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 8 weeks, 3 months after the 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Neuropsychiatric inventory includes 12 neuropsychiatric symptom domains: delusions, hallucinations, agitation/aggression, dysphoria/depression, anxiety, euphoria/elation, apathy/indifference, disinhibition, irritability/lability, aberrant motor behaviors, nighttime behavioral disturbances, and appetite/eating disturbances. Neuropsychiatric manifestations within a domain are collectively rated by the caregiver in terms of both frequency (1 to 4) and severity (1 to 3), yielding a composite symptom domain score (frequency×severity). Frequency and severity rating scales have defined anchor points to enhance the reliability of caregiver responses. Caregiver distress is rated for each positive neuropsychiatric symptom domain on a scale anchored by scores of 0 (not distressing at all) and 5 (extremely distressing).</description>

    <measure>Changes in Anxiety and depression symptoms in Caregivers of Alzheimer patients measured with Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 8 weeks, 3 months after the 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Hospital Anxiety and Depression includes 14 items assessing anxiety (7-item) and depression (7-item), which are rated on a 4-point Likert-type (from 0 to 3). The scores in each subscale are computed by summing the corresponding items, with maximum scores of 21 for each subscale. A score of 0-7 is considered as normal, 8-10 as a borderline case, and 11-21 as a case (anxiety or depression)</description>

    <measure>Changes in Cognitive Function of Alzheimer patients with Mini Mental State Examination</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 8 weeks, 3 months after the 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Mini Mental State Examination is composed of 13 items to assess with scores (0,1,2,3,4,5) according answer. the main objective is to briefly assess the mental state and allow observe the degree of progression of cognitive status through the following areas: orientation, fixation, concentration and calculation, memory, language and construction.</description>

    <measure>Changes in Executive Function of Alzheimer patients with Frontal Assessment Battery</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 8 weeks, 3 months after the 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The FAB consists of 6 subtests that explore each of the processes controlled by the frontal lobes: 1) similarities (abstract reasoning/conceptualization); 2) lexical fluency (mental flexibility [i.e. self-organization, strategy and change]); 3) motor series (programming and motor planning); 4) conflicting instructions (sensitivity to interference); 5) Go-no-go test (inhibitory control and impulsiveness); and 6) prehension behavior (ability to inhibit a response to sensorial stimulation [i.e. environmental autonomy]). Higher scores of the test imply a better performance, and the total maximum score that can be obtained in the FAB is 18. The scoring is calculated by adding up the points for each test, which ranges from 0 to 3</description>
