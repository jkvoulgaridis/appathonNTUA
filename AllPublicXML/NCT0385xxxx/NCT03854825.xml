      The investigators want to investigate if the urinary biomarker neprilysin can identify
      cardiac surgical patients suffering from postoperative AKI within 24 hours.

    <textblock>
      Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common complication following cardiac surgery and
      significantly increases morbidity, duration of hospital stay, and mortality. The diagnosis of
      AKI relies on changes in serum creatinine (SCr) from a baseline value or decreases in urine
      output. Nevertheless changes of SCr to diagnose AKI are only reliable after a minimum of 48
      hours.

      Neutral endopeptidase, also called neprilysin (NEP) represents a single-pass membrane
      glycoprotein with zinc-dependent endopeptidase activity and a short cytosolic tail and is
      found in epithelia, fibroblasts, and neutrophils and in soluble form in the circulation,
      urine, and cerebrospinal fluid. Beside the focus of interest in cardiovascular medicine for
      its role in heart failure, where the inhibition of NEP by the administration of
      sacubitril/valsartan may achieve an improvement in patients with chronic heart failure and
      reduced ejection fraction, there is also thought to be a link to renal damage.

      NEP is expressed in the brush border of proximal tubular cells, which is first shed in renal
      damage and therefore it is a marker for tubular damage when it is measurable in urine In this
      study the investigators want to investigate if NEP is a marker for earlier detection of AKI
      after elective cardiac surgery compared to the currently recommended Kidney Disease -
      Improved Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines for acute kidney injury. Also, the investigators
      want to investigate at predefined time points the occurrence and the progression of tubular
      damage during cardio-pulmonary bypass (CPB) in a closed-meshed NEP detection.
