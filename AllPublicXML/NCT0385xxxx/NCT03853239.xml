  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nasotracheal intubation(NTI) is commonly used in operations of the mouth, pharynx, larynx and
      also the neck. While these patients showed higher rates of difficult laryngoscopy. Therefore,
      duration of apnoea is prolonged and re-oxygenation is inevitable.Mask ventilation is the most
      fundamental technique in maintaining oxygenation, even when endotracheal intubation is
      failed. However, the most common complication of NTI is epistaxis, removing the nasotracheal
      tube could make mask ventilation extremely difficult.So the investigatorsbelieve the ideal
      approach is ventilation through original nasotracheal tube.Several techniques of supraglottic
      ventilations through endotracheal tubes have been reported.It remains uncertain whether
      supraglottic ventilation through inflated nasal RAE endotracheal tube has similar efficiency
      as mask ventilation after general anesthesia induction. Based on previous clinical
      experience, the investigators hypothesised that ventilations through inflated nasal RAE
      endotracheal tube and through facemask were comparable in terms of tidal volume and airway
      pressure in anesthetized, apnoeic adults.

      Forty patients were randomly assigned (sealed envelope method) to face mask（Group A，n=20）or
      nasal ventilation(Group B，n=20), For A: face mask ventilation followed by nasal ventilation
      and for B:nasal ventilation followed by face mask ventilation.Measure the tidal volume and
      air leakage of face mask and nasal ventilation during pressure-controlled ventilation mode
      and volume-controlled mode, respectively.

    <description>Group A was first ventilated through the face mask, and the tidal volume was measured under pressure-controlled mode (10, 15, 20 cm H2O) ;Switched to volume-controlled (6,8,10ml/kg predicted body weight)mode, the actual tidal volume was recorded, and the air leakage was calculated. Then, put a nasal RAE tube in one side of the nostril, inflate the cuff, make the catheter in a natural position after inflation, clip the other side of the nostril, close the lip with tape, connect the breathing circuit, record the actual tidal volume; measure the expired tidal volume during pressure-controlled ventilation (10, 15, 20 cm H2O).Subject will start with one technique and then cross over to the other technique.</description>
