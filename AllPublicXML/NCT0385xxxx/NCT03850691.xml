  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2 study designed to evaluate the combination of checkpoint blockade and
      aldesleukin (IL-2) therapy after a course of standard of care palliative radiation in the
      management of unresectable metastatic melanoma. To be eligible, a patient must have a minimum
      of 3 (preferably &gt;5) radiographically distinct, measurable (&gt;1.5 cm) lesions based on RECIST
      1.1. Metastatic cutaneous melanoma must be refractory to standard immunotherapy drugs,
      molecular targeted agents and/or chemotherapy. Patients with ocular melanoma subtypes may
      enroll in this study without prior therapy, as there is no standard front-line therapy for
      this subset of patients.

             potential for fetal harm during immunotherapy at this time. Biological females of
             childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test within 14 days of
             enrollment.

          -  Concurrent use of high dose steroids; chronic steroid use of &lt; 2 mg dexamethasone or
             equivalent per day is permissible

          -  Concurrent malignancy requiring active treatment, except basal cell carcinoma of the
             skin, squamous cell carcinoma of the skin or carcinoma in situ

          -  Severe and active autoimmune diseases requiring systemic immunosuppression

          -  Prior organ allograft or allogeneic transplantation

          -  Other contraindication to IL-2, nivolumab, ipilimumab, or combination immunotherapy
             per treating medical oncologist

          -  Live vaccines within 30 days prior to the first dose of IL-2 and while participating
             in the trial. Examples of live vaccines include, but are not limited to, measles,
             mumps, rubella, chicken pox, yellow fever, rabies, BCG, and typhoid (oral) vaccine.
             Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally inactivated virus vaccines and
             are allowed. Intranasal influenza vaccine (eg, Flu - Mist®) is a live attenuated
             vaccine, and is not allowed.
