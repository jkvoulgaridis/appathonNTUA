    <description>The Optilume Drug Coated Balloon (DCB) is a guidewire compatible catheter with a tapered atraumatic tip. The distal end of the catheter has an inflatable balloon coated with a proprietary coating containing the drug paclitaxel that facilitates the drug's transfer to the urethral wall upon inflation.</description>
