    <textblock>
      A Phase III, prospective, multicentre, non-controlled, with consecutive participant
      enrollment in order to evaluate the efficacy, safety and duration of the effects of the
      viscosupplementation with a preparation of sodium hyaluronate 2% (SH2%) from Tedec-Meiji
      Farma S.A. over 12 months. Adult patients diagnosed with primary osteoarthritis of the knee
      according to American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria with radiological grades II and
      III according to Kellgren-Lawrence scale (KL) will receive a single injection of SH2% and
      will be followed for 1 year with follow up visits at 6 and 12 months.

      At 6 months patients could be offered a second injection whenever and when they comply with
      the criteria established for re-treatment and will be followed for additional 6 months

      Prospective, multicentre and non-controlled study. Each patient will receive a single
      injection of SH 2% and will be followed for 1 year with follow up visits at 6 and 12 months
      At 6 months follow up visit patients will be offered a second injection whenever and when
      they comply with the criteria established for re-treatment and will be followed for
      additional 6 months From the pre-inclusion V0 up to the V1 (beginning of treatment), there
      will be a wash-out period of 2 weeks during which only paracetamol will be allowed for
      osteoarthritis (OA) pain relief (maximum dose allowed:3g/day).

      Paracetamol will be discontinued at least 24h before follow up visits (Treatment
      administration, 6 months of follow up and 12 months of follow up).

      Clinical evaluation will be done every visits through VAS, WOMAC and Patient's Global
      Assessment/ Investigator's Global Assessment (PGA/IGA)

    <time_frame>6 and 12 months after treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The VAS to be used in the study consists of a horizontal line marked from 0 to 100 mm, where 0 means no pain and 100 is the greatest possible pain. Patients must draw a vertical line at the point that they believe that represents the pain intensity at that time.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in function from baseline in the target knee</measure>
    <time_frame>6 and 12 months after treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Physical function will be measured by using the function subscale of the Western Ontario &amp; McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC). This index contains 24 items on different activities of daily life grouped in three subscales: pain (5 items), stiffness (2 items), and functional capacity (17 items). For each item a horizontal visual analogue scale of 0 to 100 mm with end descriptors is used, whose path goes from no pain, no stiffness, no difficulty to extreme pain, extreme stiffness, extreme difficulty.</description>
