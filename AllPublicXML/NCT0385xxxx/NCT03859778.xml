  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The pharmacist in his professional activity may have to manage opioid dependent patients.
      This professional activity will result in the provision of opioid substitution treatment
      (OST), single-use syringes, harm reduction kits and a prevention advice for the reduction of
      toxicity and infection risks.

      Since the 1990s, the consumption of OST has been steadily increasing. According to the OFDT
      (French Observatory of Drugs and Drug Addiction), the number of patients under OST is about
      150 000 patients. Since high-dose buprenorphine is prescribed for approximately two-thirds of
      patients, it remains the most frequently prescribed OST in France.

      Recently, a French association assisting drug users (ASUD - Auto-support des usagers de
      drogues) performed a study in Paris (20/07/2018 - 25/08/2018) to assess the delivery of
      opioid replacement therapies by community pharmacists. In this study, 71% of pharmacists
      refused to deliver opioid replacement therapies. The main reasons reported were security
      (56%) and activity saturation, meaning that pharmacists considered that they had too many
      patients using opioid drugs. In France, the refusal of a pharmacist to deliver drugs is a
      punishable offence. According to the Code of ethics of pharmacists, pharmacists must respect
      life and people without discrimination. Pharmacists have a low perception of patients
      suffering from opioid addiction. Another study performed by ASUD in 93 community pharmacies,
      showed that pharmacists used the term &quot;toxicomaniacs&quot; instead of &quot;drug users&quot;. Most
      pharmacists had had a bad experience with drugs users, with physical and verbal aggressions.
      The conclusions of this study showed that pharmacists lacked knowledge of drug users and drug
      use. Pharmacists knew about harm reduction kits for opioid users (containing sterile
      syringes, needles, water, antiseptics, etc.) and had already opened them, but very few knew
      how to use them. More worryingly, some pharmacists did not understand the harm reduction
      strategies available It thus appears that community pharmacists have a difficult relationship
      with opioid-dependent patients, even though these pharmacists have received education in the
      management of addictions during their studies. Indeed, it can consider that these courses
      should help to better understand the addictive disease both in its nosological / semiological
      and therapeutic components. Thus, it would be interesting to evaluate the impact of addiction
      education on pharmacists' perception of opioid dependence. In this perspective, it would be
      interesting to focus on pharmacy students.

      The objective of this study will be to evaluate the perception by pharmacy students of opioid
      dependent patients. Investigator would like to know if pharmacy students consider opioid
      addiction to be an illness and whether having taken education on drug use and addictions
      changes this perception.

      This observational and cross-sectional study will be conducted as a survey using the REDCap
      software and the response to this survey will be done online, in real time, with an
      automatic, secure and centralized data collection (CHU Clermont-Ferrand).

      French pharmacy students will be contacted by email thanks to the student associations and
      scolarity departments. Answer to the survey will be done online.
