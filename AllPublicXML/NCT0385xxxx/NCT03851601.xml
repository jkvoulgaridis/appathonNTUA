  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Extracorporeal Photopheresis (ECP) has been used as one of the treatments for graft versus
      host disease (GVHD). Responses were observed in skin, liver, GI tract, mouth, eye and lung.
      ECP does not cause immune suppression and therefore less risk of infection or relapse of
      malignancy. However, the exact mechanism of action of this expensive procedure is not fully
      understood and no predictors of response to ECP are known so far. This reflects the need for
      a better understanding of GVHD and its response to ECP. Blood samples from 15 patients who
      receive ECP as part of the treatment of GVHD at our institution will be collected. Samples
      will be analyzed using flow cytometer
