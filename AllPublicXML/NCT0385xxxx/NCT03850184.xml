      The &quot;The Exercise in Mental Illness Questionnaire (EMIQ) - Health Practicioners Version&quot; is a
      questionnaire designed to assess the prescription behaviour of physical activity as well as
      related knowledge, barriers and exercise behaviour of mental health professionals.

      As a lot of research on prescription behaviour is done using unvalidated questionnaires we
      want to translate this validated questionnaire into German for further use in this research
      field.

      The &quot;The Exercise in Mental Illness Questionnaire (EMIQ) - Health Practicioners Version&quot; is a
      questionnaire designed to assess the prescription behaviour of physical activity as well as
      related knowledge, barriers and exercise behaviour of mental health professionals.

      As a lot of research on prescription behaviour is done using unvalidated questionnaires we
      want to translate this validated questionnaire into German for further use in this research
      field. Therefore we plan to translate the questionnaire in accordance to established
      questionnaire translation guidelines.

      Then we plan to validate the questionnaire in a sample of about 30 mental health
      professionals (psychiatrists, psychologists, nurses) currently working with patients with
      mental disorders. We plan to evaluate re-test-reliability using repeated measurement within 7
      days.
