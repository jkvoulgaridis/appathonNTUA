    <textblock>
      Algorithms for neonatal resuscitation adapted to low resource settings include HR evaluation
      by auscultation or umbilical cord palpation at about one minute of life.

      Previous studies conducted in high resource settings showed that auscultation of the
      precordium is more accurate than umbilical palpation to assess HR of healthy infants at
      birth.The last versions of the American Heart Association and the European Resuscitation
      Council Guidelines on Neonatal resuscitation suggest that &quot;during resuscitation of term and
      preterm newborns, the use of 3-lead ECG for the rapid and accurate measurement of the
      newborn's heart rate may be reasonable&quot;. However, this remains a weak recommendation with a
      very-low-quality evidence.

      In low resource countries, a stethoscope is rarely available and palpation of the umbilical
      pulse is the method used for detecting HR. Although this is preferable to other palpation
      sites (i.e. femo-ral and brachial artery), there is a high likelihood of underestimating HR
      with palpation of the umbilical pulse in healthy infants.

      The accuracy of assessing HR by auscultation and umbilical palpation in newborn infants
      requir-ing resuscitation remains unknown.

      To the investigator's knowledge, there are not previous studies that have compared the
      accuracy of HR estima-tion by auscultation vs. umbilical palpation in newborn infants needing
      resuscitation This study was designed to compare two different methods (auscultation and
      umbilical cord pal-pation) of HR estimation in newborn infants needing resuscitation, in
      order to determine which method is most suitable for use in clinical practice.
