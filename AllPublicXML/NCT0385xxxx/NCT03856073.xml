  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this self-control experiment, anesthesiologists without experiment of bronchoscopy working
      in anesthesiology department in Peking Union Medical College Hospital will receive a training
      and evaluation procedure in simulation and clinical practice about clinical airway
      management. The objects was (1) to investigate the improvements of manufacturing bronchoscopy
      in simulation and clinical practice before and after training on simulation, (2) to record
      the study curve and efforts trainees needed to achieve proficiency and self-confidence on
      simulation, (3) to record the curve of manufacturing from skilled to unskilled, (4)to
      evaluate if status manufacturing on simulations could reflect the ones in clinical practice.

      A modified global rating scale from 1 (unskilled) to 5 (expert) with a score of 3 linked to
      proficiency, and 5-points Likert from 1 (felt extremely unsure) to 5 (felt extremely
      confidence) with a score of 4 linked to confidence were used to evaluate during the procedure
      of training and evaluation.
