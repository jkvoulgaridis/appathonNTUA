  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The project sets out to compare two different splints in the outcome of zone II flexor tendon
      injury hand therapy rehabilitation programme. Traditional hand therapy is based on using a
      long forearm-based splint for 6 weeks in zone II flexor tendon injuries. Manchester
      University NHS Foundation Trust have devised a new shorter splint to use as an alternative to
      the traditional longer splint as there are cogent reasons for believing that permitting more
      wrist movement during rehabilitation will improve the range of finger movement ultimately
      (tendonesis effects).

      Patients will be randomised to receive either the traditional long splint, or the short
      splint. Patients will be followed up and data will be collected at routine hand therapy
      appointments.
