      This is a non-pharmacological pilot study showing the improvement of a SMR/theta
      neurofeedback training program on cognitive performance and EEG activity in Elderly with Mild
      Cognitive Impairment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Neurofeedback training (NF) as self-regulation method of brain activity, may be beneficial in
      elderly with mild cognitive impairment. In this pilot study, the investigators studied
      whether a sensorimotor(SMR)/theta NF training could improve cognitive performance and brain
      electrical activity in a sample group of elderly patients with mild cognitive impairment.
      Twenty participants performed an electroencephalography recording, a battery of
      neuropsychological tests before the neurofeedback training program (T0), following the
      neurofeedback training program (T1) and 1-month follow-up (T2).

    <description>A sensorimotor/theta neurofeedback training consisted of 20 individuals sessions, twice a week during 11 weeks maximum. For each subject, NF was planned and conducted by a neuropsychologist experienced in neurophysiology an neurofeedback. Each session lasted 1h10 minutes and was conducted as follows:
Preparation and installation of the electrodes, verification of the impedance, adjustement of the calibration.
NF training (tasks and video described below)(45minutes)
Feedback and debriefing about the session (15 minutes)</description>

    <description>The intervention consisted to increase the synaptic strengths and sensitivity within this network. Electroencephalography signals for SMR/theta training was recorded at channel Cz according to the international 10-20 system. Theta rhythm was also recorded and, in this case, SMR was stimulated while theta waves were suppressed.A 32 channels system (EEGDigitrcak Biofeedback plus module, Inc Elmiko Medical) was used for the SMR/theta Neurofeedback training.</description>
