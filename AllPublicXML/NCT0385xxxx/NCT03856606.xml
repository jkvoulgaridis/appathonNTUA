  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of interrupting prolong sedentary
      behavior with interval exercise on postprandial metabolism following a high fat glucose
      tolerance test.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All subjects complete two trials in a randomized crossover design, with each trial occurring
      over 4 days with a minimum of seven days between trials. The first two days of each trial
      serve as a control period allowing for familiarization and the control of physical activity
      and calorie consumption prior to the intervention. Following each control period, subjects
      then perform one of the interventions on Day 3. The interventions consist of either
      eight-hours of prolonged sitting, or eight hours of sitting interrupted every hour by five
      sprints lasting 4 seconds each using the interval exercise. On day 4, all subjects will
      undergo a high fat glucose tolerance test to determine the body's ability to clear
      triglycerides from the blood as well as insulin/glucose response and substrate oxidation.
      Blood samples will be assayed for the previously mentioned substances and postprandial gas
      collection will be analyzed via indirect calorimetry.

    <description>Subjects will have a 2-day control period during which step count and diet will be controlled for and recreated for the other trial. Following this 2-day period, they will undergo a prolonged sit which with will be broken up every hour on the hour by a small bout of interval exercise. Day 4 will consist of the lipid tolerance test to determine the ability of the body to clear triglycerides.</description>
