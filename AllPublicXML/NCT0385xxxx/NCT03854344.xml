      Donor site pain study comparing post-operative donor site pain and opioid consumption after
      use of Lidocaine or Liposomal Bupivicaine for split thickness skin graft harvesting in
      patients with less than 20% TBSA burn wounds and less than %5 Deep partial or full thickness
      burn wounds.

      This study is a prospective, randomized controlled trial. Study subjects are blinded to their
      randomization to avoid bias. The control group will undergo split thickness autografting
      using the standard protocol, involving injection of lidocaine with epinephrine at the donor
      site. The experimental group will undergo injection of liposomal bupivacaine (Exparel) at the
      time of harvest of the skin graft. Baseline pain levels will be obtained for all subjects
      using a validated pain assessment scale. Postoperatively, time to first opioid pain
      medication (excluding immediate postoperative recovery from anesthesia), total opioid
      consumption on a daily basis, and donor site interval pain scores using a validated pain
      assessment scale will be obtained. The experimental group will then be compared to the
      control group to determine if there is a significant difference in pain levels, time to first
      opioid, and overall opioid consumption between the two groups.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>A measurement of post operative pain involving skin graft donor site using visual analog scale (VAS) ranging 0-10, at 8 hours post-operatively</measure>
    <time_frame>The subject completes a pain assessment at 8 hours post-operatively.</time_frame>
    <description>Pain score involving skin graft donor sites are measured using a Visual Analog Scale, which is a horizontal line numbered 0-10, with 10 being the worst pain imaginable and 0 indicating no pain and compare pain scores between donor sites treated with Exparel Vs Lidocaine</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Opioid pain medication consumption up to 72 hours post-operatively will be compared between the subjects who are given liposomal bupivacaine (Exparel) and lidocaine at the donor sites</measure>
    <time_frame>72 hours (3 days) post operatively</time_frame>
    <description>Opioid consumption will be measured by converting all opioids given to subjects to morphine equivalents</description>

    <measure>Pain Scores over 72 hours after surgery</measure>
    <time_frame>Pain scores associated with skin graft donor site will be assessed using Visual Analog Scale (0-10) at 4,8, 12, 24, 48 and 72 hours after surgery. They will be compared between two groups.</time_frame>
