      Objective: To evaluate the post-hysterectomy vault prolapse (PHVP) rates performed using
      different methods of vaginal total hysterectomy (VTH).

      Methods: A computer search identified a total of 251 women who underwent VTH with/without
      concomitant surgeries between January 1986 and December 2001 in a single center. Thirty-eight
      women were excluded due to not only a vaginal approach. Of the remaining 213 women, 129 and
      84 underwent VTH via the Tsuzi method with residual uterine ligament ligation (ligations
      group) and traditional VTH (without ligations group), respectively. The χ2 and Mann-Whitney U
      tests were applied to compare the data. The cumulative percentages of women without PHVP were
      calculated over time and compared using Kaplan-Meier curves and log-rank tests. A p value of
      less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

        Between January 1986 and December 2001, all women who received VTH with or without other
        combined operations at National Taiwan University Hospital were recruited. In September
        2016, a retrospective chart review was performed.
