    <textblock>
      The present study evaluates the functional relations of pelvic floor, diaphragm, and torso
      muscles, their variation and correlations with urinary incontinence while separately training
      physical characteristics of the mentioned muscles in men after radical prostatectomy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During the last two decades, the connection between pelvic floor muscles (PFM) and abdominal
      muscles or diaphragm has been detected: PFM contract and relax during the inhalation and
      exhalation in pace with the diaphragm; the activity of the PFM increases with the increase of
      intra-abdominal pressure during forced exhalations or cough. The role of pelvic floor is
      essential for the synergy of diaphragm and abdominal muscles in maintenance of
      intra-abdominal pressure. According to the aforementioned physiological functional
      relationships, the investigators have postulated a hypothesis that diaphragm muscles training
      and abdominal muscles training could have similar effect as direct PFM training on pelvic
      floor muscles strength and pelvic floor muscles endurance measured using perineometer in men
      after radical prostatectomy.
