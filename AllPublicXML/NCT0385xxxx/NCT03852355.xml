    <textblock>
      Rheumatoid arthritis is a common type of autoimmune arthritis that is characterized by
      inflammation of the synovial membranes. Even though any joint can be affected by the disease,
      cervical spine is often affected, and cervical pain is reported by 40-88% of RA patients,
      Cervical spine involvement is a feature of long-lasting disease, where atlantoaxial impaction
      with odontoid process vertical subluxation through the foramen magnum being one of the
      greatest and dangerous complications

      To our knowledge the effectiveness of 3rd occipital nerve blocks in managing chronic upper
      neck pain, headache in RA patients is not measured yet, so we aimed at assessing the the
      effectiveness of 3rd occipital nerve blocks in headache management in RA patients who used
      other medical agents and to compare the results with those of the patients who used only 3rd
      occipital nerve pulsed radiofrequancy on clinical and radiographic bases.
