    <textblock>
      This study aims to examine the efficacy of using Information Communication Technology (ICT)
      to deliver brief Motivational Interviewing (BMI) to promote regular physical activity among
      Hong Kong Chinese childhood cancer survivors.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A substantial body of evidence has indicated that improved childhood cancer survival has
      inevitably been accompanied by increased chronic physical problems and adverse psychological
      late-effects of cancer and its treatment. The frequently reported physiological and
      psychological sequelae included cancer-related fatigue, reduced muscle strength, decreases in
      functional capacity, activity intolerance, depression and distorted self-esteem, which in
      turn severely comprises their quality of life.

      There is a growing body of evidence highlighting the beneficial effects of physical activity
      on the physiological and psychological health of childhood cancer survivors. Particularly,
      substantial evidence reveals that engaging in regular moderate-intensity physical activity
      can help ameliorate some of the treatment-related adverse effects experienced by childhood
      cancer survivors, such as reduce cancer-related fatigue, enhance muscle strength, improve
      cardiovascular fitness and eventually lead to a better quality of life.

      Evidence demonstrates that education alone is insufficient or unlikely to change behavior.
      Motivational interviewing (MI) is a directive, client-centered counseling strategy which
      differs from prevailing patient education to support clients to explore and resolve their
      ambivalence about changing their behaviors. Meanwhile, there is an increase in the use of
      Information Communication Technology (ICT) for health care delivery and health promotion.
      Using instant messaging (i.e. WhatsApp or WeChat) allows quick, direct and continuing
      professional advice and support for the parents to promote their child's level of physical
      activity. Therefore, the aim of this study is to examine the efficacy of using ICT to deliver
      BMI to promote regular physical activity among Hong Kong Chinese childhood cancer survivors.

Parents will then receive a face-to-face BMI to motivate their children to engage in regular physical activity. Parents will also be encouraged to motivate their children to intensify their physical activity levels progressively, with the ultimate goal of achieving the Global Recommendations on Physical Activity on Health suggested by the World Health Organization.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        The Inclusion Criteria for eligible Hong Kong Chinese childhood cancer survivals are as
        follows:

          -  Aged 9 to 16 years;

          -  Able to speak Cantonese and read Chinese;

          -  Had completed cancer treatment at least six months previously; and

          -  currently do not engage in regular physical exercise.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The investigators will exclude childhood cancer survivors with evidence of recurrence
             or second malignancies, and those with physical impairment or cognitive and learning
             problems identified from their medical records.

        Additionally, parents (either father or mother; the primary caregiver of childhood cancer
        survivors) must be able to:

          -  Speak Cantonese and read Chinese,

          -  Use a smartphone and can use an instant messaging tool (e.g., WhatsApp/WeChat); and

          -  Are willing to receive health promotion advice and interact with our interventionist
             via WhatsApp/WeChat on a smartphone throughout the study period.
