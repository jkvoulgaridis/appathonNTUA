  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple Sclerosis (ME) is a degenerative, inflammatory and autoimmune demyelinating disease
      of the central nervous system, characterized by demyelination due to inflammation and
      degeneration of the myelin sheaths enveloping nerves of the eye, periventricular grey matter,
      brain, spinal cord and brainstem. The symptoms associated with MS include symptomatic
      fatigue, muscle weakness, ataxia, mobility and balance problems or cognitive problems.
      Moderate intensity strength training has been shown to improve strength and mobility in
      persons with MS. It was suggested that whole-body vibration training (WBVT) is effective to
      improve muscle strength, such as resistance training, resulting from both neural and
      structural adaptations. On the other hand, traditional strength training in hypoxia has
      garnered much attention. This method has shown improvements in isometric strength and
      increases in muscle size.

      -  Crossover.

        -  13 patients with multiple sclerosis were recruited.

        -  Patients performed two sessions: whole-body vibration training in normoxia condition and
           whole-body vibration in hypoxia condition.
