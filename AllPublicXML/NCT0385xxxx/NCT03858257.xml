  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to test the hypothesis that using high flow nasal
      oxygen improves ventilation during cardiac implantable electronic device procedures performed
      with conscious sedation. A randomized controlled trial design will be used with participants
      randomized in a 1:1 ratio to oxygen supplementation through a standard facemask or high flow
      nasal oxygen.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      High flow nasal oxygen (HFNO) is increasingly regarded as a promising technology for oxygen
      delivery in critical care and anesthetic management. Although promising, further high-quality
      studies examining the effects of using HFNO during procedural sedation are required to inform
      decision-making regarding implementation of this new technology into practice. The 2018
      guidelines from the American Society of Anesthesiology stated that there is insufficient
      evidence regarding which methods of supplemental oxygen administration (e.g., nasal cannula,
      face mask, or specialized devices such as HFNO) are more effective. This trial will address
      this limitation in the evidence base specifically in regard to the efficacy of using HFNO
      during conscious sedation in the cardiac catheterisation laboratory.

    <description>Percentage of hemoglobin saturated with oxygen (SpO2) will be measured continuously throughout procedures as part of routine clinical practice through the anaesthetic machine. This is a composite measure comprising the incidence, depth, and duration of oxygen desaturation events. Area under SpO2 90% oxygen desaturation curve is calculated as the difference between the threshold (90%) and actual oxygen saturation (SpO2) summed every second during which oxygen saturation was below threshold.</description>

    <description>The gas temperature will commence at the 'High' setting (ranges 30-32ยบ Celsius) and titrated downwards if the patient complains of irritation. The gas flow rate will commence at 30 liters per minute prior to sedation administration and be titrated up to 70 liters per minute as tolerated by the patient after sedation has been administered. The fraction of oxygen in the gas will be commenced at 50% (same as that delivered from 6 liters per minute via facemask) and can be titrated upward according to patient requirements (i.e. increased if there is evidence of hypoventilation, airway obstruction or inadequate oxygenation, decreased during use of diathermy). Anesthesia Assistants at the site will be provided with training in the use of this mode of oxygen delivery prior to study commencement.</description>
