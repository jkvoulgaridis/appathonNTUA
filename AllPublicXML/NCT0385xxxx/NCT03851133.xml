  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to partner with individuals known or suspected to have pancreatic
      cancer to build a biobank dedicated to minimizing disparities and personalizing care for
      individuals affected by pancreatic cancer. A biobank is a resource that involves collection,
      processing and storage of blood, other bodily fluids, and tissue.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Doctors, researchers, and patient advocates from numerous institutions throughout the state
      of Florida have formed a partnership known as the Florida Pancreas Collaborative. The goals
      of the Florida Pancreas Collaborative team are to find better ways to diagnose and treat
      pancreatic cancer and improve quality of life. Recent research suggests that pancreatic
      cancer affects people of various racial and ethnic groups differently, with some groups
      having more aggressive disease and a poorer prognosis than other groups.

      In this research study, the investigators want to partner with individuals known or suspected
      to have pancreatic cancer to build a 'biobank' dedicated to minimizing disparities and
      personalizing care for individuals affected by pancreatic cancer. A biobank is a valuable
      resource that involves collection, processing, and storage of blood, other bodily fluids, and
      tissue (obtained during biopsy or surgery) to improve the investigator's understanding of
      health and disease. When combined with information and medical images obtained through
      routine care, the investigators will be able to investigate biological processes that may
      underlie differences and poor outcomes and target them with more effective therapeutic
      strategies tailored to the individual.

    <ipd_description>Investigators requesting to use Florida Pancreas Collaborative (FPC) data, images, and/or biospecimens will need to submit a written proposal to the FPC biobank utilization committee. Decisions will be based on scientific merit, specimen availability, experience of the requesting investigator, and resources to conduct proposed methods. De-identified samples and/or data will be released if the concept receives approval and after scientific review committee and IRB approval is obtained, conflict of interests are checked, and a material transfer agreement is established. Intellectual property issues will need to be agreed upon. If access is granted, the biobank utilization committee may monitor the Investigator's Research studies to ensure appropriate use of the biospecimens and/or data. The Investigator shall provide a written summary of their research findings and reference this funding source in future manuscripts and presentations.</ipd_description>

    <ipd_access_criteria>Data and specimens will be shared with researchers interested in this topic area who wish to pursue analyses that may be descriptive, analytic, molecular, or correlative in nature. The access criteria used to share IPD and any additional supporting information will involve a formal process which involves submitting a written proposal to the FPC biobank utilization committee. Decisions will be based on scientific merit, specimen availability, experience of the requesting investigator, and resources to conduct proposed methods. Samples and/or data will be released if the concept receives approval and after scientific review committee and IRB approval is obtained, conflict of interests (COI) are checked, a material transfer agreement is established between institutions, and intellectual property issues are agreed upon. The release of data will be based on the nature of the request and can represent aggregate or individual-level data.</ipd_access_criteria>
