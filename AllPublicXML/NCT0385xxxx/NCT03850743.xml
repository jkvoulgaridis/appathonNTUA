      This is an observational, prospective study that will leverage existing Standard of Care
      (SOC) patient reported outcomes (PRO) and Electronic Medical Record (EMR) data and collect
      additional Pain Rating Scale (PRS) data and blood samples from patients who consent to be in
      the study. Active duty service members and DEERS eligible patients who are injured and/or
      will undergo elective orthopaedic surgery are the target population.

    <textblock>
      Sleep problems and pain, both acute and chronic, are common among military service members,
      reducing quality of life and military readiness. Evidence indicates sleep problems more
      strongly predict future acute and chronic pain than vice versa. This same pattern is also
      seen in the perioperative period, with sleep problems strongly predicting long-term post
      surgical pain. Though tightly linked, underlying biological mechanisms of the sleep-pain
      relationship in the perioperative period have yet to be identified, and treatment targets
      remain unknown. However, new technologies and methods in the areas of biomarker research
      (mRNA, microRNA, cytokine expression), as well as research describing psychosocial and
      clinical correlates, may help to identify patients most at-risk for long-term post-surgical
      sleep problems and pain, as well as identify new treatment targets.To address this research
      gap, the present observational study aims to collect four blood-samples from patients
      undergoing orthopedic surgeries at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center (WRNMMC)
      (N=240), both prior to and in the months following surgery, Additionally, patient reported
      outcomes, using the NIH's Patient Reported Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS),
      are collected as standard of care in the surgical clinics prior to surgery and for several
      years post-surgery. PROMIS scales cover a range of psychosocial (e.g., anxiety, depression,
      anger, social satisfaction, social isolation) and physical (e.g., fatigue, physical function)
      predictors. Through partnerships with the Defense and Veterans Center for Integrative Pain
      Management (USU), and WRNMMC Department of Orthopedic Surgery, the investigators will
      identify serum biomarkers (microRNA, cytokine expression) associated with pain and
      sleep-related outcomes prior to and in the months following surgery, as well as the role of
      psychosocial and clinical predictors, e.g. anxiety, depression, physical functioning, social
      functioning, opioid use) in outcomes. The long-term goal of this study are to understand
      risks for negative post-surgical outcomes, as well as help pave the way for future efforts to
      identify and test therapeutic interventions. Through this research, not only can the findings
      be used to improve surgical outcomes, but also increase quality of life among service members
      and force readiness.

    <description>To determine the biomarkers (microRNA, mRNA, proinflammatory cytokines) associated with the presence (risk-related) or absence (resilience related) of sleep dysregulation and pain prior to surgery. To determine the biomarkers associated with increases/maintenance (risk-related) and decreases (resilience-related) of sleep dysregulation and pain chronification after surgery. Protein Biomarker Analysis: The cytokine expression analysis will be done using the Human Inflammatory Cytokines Multi-Analyte ELISArray Kit. The cytokines and chemokines to be tested with this array include IL1α, IL1β, IL2, IL4, IL6, IL8, IL10, IL12, IL17A, IFNγ, TNFα, and GM-CSF (Qiagen Inc.). For this analysis, we will use 50ul of serum samples along with the 50ul of assay buffer which will be loaded in the ELISA strips.</description>
