  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Osteaoarticular infection due to C. acnes are known to be of late onset, causing chronic
      infection possibly pauci-symptomatic. Osteaoarticular infection due to C. acnes represents a
      diagnostic challenge, since C. acnes is slow and difficult to grow, and can also be
      considered a contaminant.A 16S universal PCR bacteriological diagnosis has been proposed but
      is lacking of sensitivity. A specific C. acnes PCR was developed in 2010, but is not used
      routinely.
