    <textblock>
      This is a 9-week pilot randomized controlled trial utilizing bibliotherapy compared with
      usual care to investigate the effect of bibliotherapy on caregiving appraisal of informal
      caregivers of people with dementia.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: China is one of the countries with the highest number of people with dementia
      (PWD), while over 90% of PWD are cared by informal caregivers in the community. Informal
      caregivers are found to have higher level of stress, and lower level of well-being than
      non-caregivers. However, positive outcomes of caregiving have also been noted. Caregiving
      appraisal is caregivers' cognitive evaluation of potential caregiving stressors and the
      efficacy of their coping efforts related to caregiving experience. Based on Lawton's
      Caregiving Appraisal and Psychological Well-being Model, caregiving appraisal is an important
      factor that leads to the positive or negative well-being outcomes of caregivers. Addressing
      the caregiving appraisal of informal caregiver may be able to help in promoting the caregiver
      well-being and delay premature institutionalization. Intervention for improving dementia
      caregiving appraisal is still scarce, especially in China. Bibliotherapy is the process of
      learning from high-quality written materials for therapeutic benefits, it has been proved to
      be effective in improving caregiving appraisal of informal caregivers of people with
      psychosis and depression, its effect on dementia caregivers is unsure.

      Objectives: There are two research objectives in this study: (1) To determine the feasibility
      of the evidence-based bibliotherapy protocol on improving caregiving appraisal of informal
      caregivers of PWD in China. (2) To explore the efficacy of bibliotherapy on caregiving
      appraisal, coping, positive aspects of caregiving and psychological well-being for informal
      caregivers of PWD in China.

      Methods:

      Sixty participants will be recruited from six communities in Zhengzhou, China, and will be
      randomly allocated to either the intervention group or usual care group. The feasibility of
      the intervention will be explored in terms of the ease of participant recruitment, attendance
      rate and the attrition rate. The Chinese version of Caregiving Appraisal Scale, the Chinese
      version of Ways of Coping Questionnaire, the Chinese version of Positive Aspects of
      Caregiving Scale, and the Chinese version of Ryff's Psychological Well-being Scale will be
      used to measure caregiving appraisal, coping, positive aspects of caregiving and
      psychological well-being of informal caregivers of PWD respectively. Intention-to-treat
      approach will be adopted for analysis. Descriptive statistics, Chi-square test, Mann Whitney
      U test, and independent t-test will be used to describe the participants' characteristics and
      compare the difference between groups at baseline. Regression analysis will be used to
      compare the intervention efficacy outcomes with usual care group by controlling the baseline
      difference.

    <description>To be measured with the Chinese version of Caregiving Appraisal Scale (CAS). The Chinese version of CAS includes 26 items, divided into 4 subscales: caregiving burden, caregiving satisfaction, caregiving mastery, and caregiving impact. This is a 5 point Likert scale (1 = disagree a lot to 5 = agree a lot), with higher scores indicate more positive caregiving appraisal. The Cronbach's α for each subscale was 0.68~0.87.</description>

    <description>To be measured with the Chinese version of Ways of Coping Questionnaire. This questionnaire includes 20 items, divided into 2 subscales: the active coping subscale and the passive coping subscale. It is a 4 point Likert scale (0 = never to 3 = often). The Cronbach's α was 0.90, αs for the two subscales were 0.89 and 0.78.</description>

    <description>To be measured with the shorter Chinese version for Ryff's Psychological Well-being Scale. This scale includes 18 items, and is divided into 6 subscales: positive relations with others, autonomy, environmental mastery, personal growth, purpose in life and self-acceptance. This scale is a Likert 6 point scale, with 1 = strongly disagree to 6 = totally agree, higher scores indicate better psychological well-being. The scale has been tested in middle-aged and older people, the Cronbach's α was 0.92 for the total scale, and at least 0.60 for each subscale.</description>

    <measure>Changes in positive aspects of caregiving</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline, immediate post intervention</time_frame>
    <description>To be measured with the Chinese version of Positive Aspects of Caregiving (C-PAC) Scale. It is a Likert 5 point scale ranging from 0 (strongly disagree) to 4 (strongly agree) regarding the extent to which providing care to their relatives with dementia had enabled them &quot;feel important&quot;, &quot;feel appreciated&quot; etc. The scale has 11 items, divided into two subscales: enriching life and affirming self. The Cronbach's α was 0.89 for the total scale, the αs for enriching life and affirming self subscales were 0.85 and 0.84 respectively.</description>

    <description>Participants will receive bibliotherapy without withdrawing from the usual care. They will be asked to read the designated manual (consists of nine chapters) within a recommended period of time (over 9 weeks). Weekly telephone follow-up will also be provided to figure out participants understanding, find out the unsolved problems and guide them for finding out the solution by themselves.</description>

    <description>Bibliotherapy is the use of reading materials for therapeutic benefits. In this study, an evidence-based modified manual will be used as the reading material. The manual adopts the self-directed problem-solving approach to dementia caregiving, examples of how other caregivers solve the specific problem for each chapter is included in the corresponding chapter. Bibliotherapy also involves guided learning by reading written information, enabling caregivers to solve their caregiving problems &quot;step-by-step&quot;, so telephone coach is designed to figure out participants understanding, find out the unsolved problems and guide them for finding out the solution by themselves.</description>
