  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People who experience high levels of worry often have mental habits that fuel their worry.
      One mental habit of interest to researchers is the tendency to assess situations and
      experiences in a very negative way even when it is possible the situation may turn out to be
      neutral or even positive. Cognitive bias modification of interpretations (CBM-I) is a
      training that is designed to target the tendency to catastrophize and jump to negative
      conclusions when faced with ambiguous information. CBM-I has been shown to improve this habit
      as well as anxiety and low mood. In this experiment, the investigators are looking to enhance
      CBM-I for pathological worry. Specifically, the investigators are testing the immediate and
      short-term effects of using imagery when completing CBM-I.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In pathological worry, the tendency to assess situations and experiences in a very negative
      way even when it is possible the situation may turn out to be neutral or even positive is
      suggested to fuel worry. This type of &quot;mental habit&quot; can maintain worry and cause people a
      lot of distress. Cognitive bias modification of interpretations (CBM-I) involves repeatedly
      and actively listening to descriptions of ambiguous scenarios that resolve in a benign
      fashion. CBM-I has shown promise at reducing the tendency to make negative interpretations
      when presented with ambiguous information as well as improving worry and low mood. However,
      further research is needed to optimize the protocol for individuals who engage in
      pathological worry. One such way to improve the task is using imagery. In this
      proof-of-concept experiment, the investigators are looking at whether having participants use
      imagery while practicing CBM-I for one week leads to greater improvements in worry and
      worry-related processes compared to the standard protocol without imagery instructions and
      compared to a neutral control condition. This study will also investigate dosage effects of
      CBM-I training by investigating changes in worry over the intervention period using a daily
      diary assessment.

      Potential participants will be asked to complete a telephone screen. Those who meet
      eligibility criteria will be invited to our laboratory at Ryerson University. After
      completing pre-intervention outcome measures, participants will be randomly assigned to one
      of three conditions: (1) a condition where people imagine themselves in scenarios they listen
      to; (2) a condition where people listen to the scenarios without instruction to use imagery;
      and (3) a condition in which people listen to passages of non-emotional situations.
      Participants will be asked to complete their respective training for 7 days (60
      scenarios/day). There will be two follow-up visits; one after participants complete their
      training and another two weeks following completion of the training. All of the outcome
      measures will be assessed pre-intervention, post-intervention and at the 2-week follow-up.
      Past week worry will also be assessed at a 1-week follow-up via a link that will be emailed.
      During the 1-week intervention period participants will also track their worry 3 times per
      day via a link that will be emailed to them.

      The present experiment will provide answers to important questions about the therapeutic
      potential of imagery enhanced CBM compared to standard CBM for pathological worry. Moreover,
      this study will shed light on dosing effects of the intervention.

    <intervention_model_description>Baseline (pre-intervention) outcome measures will be completed at the first visit to our lab at Ryerson University. Participants will then be randomly assigned to one of the following conditions: (1) imagery CBM-I, (2) standard CBM-I (i.e., no instruction to use imagery), or (3) a neutral control condition. The participants will then practice their respective training at home for 7 days (60 scenarios/day). During this at-home training period, participants will track their worry three times per day. All the outcome measures will be reassessed at post-intervention, and 2-week follow-up. Worry will also be assessed at 1-week follow-up.</intervention_model_description>

          1. Score of 62 or higher on the Penn State Worry Questionnaire.

          2. Endorsement of symptoms of Generalized Anxiety Disorder (e.g., excessive and
             uncontrollable worry) as per the DSM-5 description (American Psychiatric Association,
             2013).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Clinically significant suicidal ideation, intent, or plan

          2. Past or current history of psychosis, bipolar disorder, or substance or alcohol use
             disorder over the past 12 months

          3. Current psychological treatment or counseling unless this treatment is infrequent
             (once per month or less) or the participant has been receiving consistent weekly
             treatment for at least 12 weeks and still meets all other eligibility criteria

          4. Psychotropic medication with a change in dose in the past 12 weeks. If they have
             recently discontinued a psychotropic medication, they will be included if it has been
             at least 1 month since discontinuation, or 3 months if they had been taking
             fluoxetine. Use of benzodiazepines in the past 12 weeks will also exclude
             participants.

          5. Participants will be excluded if they report noncorrected hearing impairments as the
             training involves listening to audio recordings.

          6. Participants will be excluded if they do not have daily access to a computer with
             internet as this is required to complete the at home training.
