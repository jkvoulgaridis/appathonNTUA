      Primary Objective:

      The primary objective of this study is to assess the efficacy of 18F-DCFPyL PET-CT for
      initial staging of prostate cancer in Veterans compared to conventional imaging (99mTc-MDP
      bone scan and Diagnostic CT or MRI). The primary clinical endpoint of our study is the
      percent of Veterans with prostate cancer in which the 18F-DCFPyL PET-CT identifies M1 disease
      at initial staging.

      Secondary Objectives:

      Frequency of the change in primary treatment plan after initial staging.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single arm Phase II clinical trial in Veterans with prostate cancer, no prior local
      therapy, who are at risk of having metastatic disease (PSA greater than 10, or Gleason Score
      greater than or equal to 4+3, or clinical stage greater than or equal to T2c). Veterans who
      are planned to undergo or have recently undergone conventional, routine care initial staging
      scans for prostate cancer (99mTc-MDP or NaF PET bone scan and diagnostic CT or MRI of pelvis)
      will also receive a 18F-DCFPyL PET-CT scan. The primary endpoint is the percent of Veterans
      with prostate cancer in which the 18F-DCFPyL PET-CT scan identifies evidence of M1 disease at
      initial staging.

             uncontrolled infection.

          2. The subject has a condition or situation that, in the investigator's opinion, may put
             the subject at significant risk, may confound the study results, or may interfere
             significantly with subject's participation in the study.

          3. Primary small cell carcinoma of the prostate.

          4. Participation in this study significantly delay the scheduled standard of care
             therapy.
