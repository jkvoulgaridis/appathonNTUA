      This study evaluates the diagnostic value of the addition of indocyanine green and near
      infrared fluorescence imaging during laparoscopy in patients with suspected endometriosis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Endometriosis is a public health problem with an increasing incidence and various symptoms.
      Surgical treatment reliefs pain and improves fertility by radically removing endometriotic
      lesions. However, peritoneal endometriotic lesions may vary significantly in their appearance
      in standard white light laparoscopy and therefore may be difficult to be identified. Because
      endometriosis is associated with hypervascularisation the visualization of tissue perfusion
      by additional use of near infrared (NIR) fluorescence imaging with indocyanine green (ICG)
      may improve the detection of peritoneal endometriotic lesions.

    <description>NIR fluorescence imaging is performed after white light laparoscopy. 0.3mg/kg bodyweight of ICG is administered i.v. All suspected lesions are removed and labeled whether they are seen in WL or NIR imaging or both. Evaluation is performed after the histological analysis of the lesions.</description>

    <description>Indocyanine green is administered intra-venous after dilution with water in a peripheral vein at a dosage of 0.3mg/kg body weight as a bolus injection. The injection will take place during surgery. By using NIR fluorescence imaging ICG is made visible.</description>
