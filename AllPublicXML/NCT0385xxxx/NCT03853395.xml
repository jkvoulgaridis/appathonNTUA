  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      TNFi drugs remain the most prescribed first-line biologics for patients with rheumatoid
      arthritis (RA) and Psoriatic Arthritis (PsA). However, up to 40% of RA patients fail to
      respond to TNFi treatment. One explanation of non-response is the development of anti-drug
      antibodies and low drug levels.

      Studies have consistently shown that:

        1. Drug levels of monoclonal antibodies (e.g. adalimumab/certolizumab) and the presence of
           anti-drug antibodies in samples taken at 3 and 6 months correlate with 12 month
           response.

        2. Non-responders and those who develop anti-drug antibodies are less likely to receive
           concomitant methotrexate or, if they do receive it, are on lower doses than responder
           groups.

      However, it has not been proven that knowing that a patient has low drug levels or anti-drug
      antibodies improves the outcome; neither has it been shown that introducing or increasing the
      dose of methotrexate would reduce the formation of anti-drug antibodies, thereby improving
      outcome. Observational data has revealed that RA non-responders, who exhibit adequate serum
      drug levels and no detectable anti-drug antibodies, have lower probability of response to
      another agent with the same mechanism of action (MOA). RA and PsA non-responders, who have
      low detectable serum trough levels and detectable anti-drug antibodies, may benefit in
      switching to a less immunogenic drug. The next essential step, therefore, is to prove that
      introducing these tests improves clinical outcome.

      The proposed trial is a clinical feasibility trial with the aim to ensure a realistic
      assessment and capability to conduct the full clinical trial. Participants with RA or PsA,
      commencing adalimumab or certolizumab will be randomised to determine whether providing test
      results on trough drug levels and anti-drug antibodies at 4 weeks, 3 and 6 months to
      clinicians caring for patients with RA or PsA (n=15 patients) starting treatment with
      adalimumab/certolizumab, improves the course of disease activity, compared to standard care
      (n=15 patients). Clinicians will be provided with feedback and a treatment algorithm. The
      feasibility of the study will be assessed by a number of factors including evaluation of
      recruitment, attrition, data completeness and process evaluation.
