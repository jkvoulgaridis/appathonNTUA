  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall aim of this feasibility study is to develop new technologies for improved
      detection of Barrett's neoplasia using the scanning fiber endoscope (SFE) imaging system.
      This study will combine the use of a fluorescent-labeled peptide dimer that bind specifically
      to pre-cancerous mucosa in the esophagus for use as a novel imaging agent to guide endoscopic
      biopsy or endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR). This Phase 1B study will be used to provide
      early evidence of efficacy for the topical application of a peptide dimer that binds to
      molecular targets, including EGFR and HER2, that are specific for esophageal dysplasia. A
      dimer is needed because cancer in the esophagus is genetically heterogeneous. QRH binds
      specifically to Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR), and KSP binds specifically to Human
      Epithelial Growth Factor Receptor (HER2). The study will look at peptide binding in subjects
      with known or suspected Barrett's esophagus.
