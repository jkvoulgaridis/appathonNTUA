  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a piolt single-arm trial of Jiu-wei-zhen-xiao Granule, extracted from nine kinds of
      Chinese medicnie, for the treatment in patients with advanced, unresectable hepatocellular
      carcinoma(HCC). The primary objective is to assess its therapeutic efficacy in patients with
      unresectable HCC. The primary endpoint is overall survival (OS) after the use of 12-week
      drug. Secondary endpoints include progression-free survival (PFS) after the use of 12-week
      drug, the improvement of the score of the European Organization for Reasearch and Treatment
      of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire C30 (EORTC QLQ-C30), the changes of the liver
      function, coagulation function, the size of solid tumors,&quot;Du-tan-yu-jie Zheng&quot; in Chinese
      medicine, pain Visual Analogue Scale and toxicity profile of Jiu-wei-zhen-xiao Granule.

    <description>Overall Survival (OS) is defined as the percentage of people in a group who are alive after the 12-week use of drug.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression-Free Survival</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 4 weeks, 8 weeks, 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Progression-free survival (PFS) will be defined as the elapsed time from the first date of study treatment until documented disease progression (as per RECIST 1.1) or death from any cause, whichever is earlier. For patients who remain alive without progression, follow-up time will be censored at the date of last disease assessment .</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>European Organization for Reasearch and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire C30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) (Chinese version, Version 3.0)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 4 weeks, 8 weeks, 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>EORTC QLQ-C30 is a 30-item questionnaire composed of multi-item scales and single items that reflect the multidimensionality of the QoL construct. It includes five functional scales (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, and social), three symptom scales (fatigue, pain, and nausea/vomiting), and a global health status/QoL scale. The remaining single items assess additional symptoms commonly reported by cancer patients (dyspnea, appetite loss, sleep disturbance, constipation, and diarrhea), as well as the perceived financial impact of the disease and treatment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The level of the liver function</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 4 weeks, 8 weeks, 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The biochemical indicators of the liver function include alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), total bilirubin(TBiL), direct bilirubin (DBiL), albumin (ALB), alkaline phosphatase (AKP), gamma-Glutamyltransferase (γ-GGT).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The level of AFP</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 4 weeks, 8 weeks, 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>AFP is the abbreviation of alpha fetoprotein, which could be the progress of the primary hepatocellular carcinoma</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The level of coagulation function</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The biochemical indicators of the coagulation function include prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), thrombin time (TT), fibrinogen (FIB).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The size of solid tumors</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The size of solid tumors is measured by a professional film reader using MRI/CT.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>&quot;Du-tan-yu-jie Zheng&quot; symptoms score in Chinese medicine</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 4 weeks, 8 weeks, 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>&quot;Du-tan-yu-jie Zheng&quot; is a series of common symptoms in HCC，including distending pain in the hypochondrium,jaundice, a lump below the costal region,weak and lassitude, poor appetite,abdominal distension and fullness,dizziness and tinnitus, bitter or dry mouth,constipation, urinary yellow,upset and irritable,red or dark red tongue, stringy or rapid pulse</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>10cm-VAS of the pain</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 4 weeks, 8 weeks, 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The 10cm Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) of the pain is most commonly anchored by &quot;no pain&quot; (score of 0) and &quot;pain as bad as it could be&quot; or &quot;worst imaginable pain&quot; (score of 10) .</description>
