      Low motivation to exercise is one of the barriers to participation in cardiac rehabilitation.
      Fear of activity after a cardiac event is associated with low levels of physical activity.
      This study aimed to develop and validate a scale to measure fear of activity in patients with
      coronary artery disease.

      Low motivation to exercise is one of the barriers to participation in cardiac rehabilitation.
      Fear of activity after a cardiac event is associated with low levels of physical activity.
      This study aimed to develop and validate a scale to measure fear of activity in patients with
      coronary artery disease. A scale for Fear of ACTivity in patients with CAD (Fact-CAD) was
      created through semi-structured focus group interviews with patients. Face and content
      validity of Fact-CAD was verified. The scale was applied to 250 patients who had myocardial
      infarction, coronary artery bypass grafting or percutaneous coronary intervention within the
      last 12 months. Psychometric analysis included model fit, unidimensionality, reliability,
      local dependency, differential item functioning and external construct validity. Analyses
      were performed using the Rasch Analysis Model.

    <measure>A scale for fear of activity</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Each item is scored by a 5-point likert scale (4= always, 3= mostly, 2= sometimes, 1= seldom, 0= never). The scale is bi-directional; seven items 1, 5, 9, 13, 17, 19 and 21 are positively designed and their scores are inversely scored (0= always, 1= mostly, 2= sometimes, 3= seldom, 4= never). Total score is calculated by summing the scores of each item. Higher scores indicate the severity of fear of activity.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Nottingham Health Profile</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline</time_frame>
    <description>It contains 38 items that address pain, physical mobility, emotional reactions, energy, social isolation, and sleep dimensions. Higher scores indicate worse quality of life.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Beck Depression Inventory</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline</time_frame>
    <description>This is a 21-item self-report questionnaire evaluating the presence and severity of depressive symptoms in the vegetative, emotional, cognitive and motivational domains. Scores of each item ranges from 0 to 3, higher scores mean higher risk of depression.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Beck Anxiety Inventory</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Each item is rated on 4-point scale ranging from 0 to 3. Four items are related to anxiety mood, four items related to specific fears and fourteen items are related to physiological aspects of anxiety such as autonomic hyperactivity. Higher scores indicate higher levels of anxiety.</description>
