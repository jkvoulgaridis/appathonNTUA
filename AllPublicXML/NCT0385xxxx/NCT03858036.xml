    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized, single investigative site study to compare the safety and
      effectiveness of Epi-OFF CXL treatment (performed using Ricrolin+ and VEGA UV-A system)
      compared to Epi-ON CXL (performed using Ricrolin+ and VEGA UV-A system) in eyes with
      keratoconus and other corneal ectatic disorders.Subjects will be randomized to receive the
      CXL treatment with either the Epi-On or Epi-Off technique.

    <description>The Epi-ON treatment will be performed without removal of the corneal epithelium.

    <description>1 to 2 drops of Ricrolin+ will be instilled topically in the eye every 2 minutes for 30 minutes. At the end of the Ricrolin+ pre-treatment period, the eye will be examined at the slit lamp to detect the presence of a yellow flare in the anterior chamber, indicating adequate riboflavin saturation of the corneal tissue. If the yellow flare is not detected, Ricrolin+ will continue to be instilled 1 drop every 2 minutes for an additional 5 to 10 minutes; and the anterior chamber will be rechecked for yellow flare. This process will be repeated as necessary. During the irradiation period, 1 to 2 drops of Ricrolin+ to cover the cornea (in the same manner as during the riboflavin pre-treatment) before the start of irradiation and every 5 minutes during irradiation until irradiation is complete.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Be at least 12 years of age or older, male or female, of any race.

          2. Having a diagnosis of keratoconus or other corneal ectatic disorder.

          3. Presence of central or inferior steepening on the topography map.

          4. Axial topography consistent with keratoconus or other corneal ectatic disorder.

          5. For eyes diagnosed with keratoconus, presence of one or more slit lamp findings
             associated with keratoconus, such as:

               1. Scissoring of the retinoscopic reflex

               2. Fleischer ring

          7. Subject is willing to have CXL performed by the Epi-OFF or Epi-ON techniques.

          8. Provide written informed consent and a signed HIPPA form. Pediatric subjects less than
             14 years of age must sign an assent and a parent or legal guardian must sign an
             informed consent.

             to the treatment visit and to continue o one month following treatment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. One of the randomized CXL techniques (Epi-OFF or Epi-ON) is contraindicated or, in the
             investigator's clinical judgment, is not able to be performed in the study eye.

          2. Study eye keratoconus severity is classified as being normal or atypical normal based
             on the OPD-Scan III keratoconus classification indices.

             pachymetry between &lt;375 microns and 325 microns may be enrolled in the compassionate
             use group.]

          6. Presence of Intacs or corneal rings or segments in the study eye.

          7. Previous ocular condition (other than refractive error) in the eye(s) to be treated
             that may predispose the eye for future complications or prevent the possibility of
             improved vision, for example:

               1. History of corneal disease (e.g., herpes simplex, herpes zoster keratitis,
                  recurrent erosion syndrome, corneal melt, or corneal dystrophy, etc.)

               2. Clinically significant corneal scarring in the treatment zone unrelated to
                  keratoconus.

          8. Eyes which are aphakic.

          9. Eyes which are pseudophakic and do not have a UV blocking lens implanted.

         10. A known contraindication, sensitivity, or allergy to the test article or its
             components or to study medications.

         11. Nystagmus or any other condition that would prevent a steady gaze during the
             cross-linking treatment or other diagnostic tests.

         12. If female, pregnant, nursing or planning a pregnancy, or having a positive urine
             pregnancy test prior to the randomization of, or treatment of, either eye during the
             course of the study.

         13. A condition that, in the investigator's opinion, would interfere with or prolong
             epithelial healing, including a history of chemical injury or delayed epithelial
             healing in the study eye.

         14. Presence or history or any other condition or finding that, in the investigator's
             opinion, makes the patient unsuitable as a candidate for cross-linking or study
             participation or may confound the outcome of the study.
