  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will study whether Pazopanib, taken daily for 6 months, will reduce the
      severity of nose bleeds in patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. Patients will
      either be provided drug or a placebo [sugar non-drug pill], and be tested for nose bleed
      severity throughout the trial, including particularly nose bleed duration. Investigators will
      also test for blood loss, as well as for safety.

  <detailed_description>

      Once a single dose pk study is performed to properly establish similar exposure with the
      prior pilot 50mg tablet, a double blind, placebo controlled study will follow, which proposes
      to define primarily the value of low dose Pazopanib on nose bleed duration, in the context of
      assessing perceived nose bleed severity. A 3mth follow-up period will support safety and
      efficacy elements. Secondary endpoints will be interrogated, including ongoing blood loss,
      use of iron and blood products, quality of life, and drug safety.

    <intervention_model_description>After at least a 3wk baseline period, patients will be assigned low dose drug or placebo. After 3mths of therapy, if epistaxis duration endpoint has been reached, the drug dose will remain the sameâ€¦ However, if this end point is not reached, and no safety signals have been observed, the dose can be advanced up to double the initial dose. A strong initial trend would still permit continuance of the low dose intervention. Post-study drug discontinuance, a 3 month follow-up time period will continue assessments to define maintenance of effect, and/ or relapse. An interim to adjust total subject number, and potential futility occurs after 12 patients have completed their 24 week dosing period.</intervention_model_description>
