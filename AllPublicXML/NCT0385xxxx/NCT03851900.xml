  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized, controlled, clinical trial aimed to compare the 6- month clinical
      performance of a desensitizer that contains calcium phosphate TM with a two-step self-etch
      adhesive SE and placebo (distilled water). At least 150 teeth wil be treated with
      desensitizing products and placebo randomly one third usig TM, one third using SE and one
      third using placebo. The efficiency of the materials will be evaluated at baseline, 1 week, 1
      month, 3 months and 6 months after treatment.

      The aim of this randomized, controlled, clinical trial is to compare the clinical efficacy of
      a desensitizer that contains calcium phosphate with a two-step self-etch adhesive and placebo
      through a long-term period (6 months). At least fifty patients with a sensitivity score of 6
      or higher, according to the Visual Analog Scale (VAS), with at least three teeth will
      participate in this study. Teethmate Desensitizer (TM), Clearfil SE Bond 2 (SE) and placebo
      (distilled water) will be applied randomly to three teeth of each patient. Recalls will be
      done at baseline, 1 week, 1 month, 3 months and 6 months after treatment by applying
      air-blast and the sensitivity scores will be determined according to VAS. The efficiency of
      the materials will be determined according to the VAS scores. Data will be analyzed using
      Paired t test and repeated measures of ANOVA.

    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The clinical efficacy of a desensitizer that contains calcium phosphate with a two-step self-etch adhesive and placebo through a long-term period. Evaluation will be performed usig the Visual Analog Scale(VAS). VAS values will be according to the following parameters: 0 - no discomfort;1 to 3 - light discomfort;4 to 6 - mild discomfort;7 to 9 - severe discomfort;10 - Unbearable discomfort. After each stimulus to the suspected site the degree of hypersensitivity will be determined from 6 to 10 as the preop VAS score for each individual painful tooth.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Subjective satisfaction of patients</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Because of the patient-centered aspect of the study patients' subjective satisfaction will be prior. Patients will be asked to define their sensitivity according to Visual Analog Scale (VAS) scale. VAS values will be according to the following parameters:
0 - no discomfort;1 to 3 - light discomfort;4 to 6 - mild discomfort;7 to 9 - severe discomfort;10 - Unbearable discomfort. In case of persistant or recurrent sensitivity reported by the participants after application of desensitizing agents or placebo, even if the Visual Analog Scale score was decreased, it was accepted as failure, so alternative hypersensitivity treatments applied and current teeth will be excluded.</description>
