  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the prevention and treatment of cervical region pathologies, various exercise methods are
      applied in the clinic. The clinical exercises vary according to the time and severity of the
      pathology but also according to the pathology itself. These exercises include exercises
      focusing on flexor or extensor muscles. The aim of this study was to investigate the
      morphological changes in the neck muscles of cervical spinal stabilization exercises focused
      on flexor and extensor muscles applied to healthy individuals. At least 27 healthy male
      subjects between the age of 18-30 are planned to be included in the study. Individuals will
      be divided into 3 groups by simple randomization method. In one group cervical stabilization
      exercise program focused on the flexor muscles will be applied and the other group cervical
      stabilization exercise program focused on the extensor muscles will be applied for 8 weeks.
      Individuals in the control group will only be evaluated without exercise. In the study, by
      using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) method as the main evaluation, muscle anatomical
      cross-sectional area and T2 relaxation time measurements will be made and morphological
      changes in muscles will be determined. These evaluation procedures will be performed on
      longus colli, sternocleidomastoid, semispinalis cervicis, multifidus and upper trapezius
      muscles. As additional evaluation methods, muscle strength and muscle endurance tests, normal
      joint motion measurements, posture evaluation and MRI measurement of cervical spine curvature
      will be performed. All evaluations will be performed at the beginning and at the end of these
      8 weeks and the effects of the exercises applied on the muscles in the two groups will be
      examined.

    <measure>Cervical muscle strength</measure>
    <time_frame>change from baseline score at the end of 8 week</time_frame>
    <description>The strength of the cervical flexor and extensor muscles and deltoid muscles will be measured by a digital hand dynamometer (Lafayette Instrument Company, USA). The measurements of the dynamometer will be based on fine muscle test positions described by Lovett. When measuring the muscle strength, resistance will be given from the frontal region for flexors and over the occipital region for the cervical extensors. Resistance for deltoid muscles will be given around the shoulder. The tests will be repeated three times and the highest of 3 repeated results obtained from these measurements will be recorded. The strength of the muscles around the scapula will be evaluated with manual muscle test, which is rated at 0-5 points developed by Lovett. 5 point is maximum and 0 is the minimum point. Statistical analyzes will be done with total muscle strength values. A total of eight muscle muscle tests will be performed to evaluate the scapular muscles.</description>

    <measure>New York posture rating chart</measure>
    <time_frame>change from baseline score at the end of 8 week</time_frame>
    <description>This evaluation system is scored by monitoring the posture changes that may occur in 13 different parts of the body. Accordingly, if the person's posture is correct five points will be given.If impairment is moderate, three points will be given and if the impairment is severe, 0 point will be given.</description>

    <measure>Cervical flexor and extensor endurance test</measure>
    <time_frame>change from baseline score at the end of 8 week</time_frame>
    <description>The endurance evaluation of the deep cervical flexor muscles patients will be lied in the supine position, while the hands are in the free position on the abdomen, and the patient will be asked to remove the head slightly with the instruction. A slight amount (30%) craniocervical flexion will be required after this position has been taught to the patient. The time in which the patient maintains the position while maintaining the craniocervical flexion will be recorded in seconds. In the evaluation of endurance of deep cervical extensor muscles, the individual will be asked to lie down from T6 level and the head and neck will droop from the bed. The person will be instructed to bear the weight (4 kg in men) attached to a velcro placed over the ears in this position. The test will begin with a slight amount of craniocervical flexion, as if the individual makes head up against weight, and the time the individual maintains this position will be measured in seconds.</description>

The value found on the compass of the device will be recorded after each measurement.</description>
