  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this project is to evaluate the ability of the lung clearance index (LCI) to
      detect early chronic lung allograft failure (CLAD) in adult lung transplant recipients over a
      period of 3 years.

      This single center study consists of three parts:

        1. Characterisation of the Zurich lung transplant cohort regarding CLAD status and
           pulmonary function impairment (cross-sectional, study part I)

        2. Evaluation of test-retest reliability of LCI in 20 clinically stable lung transplant
           recipients during three consecutive study visits (study part II)

        3. Prospective cohort study to test the ability of LCI to detect early CLAD in patients
           without prior CLAD (study part III)
