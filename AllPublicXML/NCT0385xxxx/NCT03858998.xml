      This research is being done to assess the efficacy of a case management intervention to
      improve the one year mortality rate of hospitalized, HIV-infected, Tanzanian adults. The
      study is being conducted at hospitals in Mwanza, Tanzania. 500 participants will be enrolled:
      250 will be randomized to the case management intervention and 250 will randomized to routine
      clinical care. The case management intervention consists of 5 sessions over 90 days, and is
      designed to link hospitalized, HIV-infected patients to long term care at an HIV clinic.
      Participants will be followed for two years in order to evaluate primary and secondary study
      objectives.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of participant deaths in the first 12 months post-hospitalization</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The number of participants who die in the first 12 months post-hospitalization will be recorded. Death will be determined by phone calls to relatives and will be confirmed by verbal autopsies, obituaries, hospital records, or death certificates.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of participants who attended HIV clinic</measure>
    <time_frame>3, 6, 9, and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>HIV clinic attendance will be monitored by review of HIV clinic records. HIV clinic attendance is defined as alive and attended clinic within a window of 90 days (+/- 45 days) around the time points.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>ART adherence</measure>
    <time_frame>3, 6, 9, and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>ART adherence will be assessed using the ACTG 4-Day ART Recall Questionnaire. Adherence will be calculated as a percentage, using 1 - (number of missed doses/number of prescribed doses).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Viral suppression</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Suppressed viral load will be defined as a binary outcome based upon the WHO definition of viral suppression as a plasma HIV-1 RNA level &lt;1000 copies/Âµl.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Traditional Health Beliefs</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Traditional health beliefs will be assessed at baseline and after 12 months using the HIV Insights and Beliefs Scale, scored from 0 to 6, where higher scores indicate more traditional health beliefs.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Self-Efficacy</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Self-efficacy will be assessed at baseline and after 12 months using the HIV Adherence Self-Efficacy Scale, scored from 0 to 25, where higher scores indicate a higher level of self-efficacy.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Stigma</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Stigma will be assessed at baseline and after 12 months using questions based off the AIDS-Related Stigma Scale, scored from 0 to 8, where higher scores indicate a higher level of perceived stigma.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Social Support</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Social support will be assessed at baseline and after 12 months using the SPS-10 Scale, scored from 0 to 40, where higher scores indicate a higher level of social support.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Perceived Need for HIV Services</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Perceived need for HIV services will be assessed at baseline and after 12 months using the ART Medications Attitude Scale, scored from 0 to 4, where higher scores indicate a lower perceived need for HIV services.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Physical Weakness</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Physical weakness will be assessed at baseline and after 12 months using the SF-12 Health Survey. The SF-12 measures physical health, scored from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating greater physical health.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Acceptability</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Qualitative interviews will be conducted with a sub-set of participants to evaluate the acceptability of the intervention. The sub-set will be comprised of 20 intervention participants, 20 routine care control participants, and 20 healthcare workers (nurses and physicians). The interviews will be conducted by trained qualitative research assistants and will focus on the issues central to the intervention including traditional health beliefs, self-efficacy, stigma, social support, and perceived need for HIV services.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Incremental cost of the intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Healthcare service utilization will be summarized for each arm as descriptive counts such as number of HIV care visits, home visits, laboratory tests, medications, and hospitalizations. Unit costs will be determined for each type of service unit by applying labor rates and materials costs available from the study hospital, and other expense costs available from previous studies. Unit costs will be multiplied by service utilization to calculate healthcare costs. Resources spent on research activities will be excluded. Costs will be reported from the healthcare sector perspective. All data will be analyzed under an intent-to-treat principle.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cost per life saved</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The difference in costs between the arms from the healthcare perspective will be compared to the observed difference in survival between the arms to calculate incremental cost per life saved. Parametric methods based on parameters obtained from bootstrapping will be used to estimate an acceptability curves, which will illustrate the probability that the intervention is a good value for different willingness-to-pay thresholds</description>

    <ipd_description>The final dataset will include de-identified data on demographic characteristics, medical history, psychosocial measures, survival, HIV clinic linkage and retention, ART adherence, HIV viral loads, health economic variables and acceptability. Even though the final dataset will be stripped of identifiers prior to release for sharing, we believe that there remains the possibility of deductive disclosure of subjects with unusual characteristics. Therefore, we will make the dataset available to users under a data-sharing agreement that includes the following: a commitment to use the data for research purposes and not participant identification, commitment to securing the data with appropriate password protected IT practices, and a commitment to destroying the data after analyses are completed.
For published data, the de-identified individual participant data that underlie the results reported in the article (text, tables, figured, appendices) will be available.</ipd_description>
