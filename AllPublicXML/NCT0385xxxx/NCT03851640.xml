      The study primary objective is to evaluate the effect of HC-1119 soft capsules versus placebo
      on overall survival (OS) in mCRPC patients who have failed or become intolerant to the

        Inclusion Criteria:

             no small cell features.

          3. In the case of medical or surgical castration, during or after the last treatment
             before screening, there are signs of progressive disease determined according to the
             PCWG3 criteria, defined as satisfying one or more of the following 3 criteria:

               1. PSA progression; at least 2 episodes of increased PSA levels that are measured ≥1
                  week apart; PSA ≥ 1 μg/L (1 ng/mL) in the screening period;

               2. Progression of soft tissue lesions as defined by RECIST 1.1;

               3. The progression of bone lesions is defined as at least two new lesions discovered
                  by bone scan; ambiguous results can be confirmed using another imaging technique
                  (e.g., CT or MRI).

          4. Metastatic diseases confirmed by imaging examinations during the screening period (the
             status of metastasis refers to the presence of metastatic lesions confirmed by bone
             scan and/or CT/MRI scan).

          5. For patients who have undergone orchiectomy or are being treated by medical castration
             therapy, their androgen blockade therapy is maintained by luteinizing
             hormone-releasing hormone agonists or antagonists during the study period (including
             the follow-up period), and their serum testosterone levels are ≤ 1.73 nmol/L (50
             ng/dL) during screening visits.

          6. Patients who have failed previous treatments of prostate cancer with abiraterone
             acetate or who are intolerant to treatments with abiraterone acetate.

          7. Patients who have failed previous chemotherapy of prostate cancer with docetaxel or
             who are intolerant to treatments with docetaxel, or who are not suitable for docetaxel
             treatment during screening. Patients who are not suitable for docetaxel treatment
             during screening and do not plan to use cytotoxic chemotherapy within 6 months after
             the informed discussion are eligible.

          8. Expected survival of ≥ 3 months.

          9. ECOG performance status score of 0-2.

         10. Laboratory tests must meet the following criteria:

               1. Blood routine examination: Hemoglobin (Hb) ≥ 85 g/L; white blood cell (WBC) ≥ 3.0
                  x 109/L; platelet (PLT) ≥ 75 x 109/L;

               2. Liver function: Total bilirubin (TBIL) ≤ 1.5 x ULN; alanine aminotransferase
                  (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ≤ 2.5 x ULN (for patients without
                  liver metastasis) or ≤ 5 x ULN (for patients with liver metastasis); albumin
                  (ALB) ≥ 25 g/L;

               3. Renal function: serum creatinine (SCr) ≤ 1.5 x ULN.

         11. Willing to use reliable contraceptive measures (such as condoms) and not to donate
             sperms throughout the study period and within 3 months after the last dose.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Subjects with any of the following conditions should not be enrolled:

          1. Received any anti-prostate cancer treatment within 4 weeks before randomization,
             including chemotherapy, immunotherapy, targeted therapy, estrogen therapy,
             anti-androgen therapy, systemic radiotherapy, treatments with traditional Chinese
             medicines for anticancer, or treatments with interventional drugs of other clinical
             trials; palliative radiotherapy or surgery for bone metastatic or soft tissue lesions
             should be completed &gt;14 days prior to baseline imaging examinations; the lesions

             study treatment; toxic reaction of grade 2 or above (except for hair loss) according

             or intestinal obstruction, and patients had total gastrectomy).

          7. Patients with a history of serious diseases in the central nervous system. Patients
             with a history of epilepsy or any history of diseases that may induce epilepsy,
             including unexplained loss of consciousness or transient ischemic attack.

          8. Patients who have been diagnosed in the past 5 years with other malignant tumors in
             addition to prostate cancer, except patients with cured basal or squamous cell skin
             cancer and superficial bladder tumors (Ta, Tis, and T1).

             continued medical treatment.

         10. Patients with known congenital or acquired immunodeficiency, active hepatitis, active
             tuberculosis or other active infections.

         11. Patients known to be allergic to androgen receptor inhibitors.

         12. The investigator believes that the patients are unfit for this study (e.g., the
             treatments will not benefit the patients the most, inadequate patient compliance,
             etc.).
