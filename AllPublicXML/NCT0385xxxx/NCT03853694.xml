  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare total opioid consumption by subjects in different
      treatment groups.

      Another purpose of this study is to assess how well EXPAREL works, collect any safety data
      and assess your satisfaction using EXPAREL.

      This is a Phase-4, multicenter, randomized, active-controlled study in approximately 182
      adult women undergoing elective C-section. All subjects will remain in the hospital for up to
      72 hours post surgery.

      Subjects will be screened within 30 days prior to surgery. During the screening visit,
      subjects will be assessed for any past or present medical conditions that in the opinion of
      the investigator would preclude them from study participation.

      After the Informed Consent Form (ICF) is signed, a medical history, surgical history,
      physical examination, 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), vital sign measurements, alcohol
      breath test and urine drug screen, and clinical laboratory tests (hematology and chemistry)
      will be performed.

      On Day 1, prior to the C-section, eligible subjects will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio into
      one of the three treatment groups listed below:

        -  Group 1: 150 mcg Duramorph® (SOC arm)+ postoperative multi-modal pain regimen as defined
           in this protocol. No EXPAREL TAP infiltration following skin-incision closure.

        -  Group 2: 50 mcg Duramorph + EXPAREL TAP infiltration following skin-incision closure +
           postoperative multi-modal pain regimen as defined in this protocol.

        -  Group 3: EXPAREL TAP infiltration following skin-incision closure + postoperative
           multi-modal pain regimen as defined in this protocol. No Duramorph.

      Rescue Medication will be provided, as needed, for all subjects.

      Subjects will remain in the hospital for up to 72 hours after surgery.

      Total opioid burden and Pain intensity scores using a 10 cm Visual Analog Scale (VAS) will be
      collected.

      Daily pain intensity score (VAS) and all pain medications will be collected through Day 14.

      A phone call will be made to each subject on Day 14 and Day 30.
