  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mindful walking is a meditation practice that combines physical activity and mindfulness
      practice. This study examined whether a mindful walking intervention increased physical
      activity and improved health outcomes. The investigators conducted a randomized experiment
      among adults with inadequate physical activity, whereby the intervention group received a
      four-week, one-hour-per-week mindful walking intervention and the control group received
      instructions to increase physical activity (N=38). Participants in both groups received a
      wrist-worn step count device as participation incentive. Physical activity and health
      outcomes were measured with an online survey and data obtained from the wearable device at
      baseline (T1), post-intervention (T2), and one month after the intervention (T3).
