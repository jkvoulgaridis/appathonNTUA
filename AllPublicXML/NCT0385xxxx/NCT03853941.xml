  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to develop and test a theory-based motivation communication training
      programme for healthcare professionals working with diabetic foot ulcer patients. The
      investigators will explore the acceptability of the training programme and examine whether
      the training leads to changes in healthcare professionals' communication style, and results
      in greater adherence to treatment recommendations (i.e., reduced weight-bearing) in patients.

      This is a proof of concept, two-arm non-randomised, controlled before-and-after study.
      Patient outcomes (perceptions of healthcare professional communication style, treatment
      self-regulation and adherence to activity reduction) will be collected first during a
      control/usual care period. Healthcare professionals will then receive the theory-based
      motivation communication training programme. Subsequently a new group of patients will be
      recruited as the intervention group and the same outcome measures collected. Control group
      outcomes will be compared to intervention group outcomes. Interviews will be conducted with
      healthcare professionals and patients to assess acceptability of the intervention.

    <measure>Change in healthcare professionals' communication style</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Measured using the 6-item Health Care Climate Questionnaire, and indicated by patients' perceptions of healthcare professional autonomy support being higher in the intervention group compared to the control group.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in patients' adherence to activity reduction recommendations</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>

    <measure>Change in patient treatment self-regulation</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Treatment self-regulation is the reasons why patients may adhere or not and is a potential mechanism explaining the relationship between healthcare professional autonomy support and patient adherence to treatment recommendations.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>A researcher will sit in on up to 20 patient/healthcare professional consultation sessions (10 prior to training and 10 post training). The researcher will record observations of the communication style used by the healthcare professionals within the sessions. Observations will be assessed for fidelity of delivery using a checklist developed specifically for this study. Data from pre and post-training observations will be compared for differences in communication style.</description>

    <description>The experimental group will receive clinical treatment as usual, however, the healthcare professionals treating them will have received training on how to enhance patient adherence via the use of a motivationally supportive communication style. Thus, the style/language healthcare professionals use to convey usual treatment recommendations may differ.</description>
