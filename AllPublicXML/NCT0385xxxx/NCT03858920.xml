      This project investigates whether exposure to the World Trade Center Attack is a risk factor
      for liver injury.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective cross-sectional study of liver disease in individuals who meet the
      United States Preventive Services Task Forces guidelines for lung cancer screening because
      they are between 55 and 80 years of age and have a 30 year pack-history of smoking and are
      either current smokers or who quit during the past 15 years. Liver disease will be compared
      between individuals who are members of the World Trade Center General Responder Cohort and
      individuals who are not members of this cohort. The basic objective is to determine whether
      exposure to the WTC attack increased liver disease.

      Data will be obtained from the World Trade Center Data Center, from Mount Sinai Medical
      records, EPIC, the data warehouse, and from data collected by the Lung Cancer Screening
      Program of Dr. Henschke. Results of genetic tests that relate to liver disease will be
      collected from the medical record.

F0 Zero 5.3 kPa means no scarring F1 5.3-7.0 kPa is mild fibrosis F2 is 7.1-8.0 kPa moderate fibrosis F3 8.1-12.4 kPa is severe fibrosis F4 greater than 12.5 kPa is cirrhosis or advanced fibrosis,</description>
