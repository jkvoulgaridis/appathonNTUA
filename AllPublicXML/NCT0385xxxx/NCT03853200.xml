    <textblock>
      This study was conducted to determine the antibacterial affect of three different solutions
      used as final irrigant during endodontic therapy. The investigator's objective was to compare
      the antibacterial affect of relatively new final irrigant QMix with EDTA and Qmix with
      EDTA+CHX by evaluating the bacteriological status of the root canal before and after use of
      the final irrigant.

      The aim of this clinical trial is to compare the antibacterial efficacy of Qmix, to 17% EDTA+
      Chlorhexidine and 17% EDTA, used as final irrigants, during endodontic procedure.

      Endodontic treatment was carried out on 90 necrosed teeth of patients under rubber dam
      isolation and strict sterilization protocol. The teeth were divided into three groups; A, B
      and C depending on the type of final irrigant to be used. The chemo-mechanical preparation of
      all the 90 samples was carried out using ProTaper Universal (Dentsply) File system, and 3%
      sodium Hypochlorite. All the samples from each group were then irrigated according to the
      final rinse protocol (FRP). Group A was irrigated with Qmix; Group B with 17% EDTA + 2%
      Chlorhexidine and Group C (Control group) 17% EDTA.

      Three bacteriologic samples were taken during the procedure from each root canal under study
      in all three groups, using sterile paper points. Sample A was collected after access cavity
      opening and negotiation of the canal but before chemo-mechanical preparation. Sample B was
      taken after chemo-mechanical preparation but before the use of the final irrigant. Sample C
      was collected after the use of final irrigation solution. The samples were collected with
      sterile paper points and were then transferred to microbiology laboratory in microtubes
      containing Brain Heart Infusion (BHI) broth within 2 hours of sample collection for obtaining
      the colony forming unit (CFU) counts.
