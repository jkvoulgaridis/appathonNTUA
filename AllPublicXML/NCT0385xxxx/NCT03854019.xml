    <time_frame>Baseline.</time_frame>
    <description>The C-SSRS is a suicidal ideation and behavior rating scale with yes/no responses. The first part (Items 1-5) rates an individual's degree of suicidal ideation on a 0-5 scale, ranging from &quot;wish to be dead&quot; to &quot;active suicidal ideation with specific plan and intent and behaviors&quot;. The C-SSRS outcomes are categories and have binary responses (yes/no). Suicidal ideation is considered when the patient responds a &quot;yes&quot; answer at any time during treatment to any one of the five suicidal ideation questions (Categories 1-5) on the C-SSRS. The sum of the 5 intensity item scores create a total score (range 0 to 25) to represent the intensity rating (higher scores indicate more severe suicidal ideation).</description>
