  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In multiple sclerosis (MS) cells of the immune system attack the brain causing tissue damage.
      In secondary progressive MS (SPMS) these repeated immune attacks have stopped but despite
      this new damage continues to appear. TSPO is a protein found in the brain and cells of the
      immune system, whose levels increase during MS. The investigators would like to know whether
      drugs that bind TSPO could dampen the immune responses in patients with SPMS. The
      investigators will be testing two drugs that affect TSPO; etifoxine and XBD173. Subjects with
      SPMS will be recruited from neurology clinics at hospitals associated with Imperial College
      Healthcare NHS Trust. Healthy volunteers will also be recruited in order to provide a
      comparison to these patients. The volunteers recruited will be invited to the clinical
      research facility (CRF) at Hammersmith Hospital. The volunteers will take one of the two
      drugs every day for 7 days. The researchers will perform blood tests before the first dose
      and after the last dose to investigate the effects of the drugs, including the expression of
      genes and immune cell activity. This will allow the researchers to explore which of the two
      drugs produces the greatest changes in the amount of TSPO in the blood in MS patients
      relative to healthy controls.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The 18 kiloDalton Translocator Protein (TSPO) is a mitochondrial protein highly expressed in
      myeloid cells. While the full range of its functions are unknown, preclinical and in vitro
      studies provide suggestive evidence that TSPO ligands alter TSPO protein function to bias
      monocytes/macrophages and microglia towards reparative phenotypes. XBD173 and etifoxine are
      two TSPO ligands and represent two distinct chemotypes. Etifoxine is a benzoxaine, licenced
      in France (although not the UK) for the treatment of anxiety. XBD173 (Emapunil) is a
      phenylpurine that has recently been investigated for the treatment of anxiety, but is not
      licensed.

      The aim of this experimental medicine study is to test the hypothesis in humans that
      functional changes effected by TSPO can induce pro-inflammatory monocytes/macrophages and
      microglia to adopt a reparative phenotype. People with multiple sclerosis (MS) will be
      enrolled in this study because monocytes from MS patients have a chronic pro-inflammatory
      phenotype. Healthy volunteers (HVs) will also be enrolled to determine whether TSPO mediated
      effects are immune state dependant.

      The primary objective of this study is to determine the effects of TSPO ligand binding on
      monocyte/macrophage phenotype in humans.

      The secondary objectives are:

      a To characterise immunological responses in blood plasma and in circulating immune cell
      subsets of healthy volunteers and people with SPMS after TSPO functional changes induced by
      challenge ligand binding.

      b To explore the potential dependence of these pharmacodynamic responses on variation at
      rs6971 (a common polymorphism influencing ligand binding affinities in the TSPO protein) in
      the TSPO gene.
