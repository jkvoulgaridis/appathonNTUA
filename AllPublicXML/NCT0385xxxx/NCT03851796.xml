    <textblock>
      A randomized control trial to compare the efficacy of two distinct parent treatments on
      weight loss maintenance for adolescents with obesity participating in a lifestyle
      intervention including nutrition education, exercise and behavioral support.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Investigators will recruit adolescents with overweight or obesity (BMI&gt;85th percentile) and a
      parent (BMI &gt; 25 kg/m2). Families will participate in one of two 4-month treatments: 1)
      TEENS+ Parents as Coaches (PAC), engaging parents as helpers in their child's weight
      management, or 2) TEENS+ Parent Weight Loss (PWL), engaging parents in their own weight
      management. All adolescents will participate in TEENS+, which includes behavioral support,
      nutrition education, and supervised physical activity.

      For adolescents, the intervention will consist of weekly behavioral weight management group
      sessions and weekly 1 hour exercise sessions. Each adolescent also has a monthly individual
      session with a behavior coach. Parent groups meet weekly for 1 hour according to treatment
      arm (PAC or PWL). All PWL sessions are separate from their adolescent. Bi-weekly sessions in
      the PAC arm are combined with parents and adolescent. Assessments will consist of
      anthropometric measures, psychological surveys and dietary and PA evaluations. Assessments
      will be completed at baseline, 2 months, 4 months (post-test), 8 months and 1 year.

    <measure>Adolescent weight loss maintenance</measure>
    <time_frame>8 months [4 month - 12 month follow up]</time_frame>
    <description>Primary pre-specified outcome is BMI change (kg/m2; adolescent) during the maintenance phase. At 0, 2, 4, 8, 12 months, trained staff will measure adolescent height and weight (in light clothing and after a 12 hour fast) to the nearest 0.1cm and 0.1kg using a precision stadiometer and digital scale, respectively. BMI will be calculated (kg/m2); Adolescent BMI Z-scores will be determined using Epi Info software.</description>

    <description>trained staff will measure parent height and weight (in light clothing and after a 12 hour fast) to the nearest 0.1cm and 0.1kg using a precision stadiometer and digital scale, respectively, at 0, 2, 4, 8, 12 months. Percent weight loss and weight change (kg) from baseline to 4 months is the primary parent weight loss outcome interval.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Physical activity</measure>
    <time_frame>8 months [4 months - 12 months]</time_frame>
    <description>Accelerometers will be worn for 1 week by adolescents and parents for each assessment period (0, 4, 8, and 12 months) to assess adolescent and parent physical activity objectively. Total time (min/wk) spent in moderate/vigorous activity and mean total daily physical activity energy expenditure (kcal/d) estimated via accelerometer will be examined. The Seven-Day Physical Activity Recall (PAR) will also be administered to participants in person at the same timepoints. This measure asks them to report the approximate number of hours they slept and engaged in moderate, hard and very hard activity for each day of the preceding week.
Parent and adolescent change in physical activity from 4-12 months during the maintenance period is the primary PA outcome.</description>

    <description>Parents are taught strategies to support and facilitate child weight management via family-based change. Each visit includes group psychoeducation and discussion, focused on strategies to facilitate healthy weight management in their child(ren). Topics include role modeling, strategies for healthy lifestyle changes, and how to be a coach to your teen. They receive personalized feedback throughout the program.
All adolescents participate in a group-based empirically supported behavioral weight management treatment, that includes dietary and physical activity goals, and instructions to self-monitor key information. Adolescents will receive training in core behavioral weight loss strategies (e.g. goal setting, stimulus control) and techniques to help them achieve these goals. They also receive personalized feedback throughout the program.</description>
