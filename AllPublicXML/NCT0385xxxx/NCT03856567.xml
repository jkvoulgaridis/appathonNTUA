  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cognitive Behavioral Therapy with fear provoking exposures is the most effective therapy for
      anxiety disorders. The investigators aim to enhance this therapy with the use of virtual
      reality exposures. The human subjects study will test the effects of using VR for exposures
      compared to traditional imaginal exposures on anxiety symptom improvement, functioning, child
      engagement in and response to exposures, completion of exposure homework between treatment
      sessions, and length of treatment in weeks and length of treatment among children with
      anxiety disorders and/or obsessive compulsive disorder.

      The funding award supports the development of the technology and the human subjects study.
      The subcontract to Mayo supports expert input to identify clinically relevant content for
      therapeutic videos on the VR system and the human subjects study to test the VR system.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Seventy children with childhood anxiety disorders (CADs) or obsessive compulsive disorder
      (OCD) and a parent will be recruited to test the Phase II VR system with a randomized
      controlled mixed methods study. Participants will be identified through the Mayo Clinic
      Pediatric Anxiety Disorders Clinic (PADC). Participants will be randomly assigned to home
      exposure practice with or without the VR system, i.e., intervention or control, respectively.
      All participants in the study will participate in an introductory session in which
      participants complete two exposures related to content from their fear ladder, one with the
      VR system and an analogous imaginal exposure. Each family will receive instructions for how
      to use the Mayo Clinic Anxiety Coach tablet app to record exposures during home practice.
      Participants will then be assigned one week of daily exposure homework for both the
      intervention and control conditions. Patients randomized to the intervention condition will
      take home the VR system for homework completion and participants assigned to control will be
      instructed to complete imaginal exposures. One week after the introductory session, all
      participants will return for a session in which participants complete both types of exposure.
      Participants will also be assigned to a third generalization exposure, i.e., an exposure
      related to the baseline exposure that is higher on the fear ladder, to complete at their next
      anxiety clinic treatment session. SUDS ratings for each type of exposure will be recorded
      electronically via the Mayo Clinic Anxiety Coach. During the follow up session, an
      independent interviewer will observe participants' engagement during exposures and will
      interview participants and their parents about their experience with both types of exposure.
