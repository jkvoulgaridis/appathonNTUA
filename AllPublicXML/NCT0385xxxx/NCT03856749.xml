  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although there is strong evidence to support the role of wheelchair skills training for
      wheelchair users when receiving a new wheelchair, there has never been a randomized
      controlled study looking at the effectiveness of training the caregivers. The main purpose of
      this study is to test if providing wheelchair skills training to caregivers of new manual
      wheelchair users enhances caregiver-assisted wheelchair skills ability and confidence in
      comparison to a control group of participants who are receiving usual care while on a wait
      list for wheelchair skills training. The investigators will also study whether the benefits
      of training are still seen at a 6-week follow-up and assess the health-economic impact of
      caregiver training.

    <description>The wheelchair user and caregiver will be trained together on wheelchair skills.

    <description>The wheelchair user and caregiver will receive &quot;usual care&quot;, which may include wheelchair skills training for both wheelchair users and caregivers( but which often does not do so to an adequate extent) for 5 weeks. At the end of 5 weeks, the wheelchair user and caregiver will be trained together on wheelchairs skills similar to the protocol for the experimental group.</description>

    <intervention_name>Wheelchair skills training</intervention_name>
    <description>The wheelchair user and caregiver will be trained together on wheelchair skills, using the principles of the Wheelchair Skills Training Program, as outlined in the Wheelchair Skills Program Manual. Each training session will be with a trainer-to-dyad ratio of 1:1 1 dyad = 1 manual wheelchair user + his/her caregiver. Training will continue until the goals have been met and retained (for at least one subsequent session), using up to 4 training sessions that will each last 30-60 minutes at intervals of 1-10 days.
Prior to the first training session, the trainer will be provided with the wheelchair skills test questionnaire results from the assessment immediately preceding training to provide him/her time to individualize the training session.</description>
