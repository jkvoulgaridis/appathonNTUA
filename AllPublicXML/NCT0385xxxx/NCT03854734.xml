  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project aims to understand how improving vaccine education and awareness can impact the
      number of parents who vaccinate, or intend to vaccine, their middle school-aged children with
      age-appropriate vaccines, including human papillomavirus (HPV), meningitis (MCV) and tetanus,
      diphtheria, pertussis (TDap).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Vaccines are considered one of the greatest public health successes. Unfortunately, an
      increasing rate of parental resistance in recent years has led to a reemergence of
      vaccine-preventable diseases. This project seeks to determine the effect of a multi-tiered
      school and community-based approach to improving rates of parental intent to vaccinate for
      middle school-aged vaccinations including Human Papillomavirus (HPV), meningitis (MCV) and
      Tetanus, Diphtheria, Pertussis (TDap).

      By randomizing participating schools, parents receiving the intervention will participate in
      (1) a community-based event to raise parental awareness of the importance of vaccination and
      (2) a social marketing to target parents' attitudes and knowledge around vaccinations.

      The Investigators hypothesize that participation in this study will increase parental
      intention to vaccinate. In addition, this study intends to improve rates of recommended
      vaccination among middle school-aged children, as measured through vaccine uptake information
      required for annual entry into Pennsylvania public schools.

      The Penn State team brings a breadth of experience in pediatrics, community-engaged research,
      adolescent health, and engagement with schools.

    <description>The change between the pre- and post-intervention proportions will be compared within the study groups as well as between the two groups using a generalized estimating equations (GEE) model that includes factors for time, study group, and the interaction between the time and study group. Given that there is no specific power calculation for a GEE model, this study will focus on a subcomponent of this analysis for the comparison of the change within the intervention group between pre and post and double the sample size to account for the control group. The comparison of the change between the pre- and post-intervention proportions could be accomplished with a McNemar's test.</description>
