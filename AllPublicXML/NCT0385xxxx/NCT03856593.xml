  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In collaboration with the Los Angeles County Medical Examiner's Office and the State of
      California's controlled Substance Utilization Review and Evaluation System (CURES), the
      investigators propose to review opioid poisonings over 12 months and send letters to
      prescribers in California when at least one of the provider's prescription(s) was filled by a
      patient who died of an opioid poisoning in Los Angeles County. The letters will be
      non-judgmental and factual, explaining that a patient of the provider who was being treated
      with prescription narcotics died of an opioid poisoning. The letters will also encourage
      judicious prescribing including use of the CURES system before prescribing. The investigators
      will evaluate physician prescribing practices over 24 months (12 months pre- and 12 months
      post-letter) using data from the CURES database. The investigators' hypothesis is that
      letters will make the risk of opioids more cognitively available and that physicians will
      respond by prescribing opioids more carefully, resulting in fewer deaths due to misuse and
      more frequent use of the CURES system.

    <description>The letter will be signed by the Chief Medical Examiner-Coroner and County Health Officer of Los Angeles County to notify prescribers of the death in their practice. The letter includes the decedent's name, date of birth and date of death, and outlines the annual number and types of prescription drug deaths seen by the medical examiner, discusses the value of and way to access the State's prescription drug monitoring program and includes five Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guideline-recommended safe prescribing strategies: 1) Avoid co-prescribing of opioids with benzodiazepines, 2) prescribe minimal dose necessary for acute pain, 3) consider slow tapers with pauses to below 50 MME per day, 4) avoid prescriptions lasting greater than 3-months for pain, and 5) prescribe naloxone in conjunction with opioids for patients taking &gt; 50 MME per day. The letter also states that CURES review is required by law as of October 2, 2018.</description>

    <description>This letter includes all the details in Letter A plus additional text involving an &quot;if/when/then statement&quot; along with an injunction to providers to share safety information with patients so that they identify as a &quot;safe prescriber.&quot; Specifically, the additional text reads as follows: When your next patient presents with pain, keep the above 5 recommendations close at hand to assist with their safe care. Also, be comfortable voicing your concern about prescribing safety with them so that they are also aware of the dangers scheduled drugs may carry. &quot;If/when/then&quot; is a form of &quot;pre-suasion&quot; that provides simple rules that tie goals to specific actions and has been used successfully to encourage behavior in many areas including medication adherence and drug abuse rehabilitation.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        The investigators will not be enrolling subjects. This is an evaluation of a public health
        intervention involving sending prescriber's factual and nonjudgmental letters, signed by
        the County Medical Examiner, that would state that a patient the provider had treated with
        controlled substances died of an opioid poisoning.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Prescribers in California for whom at least one of their prescription(s) was filled by
             a patient who died of an opioid poisoning in Los Angeles County

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prescriber is licensed outside the State of California and does not hold a California
             license, but the prescription was filled in California

          -  The prescriber does not have a CURES report on record

          -  The prescriber has issued only one opioid prescription in the last 12 months since the
             time of the deceased death (and the prescription was to the deceased)

          -  Prescriptions with unknown Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) number
