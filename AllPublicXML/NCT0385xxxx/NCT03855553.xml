  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goals of this project are to 1) develop training opportunities for master's-level and
      pre-doctoral psychology students in evidence-based assessment and treatment of adolescent
      EDs; 2) to provide the healthcare workforce, including licensed health professionals such as
      primary care physicians and behavioral health interventionists, with knowledge and competence
      to recognize early symptoms of and intervention strategies for EDs; and 3) to test the
      efficacy of delivering two evidence-based treatments for adolescent eating disorders, Family
      Based Treatment (FBT) and Enhanced Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT-E), in the home-based
      setting.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The complete project will incorporate three phases. Phase I is designed to gather information
      from existing licensed health professionals in the community who serve Medicaid populations
      on their knowledge needs and priorities related to screening and intervening with patients
      with eating disorders. Phase I will comprise eating disorder psycho-education, implementation
      of workshops, and supervision among primary care professionals and mental health workers.
      Responses will inform the content of in-services and program development (e.g., monthly
      consultation services, ongoing multi-family support groups) provided in Phase II.

      During Phase II, families containing a child with a restrictive-type eating disorder will be
      recruited to receive treatment from the clinicians assessed and trained during Phase I.
      Families will be assigned to receive either Family Based Treatment (FBT) or Enhanced
      Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT-E) to treat their adolescent's eating disorder. Treatment
      will occur over 10-16 weeks, depending on the family's needs and availability. Families will
      be assessed at pre-treatment, post-treatment, and 1-year follow-up.

      Phase III will consist of follow-up with the families and clinicians, and further development
      of training/education approaches for the Rhode Island healthcare workforce.

    <description>10 families will be randomized to receive 10 - 16 weeks of Family Based Treatment (FBT), the &quot;gold standard&quot; in eating disorder treatment for adolescents. FBT is a highly structured behavioral intervention in which caregivers are charged with the primary task of re-feeding their child and normalizing his or her eating behaviors and weight status.</description>

    <description>10 families will be randomized to receive 10 - 16 weeks of Enhanced Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT-E), a clinically validated treatment for adolescent eating disorders. CBT-E is a short-term, individual treatment focused on normalizing eating behaviors and modifying underlying cognitions that contribute to the maintenance of eating disorder behaviors (e.g., over-importance of shape and weight in one's self-evaluation).</description>
