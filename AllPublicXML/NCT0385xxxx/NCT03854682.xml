  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Plantar fasciitis (PF) is one of the most common causes of heel pain in 40-60 year old
      people. Approximately 10% of the population is affected by the disorder and the PF prevalence
      is 3.6-7.0%. The risk factors include decreased ankle dorsiflexion, overweight (BMI&gt; 27),
      pronated foot position, and prolonged work and activity-related weight bearing. The condition
      affects both active and less active people.

      The typical symptoms are pain around the attachment of the foot's tendon mirror (fascia
      plantaris), especially the medial part. The pain is well defined and occurs during weight
      bearing activities or during the first steps after rest. The walking pattern is changed to
      relieve pain. Ultrasound scan is used to confirm the diagnosis (thickened tendon mirror&gt; 4
      mm). The condition is described as inflammatory, but the relationship between the initial
      inflammatory condition and the chronic tendon mirror overload injury (fasciopathy) is unknown
      and marked by degenerative changes.

      Although the majority of people improve within 1-2 years, the long-term prognosis is unknown.
      People with symptoms lasting &gt; 7 months have poor prognosis and should be offered other
      treatment. Non-surgical treatment is often first line of treatment followed by surgical
      treatment.

      In this clinical trial investigators compare pain levels (FHSQ-DK) in people, who receive
      surgical treatment (radiofrequency microtenotomy, shoe inserts and patient education) and
      people who receive non-surgical treatment (strength training, shoe inserts and patient
      education) with a primary end-point at 6 months. The hypothesis is that surgical treatment is
      better than non-surgical treatment measured by FHSQ-DK (pain)

    <masking_description>Blinding to treatment allocation of patients, physiotherapists (health care providers) will not be possible due to the nature of the interventions. However, independent data collectors will be responsible for baseline and follow-up assessments, while all self-reported outcome measures will be made available to the patients electronically, and responses entered into a database identified by identification numbers only. The data analyst will be unaware of the treatment allocation as data will be analyzed using recoded identification numbers. The recoding will be performed by an independent person.</masking_description>

    <description>Radiofrequency microtenotomy (RF): A longitudinal incision of about 3 cm will be made over the most tender part of the foot taking care to avoid the weight bearing part of the sole, and the tissues dissected down to the affected plantar fascia. After initiating sterile isotonic saline flow of 1 drop every 1-2 s from a line connected to the RF system, the TOPAZ tip will be placed onto the fascia and the micro debridements carried out in a grid like pattern on and throughout the symptomatic fascia area. After debridement, the wound will be irrigated with copious amounts of normal saline solution and closed in layers. A local anaesthetic will be injected into the skin and subcutaneous tissues around the wound and standard wound dressings will be applied</description>

    <description>Strength training: Consists of one-legged heel lift to primarily activate the windlass effect and increase the mechanical stress on the tendon. The exercise is performed on a step, a thick book or the like, so the heel movement finishes below the horizontal level. The exercise is performed every other day with as many sets as possible and as heavy as possible, but not heavier than eight repetitions can be performed per. set. The load progressed from two to one leg +/- backpack. The exercise is performed as 3 s/2 s / 3 s concentric, isometric and eccentric respectively followed by 2 min rest. Patients continue to exercise 4 weeks after patient acceptable symptom state (PASS) has been achieved</description>
