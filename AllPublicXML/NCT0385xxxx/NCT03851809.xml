      This study adopted a prospective, randomized controlled design. All eligible patients
      included in the study agreed to participated and signed the informed consent from and the
      study procedures were approved by the ethical committee of Taichung Tzu Chi general hospital
      (REC103-26). Patients were recruited from the neurosurgery department of Taichung Tzu Chi
      general hospital between June 2014 and July 2015. A total of 60 patients were enrolled in
      this study and randomized into intervention group and control group. All patients of both
      groups were enrolled within 14 days after episode and a follow-up interview until 6 months
      from the onset. The intervention group mean regular neuro-intensive care combined TCM and the
      intervention group mean only neuro-intensive care. But there are 7 patients in intervention
      group and 12 patients in control group quit out this study

    <description>With the guidance of Taiwan Neurosurgical Society and Taiwan Neurological Society, patients in the control group were given the consistent treatment. (http://www.neurosurgery.org.tw/nsr/tbi/main.htm and http://www.stroke.org.tw/guideline/guideline_1.asp). The intensive treatments were established according to the traumatic brain injury treatment guidelines and spontaneously intracerebral hemorrhage general treatment principles from these two society in Taiwan.</description>
