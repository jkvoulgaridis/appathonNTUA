  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Objective: The investigators aimed to compare the heated humidified high-ﬂow nasal cannula
      (HHHFNC) flow rate of 1-L/kg/min (1L) with 2-L/kg/min (2L) in patients with severe
      bronchiolitis presenting to the pediatric emergency department.

      Study design: The investigators performed a study in which all patients were allocated to
      receive these two flow rates. The primary outcome was admitted as treatment failure, which
      was defined as a clinical escalation in respiratory status. Secondary outcomes covered a
      decrease of respiratory rate (RR), heart rate (HR), the clinical respiratory score (CRS),
      rise of peripheral capillary oxygen saturation (SpO2) and rates of weaning, intubation and
      intensive care unit (ICU) admission.
