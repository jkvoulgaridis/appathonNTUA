  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will evaluate visual acuity and visual function with a 'blended' ReSTOR Toric
      intraocular lens (IOL) implantation after cataract surgery.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective is to provide a normative standard for refractive and visual outcomes in eyes
      with significant corneal astigmatism undergoing cataract surgery with the Alcon Toric ReSTOR
      lens. Patients will be bilaterally implanted, with the Toric ReSTOR +2.5D model implanted in
      the dominant eye and the Toric ReSTOR +3.0D model implanted in the non-dominant eye.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects are eligible for the study if they meet the following criteria:

        Note: Ocular criteria must be met in the eligible eye.

          -  Bilateral visually-significant cataracts

          -  Willing and able to provide written informed consent for participation in the study.

          -  Willing and able to comply with scheduled visits and other study procedures.

          -  have good ocular health, with no pathology that compromises visual acuity (outside of
             residual refractive error and cataract)

          -  Regular corneal astigmatism of 1.00D to 2.50D in both eyes

          -  Potential postoperative acuity of 20/25 or better

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  If any of the following exclusion criteria are applicable to the subject or either
             eye, the subject should not be enrolled in the study.

               -  Irregular astigmatism (e.g. keratoconus)

               -  Corneal pathology (e.g. opacities, epithelial basement membrane dystrophy (EBMD),
                  Fuch's dystrophy, etc.)

               -  Monocular status (e.g. amblyopia)

               -  Previous radial keratotomy, corneal refractive surgery or other corneal surgery
                  (e.g. corneal transplant, Descemet Stripping Automated Endothelial Keratoplasty
                  (DSAEK), lamellar keratoplasty)

               -  Previous anterior or posterior chamber surgery (e.g., vitrectomy, laser
                  iridotomy)

               -  Moderate-to-advanced glaucoma

               -  Strabismus

               -  Use of arcuate incisions for astigmatism management at the time of surgery

               -  Diabetic retinopathy

               -  Macular pathology (e.g. age-related macular degeneration, epiretinal membrane,
                  etc.)

               -  History of retinal detachment

               -  Subjects who have an acute or chronic disease or illness that would confound the
                  results of this investigation (e.g., immunocompromised, connective tissue
                  disease, clinically significant atopic disease, diabetes, and any other such
                  disease or illness), that are known to affect postoperative visual acuity.

               -  Participation in (or current participation) any investigational drug or device
                  trial within the previous 30 days prior to the start date of this trial.

        The principal investigator reserves the right to declare a patient ineligible or
        non-evaluable based on medical evidence that indicates they are unsuitable for the trial.

        Pregnancy has a known effect on the stability of refractions and visual acuity. As such,
        subjects who become pregnant during the study will not be discontinued but their data may
        be excluded from analyses of effectiveness.
