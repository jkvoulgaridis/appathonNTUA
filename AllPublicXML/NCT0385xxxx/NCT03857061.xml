  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our overall research goal for this project is to create a wearable device and mobile
      application, appealing to patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), which
      provides them with appropriate self-management tools and detects AECOPDs early to permit
      prompt treatment and prevent severe exacerbations requiring hospitalization.

      Our overall research goal for this project is to create a wearable device and mobile
      application, appealing to patients with COPD, which provides them with appropriate
      self-management tools and detects Acute Exacerbations of COPD (AECOPDs) early to permit
      prompt treatment and prevent severe exacerbations requiring hospitalization. Currently, the
      investigators are developing a second version of this app, WearCOPDv2. This app will
      incorporate features identified as being desirable from our patient interviews: 1) new sensor
      that was requested by patients - oxygen saturation, and 2) the app will incorporate a
      patient-facing interface as patients requested a method to view their data as well as access
      to information to learn how to manage their condition better.

      Research questions:

      Can an app designed for patients with COPD that includes biosensor feedback improve
      self-management of COPD?

      What is the accuracy of our sensor data (heart rate, activity, respiratory rate, oxygen
      saturation, coughing, and other sounds of interest) in detecting early AECOPDs?

    <description>Can an app designed for patients with COPD that includes biosensor feedback improve self-management of COPD?
We will use the Mastery sub-section of the Chronic Respiratory Disease Questionnaire to measure our research question. Mastery is measured with a 7-point likert scale where higher scores indicate better health-related mastery.</description>

    <description>Can an app designed for patients with COPD that includes biosensor feedback improve self-efficacy of COPD?
This will be measured by the COPD self-efficacy scale. Participants will determine how confident they are that they could manage breathing difficulty or avoid breathing difficulty in certain situations. Usin the following scale.
Very confident
Pretty confident
Somewhat confident
Not very confident
Not at all confident
A lower score indicates higher self-efficacy.</description>

Scoring and Scales
Questions 1 - 7 Scale: Most days a week - Not At All
Where a patient has ticked a box, a value of 1 is entered for the appropriate question.
Question 8 Where a patient has ticked 'Yes' to having a worse wheeze in the morning, a value of 1 is entered for the appropriate question.
Questions 9, 10 &amp; 17 Where a patient has ticked a box, a value of 1 is entered for the appropriate question.
Questions 11 - 16 Where a patient has ticked 'True' a value of 1 is entered for the appropriate question.
In response to question 14, if a patient is not receiving medication, enter the responses as zero.
Score = 100 x (Summed weights from positive items in the questionnaire divided by the Sum of weights for all items in the questionnaire)
lower scores indicate higher health related quality of life</description>

    <measure>Change in symptom scale as measured by the MRC dyspnea scale</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Can an app designed for patients with COPD that includes biosensor feedback improve COPD symptoms?
The MRC Dyspnea scale asks you to rate your breathlessness on a 5 point likert scale.</description>

    <measure>Accuracy of our derived prediction algorithm to detect acute exacerbations as measured by the daily symptom score.</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>We will correlate sensor data from the smartwatch to exacerbations defined by the daily symptom score.
The daily symptom score asks about daily symptoms of COPD and patients are asked to answer yes or no to whether or not they have experienced a decline of any of the symptoms</description>

        The investigators will recruit patients who have clinically relevant COPD who live at home.
        They will be identified in clinics and the wards by members of their care team. Posters
        informing people of the study will also be posted at University Health Network (UHN) with a
        contact number.
