  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypotension with potentially serious consequences for organ perfusion is a common
      complication in extracorporeal procedures such as hemodialysis / hemofiltration. The exact
      reasons for this are still insufficiently clarified. Probably periinterventional vasorelaxant
      released substances play a crucial role in these procedures. These substances could be due to
      contact of blood cells with the Membrane in the dialyzer / hemofilter arise. In this project
      the hypothesis will be checked, if EETs / DHETs are released by Erythrocytes during
      hemodialysis and thus act as potential candidate products for the result of hypotonic phases
      in the Dialysis.

      We will determine differences in RBC fatty acids profiling in hemodialysis patients before
      and after dialysis intervention. Furthermore a matched control group of healthy individuals
      will be profiled. RBC fatty acids profiling will be achieved by using targeted HPLC-MS mass
      spectrometry.

      It is believed that during hemodialysis / HLM / CVVH there is an increase in EETs / DHETs in
      the serum and in the erythrocytes. It is believed that shear forces play an important role in
      the release of erythrocyte EETs / DHETs.
