  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm, open-label phase 2study of Chidamide in combination with CHOP in the
      treatment of subjects with untreated angioimmunoblastic T cell lymphoma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This open-label, single arm study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of chidamide in
      combination with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisolone or prednisone
      (CHOP) chemotherapy in previously untreated subjects with angioimmunoblastic T cell lymphoma.
      Subjects will receive 6 cycles of Chidamide 20mg, day 1,4,8,11, orally (PO) every 21 days, in
      addition to 6 cycles of CHOP chemotherapy IV every 21 days.

    <description>An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with the treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a pharmaceutical product, whether or not considered related to the pharmaceutical product. Preexisting conditions which worsen during a study are also considered as adverse events.</description>

    <description>The EORTC QLQ-C30 is a health-related quality of life questionnaire. A higher score indicates better quality of life, with changes of 5 to 10 points considered to be a minimally important difference to participants.</description>
