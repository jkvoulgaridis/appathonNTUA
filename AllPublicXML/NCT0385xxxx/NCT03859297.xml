      This study will evaluate whether a newer treatment, rumination-focused cognitive behavioral
      treatment, which includes mindfulness and can be used to reduce ruminative habits, change
      ways in which key brain regions interact with each other (e.g.., often called connectivity),
      and whether these changes in habits and brain connectivity can reduce the risk for recurrence
      of depression in the next two years.

    <textblock>
      Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is a disease that has it's onset in childhood and early
      adolescence for many. Treatments in adolescence tend to be acute and short-term.
      Unfortunately, between half and three quarters of adolescents who have a first episode of MDD
      will go to have a second episode within the next two years. Studies in adults suggest that
      maintenance treatments or preventative treatments can lower these risks and delay or stop
      recurrences.

      The present study will use a preventative strategy, rumination-focused CBT (RF-CBT) to delay
      or stop the onset of another MD episode for at least two years.

      For the first 2 years of the study, adolescents with a history of MDD who are currently well
      will be randomly selected for either treatment with RF-CBT or just treatment as usual in the
      first two years of the study.

      In the last 3 years of the study, these adolescents will be randomized to either RF-CBT or
      Relaxation Therapy above and beyond TAU (Treatment as Usual). Brain, cognitive, and
      self-report measurements are collected before during and after the intervention to evaluate
      what brain and rumination changes occur, and which adolescents benefit the most from the
      treatment.

      What will happen.

        1. The Investigators determine if the child is eligible (see criteria below for 14-17 year
           olds with history of MDD.

        2. The Investigators complete pre-intervention assessments with the child that include

             1. brain imaging

             2. tests of cognitive skills and emotion processing, including rumination

             3. questionnaires about how the adolescent thinks and responds to situations, similar
                questionnaires in at least one parent/guardian

             4. measurement of sleep using a handheld wristwatch (called an actigraph - optional).

        3. randomization (chance assignment) in years 1-2 to either rumination focused cognitive
           behavioral therapy (RF-CBT) or assessment only for a 10-session intervention. Treatment
           as usual continues for all adolescents. In years 3-5, chance assignment is to RF-CBT or
           Relaxation Therapy.

        4. repeat assessments after the intervention period. The cognitive skills and emotion
           processing are also assessed during the middle of the intervention period.

             4. measurement of sleep using a handheld wristwatch (called an actigraph - optional).

        5. follow-up assessments to determine any changes, recurrence of depression, new treatments
           for the next two years.

    <time_frame>10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>RRS is a scale developed by Dr. Susan Nolan-Hoeksema that is used to determine pre-post reductions in rumination after RF-CBT.
The RRS is the Rumination Responsiveness Scale. Scores range from a low of 22 to a high of 88 on the 232 item scale. Higher scores indicate more difficulties with rumination. Higher rumination has been reported in a number of samples of both active and remitted MDD.
The outcome is a reliable change index decline of at least 1/2 standard deviation in the RF-CBT group relative to the AO and RelaxT arms.
In our preliminary study, the RRS declined from 52.88 to 43 (Jacobs et al., 2016). An age matched control group had a mean score of 30.4 (7.1), Burkhouse et al., 2016.</description>

    <description>RF-CBT targets rumination and other maladaptive forms of emotion regulation such as suppression and avoidance and provides skills training in effectively coping with rumination. RF-CBT specifically targets rumination through psychoeducation, adopting a functional analytic approach to the learned habitual behavior of rumination, and a focus on shifting process style. The adolescent is taught to notice triggers to ruminate as well as the consequences of rumination and to shift into practicing a more adaptive strategy such as an attention training exercise, behavioral activation, thinking in a concrete way, or active problem-solving. RF-CBT directly teaches adolescents to recognize rumination or &quot;when the participant gets stuck in their head&quot; and to notice the influence this has on their mood.</description>
