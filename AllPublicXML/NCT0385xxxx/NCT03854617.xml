    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, open-label, parallel, multi-center study, aims to evaluate the efficacy
      and safety of metronomic chemotherapy with oral Navelbine versus intermittent oral Navelbine
      in female patients with HER2 negative Metastasis Breast Cancer.

      1. The significant efficacy and good safety profile of Vinorelbine in the treatment of
           advanced breast cancer are accepted.

        2. Oral NVB presents absolute bioavailability of 40% and oral availability allows to use
           different schedules and the endothelial cell functionality and motility are interfered
           at very low drug concentration

        3. Oral NVB at 50 mg three times a week (Monday-Wednesday-Friday) has been tested in phase
           Ia/Ib/II trials, highlighting the excellent safety of this scheme combined with an
           interesting activity in various European countries.

        4. The study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of metronomic chemotherapy with oral
           Navelbine versus intermittent oral Navelbine in female patients with HER2 negative
           Metastasis Breast Cancer.

               -  Subjects who are not suitable for the choice of anthracycline- and/or taxane-
                  based chemotherapy as first-line treatment in the judgment of investigator.

          -  Prior radiotherapy must have completed before randomization, with full recovery from
             acute radiation side effects. An interval of less than 4 weeks after radiotherapy was
             not allowed.Concurrent limited field radiation therapy (RT) is allowed. At least one
             measurable lesion must be completely outside the radiation portal in accordance with
             RECIST 1.1 guidelines;

          -  Subjects of reproductive potential who are pregnant, breast feeding or not willing to
             use effective contraceptive precautions during the study and for at least one month

          -  Patients with psychiatric disorder or other disease leading to incompliance to the
             therapy.

          -  Known hypersensitivity to any ingredient of the study drug.

             randomization.

          -  Previous treated by oral NVB.

          -  Treatment with any investigational drug within 30 days before the beginning of
             treatment with study drug. Less than 30 days since receipt of any other
             investigational product or device.
