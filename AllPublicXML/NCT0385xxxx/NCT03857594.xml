  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the utility of integrative sequencing of individuals and families
      at risk of hereditary cancer syndromes and will uncover novel contributors to tumourigenesis.
      Integrative sequencing refers to:

        1. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) of the germline (inherited) genome

        2. Whole exome sequencing (WES) or targeted/panel sequencing of tumour(s) (somatic,
           tumour-specific mutations)

        3. DNA methylation (methylome) analysis of tumour(s)

        4. RNA sequencing (transcriptome) of tumour(s)

      Eligible patients receiving genetic care at Princess Margaret Cancer Centre and the
      University Health Network may be approached by their genetic counsellor for participation in
      this study.

        All individuals at risk of a hereditary cancer syndrome with or without a known germline
        mutation. This includes individuals with multiple primary malignancies, families with a
        strong family history of cancer, young individuals with cancer, rare cancer histologies.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients must be â‰¥18 years of age

          2. All patients and enrolled family members must have a signed and dated informed consent
             form

        All individuals at risk of a hereditary cancer syndrome without a known germline mutation
        from clinical genetic testing, will be eligible for this study. This includes:

          1. Individuals with multiple primary malignancies

          2. Families with a strong family history of cancer suggestive of a hereditary cancer
             syndrome

          3. Young individuals with cancer (10 years earlier than the age of onset of sporadic
             cases) and no identified gene mutation

          4. Rare cancer histologies

        Individuals with an identified germline mutation will also be eligible for this study, if
        there are discordant family members suggesting additional genetic factors contributing to
        the variable familial phenotype. For example, a family composed of mutation carriers
        severely affected with cancers, and carriers unaffected with cancer.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        None.
