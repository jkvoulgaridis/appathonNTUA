  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Telenutrition Center will use the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation and
      Maintenance (RE-AIM) Framework to assess the implementation of an evidence-based, intensive
      behavior therapy (IBT) for obesity intervention (with a motivational interviewing [MI]
      framework) based on the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services (CMS) IBT for obesity
      benefit. The intervention will be examined under real-world conditions with technology
      supplementation to address obesity and related chronic disease among young adult (18-50 years
      of age) African Americans across the state. The intervention contact will model the CMS IBT
      for obesity benefit according to the patient contact schedule (of weekly visits in the first
      month, biweekly in months 2-7, and once a month per months 8-12) and include nutrition, stage
      of change and other physical and psychosocial assessments. Program delivery will be assisted
      by the &quot;Bridge2U&quot; web and mobile platform and supported in both clinic and community
      settings. The proposed project will shed new light on how IBT for obesity (and similar)
      models may be amended to facilitate the provision of health care resources in areas with
      limited to no resources, such as the state of Mississippi.
