  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study will be to compare functional outcomes of the two surgical hip
      approaches in total hip arthroplasty: anterior and anterolateral. Surgical approach may have
      influence on patients functional outcome.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with primary hip osteoarthritis will be included in a randomized controlled trial
      and assigned to total hip arthroplasty using one the of hip approaches: anterior or
      anterolateral. Subjects will be assessed preoperative and 3 and 12 moths postoperative.

      Biomechanical gait parameters will be collected using tree-dimensional motion analysis system
      &quot;BTS SMART&quot;.

      Evaluation of the function of the middle gluteal muscle with superficial EMG (sEMG)
      percutaneous surface electromyography. Fatigue assessment (mean frequency and amplitude) of
      the gluteus medius muscle during isometric muscle contraction.

      Balance and coordination as well as fall risk will be assessed with use of dynamometric
      Biodex Balance platform. The study will determine the values of individual indicators:
      general stability index (OWS), anterior-posterior stability index (APW), the median lateral
      stability index (MLW) and the fall risk index (RU).

      Subjective assessment will be conducted with use of Visual Analogue Scale, WOMAC Index,
      Oxford Hip Score, The Short Form-36 (SF-36) and Harris Hip Score

    <description>This asks the patient how their hip functions during their daily life. It has 5 subscales measuring Pain, Symptoms, ADL, Sports/Recreation and Quality of Life (which is calculated using all the subscores). Each subscale is calculated using the mean score, with each score range being from 0 to 4. The subscore is normalized such that the lower the number the more extreme the problem is. To calculate Quality of Life, the mean of the other 4 subscores are taken to calculate the score.
