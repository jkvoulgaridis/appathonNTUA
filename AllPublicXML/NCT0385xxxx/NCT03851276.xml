    <textblock>
      The CABG-REVOLUTION study is an investigator-initiated single-arm, multicentre, prospective
      study for patients with 3-vessel disease (with or without left-main involvement) referred to
      CABG treatment. Surgical revascularization strategy and treatment planning will be solely
      based on MSCT (with FFRCT) without knowledge of the anatomy defined by conventional
      cine-angiography.

      The CABG-REVOLUTION study is an investigator-initiated single-arm, multicentre, prospective
      study for patients with 3-vessel disease (with or without left-main involvement) referred to
      CABG treatment. Surgical revascularization strategy and treatment planning will be solely
      based on MSCT (with FFRCT) without knowledge of the anatomy defined by conventional
      cine-angiography.

      One clinical follow-up visit including MSCT acquisition will be performed at 30 days after
      bypass surgery in order to assess graft patency and adequacy of the revascularization with
      respect to the surgical planning based on non-invasive imaging.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient referred to CABG treatment (as assessed by 'conventional Heart Team');

          2. Patients with at least 1 stenosis (visually determined de novo lesions with ≥50% DS)
             in all 3 major epicardial territories (LAD and/or side branch, CX and/or side branch,
             RCA and/or side branch) supplying viable myocardium with or without left main
             involvement;

          3. Patients with hypoplastic right coronary artery (RCA) with absence of descending
             posterior and presence of a lesion in the LAD and circumflex (CX)territories may be
             included in the trial as a 3vessel disease equivalent. Ostial LAD plus ostial left
             circumflex artery (LCX) may be included in the trial as a Left Main equivalent

          4. Distal vessel size should be at least 1.5 mm in diameter as visually assessed in
             diagnostic angiogram;

          5. Patient with silent ischemia, chronic stable angina or stabilized acute coronary
             syndromes with normalized (stable or decreasing) cardiac biomarker values Note: For
             patients showing elevated Troponin (cTn) (e.g. non-STEMI patients) at baseline (within
             24h pre-CABG) an additional blood sample must be collected prior to the CABG procedure
             to confirm that: • hs-cTn or Troponin I or T levels are stable, i.e. the value should
             be within 20% range of the value found in the first sample at baseline, or have
             dropped • CK-MB and CK levels are within normal range If hs-cTn or Troponin I or T
             levels are stable or have dropped, or the Creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB) and Creatine
             kinase (CK) levels are within normal ranges, and the ECG is normal, the patient may be
             included in the study.

          6. All anatomical SYNTAX Scores are eligible;

          7. Patient amenable to a MSCT coronary angiography (e.g. no claustrophobia, high
             heartrate not amenable to beta-blockers, poor renal function, etc., up to discretion
             of investigator);

          8. Patient has been informed of the nature of the study and agrees to its provisions and
             has provided written informed consent as approved by the Ethical Committee of the
             respective clinical site;

          9. The patient agrees to the 1-month follow-up visit including a MSCT coronary
             angiography.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Under the age of 18 years;

          2. Unable to give Informed Consent;

          3. Known pregnancy at time of enrollment. Female of childbearing potential i.e. who are
             not surgically sterile or post-menopausal (defined as no menses for 2 years without an
             alternative cause). Female who is breastfeeding at time of enrollment;

          4. Prior percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or CABG; history of coronary stent
             implantation;

          5. Evidence of evolving or ongoing acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in ECG and/or
             elevated cardiac biomarkers (according to local standard hospital practice);

          6. Known renal insufficiency (e.g. serum creatinine &gt;2.5mg/dL, or creatinine clearance
             ≤30 mL/min), or subject on dialysis, or acute kidney failure (as per physician
             judgment);

          7. Concomitant cardiac valve disease requiring surgical therapy (reconstruction or
             replacement) and/or aneurysmectomy;

          8. Single or two-vessel disease (at time of the conventional Heart Team consensus);

          9. Non-graftable distal bed in &gt;1 vessel as assessed by the surgeon based on conventional
             angiography;

         10. Atrial fibrillation or significant arrhythmias;

         11. Known allergy to iodinated contrast;

         12. A Body Mass Index (BMI) of 35 or greater;

         13. Currently participating in another trial and not yet at its primary endpoint.
