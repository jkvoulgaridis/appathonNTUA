  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Kyphoplasty(PKP) is performed under general anaesthesia in patients with osteoporotic
      vertebral compression fracture. The balloon is first placed into the fractured vertebra and
      inflated with contrast agent for height restoration. Then, the cement is injected into the
      cavity created by the balloon. As the diffusion of cement can be interfered by closely
      barriers formed by surrounding cancellous bones, refractures are often found in patients with
      conventional PKP. Furthermore, the loss of restored height of surgical vertebrae due to
      refracture in PKP. The investigators will applied a rotary cutter to destroy the structure of
      the cavity created by the balloon. Finally, the cement is injected, which may effectively
      interdigitates with the surrounding cancellous bone.
