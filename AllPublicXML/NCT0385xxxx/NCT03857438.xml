    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to show the physiological changes during manic episode in bipolar
      mania how much they differentiate from remission and healthy control. Relation of
      audio-visual features as physiological changes and cognitive functions and clinical variables
      will be searched. The aim is to find biologic markers for predictors of treatment response
      via machine learning techniques to be able to reduce treatment resistance and give an idea
      for personalized treatment of bipolar patients.

      The objective of this research protocol is to find audio-visual features which differentiates
      bipolar mani/ remission/ health/ simulation and predicts treatment response earlier and
      detect neurocognitive changes during mania/ remission and difference from the healthy
      control. During hospitalization in every follow up day (0th- 3rd- 7th- 14th- 28th day) and
      after discharge on the 3rd month, presence of depressive and manic features for patients was
      evaluated using Young Mania Rating Scale(YMRS) and Montgamery- Asberg Depresyon Scale
      (MADRS). Audiovisual recording is done by a video camera in every follow up day for patients
      and for healthy controls which includes also depression and mania simulation. Cambridge
      Neurophysiological Assessment Battery (CANTAB) were administered to both groups( for patients
      both in the manic phase and in the remission) to assess neurocognitive functions.
