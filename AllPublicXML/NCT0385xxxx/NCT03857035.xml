  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose is to compare the effects of piezosurgery and conventional rotary instruments on
      postoperative pain, swelling, trismus and patients' comfort after mandibular third molar
      surgery.

      The investigators plan a prospective and split mouth study. Thirty patients will be randomly
      selected. Inclusion criteria were being older than 18 of age, having asymptomatic bilateral
      mesioangular impacted mandibular third molar (Pell and Gregory class II, position B) fully
      covered with mucosa and bone, and being otherwise medically healthy.

      One side of the patients will be randomly selected and labeled as &quot;experimental group&quot;. In
      experimental group, impacted third molar will be extracted using piezosurgery. The other side
      will be accepted as &quot;control group&quot;. In the control group, impacted third molar will be
      extracted using conventional rotary instruments.There will at least one month between two
      surgeries. The investigators will compare postoperative pain, swelling, trismus and patients'
      comfort.

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain will be assessed using a visual analogue scale.</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 1 week</time_frame>
    <description>The level of postoperative pain will be evaluated using a 10-cm visual analogue scale , with zero representing no pain and 10 representing excruciating pain. Pain measurement will be done preoperatively, postoperative 2nd day, 7th day after the surgery.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Trismus will be evaluated using a caliper at maximum mouth opening.</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 1 week</time_frame>
    <description>Trismus will be assessed by measuring the maximum interincisal opening (in millimetres) - the distance between the incisal margin of the upper and lower central incisors. Trismus measurement will be done preoperatively, postoperative 2nd day, 7th day after the surgery.</description>
