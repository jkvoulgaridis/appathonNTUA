    <textblock>
      This is a pretest-posttest feasibility study of Media Aware Sexual Health - High School, an
      interactive web-based comprehensive sexual health media literacy education program for high
      school students. The program is designed to develop students' critical thinking skills and
      promote sexual health. It is hypothesized that this program will enhance adolescents' media
      literacy skills, sexual health knowledge, cognitions (i.e., attitudes, self-efficacy, and
      norms), and behaviors regarding healthy sexual decision-making.
