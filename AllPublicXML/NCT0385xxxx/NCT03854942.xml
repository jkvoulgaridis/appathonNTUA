  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      About 10% of the calculable loss of health and quality of life in industrial countries can be
      attributed to excessive alcohol consumption. Behavioural pharmacological, genetic and
      clinical studies on alcohol dependence suggest a multifactorial model for the development of
      the disease, which ascribes an important role in the development of the disease to genetic
      variance, educational style and continued substance use. Animal and human experimental
      studies suggest that continued alcohol consumption leads to a pathological activation of the
      mesolimbic reward system. In the presented study, the modification of the alcohol-mediated
      activation of the mesolimbic reward system by the administration of the opiate antagonist
      naltrexone will be investigated in a human in vivo model. The aim is to gain important
      insights for the further development of pharmacological treatment options for alcohol
      dependence. Further development of pharmacological treatment options for alcohol dependence
      seems urgently necessary in order to slow down the high tendency to relapse and prolong the
      short abstinence period.
