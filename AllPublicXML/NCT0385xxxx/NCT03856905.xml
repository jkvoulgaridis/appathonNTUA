      Objective: The purpose of this study will compare the effects of extracorporeal shock wave
      therapy (ESWT) versus functional electrical stimulation (FES) on spasticity, function and
      gait parameters in hemiplegic cerebral palsy (CP).

      Methods: Forty-five children with CP ranging in age from 6 to 9 years will be selected and
      will participate in this study. They will be assigned randomly using opaque envelopes into
      three groups (A, B and C). Group A will consist of 15 children and will receive the
      conventional physical therapy program (CPTP) in addition to ankle foot orthosis (AFO). Group
      B will consist of 15 children and will receive the CPTP, AFO in addition to ESWT. Group C
      also will consist of 15 children and will receive the CPTP, AFO in addition to FES. The
      program of treatment will be 3 days/week for 12 weeks. Assessment of spasticity by using the
      modified ashworth scale (MAS), function by using the pediatric functional independence scale
      and gait parameters by using the 3-dimensional gait analysis will be conducted at baseline
      and after 12 weeks of the treatment program.

      Forty-five children with cerebral palsy (CP) with ages ranging from 6 to 9 years will
      participate in this study. They will be selected from the out-patient clinic of Obstetric and
      Pediatric Hospital, Comprehensive Rehabilitation Center, King Khalid Hospital and Najran
      Generalized Hospital, Najran, KSA, according to inclusive criteria including, children who
      demonstrate unilateral dynamic equinus deformity, all children must be ambulant independently
      and they will classified at Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) levels I or
      II. They must be free from any skeletal abnormalities other than spasticity and the degree of
      spasticity according to the Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS) within the range of 1+ and 2
      grades. Moreover, all children must have a minimum five degrees of passive ankle dorsiflexion
      with knee joint extended. Exclusion criteria including, the use of botulinum toxin injection
      of the planter flexor muscles within the 4 months before the study and orthopedic surgery to
      the ankle joint in the previous 6 months before or during the study.

      Children will be assigned randomly using opaque envelopes into three intervention groups (A,
      B and C). Group A will receive the conventional physical therapy program (CPTP) in addition
      to ankle foot orthosis (AFO). Group B will receive the CPTP, AFO in addition to
      Extra-corporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT), whereas group C will receive CPTP, AFO in addition
      to functional electrical stimulation (FES). All groups will receive the treatment program 3
      sessions/week for 12 weeks. Evaluation of spasticity by using the MAS, function by using the
      pediatric functional independence scale and gait parameters by using the 3-dimensional gait
      analysis will be conducted before and after 12 weeks of the treatment program.

    <description>Name of the scale: The Modiﬁed Ashworth Scale. It will be used to measure spasticity of the ankle plantar ﬂexors. It is a simple measure of spasticity giving grades (0, 1, 1+, 2, 3, 4) 0: No increase in muscle tone
Slight increase in muscle tone, manifested by a catch and release or by minimal resistance at the end of the range of motion when the affected part(s) is moved in flexion or extension 1+: Slight increase in muscle tone, manifested by a catch, followed by minimal resistance throughout the remainder (less than half) of the ROM
More marked increase in muscle tone through most of the ROM, but affected part(s) easily moved
Considerable increase in muscle tone, passive movement difficult
Affected part(s) rigid in flexion or extension The total score will be obtained by calculating the mean of the obtained data Lower scores indicate better results.</description>

    <description>Name of the scale: Functional Independence Measure for Children It will be used to assess the functions of children between 6 months and 12 years.
The scores of the scale extends from minimum 18 (fully dependent) to maximum 126 (fully independent) The scale measures different functional activities in children and the total score will be obtained for each category by computing the mean of the obtained data.
Higher scores indicate better results.</description>
