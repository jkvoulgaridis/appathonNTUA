  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to identify cognitive mechanisms that might facilitate treatment
      response for individuals experiencing depression and/or anxiety. The Stress, Anxiety, and
      Mood group helps individuals experiencing symptoms of stress, anxiety, and mood by providing
      concrete coping skills to regulate emotions, to let go of negative thoughts, and build
      courage to talk to others about tough topics. Groups meet for 8 weeks, with sessions lasting
      90 minutes each. In addition to group therapy, you will be asked to complete some
      computerized and paper and pencil-based tasks.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Identify specific patterns of executive function impairment that distinguish affective and
      cognitive symptoms in anxious and/or depressed patients.

      II. Identify specific components of executive function that predict Unified Protocol
      treatment response. This will set up subsequent cognitive intervention studies targeting
      those components.

      The phone screen includes a confidentiality statement explaining how their information will
      be kept confidential, demographic questions, and questions regarding the participants'
      medical and psychiatric history, and current psychological state. Responses to these
      questions will be used to determine if the individual meets inclusion criteria to engage in
      the study. If the participant meets study eligibility criteria, he/she will be invited to an
      informational session not exceeding two and a half hours at Dr. Warren's lab, which involves
      an explanation the project, informed consent, some questionnaires, and a diagnostic clinical
      interview. Also during the first visit, participants will be informed of the upcoming visits
      and the types of activities they will be asked to engage in for the purposes of this study.
      During a second visit, subjects will undergo cognitive testing designed to measure set
      shifting, working memory updating, cognitive inhibition, processing speed, general
      intelligence, and attentional control. These tests will be administered at Dr. Warren's lab
      and will not exceed two and a half hours. The remainder of the study visits will involve an
      8-week, cognitive-behavioral group therapy titled &quot;Unified Protocol,&quot; to take place at the
      Gronowski Clinic. Treatment groups will be facilitated by Dr. Warren and co-facilitated by
      trained graduate students selected by Dr. Warren.

    <description>Unified Protocol (UP) is is an 8-week intervention designed to specifically benefit individuals who report co-occurring symptoms of anxiety, stress, and mood by providing them with psychoeducation regarding (mal)adaptive emotion regulation, as well as with skills for effectively responding to stress. UP is based on a cognitive-behavioral framework and uses cognitive and behavioral therapy techniques. Each session of UP group therapy is 90 minutes in duration. Sessions themselves generally include a review of homework and previously discussed concepts, introduction of new material, and in-session discussions/activities.</description>
