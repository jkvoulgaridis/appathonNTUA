  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a Phase IIa, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, 2-way crossover,
      2-center (conducted in EU; The Netherlands) study in male and female subjects with stable,
      mild HDM-allergic asthma. The study will consist of two identical study periods of 12
      treatment days each, separated by a washout period of at least 3 weeks (and no more than 7
      weeks). Approximately 36 eligible subjects will be enrolled, to yield 32 evaluable subjects
      who will be treated with both FP-025 (400 mg BID) or matching placebo in a cross-over design
      from the evening of Day 1 till the morning of Day 12 (22 doses per study period in total).

             healthy with no history of a clinically relevant medical condition that in the opinion
             of the investigator might interfere with successful study conduct and no clinically
             relevant abnormalities on medical history, physical exam, vital signs, laboratory
             parameters or ECG at Screening.

          3. Subject has a BMI ≥ 18.0 kg/m2 and ≤ 32.0 kg/m2 (and weighs ≥50 kg).

          6. No severe exacerbation of asthma within past 1 year requiring hospital admission
             and/or treatment with oral corticosteroids; no (never) intensive care admissions for

          7. FEV1 should be ≥70% of predicted on Screening Day 2.

          8. On Screening Day 2, PC20FEV1(Meth) should be &lt;16 mg/mL if methacholine chloride is
             used (or adjusted by a factor of 1.2 if methacholine bromide is used).

          9. Baseline blood eosinophils should be ≥150 cells/μL at Screening or documented within 3
             months before Screening Day 1.

             any immunotherapy).

          6. Subject regularly used alcohol (intake of &gt;21 units/wk for males and &gt;14 units/wk for
             females) and/or recreational drugs within the last 6 months prior to screening.

          7. Subject had any respiratory (viral) infections (e.g. common cold) within 3 weeks of
             Screening Day 1 or on Day -1.

          8. Subject is using maintenance asthma therapy or long-acting bronchodilators or any
             other anti-asthma or anti-allergic medications (as detailed in the protocol) other
             than infrequent use of SABA prn only.

          9. Subject is using prohibited medications as detailed in the protocol.

         10. Multi-sensitized symptomatic subjects with seasonal (pollen) allergies should be
             included outside of the relevant allergen season and/or should not be in frequent
             contact with the relevant allergen during the study.

         11. Subject has any known allergic response for the medications used or known severe
             allergic reactions or anaphylaxis (to food/medications/insect venoms).

         12. Subject participated in medical studies in the past 3 months (non-biologicals) or in
             the past 6 months (biologicals).

         13. Subject is anticipated not to comply with study medication or other aspects of the
             study (at the discretion of the investigator).
