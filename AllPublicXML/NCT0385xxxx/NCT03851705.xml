      This study is a Phase III,A two-part (double-blind placebo-controlled/open-label) multicenter
      study to evaluate safety, tolerability, and efficacy of inclisiran in subjects with
      homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH).

      This study has two sequential parts:

        -  Part 1: 6-month double-blind period in which subjects will be randomized to receive
           either inclisiran or placebo

        -  Part 2: 18-month open-label follow-up period; placebo-treated subjects from Part 1 will
           be transitioned to inclisiran at Day 180 and all subjects will participate in an
           open-label follow-up period of inclisiran only

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Diagnosis of HoFH by genetic confirmation or a clinical diagnosis based on a history

             during study participation.

          6. Fasting central laboratory LDL-C concentration ≥130 mg/dL (3.4 mmol/L).

             normal (ULN) at screening confirmed by a repeat measurement at least 1 week apart

          8. Severe concomitant noncardiovascular disease that carries the risk of reducing life
             expectancy to less than the duration of the trial

          9. History of malignancy that required surgery (excluding local and wide-local excision),
             radiation therapy and/or commencement of systemic therapy as treatment during the 3

               1. Subjects who are unable to communicate or to cooperate with the investigator.

               2. Unable to understand the protocol requirements, instructions and study-related
                  restrictions, the nature, scope, and possible consequences of the study

                  dependency)

               3. Unlikely to comply with the protocol requirements, instructions, and
                  study-related restrictions (eg, uncooperative attitude, inability to return for
                  follow-up visits, and improbability of completing the study)

               4. Have any medical or surgical condition, which in the opinion of the investigator
                  would put the subject at increased risk from participating in the study

               5. Persons directly involved in the conduct of the study

         13. Any uncontrolled or serious disease, or any medical or surgical condition, that may
             either interfere with participation in the clinical study, and/or put the subject at
             significant risk (according to investigator's [or delegate] judgment) if he/she
             participates in the clinical study

         14. Any underlying known disease, or surgical, physical, or medical condition that, in the
             opinion of the Investigator, might interfere with the interpretation of clinical study
             results

         15. Treatment with other investigational medicinal products or devices within 30 days or 5
             half-lives of the screening visit, whichever is longer
