  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to characterise acute changes in muscle mass, strength, physical performance
      in hospitalised older adults. We will assess the impact of these changes upon physical
      function at three month follow-up, and assess for the impact of clinical and immune-endocrine
      factors upon these changes.

      Study Design

      Time-limited cohort study involving serial measurements of Bilateral Anterior Thigh Thickness
      (BATT) using ultrasound, handgrip strength, physical performance, and physical function
      measured using the Patient Reported Outcome Measures Information System (PROMIS®). We aim to
      fully characterise changes in these patients, and will perform a comprehensive evaluation of
      clinical factors including nutrition and physical activity, and measure immune-endocrine
      markers of inflammation.

      Study Participants

      Elective colorectal surgery, emergency abdominal surgery, and medical patients aged 70 years
      and older

      Planned Size of recruitment target

      56 elective colorectal patients, 56 emergency abdominal surgery patients, and 56 medical
      patients with acute infections

      Follow up duration

      3 months

      Primary research question

      Does acute change in quadriceps muscle thickness, handgrip strength and/or physical
      performance within one week of hospitalisation predict change in patient reported physical
      function at three months?

    <description>Change in physical function at three months as measured by the T score derived from the Patient Reported Outcome Measures Information System (PROMIS®) - Item Bank v. 2.0, Physical Function, Short Form 10b.
This is a patient-reported outcome measure of physical function. Raw scores are collected out of a maximum of 50; minimum of 10. These are converted to T scores, which are used for analysis (mean 50, SD 10; range 13.8 - 61.3). Higher scores are representative of better physical function.</description>
