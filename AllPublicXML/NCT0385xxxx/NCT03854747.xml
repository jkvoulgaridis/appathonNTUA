  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson's disease (PH); it occurs due to dopamine deficiency due to the loss of
      dopaminergic neurons in a degenerative process in the substantia nigra found in the middle
      brain; resting tremor, bradykinesia, trunk and extremities rigidity, mask facial and postural
      instability characterized by a neurodegenerative disease. These findings are basic and also
      motor symptoms of Parkinson's Disease. Non-motor symptoms include many problems ranging from
      autonomic dysfunction to sensory symptoms.

      Treatment of Parkinson's disease requires a multidisciplinary approach such as medical
      treatment, physiotherapy and rehabilitation, surgical treatment.

      Physiotherapy programs applied to patients with Parkinson's disease include classical
      physiotherapy methods and neurophysiological based methods.

      Spinal stabilization is an important concept for proper control of body balance and extremity
      movements. Spinal stabilization training was based on biomechanics, neurophysiology and
      physiotherapy research. Stabilization exercises, which form the basis of spinal stabilization
      training, increase the strength and endurance of the postural and stabilizing muscles using
      the basic principles of motor learning and improve stability control in stable and unstable
      positions, provides postural smoothness.

      The cervical region is one of the most affected regions of the musculoskeletal system due to
      the intensive proprioceptors.

      Although studies have been carried out to investigate the effect of spinal stabilization
      exercises in Parkinson's patients, there is no study on the effect of cervical region
      stabilization exercises in the literature despite these important connections of the cervical
      region.

      For these reasons, this study is planned to investigate the effects of cervical spinal
      stabilization exercises on spinal posture, cervical proprioception and postural instability
      in Parkinson's patients.

      Hypothesis 1: When cervical spinal stabilization exercises are added to the traditional
      physiotherapy program in Parkinson's patients, it will be more effective in correcting spinal
      posture.

      Hypothesis 2: When cervical spinal stabilization exercises are added to the traditional
      physiotherapy program in Parkinson's patients, cervical proprioception will develop better.

      Hypothesis 3: In the case of Parkinson's patients, when the cervical spinal stabilization
      exercises are added to the traditional physiotherapy program, postural stability may be more
      pronounced.

    <description>The cervical region is one of the most affected regions of the musculoskeletal system due to the intensive proprioceptors. Studies have shown that many position sense proprioceptors are over the deep group cervical muscles such as longus colitis and longus capitis. The deep group cervical muscles, which perform a dynamic ligament function, have an important role in maintaining the stability of the spine as well as the proprioceptive sense. In particular, proprioceptive receptors, which are commonly found in the deep suboccipital muscles; There are cervical and reflex connections with vestibular, visual and postural control systems.</description>
