      This study aims to investigate and compare the intervention effects of
      acupressure,aromatherapy,combining acupressure and aromatherapy in elderly with mild
      cognitive impairment. The investigators hypothesize that (1) Combined intervention can induce
      greater improvements in the outcome measures than single mode of intervention; (2) the
      improvement in cognitive functions and other outcomes may differ between the groups.

      Background and study aims:

      Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or minor neurocognitive disorder is a syndrome defined as an
      intermediate stage between cognitively intact and clinically diagnosed dementia. The
      progression rate from MCI to dementia ranges from 10 to 15% each year, and over 50% of the
      MCI population will develop into severe cognitive impairment or dementia in 5 years.MCI
      involves functional decline that may include decrements in engagement in meaningful
      activities and one's own sense of confidence/mastery, and it is associated with depressive
      symptoms, poor satisfaction with family communication, and declining physical function.
      Therefore, early detection of the individuals who manifest MCI and provide appropriate
      interventions may help reduce the burden of their caregivers and the medical expenses of the
      health-care system. Previous studies found that acupressure or aromatherapy has emerged as an
      important therapeutic approach for individuals with MCI. However, the intervention effects of
      combining acupressure or aromatherapy remain to be determined. Furthermore, whether
      acupressure and aromatherapy should be administered simultaneously is an important question
      to pursue. The overall goal of this study is to determine and compare the intervention
      effects acupressure,aromatherapy, and combining acupressure and aromatherapy in individuals
      with MCI.

      Who can participate? Individuals with MCI (≥60).

      What does the study involve? The participants will receive acupressure, aromatherapy,
      combining acupressure and aromatherapy randomly. Intervention frequency will be 5-6 times per
      week for 6 months. All participants will received pretreatment test, post treatment test, and
      a 1-month follow-up test.

      What are the possible benefits and risks of participating? The possible benefits include
      improvement in cognitive, and daily functions. There are no risks for participating.

      Where to conduct the study? The investigators anticipate recruiting a total of 120
      participants from nursing homes from multiple areas in NanJing,china.

    <time_frame>Change from baseline in Mini-mental State Examination at month 3 and month 6. To investigate the Intelligence state.</time_frame>
    <description>The table is simple and easy to use, widely used at home and abroad, and is the preferred scale for dementia screening. The scale includes the following seven aspects: time-orientation, location-orientation, immediate memory, attention and computational power, delayed memory, language, and visual space.The total score of the scale ranges from 0-30 points. The test scores are closely related to the cultural level. The normal boundary value is:uneducated people（＞17）.primary school education（＞20）, and middle high school or above（＞24）, indicating good mental state. The higher the total score, the better the situation.</description>

    <time_frame>Change from baseline in Wechsler Intelligence Scale at month 3 and month 6. To investigate the Memory capacity.</time_frame>
    <description>There are ten aspects of the scale. Consult relevant experts and consult literature, this program selects four aspects: logical memory(0~25), association learning(0~21), picture recall(0~20), and number of memories(0~17).Add the total scores, the higher the score, the better the memory.</description>

    <description>Dedicated to screening for depression in the elderly. The most suitable feelings for the elderly in the past week were evaluated. The scale has a total of thirty entries, including the following symptoms: low mood, reduced activity, irritability, retreat from painful thoughts, negative scores on past, present and future.The total score is 0-10 points, which is normal; 11-20 points, mild depression; 21-30 minutes, moderate to severe depression.</description>

    <measure>Pittsburgh sleep quality index</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline in Pittsburgh sleep quality index at month 3 and month 6. To investigate the Functional Activities status.</time_frame>
    <description>PSQI was used to assess the quality of sleep in the last month of the test. It consists of 19 self-evaluations and 5 other evaluation items. The 19th self-evaluation item and 5 other evaluation items do not participate in the scoring. Only 18 self-evaluation items participating in the scoring are introduced here. 18 items are composed of 7 components, each component is scored according to o~3 level, and the accumulated components are scored as PSQI total score, and the total score range is 0~2l. The higher the score, the worse the sleep quality. It takes 5 to 10 minutes for the subject to complete the test.</description>
