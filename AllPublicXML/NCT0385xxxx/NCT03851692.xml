  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The early placement of an intravenous (iv) line in children anesthetized with halothane has
      been shown safe and acceptable compared with later placement. However, there's not well known
      with sevoflurane use (2). The aim of the investigator's study is to determine whether one
      should make iv attempts during the early induction period (at 60seconds) or lately (90 or 120
      s) and waiting until the child receives additional sevoflurane inhalation anesthesia

      the investigators conducted a prospective randomized study, after obtaining Institutional
      review board approval, which didn't require written parental consent. Children age 1-12
      years, undergoing elective general anesthesia via an inhalation induction were randomized to
      one of three groups of 30 patients each one, for iv placement, either 60s (group E), 90 or
      120 s (group L) following loss of lid reflex. Movement on iv placement and incidence of
      laryngospasm were determined. Difficulty with iv placement was also recorded. Statistical
      analysis included contingency testing, ANOVA, and non parametric testing. A P-value &lt;0.05 was
      considered significant.
