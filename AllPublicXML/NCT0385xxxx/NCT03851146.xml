  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial is an open-label, single-centre, phase I study designed to investigate
      the safety and tolerability of a single infusion of autologous peripheral blood T-lymphocytes
      transduced with the anti-LeY-scFv-CD28-ζ vector (LeY CAR T-cells) The primary aim of the
      trial is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of LeY CAR T cells in patients with Lewis Y
      antigen-expressing, advanced solid tumours.

      The secondary aim of the trial is to assess the anti-tumour activity of LeY CAR T cells in
      patients with LeY antigen-expressing, advanced solid tumours.

      Patients aged 18 years or older with advanced solid tumours have consented to pre-screening
      that allows their tumours to be assessed for LeY expression by immunohistochemistry. Patients
      whose tumours test positive for LeY were then able to proceed to eligibility screening and,
      if found to fulfil the eligibility criteria, were registered in the study. The study involves
      an initial dose escalation phase followed by an expansion phase.

      To autologous peripheral blood T-lymphocytes transduced with the anti-LeY-scFv-CD28-ζ vector
      in patients with LeY expressing advanced solid tumours. evaluate the safety and tolerability
      of an intravenous infusion of autologous peripheral blood T-lymphocytes transduced with the
      anti-LeY-scFv-CD28-ζ vector in patients with LeY expressing advanced solid tumours.

      Aims:

      To evaluate the safety and tolerability of an intravenous infusion of autologous peripheral
      blood T-lymphocytes transduced with the anti-LeY-scFv-CD28-ζ vector in patients with LeY
      expressing advanced solid tumours.

      Primary Objectives To determine the maximum tolerated dose and rate of dose limiting
      toxicities of a single intravenous infusion of autologous peripheral blood T-lymphocytes
      transduced with the anti-LeY-scFv-CD28-ζ vector in patients with LeY expressing advanced
      solid tumours (LeY CAR T cells).

      Secondary Objectives i. To assess the anti-tumour activity of the LeY CAR T cells in terms of
      overall response, duration of response, progression free survival and overall survival.

      ii. To assess persistence in peripheral blood of the LeY CAR T cells.

      The study will recruit an anticipated number of 12 patients in the dose escalation phase
      consisting of 4 dose levels, each with dose level cohorts of 3 patients. Following completion
      of the dose-escalation phase, additional patients with Le Y expressing solid tumours will be
      recruited to the study. These patients will be administered the maximum number of cells
      safely delivered in the dose escalation phase of the study. A subset comprising 5 patients in
      the expansion cohort will be administered Indium-111 labelled T-cells and imaged by SPECT to
      determine the biodistribution of reinfused T cells.

      If the proposed number of T cells is unable to be obtained due to technical production
      reasons, the available number will be infused.

      It is anticipated that up to 30 patients will be treated on this protocol.

    <intervention_model_description>The study will employ dose level cohorts of three patients that will be treated at each level described in Table 1, based on the number of T cells to be infused using the &quot;3 + 3&quot; dose-escalation strategy. If the proposed number of T cells is unable to be obtained due to technical production reasons, the available number will be infused. However, the cohort will only be escalated when a minimum of three patients have been safely treated at the planned level.
The fourth cohort dose level has been set according to the maximum level considered to be feasible taking into account technical constraints. The study will be expanded to accrue additional patients at the MTD (expansion phase cohort) with an expansion cohort of upto 20 patients. For technical and logistic reasons the maximum number of patients to be enrolled on the study will be 30.</intervention_model_description>
