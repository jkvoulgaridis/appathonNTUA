  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A multicenter, placebo-controlled, randomized, dose escalation, safety, and tolerability
      study of UNEX-42 in infants born at &lt;27 weeks of GA at high risk for BPD.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will be assessed during Screening and Baseline (prior to randomization) to determine
      eligibility for the study. After randomization, subjects will be monitored in the hospital
      through 40 Weeks PMA or the time of hospital discharge (whichever comes first).

      The following efficacy and safety assessments will occur during the course of the study:

      Efficacy Assessments: incidence and severity of BPD, duration of hospitalization, duration of
      mechanical ventilation, duration of supplemental oxygen therapy, duration of postnatal
      steroids, tracheal aspirate, and Respiratory Severity Score.

      Safety Assessments: physical examination, vital signs, adverse events, predefined
      complications of prematurity, clinical laboratory parameters, and chest x-ray.

      Enrollment between cohorts will pause for data review by a Data Monitoring Committee to
      evaluate the data available after each of the first 2 cohorts have been enrolled. Dose
      administration for Cohort 1 will occur such that there is an observational period of 3 days
      between dosing the first, second, and third subject to assure the opportunity for safety
      assessments in at least 1 subject on active treatment. This procedure will be followed for
      each cohort.

      Subjects that complete the Post-treatment Phase (including those that are discharged from
      hospital prior to 40 Weeks PMA) will continue into the Long-term Outcome Phase and will be
      assessed through 1 year of corrected age.
