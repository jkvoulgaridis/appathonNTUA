        Inclusion Criteria:

        - 1、18 and 75 years old; ECOG physical condition: 0 - 1 points; expected survival time more
        than 3 months。 2、Histological or cytological diagnosis of relapsed/metastatic triple
        receptor negative breast cancer (TNBC).TNBC is defined negatively expression of
        estrogen(ER), progesterone(PR) and human epidermal receptor-2(HER2).If there is a pathology
        report of the metastasis, take the histopathology of the metastases as standard. Negative
        of ER and PR is defined as expression of ER,PR&lt;1% of the tumor cells by
        immunohistochemistry (IHC). HER2-negative is defined as a score of 0 and 1+ by IHC, or IHC
        2+ &amp; fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH)negative. If the ER2 test result is 0 or 1+ by
        IHC, FISH detection is optional, but the result must be negative.

        3、Patients had at least one measurable lesion (RECIST 1.1); 4、Participants has received
        prior anthracyclines and/or taxanes in first-line therapy. Disease progressed after latest
        chemotherapy. For adjuvant therapy/neoadjuvant therapy, disease relapse or progression
        during treatment or within 6 months after treatment is considered as failure of standard
        therapy.
