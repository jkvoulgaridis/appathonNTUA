  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The incidence and prevalence of chronic kidney disease are increasing worldwide, as is the
      number of patients progressing to End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD). China has experienced an
      increased accessibility and affordability of dialysis treatment, which in turn has brought
      about an increase in the number of patients receiving Renal Replacement Therapy (RRT).Without
      RRT, either in the form of maintenance dialysis or transplantation, ESRD is fatal.

      The scope of the trial is to observe the performance of Artis Dialysis System, ArtiSet
      PrePost and Ultra HDF Line versus AK 200 Ultra S, extracorporeal circulation conduct of blood
      purification apparatus and Ultra Steriset as the comparator devices in treatment of patients
      using hemodialysis (HD) or hemodiafiltration (HDF) for ESRD.

    <measure>Number of participants successfully completing HDF without interruption of therapy during Dialysis</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 (One Midweek HDF Treament Session, 4 hour duration)</time_frame>
    <description>Defined as participants not having an interruption in therapy for greater than 15 continuous minutes due to a technical reason of all the enrolled patients in the same group. If there is more than one interruption due to technical reasons, the criteria for failure should be the sum of all interruptions being greater than 15 minutes.</description>

    <description>Computing formula: spKt/V = -ln (R - 0.008t) + (4 - 3.5R) x (ΔBW/BW). Where R is the blood urea after hemodialysis/ blood urea before hemodialysis; t is time in hours; ΔBW is the weight change values after hemodialysis, namely ultrafiltration volume in liters; BW is weight in kilograms.</description>
