    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK),
      immunogenicity, pharmacodynamics (PD) and anti-tumor activities of AK104，a PD-1/CTLA-4
      bispecific antibody, when administered as a single agent in adults subjects with advanced or
      metastatic solid tumors, or combined with oxaliplatin and capecitabine as first-line therapy
      in adult subjects with advanced unresectable or metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal
      junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma.

      The study consists of a dose escalation and expansion phase (Phase Ib) to determine the
      recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) for AK104 in combination with oxaliplatin and capecitabine,
      and a dose confirmation phase (Phase II) which will further characterize the treatment of
      AK104 in combination at the RP2D.
