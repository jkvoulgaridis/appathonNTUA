  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Colorectal cancer is the second-leading cause of cancer death in the United States.
      Colorectal cancer screening is recommended to begin at age 50 years for most men and women at
      average risk for this disease. Colonoscopy is a gold standard method of screening for
      colorectal cancer, allowing for the detection and removal of colorectal polyps, some of which
      can progress into malignancy. The literature has shown that the removal of polyps during a
      colonoscopy results in decreased incidence and mortality related to colorectal cancer.
      Indeed, the last decade has shown a decline in colorectal cancer incidence and mortality in
      adults over age 50, largely due to increased colonoscopy screening. Currently, the risk of a
      patient developing colorectal cancer and thus time intervals for colonoscopy surveillance
      post-polypectomy is determined by the number, pathology, and size of the polyps that are
      observed and removed during the colonoscopy procedure. Current surveillance guidelines
      indicate the need for a shorter interval before the next colonoscopy for patients who have
      one or more polyps that are 10mm or larger. In addition, different polypectomy techniques are
      indicated for the treatment of polyps less than 20mm in size. For example, cold forceps may
      be appropriate for removal of 1mm to 2mm polyps, cold snare for polyps less than 10mm, and
      hot-snare resection for polyps 10mm to 19mm. Yet, while the number and pathology of polyps
      are easily obtained and verified, it is standard practice for the size of a polyp to be
      assessed through endoscopist optical visualization alone, without use of an objective device
      or standard by which to measure it. Often, the endoscopist will compare the size of the polyp
      to the size of the snare loop to estimate and document the size of the polyp(s). However,
      with the size of a polyp being a major indicator of malignant potential as well as an
      indicator of appropriate polypectomy technique and surveillance intervals, a device with
      which to take and document accurate and objective measurements of polyps during colonoscopy
      holds the potential for health benefits. In addition to having a potential clinical benefit
      for each patient in terms of polypectomy and surveillance intervals, as an objective
      indicator of polyp size, this technique also holds promise for use in future studies that
      evaluate polyp size as an indicator of potential malignancy (or future malignancy) and for
      use by national clinical guidelines committees who may utilize these objective data to update
      future screening and surveillance recommendations.
