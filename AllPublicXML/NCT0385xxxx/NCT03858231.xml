    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to look at pain management with opioids versus non-opioids after
      knee arthroscopy. This study will determine 1) whether the most commonly used non-narcotic
      medications provide pain relief comparable with the most commonly prescribed narcotic
      medications in patients undergoing arthroscopic knee surgery, and 2) whether patients'
      characteristics (gender, pre-operative knee symptoms, workers compensation status and
      employment status) affect pain level following surgery or medication usage.
