  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Several drugs and chemotherapies seem to induce myocarditis. This study investigates reports
      of myocarditis, including the International classification of disease ICD-10 for treatments
      in the World Health Organization (WHO) global Individual Case Safety Report (ICSR) database
      (VigiBase).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Several drugs and chemotherapies seem to have an impact on the myocardium and are responsible
      of myocarditis. Those are poorly described, due to the modification of the pharmacopeia, and
      the recent recognition of several of these adverse events. This study investigates the main
      characteristics of patients affected by myocarditis side effect imputed to drugs. A causality
      assessment according to the WHO-UMC (World Health Organization - Uppsala Monitoring Center)
      is systematically applied.
