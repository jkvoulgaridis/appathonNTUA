      This study will help the researchers find out whether the S+C approach is better, the same
      as, or worse than EUC.

    <description>ICs randomized to EUC following baseline questionnaire completion will be given instructions (Appendix I) on how to access or create an account to access the myMSK online portal IC Resources page (https://my.mskcc.org/login). If the caregiver does not wish to enroll in MyMSK, the research study staff will send them an email with sample referral material ( Appendix D. The IC Resources page includes links to extant MSK educational materials for ICs (e.g., &quot;A Guide for Caregivers&quot; [47]), contact information for psychosocial services (e.g., Caregivers Clinic in the MSK Counseling Center), and external resources (e.g., educational materials and services through the CSC, American Cancer Society, and others) (Appendix D,).</description>

    <description>ICs randomized to S+C will complete the web-based CSS-CG (Appendix C) using a tablet immediately following baseline study measures. In case of technical issues, ICs may complete Appendix C with the guidance of a member of the research study team. The CSS-CG asks ICs to rate their level of concern for 33 different possible problems: if a need is rated as low (i.e., &quot;A little&quot; or less concern), after each problem is rated ICs will be prompted to request pertinent educational materials if they are interested. If a need is endorsed (i.e., &quot;Moderate&quot; or greater concern), ICs are asked through the web-based electronic platform (https://mskcc.mycarereport.com) whether they would like educational materials and/or to speak with someone about that need (i.e., receive a referral).</description>
