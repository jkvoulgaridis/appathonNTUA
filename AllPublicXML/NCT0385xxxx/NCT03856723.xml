  <brief_summary>

      The aim of this study was to verify the prognostic value of functional kidney biomarkers on
      survival and renal function recovery in cardiac surgery patients with acute kidney injury.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cardiac surgery-associated acute kidney injury (CSA-AKI) is the second most common type of
      AKI after septic AKI and is associated with increased mortality and morbidity. Few biomarkers
      were validated as outcome-specific biomarkers in patients developing AKI after cardiac
      surgery at initiation of RRT. This study was designed to not only verify the prognostic value
      of functional kidney biomarkers on survival, but also predict it severity in order to
      optimize clinical decision making with respect to dialysis initiation and discontinuation.

Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) stage 2 ;
severe sepsis, persistence of hypotension (for more than 6 h) despite preload optimization and use of vasopressors or catecholamines (norepinephrine or epinephrine &gt;0.1 μg/kg/min),
refractory fluid overload (worsening pulmonary edema, PaO2/FiO2 &lt;300 mm Hg or fluid balance &gt;10% of body weight),

      Blood samples are drawn before the first dialysis session after post cardiac surgery
      associated AKI ( initializing RRT). Blood is drawn into Vacutainer tubes containing EDTA, and
      immediately placed on ice and centrifuged within 1 h. All the samples are stored at -70°C
      until analysis.

        The incidence of cardiac surgery-associated AKI (CSA-AKI) varies from 5% to 42%. CSA-AKI is
        the second most common cause of AKI in the intensive care setting (after sepsis) and is
        independently associated with increased morbidity and mortality.
