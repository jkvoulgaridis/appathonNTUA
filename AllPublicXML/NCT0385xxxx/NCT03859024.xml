  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigator's study aims to see if an enhanced recovery regimen of pain medications
      before and during surgery will decrease the use and risk of opioid pain medications as well
      as improve pain control in anterior urethroplasty patients. Participants will be randomized
      to one of two pain regimens (enhanced recovery regimen vs standard regimen).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the difference in narcotics usage between two
      different pain management protocols after urethroplasty. Management at the current time
      varies between giving intraoperative painkillers along with peripheral nerve blocks in some
      patients, while others do not receive this protocol. In this study, one group will continue
      the historical standard of care of the hospital, receiving postoperative nonsteroidal
      anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and narcotics for pain control. The other group will utilize
      a protocol to lower narcotics usage, including acetaminophen, gabapentin, Celebrex, and local
      anesthetic (bupivacaine) in an attempt to reduce the usage of narcotics postoperatively.
      Given the heightened concern over narcotic usage by postoperative patients, including the
      risk of chronic usage by even young patients, the objective will be to assess if using this
      protocol as a new standard can limit the need for postoperative narcotics prescriptions.

      In related urological procedures, bupivacaine injections given before surgeries have been
      shown to significantly lower pain scores after surgery for patients undergoing penile
      prosthesis. The University of Alabama at Birmingham has also been using an Enhanced Recovery
      After Surgery (ERAS) protocol, a multimodal presurgical care pathway designed to achieve
      early recovery after surgical procedures, for cystectomy and seen reduced narcotic usage
      among those patients.

      This study would potentially help determine a new pain management protocol for urology
      patients undergoing anterior urethroplasty that is both more effective and less risky.
