  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the clinical performance of two daily disposable
      silicone hydrogel contact lenses. One of these lenses, the 'test' lens is an investigational
      product. This means that it has not yet been approved for commercial use and is not available
      for sale. The other lens (control) is a commercially available contact lens.

      The results of this study will be analysed to determine how the 'test' lens compares with the
      'control' lens. The control lens has been chosen because it is a market leader and is well
      tried and tested.

      Participants who are in this study will need to have healthy eyes, except for the need to
      correct their eyesight. Up to 90 people who are aged 20 years or older will be considered for
      participation in this study. The study is designed to be approximately 3 months long.

             vascularization, tarsal abnormalities, bulbar hyperemia, limbal hyperemia, or any
             other abnormality of the cornea that would contraindicate contact lens wear.

          -  History of herpetic keratitis.

          -  Pathological dry eye.

          -  Aphakia or amblyopia.
