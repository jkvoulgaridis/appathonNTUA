  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will compare standard ultrasound images to high frame rate ultrasound images in
      patients with heart disease or with a low risk of heart disease to see if a higher frame rate
      of ultrasound adds to the information obtained from standard ultrasound.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Following informed consent, patients recruited for the study will have an IV cannula inserted
      and will undergo imaging using 2 ultrasound systems. Standard clinical system (Philips IE33)
      will be used for 2D and CE imaging, followed by imaging using the Verasonics VantageTM
      research system (Verasonics Inc., Redmond, WA), using both conventional 2D and HFR modes.

      Baseline unenhanced 2D and Doppler images would initially be acquired using Philips IE33
      system and Verasonics VatangeTM unenhanced conventional 2D and HFR mode .

      Ultrasound contrast agent (Sonovue) will be then injected via the intravenous (iv) cannula
      and 3 sets rest contrast images will be acquired - using the Phillips IE33, Verasonics and
      Verasonics VantageTM platform (conventional CE and HFR CE). Both systems will be optimised
      separately on each patient before and during infusion of contrast agent. When the optimal
      imaging and destruction parameters are set, there are not modified along the acquisition.

      This is followed by dipyridamole infusion and the scans being repeated during stress - 3 sets
      contrast images will be acquired - using the Philips IE33 and Verasonics VantageTM platform
      (conventional CE and HFR CE).

        25 patients will be recruited over 12 months. 5 of these patients will be at low high of
        having coronary artery disease and 20 at high risk of coronary artery disease. patients
        will be recruited from those referred for clinical stress stress echocardiography.
