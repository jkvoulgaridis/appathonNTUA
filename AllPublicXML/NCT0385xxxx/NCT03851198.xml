  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study aims to develop an index formed by the variables, functional tests, scales
      and instruments that best discriminate between healthy subjects and subjects with MCI and
      that allows the stratification of different levels of severity of MCI, and to validate new
      systems for the early diagnosis of subjects with mild cognitive impairment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dementia affects 46.8 million people and in 2050 it is expected that there will be between
      115-135 million people suffering from dementia. Inside dementias, Mild Cognitive Impairment
      (MCI) has a prevalence in adults aged â‰¥65 years of 10-20%.

      Patients with MCI also show greater progression towards dementia, higher mortality and
      disability, and a greater use of medical care compared to cognitively normal subjects that
      converts MCI into an important public health problem, which reinforces the need to perfect
      clinic assessment procedures to improve the early identification of individuals with MCI.
      Early diagnosis could allow effective medical treatments that prevent or slow the onset of
      dementia, and could improve the effectiveness of non-pharmacological interventions.

      Currently, it can be used an Inertial Sensor and 3D motion capture systems with a camera to
      analyse kinematics and these instruments are being integrated as a rehabilitation tool in
      patients. The use of Inertial Sensor and 3D motion capture cameras would help to find fast
      and cheap assessment methods for professionals.

    <measure>Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE)</measure>
    <time_frame>15 min</time_frame>
    <description>Questionnaire used for the cognitive state assessment. The Mini-Mental State Examination includes eleven questions. The maximum total score is 30 points. It is divided into two sections, the first of which requires only vocal responses and covers orientation, memory and attention; the maximum score is 21. The second part assess the ability to name, follow verbal and written commands, write a sentence spontaneously and copy a complex polygon similar to a Bender-Gestalt figure; the maximum score is 9. As usual, a score lower 24 points points is indicatives of dementia.</description>

    <time_frame>15 min</time_frame>
    <description>A questionnaire designed to detect depression in older adults. This scale consists of 30 items (answer format yes / no). Less score is indicative of depression. Generally, a score below 15 points is already indicatives of depression.</description>

    <measure>Katz Index</measure>
    <time_frame>15 min</time_frame>
    <description>It is a hetero-administered questionnaire used to assess activities of daily living that includes 6 dichotomous items (bathing, dressing, goimt to toilet, transfer, continence, feeding). It is scored considering the items individually, so that 0 points are given when the activity is performed independently and 1 point if the activity is done with help or not done. The score varies from 0 to 6 points, with a higher score indicative of greater dependence on the development of activities of daily living.</description>

    <measure>Lawnton &amp; Brody Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>15 min</time_frame>
    <description>It is a hetero-administered questionnaire used to assess instrumented activities of daily living that includes the assessment of 8 activities of daily living (ability to use the telephone, shopping, food preparation, housekeeping, laundry, mode of transporation, responsibility for own medications and ability to handle finances). The score varies from 0 to 8 points. 0 points are given when the activity is performed independently and 1 point if the activity is done with help or not done. There is no cut-off point, but a higher score is indicative of worse performance of instrumental activities or less functionality.</description>
