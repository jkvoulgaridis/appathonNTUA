    <textblock>
      CONTESSA 2 is a multinational, multicenter, Phase 2 study of tesetaxel in patients with
      taxane-na√Øve, HER2 negative, HR positive, locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer
      (LA/MBC). The primary objective of the study is to establish the efficacy of tesetaxel plus a
      reduced dose of capecitabine, based on objective response rate (ORR) as assessed by an
      Independent Radiologic Review Committee (IRC). Approximately 125 patients will be enrolled.

      CONTESSA 2 is a multinational, multicenter, Phase 2 study of tesetaxel, an investigational,
      orally administered taxane, in patients with HER2 negative, HR Positive, LA/MBC not
      previously treated with a taxane in the neoadjuvant, adjuvant or metastatic setting. This
      Study complements CONTESSA, a multinational, multicenter, randomized, Phase 3 study in
      patients with HER2 negative, HR positive LA/MBC previously treated with a taxane in the
      neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting. In CONTESSA 2, approximately 125 patients will be enrolled
      to receive tesetaxel at 27 mg/m2 orally once every 21 days on the first day of each 21-day
      cycle plus capecitabine at 825 mg/m2 orally twice daily (for a total daily dose of 1,650
      mg/m2) for 14 days of each 21-day cycle. Patients in the dense pharmacokinetics (PK) cohort
      will also receive a single dose of capecitabine monotherapy prior to starting the combination
      regimen. Capecitabine is an oral chemotherapy agent that is considered a standard-of-care
      treatment in LA/MBC. The primary endpoint is ORR as assessed by an IRC. The secondary
      efficacy endpoints are duration of response as assessed by the IRC, progression-free survival
      as assessed by the IRC, disease control rate as assessed by the IRC and overall survival.
      CONTESSA 2 will also investigate the PK of tesetaxel.
