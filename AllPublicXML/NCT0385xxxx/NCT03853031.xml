  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intraoperative fluid management is pivotal to successful outcome of major oncosurgeries .
      Adequate volume replacement to achieve optimal cardiac performance is critical to prevent any
      deleterious consequences of under resuscitation or fluid overload . Traditionally CVP
      monitoring has been tool to guide intraoperative fluid therapy and has poor reliability as
      indicator of volume status . Transesophageal Echocardiography measured LVEDA is more reliable
      and sensitive measure of left ventricular volume to guide intraoperative fluid therapy .
      Investigators plan the study comparing total fluid requirement and postoperative outcomes in
      two groups of patients receiving central venous pressure (CVP) guided and Left ventricular
      end diastolic area( LVEDA) guided fluids for major oncosurgeries.

      Adult patients undergoing major oncosurgeries will be included in the study ,with Alpha
      Error(%) = 5 ,Power(%)= 80 ,required sample size per group is 29.Investigators will include
      30 patients in each group. Patients will be randomly allotted to Central Venous Pressure CVP
      Group (Control Group) or Transesophageal Echocardiography TEE Group (Study Group) according
      to computer generated randomization. In the OR 5 lead Electrocardiogram ( ECG ), Oxygen
      saturation (SPO2 ), Noninvasive blood Pressure (NIBP) , End tidal carbon di oxide (ETCO2
      )monitors will be attached .Under local anesthesia 16Gauge peripheral intravenous and Radial
      artery cannulation will be performed . Anesthesia will be induced with Fentanyl 1mcg/kg-1,
      Morphine 0.05mg/kg-1, Propofol titrated dosage 1-2 mg/kg-1 and neuromuscular blockade with
      Atracurium 0.5mg/kg-1.Trachea will be intubated with oral cuffed endotracheal tube of
      appropriate size. Anaesthesia will be maintained with O2 / Air mixture 40:60 % Intermittent
      Positive Pressure Ventilation with Sevoflurane , intermittent boluses of Fentanyl and Train
      of Four ratio guided Atracurium . Postintubation ultrasound guided internal jugular vein will
      be cannulated with B.Braun 7French 20cm, 16 G Triple lumen central venous catheter in CVP
      Group patients . ESAOTE TEE 022 multiplane probe will be placed in TEE Group
      patients.Intraoperative all patients will be given one-third starvation fluid in first hour
      of surgery , maintenance fluid 2ml/hour crystalloid . Goal is to maintain CVP between 10 -16
      cms of water (H20) in CVP Group , values will be recorded every 30 minutes if CVP decreases &lt;
      10 then 200 ml colloid bolus will be given and increase in CVP value noted . In the TEE Group
      TEE probe will be inserted in the oesophagus (40-45 cms) adjusted to obtain mid-papillary
      transgastric short axis view ,the desired view will be freezed at end-diastole and the left
      ventricular cavity will be traced including the papillary muscles to obtain left ventricular
      end diastolic area in cm2 , the average of three readings at particular interval will be
      noted . Every half hourly values will be measured and also if systolic blood pressure &lt; 90 mm
      Hg . Fluid therapy will be given with the aim to maintain LVEDA ≥ 10 cm2 (ranging between
      10-18 cm2). For readings &lt; 10 cm2 colloid bolus 200 ml will be given and increase in the
      LVEDA will be noted.For same readings Left Ventricular Outflow trac ( LVOT) view will be
      obtained to measure aortic diameter at the cusps and LVOT VTI , Stroke volume ( SV) will be
      calculated as LVOT area { Pi (LVOT diameter /2 } 2 × LVOT VTI and Cardiac Outpt will be
      calculated as SV x Heart Rate . Increase in stoke volume and cardiac output with colloid
      boluses will be noted.Urine output will be recorded every 30 minutes in all the patients.
      Titrated noradrenaline infusion (conc 0.08mg/ml ) will be started if Mean Arterial Pressure
      (MAP) &lt; 70 mmHg with optimal fluid administration in CVP and TEE group .Serum lactate levels
      will be measured on completion of surgery and postoperative at 24 and 48 hours.On completion
      of surgery in the study group TEE probe will be removed and ultrasound guided internal
      jugular vein cannulation will be performed with 7French 16 G cannula for administering CVP
      guided fluid in the Postoperative Anaesthesia care unit (PACU) neuromuscular blockade will be
      reversed and trachea extubated . In PACU both groups will receive CVP guided intravenous
      fluids , monitoring will include heart rate , Blood Pressure ,SPO2 , CVP , urine output .
      Note will be made of any patient requiring postoperative ventilator support , inotropic
      support ,return of bowel sounds, serum lactate levels and serum creatinine levels at 24 and
      48 hours and length of ICU stay.
