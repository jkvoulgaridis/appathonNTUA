  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For patients diagnosed with early stage Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) on preoperative
      computerized tomography (CT) and positron emission tomography (PET) scans, surgical resection
      is usually the preferred method of treatment. However, to be eligible for surgery, current
      guidelines require that the cancer has not spread to the lymph nodes in the chest cavity. To
      evaluate these lymph nodes, the standard of care is to undergo an endobronchial ultrasound
      (EBUS) procedure, where all the visible lymph nodes in the chest are biopsied (sampled) with
      a needle. Unfortunately, these biopsies are often inconclusive, especially in patients who
      have no evidence of mediastinal lymph node spread on pre-operative imaging. Currently, the
      standard of care mandates that inconclusive biopsies should be repeated, either through
      another EBUS, or through more invasive procedures. Repeat inconclusive biopsies are
      oftentimes inconclusive as well; leading to a vicious cycle of inconclusive results, a delay
      in treatment, morbidity for the patient, and increased costs to the healthcare system. To
      circumvent this issue, the investigators have developed, validated and published a 4-point
      score, the Canada Lymph Node Score (CLNS), which uses four features observed during EBUS to
      predict whether the cancer has spread to the lymph nodes or not. Research has demonstrated
      that lymph nodes which appear benign on both CT and PET scan that also have a CLNS of ≤1/4
      are almost certainly benign. As such, it is believed that these &quot;triple normal&quot; lymph do not
      require biopsy (or repeat biopsy).

      The investigators are challenging the current standard of care in lung cancer, which mandates
      that all the lymph nodes in the chest need to be biopsied (i.e. Systematic Sampling) before
      surgery, by proposing that triple normal lymph nodes can be omitted, and only those with
      cancer potential should be biopsied (i.e. Targeted Sampling).To prove this hypothesis, a
      randomized controlled trial comparing Systematic Sampling to Targeted Sampling is required. A
      feasibility trial is proposed to determine whether this large-scale randomized trial will be
      possible.

    <masking_description>Trial participants will remain blinded to their randomized treatment. Additionally, the biostatistician performing the analysis will be blinded as to which intervention arm participants were allocated to, as the group allocations will be coded as Group A and Group B. Provided this is an endoscopic trial, endoscopist blinding will not be feasible. Nonetheless, all patients deemed surgical candidates after EBUS will have their pathology compared to EBUS staging in order to ensure appropriate diagnosis. Pathologists performing such pathology report will be blinded to which intervention arm participants are allocated to.</masking_description>

    <description>Patients will undergo systematic sampling of lymph node stations in the mediastinum with a minimum sampling of 3 stations: 4R, 4L and 7, as is the standard of care. Other stations may be included at the endoscopist's discretion. CLNS is not used for this arm.</description>

    <description>Patients will first undergo endosonographic assessment of 3 mediastinal lymph node stations (i.e. 4R, 4L, and 7) using the four criteria of the CLNS. Lymph node stations that exhibit a CLNS &gt;1/4 will be biopsied as is standard of care. Lymph node stations with CLNS ≤ 1/4 will be marked as &quot;not requiring biopsy&quot; but will be biopsied nevertheless, so that there is no deviation from the standard of care. Other stations may be included at the endoscopist's discretion.</description>
