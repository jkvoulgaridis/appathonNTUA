  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is the effects, safety and how OPS-2071 (150, 300, or 600 mg twice
      a day [BID]) is as an add-on therapy in Crohn's disease who show symptoms of active
      inflammation despite being on ongoing treatment.

    <textblock>
      OPS-2071 is a novel agent that is currently being developed for the treatment of Crohn's
      disease and was previously investigated for the treatment of enteric infection, including
      those caused by Clostridium difficile. OPS-2071 belongs to the fluoroquinolone family of
      compounds and has shown anti-inflammatory and potent antibacterial activity in in vitro and
      in vivo assays. OPS-2071 is anticipated to be effective in the treatment of Crohn's disease
      due to its unique mode of action. In vitro investigations of OPS-2071 showed a dual mechanism
      of action, including a potent, broad spectrum antibacterial effect and a strong
      anti-inflammatory effect that translated into significant attenuation of numerous cytokines,
      including TNF-alpha (TNF-α) Screening.
