  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim is to identify the impacts of a behavioral intervention called
      &quot;Mindfulness-Based Blood Pressure Reduction&quot; (MB-BP) vs. enhanced usual care on the primary
      self-regulation target, specifically an assay of self-related processes (Multidimensional
      Assessment of Interoceptive Awareness) (MAIA) at 6 months, via a randomized controlled trial.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Effects of mindfulness interventions customized for prehypertensive/hypertensive patients are
      poorly understood. Until methodologically rigorous studies to evaluate customized
      interventions for hypertension are performed, it will be unknown whether the observed
      preliminary effects of general mindfulness interventions on blood pressure reduction could be
      much more effective with a tailored approach. Consequently, this study proposes to conduct a
      behavioral intervention study to evaluate whether Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR)
      customized to prehypertensive and hypertensive patients has the potential to provide
      clinically relevant reductions in blood pressure.

      This customized intervention is called Mindfulness-Based Blood Pressure Reduction (MB-BP).
      The study follows the NIH Stage Model for Behavioral Intervention Development, where targets
      likely proximally affected by the intervention are identified, that should also have effect
      on the longer-term outcomes (e.g. blood pressure, mortality). The selected targets,
      consistent with theoretical frameworks and early evidence how mindfulness interventions could
      influence mental and physical health outcomes, are measures of self-regulation including (1)
      attention control (specifically the Sustained Attention Response Task and Mindful Attention
      Awareness Scale), (2) emotion regulation (specifically the Pittsburgh Stress Battery and the
      Perceived Stress Scale), and (3) self-awareness (specifically the Heart Beat Detection Task
      and Multidimensional Assessment of Interoceptive Awareness). Based on the degree of target
      engagement, MB-BP can be further customized to better engage with the targets as needed.

    <measure>Self-Regulation Primary Outcome: Multidimensional Assessment of Interoceptive Awareness (MAIA)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>a validated measure of body awareness - a 32 item self-report measure composed of the following 8 subscales: (i) Noticing, (ii) Not-Distracting, (iii) Not-Worrying, (iv) Attention Regulation, (v) Emotional Awareness, (vi) Self-Regulation, (vii) Body Listening, and (viii) Trusting. Individuals rate items using a 6 point Likert scale from 0 ('Never') to 5 ('Always'). Total scores are obtained through reverse coding items 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and summing all items. Higher scores indicate higher levels of positive awareness.</description>

    <measure>Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 10 weeks, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Behavioral measure of emotion regulation - The Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale is a 36-item self-report measure of six facets of emotion regulation. Items are rated on a scale of 1-5, with 1 being (&quot;almost never [0-10%]&quot;); 2 (&quot;sometimes [11-35%]&quot;); 3 (&quot;about half the time [36-65%]&quot;); 4 (&quot;most of the time [66-90%]); and 5 being (&quot;almost always [91-100%]&quot;). Higher scores indicate more difficulty in emotion regulation.</description>

    <measure>Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-14)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 10 weeks, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>14-item self-report measure of perceived stress - Participants indicate how often they have found their lives unpredictable, uncontrollable, and overloaded in the last month. Items are rated on a 4 point Likert scale with 0 being (&quot;Never&quot;); 1 (&quot;Almost Never&quot;); 2 (&quot;Sometimes&quot;); 3 (&quot;Fairly often&quot;) and 4 (&quot;Very often&quot;). PSS-14 scores are obtained by reversing the scores on the seven positive items, e.g., 0=4, 1=3, 2=2, etc., and then summing across all 14 items. Items 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, and 13 are the positively stated items.</description>

    <measure>Anxiety Symptoms - self-report</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 10 weeks, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed via the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) scale. The BAI is a 21-item self-report measure of anxiety. Participants indicate how much they have been bothered by an anxiety symptom during the past month. Items are rated on a 3-point Likert scale with 0 being &quot;Never&quot;); 2 (&quot;Mildly but it didn't bother me much&quot;); 2 (&quot;Moderately - it wasn't pleasant at times&quot;); 3 (&quot;Severely- it bothered me a lot&quot;). The total score is calculated by finding the sum of the 21 items. A score of 0-21= low anxiety, Score of 22-35 = moderate anxiety, Score of 36 and above = potentially concerning levels of anxiety.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, 10 weeks, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed via Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale Revised (CESD-R). The CESD-R is a 20-item self-report measure of depression in nine different groups according to the DSM-5. The symptom groups are Sadness (items 2,4,6), Loss of Interest (items 8, 10), Appetite (1,18), Sleep (5,11,19), Thinking/Concentration (3,20), Guilt (9,17), Tired (7,16), Movement (12,13), and Suicidal Ideation (14,15). Response values for each question are 0 (&quot;Not at all or less than one day&quot;); 1 (&quot;1-2 days&quot;); 2 (&quot;3-4 days); 3 (&quot;5-7 days&quot;); 4 (&quot;Nearly every day for 2 weeks&quot;). The total score is calculated as a sum of responses to all 20 questions.</description>

    <measure>Sustained Attention to Response Task (SART)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Behavioral measure of attention control - The Sustained Attention to Response Task (SART) is a computer-based go/no-go task that requires participants to withhold behavioral response to a single, infrequent target (often the digit 3) presented amongst a background of frequent non-targets (0-2, 4-9). After each block, two probe questions are presented in succession. The first asks, &quot;Where was your attention focused during this block of trials?&quot; Participants respond on a 6-point Likert scale, where 1 represents, &quot;on task, &quot; and 6, &quot;off task.&quot; A second question asks, &quot;How aware were you of where your attention was during this block of trials?&quot; Participants respond on a similar scale, where 1 represents, &quot;aware, &quot; and 6, &quot;unaware.&quot;</description>

    <measure>Self-Compassion</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed using the 12-item validated Self-Compassion Scale Short Form (SCS-SF); Participants indicate how they typically act towards themselves in difficult times using a 5-point Likert scale with 1 being &quot;Almost Never&quot; to 5 being &quot;Almost Always&quot;. The total self-compassion score is calculated by reverse scoring the negative subscale items -self-judgment, isolation, and over-identification (i.e., 1 = 5, 2 = 4, 3 = 3, 4 = 2, 5 = 1) then computing a total mean.</description>
