  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, patients who are going to undergo endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) or
      surgery for early gastric cancer will be enrolled and divided into ESD group and Surgery
      group according to the procedure they go through. The patients will be followed up for at
      least 5 years after ESD or surgery. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EDG) and biopsy will be
      performed 3 months and then 6 months after ESD or surgery. Thereafter, EDG will be performed
      along with biopsy and abdominal computed tomography annually up to 5 years. Patients' data
      such as age, sex, clinical diagnosis, achievement of en-bloc resection, pathological
      outcomes, complications and survival condition will be prospectively collected. Statistical
      methods such as Student's t-test, the chi-square test, the Kaplan-Meier method and the
      log-rank test will be used to compare the short term and long term outcomes between the ESD
      group and the surgery group.

    <description>Endoscopic submucosal dissection is an endoscopic procedure which can achieve en bloc resection of GI tumor. ESD is characterized by three steps: injecting fluid into the submucosa to elevate the lesion from the muscle layer, circumferential cutting of the surrounding mucosa of the lesion, and subsequent dissection of the connective tissue of the submucosa beneath the lesion. The ESD procedure will be carried out by experienced endoscopists.</description>

    <description>Surgery for EGC include Distal, proximal, or total gastrectomy, which will be performed according to the location and macroscopic tumor type by experienced surgeons.</description>
