  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study was a multicentre, observational, cross-sectional, open and monitored trial
      involving 274 females who were subject to an examination using liquid crystal contact
      thermography device as a complementary tool to standard diagnostic imaging procedures of the
      breast glands. The study was conducted in specialist outpatient clinics. Patients were
      eligible to participate in the study upon signing the informed consent form. There was no
      follow up after the thermographic examination.

      The study will comprise of a single registration of thermographic images of the breasts which
      will be subjected to automatic and expert analysis by radiologists.

        Women were eligible if they underwent a breast ultrasound (with outcome BIRADS 1-5), had no
        breast surgery over the previous year, no core biopsy over the previous 3 months, no
        previously-diagnosed breast cancer, were not pregnant or lactating, and had no
        symptoms/signs of local or generalized infection. Those recruited signed an informed
        consent form that also gave permission to use medical information (clinical
        characteristics, ultrasound, mammography and pathology findings) for study purposes. A
        total of 274 women, 25 years of age and older, were recruited consecutively between June
        2015 and April 2016. Mammography was performed in some patients below 50 years and in all
        women of 50 years or over. The thermographic examination was performed after breast
        ultrasound.
