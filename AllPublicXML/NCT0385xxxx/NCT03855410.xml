  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to develop tobacco modules to be included in an innovative mobile-health
      (mHealth) intervention (hereon referred to as S4E) and to determine the feasibility and
      preliminary efficacy of the updated version of S4E in an urban youth-centered community
      health clinic in Southeast Michigan.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tobacco use remains a significant public health concern in the US, and youth are
      disproportionately affected. Among high school youth , 38% report lifetime cigarette use, and
      9.3% report having smoked a whole cigarette before the age of 13. In Southeast Michigan,
      African-American youth are at disproportionate risk of engaging in tobacco use and
      co-occuring substance use and other risk behaviors. To address these significant public
      health concerns, we developed Storytelling 4 Empowerment (S4E), a targeted and tailored
      mobile-health (mHealth) application (app) intervention to be delivered in health clinic
      settings. The proposed research aims to develop culturally congruent and developmentally
      appropriate modules focused on tobacco use prevention and risk reduction to be included as
      part of the S4E mHealth app. The proposed research will also determine the preliminary
      efficacy of S4E in reducing tobacco use, alcohol and other drug use, sexual risk behaviors,
      and improving HIV/STI testing in a sample (n=50) of youth ages 13-21 living in Southeast
      Michigan.

    <description>Participants in the S4E group will receive the tobacco modules via iPads in a private room. The intervention will last approximately 20 minutes. Content includes the theoretically driven components of S4E: (a)Storytelling scenarios, (b) an introduction video, tobacco use knowledge development, (c) interactive activities, (d) increasing self-efficacy to prevent tobacco use, (e) clinician-youth communication, and (f) highlighting prevention principles. Participants in this group also receive usual care. The Clinic's usual care includes a standard risk behaviors intake form, pamphlets highlighting resources on sexual, physical, and mental health, and other healthcare services. Adolescents will be compensated $20 at baseline and $40 at 30-day follow-up. To minimize bias, randomization will occur prior to baseline assessment.</description>

    <description>The face-to-face version of S4E (i.e., Storytelling for Empowerment) is registered as a best-practice with the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration's (SAMHSA) National Registry of Evidence-Based Practices and Programs.The S4E mHealth app was developed in collaboration with youth in Southeast Michigan. Content produced for the application is based on scientific prevention principles in conjunction with youth input. To date, we have developed modules focused on youth alcohol and drug use, HIV and STIs. We now propose to develop modules focused on tobacco prevention and cessation. S4E aims to increase self-efficacy and communication about health risk behaviors. The face-to-face version of S4E has been shown to prevent and reduce substance use, including cigarette use, as well as increase (1) substance use prevention knowledge, (2) communication about health risk behaviors, and (3) perception of harm and self-efficacy in refusing licit and illicit substances.</description>
