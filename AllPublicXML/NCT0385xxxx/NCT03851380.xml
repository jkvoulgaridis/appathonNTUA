  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Repetitive pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a noninvasive treatment that
      involves stimulating the brain; however, treatment benefit depends on placing a TMS coil in
      the correct place on the head to reach critical brain regions below. Clinicians typically use
      scalp-based targeting, a process in which rather than using MRI guidance to target brain
      regions for stimulation, they use landmarks on the scalp. Several researchers, including the
      investigators' lab, showed that the current scalp-based targeting techniques do not position
      stimulation above the correct brain region, and patients fail to respond. The investigators
      propose to improve clinical scalp-based targeting by comparing it to MRI guided targeting.
      The most common clinical population receiving rTMS therapy is depressed patients. The
      investigators' plan is to study the accuracy of certain scalp-based rules in patients with
      depression. Accurate brain stimulation targeting is critical for effective rTMS therapy.

      Potential participants are first identified and contact is made. Potential participants are
      then screened for inclusionary and exclusionary information (see tab 9. Eligibility) that
      relate to whether they can safely and comfortably perform the procedures and whether they are
      considered healthy or have the disorder for which brain stimulation therapy will be
      delivered. They will undergo informed consent that will disclose all the different risks and
      benefits for the procedures they will undergo. The list of procedures in which participants
      consent to participate is below.

      PROCEDURES:

      The three procedures conducted at VA Palo Alto are as follows:

        1. Psychological / functional assessments:

           Interview, computerized, and paper and pencil measures of psychological functioning.
           These measures are used to characterize patients' diagnosis and psychological status.
           For example, depressed patients will answer questions about depressive symptoms and
           potentially comorbid symptoms such as post-traumatic stress disorder. This testing
           typically lasts 2 hours.

        2. MRI and functional MRI Patients will undergo an MRI that indicates where they receive
           stimulation by a marker placed on a cap that displays brightly on an MRI. At Lucas
           center or the Palo Alto VA and involves brain imaging that will be related to brain
           stimulation techniques either through facilitating image guidance or providing
           information that will be correlated to data collected during stimulation. Typically, a
           session lasts about 2.5 hours since there is setup time involved.

        3. Brain Stimulation:

      TMS-transcranial magnetic stimulation which will be collected at the Palo Alto VA. Part of
      this procedure may include electromyography (EMG) which involves placing electrodes on the
      skin, typically the hand, and measuring indicators of muscle contraction. Sometimes this
      information is used to decide stimulation intensity during TMS and sometimes the TMS induced
      response will be a source of data in itself. Typically, this is only a measure conducted in
      parallel with other procedures and thus will not be given its own consent. MRI Guided TMS. An
      MRI will be used to target a selective brain region. To accomplish this, the MRI will be
      displayed on a computer screen and an infrared camera enables identification of the
      correspondence between the image and the participant's head. To study errors in scalp-based
      targeting, the investigators will perform scalp targeting while under MRI guidance but
      without the typical visual feedback provided by the MRI. Then this will be compared to scalp
      targeting with MRI guidance. The difference will identify typical errors in scalp targeting.
      Typically, a session will last approximately 1.5 hours.

          2. Ability to obtain a Motor Threshold (MT) with single pulse TMS.

          3. Ability to safely and comfortably undergo an MRI and TMS.

          4. Able to read, verbalize, understand and voluntarily sign the Informed Consent Form
             prior to participating in any study-specific procedures or assessments.

          5. Depression (PHQ-9 &gt;= 10 and functional impairment present indicated with &quot;difficulty&quot;

          6. Confirmed diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD).

          7. Can maintain all existing treatments (e.g. psychopharmacology, psychotherapy, etc.,)
             throughout course of the three sessions (psychological / functional assessments, MRI,
             and TMS), with modifications only as needed for clinical management.

          8. Is a Veteran.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants who can not safely and comfortably undergo MRI OR TMS

          -  If they are left handed or their language is not primarily English they may be
             excluded depending on how dependent the imaging and cognitive tasks are on language

               -  Additionally, participants may be excluded if English is not their primary
                  language and they therefore do not fully understand the consenting process

          -  Inability to safely and comfortably undergo an MRI and TMS

               -  An example of safety screen details for an MRI is detailed in the Stanford
                  University MRI screening form

          -  MRI exclusions include having any non-removable device or implant that makes scanning
             unsafe, claustrophobia, and size (e.g. weight, girth) beyond the constraints of the
             MRI and scanner bed

          -  For TMS the investigators will follow safety guidelines set by Rossi et. al.,2009

               -  Specifically, the investigators will not include subjects whose Motor Threshold
                  (MT) is greater than 84% of maximum device output because mathematically they
                  would not be able to be safely stimulated using the standard 120% of MT (i.e. the
                  device cannot stimulate more than 100% of its potential output)

               -  The investigators will report these high MT data in our secondary analyses.
                  Additional TMS exclusions include any history or condition that puts patients at
                  risk for a seizure

          -  Pregnant or lactating female or planning to become pregnant within the next 3 months

          -  Lifetime history of moderate or severe traumatic brain injury, current unstable
             medical conditions, current (or past if appropriate) significant neurological
             disorder, or lifetime history of:

               -  seizure disorder

               -  primary or secondary CNS tumors

               -  stroke

               -  cerebral aneurysm

          -  Significant cognitive impairment (Montreal Cognitive Assessment [MoCA] &lt; 16)

          -  Comorbidities (e.g. PTSD) determined not to be the primary diagnosis

          -  Have a lifetime diagnosis of schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder,
             schizophreniform, delusional disorder, or current psychotic symptoms

          -  Have a diagnosis of obsessive-compulsive disorder, anxiety disorder (generalized
             anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, panic disorder), or dysthymia assessed by a
             study investigator to be primary and causing greater impairment than MDD

          -  Have active suicidal intent or plan in which case Dr. Rosen will determine whether the
             patient needs to be referred for hospitalization

          -  Presence of any other condition or circumstance that, in opinion of the investigator
             team, has the potential to prevent study completion and/or to have a confounding
             effect on outcome assessments
