  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The RTS, S/AS01E vaccine has been developed for routine immunization of children living in
      malaria-endemic countries of sub-Saharan Africa. This study is intended as a
      post-implementation safety study (after vaccine implementation), with the primary objective
      to evaluate the safety of vaccine after its administration. In addition to the primary
      objective, the study will also evaluate the impact and effectiveness of the vaccine.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Active surveillance refers to the screening for adverse events of special interest (AESI) and
      other diseases during study follow-up visits at the community level.

      Enhanced hospitalisation surveillance is defined as case detection during hospitalisation
      through monitoring of medical records and registries.

      The study targets enrolling at least 45,000 children in active surveillance, including 22,500
      in the exposed clusters and 22,500 in the unexposed clusters for evaluation of the vaccine
      safety, effectiveness and impact. In the exposed clusters are included a minimum of 20,250
      children vaccinated with RTS,S/AS01E for evaluation of the vaccine safety, and a minimum of
      2,250 unvaccinated children for evaluation of effectiveness and impact. Assuming that of the
      22,500 study participants, 80% will receive three doses of RTS,S/AS01E, 10% will receive one
      or two doses and 10% will not have any dose.

        The study population includes children &lt; 5 years of age. Children will be enrolled into
        active and enhanced hospitalisation surveillance from both exposed and unexposed clusters.

        For active surveillance, approximately 22,500 children in the exposed clusters, including a
        minimum of 20,250 children vaccinated with RTS,S/AS01E, and a minimum of 2,250 unvaccinated
        children, are targeted to be enrolled. Approximately, 22,500 children in the unexposed
        clusters will be enrolled into the active surveillance when presenting for administration
        of DTP/HepB/Hib vaccine.

        Children under the age of 5 years within the study areas, not already enrolled in the
        active surveillance, or not eligible for active surveillance will be enrolled into enhanced
        hospitalisation surveillance.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Study participants' parent(s)/ LAR(s) who, in the opinion of the investigator, can and
             will comply with the requirements of the protocol.

          -  Written informed consent provided from either the parent(s) or LAR of the study
             participant.

          -  Study participant living in the HDSS or equivalent surveillance system area.

          -  For enrolment in the active surveillance - DTP group: children must be aged &lt;18
             months, identified at any administration of DTP/HepB/Hib (or at hospitalisation before
             3rd dose of DTP/HepB/Hib in case of hospitalisation and vaccinated with at least one
             dose of DTP/HepB/Hib). (This group will include children from exposed and unexposed
             clusters.) OR For enrolment in the active surveillance - Catch-up group: children must
             be aged &lt; 18 months, received at least one dose of DTP/HepB/Hib vaccine, whose age
             corresponds to the age after the 3rd dose of DTP/HepB/Hib vaccine and identified at
             administration of first dose of RTS,S/AS01E vaccine. (This group will include children
             from exposed clusters only.) OR For enrolment in the enhanced hospitalisation
             surveillance: children must be aged &lt; 5 years and hospitalised at any time during the
             study. (This group will include children from exposed and unexposed clusters.)

             not having completed the visits for DTP/HepB/Hib, and first identified during
             hospitalisation, must first be proposed enrolment in active surveillance (if
             recruitment is not completed).

        Children already enrolled in active surveillance will have hospitalisation monitored as
        part of the procedures related to the active surveillance and can therefore not be enrolled
        in enhanced hospitalisation surveillance.
