  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In obese patients, the prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is around 40% in men and
      30% in women. Weight loss after bariatric surgery significantly improves OSA, with 75% of
      patients having a reduction in OSA severity or becoming non-apneic. We hypothesize a similar
      effect on OSA of nutritional and psychocomportemental rehabilitation for obese patients.
      However, we expect weight loss and blood pressure reduction to probably be lower in obese
      patients who have OSA and nutritional rehabilitation alone than in those who are treated for
      their OSA or are without OSA. To address this question, we will conduct an observational
      study on obese patients, treated or not for OSA, following nutritional and
      psychocomportemental rehabilitation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In obese patients, OSA prevalence is around 40% in men and 30% in women. Being overweight or
      obese are independent risk factors for OSA, and the prevalence increases with body mass index
      (BMI). Weight loss after bariatric surgery is one treatment for OSA, 75% of patients having a
      reduction in OSA severity or becoming non-apneic. OSA and obesity both induce type 2
      diabetes, hypertension and/or nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). A randomized study
      (Chirinos et al. NEJM 2014) demonstrated a better improvement in blood pressure, triglyceride
      levels or insulin resistance with weight loss alone or weight loss associated with continuous
      positive airway pressure (CPAP) than with CPAP alone. We hypothesize a similar effect of
      nutritional and psychocomportemental rehabilitation on OSA. However, weight loss and blood
      pressure improvements could be lesser in untreated OSA patients than in treated OSA or
      non-OSA patients. It has been demonstrated that bariatric surgery reduces medication use such
      as antihypertensive or antidiabetic drugs, and thus a secondary objective is to determine
      whether nutritional and psychocomportemental rehabilitation similarly reduces medication use
      by the overweight and obese.
