  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Phase Ib/II, open-label, multicenter, non-randomized study will evaluate the safety,
      efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of idasanutlin when it is given in combination with cytarabine
      and daunorubicin in induction, in combination with cytarabine in consolidation, and as a
      single agent in maintenance for treating participants with acute myeloid leukemia (AML).
