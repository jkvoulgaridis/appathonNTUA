  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Women who attend for their screening mammogram will be recalled if an abnormality is detected
      on the screening mammogram. Calcifications account for 20% of the women recalled to second
      stage screening. Currently there is no effective imaging tool to determine if the
      calcifications are cancer or not. Therefore, 90% of women will be subjected to a biopsy.
      25-30% of the biopsies will show cancer. Contrast enhanced spectral mammography (CESM) is
      where contrast is given and then a mammogram performed. The theory is that high risk DCIS and
      invasive cancers have an increased blood supply and will therefore enhance more than benign
      lesions within the breast. If CESM can identify calcifications that are cancerous then we
      maybe able to reduce the number of women who have benign biopsies. This is patient focused as
      women would not require a biopsy and be able to be reassured at the same visit. This is also
      a cost-saving for the Trust by reducing unnecessary biopsies. This also supports the findings
      of the Marmot review by aiming to reduce harm by over-diagnosis.

    <description>Contrast enhanced spectral mammography (CESM) will be undertaken in addition to routine practice.
CESM is a specialist mammography test that aims to 'highlight' areas of concern within the breast in more detail than a standard mammogram.
The difference between CESM and a standard mammogram (x-ray of the breast) is the use of a special dye (called contrast medium) that is injected into the veins before the mammogram images are taken. The contrast enhanced images give more detailed information to the breast radiologists (expert doctors trained to analyse breast imaging).</description>
