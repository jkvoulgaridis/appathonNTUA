    <textblock>
      Right ventricular pacing (RVP) causes left ventricular mechanical dyssynchrony by inducing
      electrical interventricular and intraventricular dyssynchrony. His bundle pacing may restore
      the the atrioventricular, interventricular and intraventricular electrical synchronization,
      however, Increased pacing threshold might result in the early depletion of the pacemaker, and
      finally brought on pacemaker replacement, which was one of the major causes of device
      infection. Pacing the left bundle branch beyond the conduction block site might achieve a low
      and stable output and narrow QRSd. The investigators were prepared to consecutively include
      patients with atrioventricular block, divided into the left bundle branch area pacing(LBBAP)
      group and the conventional right ventricular pacing group. The electrophysiological
      characteristics of LBBAP and right ventricular pacing were compared with ECG characteristics.
      The left and right ventricular synchrony and left and right cardiac function were evaluated
      by 3D ultrasound, and the short-term and long-term safety and efficacy of LBBAP were
      evaluated.

      This study is intended to be included in Fuwai hospital for admission to the atrioventricular
      block, with permanent pacemaker implant indications recommended by current guidelines.
      Patients were assessed for preoperative electrocardiogram, quality of life scores, cardiac
      function, and left and right ventricular synchrony. Patients were followed up by regular
      outpatients. The electrocardiogram, quality of life score, echocardiographic function, left
      and right ventricular synchrony, pacing parameters and pacing ratio were evaluated
      immediately after surgery, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months after surgery. At the same time,
      the left bundle branch area pacing success rate, complications during intraoperative and
      postoperative follow-up were recorded.
