  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this feasibility study, the investigators will randomize preterm infants born at &lt;32 weeks
      gestation to either the standard practice of delayed cord clamping (DCC) for 30-60 seconds at
      birth or milking of the long-cut cord (MOCC) while providing resuscitation/stabilization to
      the infant. The main objectives of the trial are to assess the feasibility of the new
      approach (MOCC) and to compare the two groups regarding the hemoglobin levels on admission to
      NICU in addition to neonatal morbidity and mortality.

    <description>The OB provider will hold the baby at/below the placenta, provide warmth, stimulate the baby and suction the mouth/nose for 30 secs.S/He will then clamp and cut the cord about 5 cm from the the introitus (vaginal deliveries) or from the abdominal incision (C-Sections) before handing the baby with the long-cut cord to the neonatal team to resuscitate/ stabilize the baby. A member of the neonatal team will milk the long-cut cord slowly 1 time from the cut end toward the infant over 10 secs before clamping and cutting the cord 1-2 cm from the umbilical stump. The neonatal team will provide PPV to the baby (during the milking process) if the baby is not breathing. If the baby is breathing during the milking process the team will continue the stabilization as per standard NRP practice.</description>

After these initial 30 seconds, if the baby is breathing then the obstetrician will continue DCC for a total of 60 seconds before clamping and cutting the cord close to the umbilicus and handing over the baby to the neonatal team for further stabilization as per standard NRP practice. If the baby is not breathing after the initial 30 seconds of DCC, then the OB provider will clamp and cut the cord close to the umbilicus and hand over the baby to the neonatal team to continue resuscitation of the baby as per the standard NRP guidelines.</description>
