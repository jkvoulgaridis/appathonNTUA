  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to study the effects of the Life Story Book intervention on
      depressive symptoms and meaning in life for mentally alert residents of nursing homes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Two nursing homes were recruited to participate. One nursing home will receive the Life Story
      Book intervention while the other half receives Usual Care intervention. The interventions
      were then switched, and the participants who received Usual Care intervention received the
      Life Story Book intervention while the home that received Life Story Book intervention
      received Usual Care intervention. The study consisted of two treatment periods of 3 weeks
      separated by a washout period of 1 week.

      Life Story Book provides a person with the opportunity to chronologically share their life
      experiences and memories. This three-1 hour reminiscence intervention is designed to provide
      a person with the opportunity to review their past and capture their life story into
      something tangible. The Life Story Book includes a combination of written information,
      photographs of significant people, places or events, and personal narratives from the stages
      of life that the person would like to include.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Mean Scores for Geriatric Depression Scale at 3 Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Geriatric Depression Scale (Residential) (GDS-12R) is a validated, self-reported instrument assessing depression over the past 7 days. It is a &quot;yes/no&quot; format. Possible scores range from 0 (no depressive symptoms) to 10 (depression). A score of 0 to 4 is normal; scores ≥ 4 are significant for depressive symptoms; scores ≥ 08 is almost always indicative of depression. A score ≥ 5 points should warrant a follow-up comprehensive assessment.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Mean Scores for Meaning in Life Questionnaire Sub-Scale Presence of Meaning (POM) at 3 Weeks.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Meaning in Life was measured using the Meaning in Life Questionnaire (MLQ), created by Steger et al. The MLQ has two sub-scales which assess the presence of meaning (POM) (how much a person feels their life has meaning) and the search for meaning (how much a person strives to find meaning and understanding in their life). The two sub-scale measures, which consist of 10 items on a 7-point Likert scale, range from 1-absolutely true to 7-absolutely untrue: five items for presence of meaning (POM) and five items for search for meaning (SFM).
A POM score &gt; 24 indicates the person feels their life has meaning and purpose.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Mean Scores for Meaning in Life Questionnaire Sub-Scale Search for Meaning (SFM) at 3 Weeks</measure>

An SFM score of &lt; 24 indicates the person is not seeking meaning in their life.</description>

Clients are scored yes/no for independence in each of the six functions. A score of 6 indicates full function, 4 indicates moderate impairment, and 2 or less indicates severe functional impairment. 6 = High (patient independent) 0 = Low (patient very dependent).
The mean score and standard deviation for each nursing home (A and B) was calculated to compare the physical functioning ability of each home's participants.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Mean Scores for Geriatric Depression Scale at 3 Weeks</title>
        <description>The Geriatric Depression Scale (Residential) (GDS-12R) is a validated, self-reported instrument assessing depression over the past 7 days. It is a &quot;yes/no&quot; format. Possible scores range from 0 (no depressive symptoms) to 10 (depression). A score of 0 to 4 is normal; scores ≥ 4 are significant for depressive symptoms; scores ≥ 08 is almost always indicative of depression. A score ≥ 5 points should warrant a follow-up comprehensive assessment.</description>

A multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA) models with the GDS-12R at baseline as the covariate, and the treatment group and study site as factors.

        <title>Change From Baseline in Mean Scores for Meaning in Life Questionnaire Sub-Scale Presence of Meaning (POM) at 3 Weeks.</title>
        <description>Meaning in Life was measured using the Meaning in Life Questionnaire (MLQ), created by Steger et al. The MLQ has two sub-scales which assess the presence of meaning (POM) (how much a person feels their life has meaning) and the search for meaning (how much a person strives to find meaning and understanding in their life). The two sub-scale measures, which consist of 10 items on a 7-point Likert scale, range from 1-absolutely true to 7-absolutely untrue: five items for presence of meaning (POM) and five items for search for meaning (SFM).
A POM score &gt; 24 indicates the person feels their life has meaning and purpose.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Mean Scores for Meaning in Life Questionnaire Sub-Scale Search for Meaning (SFM) at 3 Weeks</title>
        <description>Meaning in Life was measured using the Meaning in Life Questionnaire (MLQ), created by Steger et al.The MLQ has two sub-scales which assess the presence of meaning (how much a person feels their life has meaning) and the search for meaning (how much a person strives to find meaning and understanding in their life). The two sub-scale measures, which consist of 10 items on a 7-point Likert scale, range from 1-absolutely true to 7-absolutely untrue: five items for presence of meaning (POM) and five items for search for meaning (SFM).
An SFM score of &lt; 24 indicates the person is not seeking meaning in their life.</description>
