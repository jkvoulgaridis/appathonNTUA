  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this registry is to evaluate the indication for EndoVenous Laser Ablation (EVLA)
      therapy. Can this be enhanced? What are the reasons for not using the laser? Therefore, this
      study aims to define clear indications for EVLA by registering the incentives of the
      participating investigators to use the laser instead of conventional corrective surgery for
      the treatment of varicose veins, at baseline and post-operative. Additionally, the efficacy
      and safety of the different varicose vein treatments will be evaluated by registering
      procedural characteristics, anatomic outcome (duplex ultrasound), quality of life (AVVQ) and
      postoperative pain (VAS).

    <description>The participating investigators will register the incentives (based on clinical examination and/or anatomic outcome by duplex ultrasound, as well as secondary considerations) to use laser ablation or conventional treatment for varicose veins in the study database in order to define clear indications for EndoVenous Laser Ablation (EVLA) treatment of varicose veins and to investigate whether the use of EVLA can be enlarged.</description>

    <description>The VAS scale contains a 0 - 100 grading with 0 equaling no pain and 100 equaling the worst conceivable pain.

Pain is classified into mild (1 - 30 mm), moderate (31 - 60 mm) and severe (61 - 100 mm). Absence of pain is defined as VAS = 0.</description>
