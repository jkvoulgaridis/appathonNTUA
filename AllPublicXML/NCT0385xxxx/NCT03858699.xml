  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate brain signals relating to motor function, using
      electroencephalography (EEG) technology. The aims of the study can be separated into 3
      specific study objectives:

        1. Record EEG data from control participants and individuals with stroke during basic motor
           tasks and build a database of EEG signals to enable analysis of motor control.

        2. Apply signal processing algorithms to extract EEG features related to motor control.

        3. Develop a framework/the motor score (M-Score) that uses the EEG signals, in combination
           with machine learning approaches, to quantify motor control ability.

    <measure>Resting state EEG measures</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>EEG uses scalp sensors to monitor the brain's electrical activity. EEG sensors are placed on the scalp and passively record neural activity with high time resolution. The principal recording system for this study will be a 32-channel g.Nautilus EEG system (g.tec medical engineering). Secondary recording systems may be used: 8-channel g.Nautilus EEG system (g.tec medical engineering) and 64-channel, high-density BrainAmp EEG system (BrainProducts).Participants will be seated while wearing the EEG cap and asked to sit quietly with either eyes open (with a fixation dot or cross to reduce eye movements) or eyes closed. Resting state recordings will be approximately 5-10 minutes in length.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Motor task EEG measures</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>While completing EEG scans, participants will be asked to execute simple motor movements. . Study will focus on finger tapping task (with mouse-like button for recording movement timing). Participants will be asked to complete self-paced movements with approximately 10-15 second inter-trial spacing. Recording will occur in two-minute intervals, followed by a rest period, repeated until approximately 40 trials have been collected. Other motor movements, such as flexion of the upper limbs or flexion of the lower limbs, may also be considered. During EEG recordings changes in motor oscillations (alpha, beta, &amp; gamma range) will be analyzed. During EMG recordings, muscle tonicity/spasticity and functional firing patterns will be analyzed.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Imagery task EEG measures</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>During EEG recording participants could be asked to engage in mental imagery of motor movements stated above. Here, potential changes in oscillatory patterns in the motor cortex will be measured and detected.</description>
