  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study to evaluate peripheral vibrotactile coordinated reset stimulation for
      Parkinson's disease seeks to explore the safety and efficacy of an experimental non-invasive
      method to aid in the symptoms of Parkinson's disease. The purpose of the study is to verify
      the safety and tolerability of non-painful sensory (tactile) vibratory stimulation delivered
      to the fingertips of patients with Parkinson's disease.

      This study aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a non-invasive, experimental method to
      aid in the symptoms of Parkinson's disease. A glove device produces non-painful sensory
      (tactile) vibratory stimulation to the fingertips of Parkinson's patients. Participants will
      either be randomized to receive the real stimulation, or fake (&quot;sham&quot;) stimulation. This will
      help investigators compare durability and efficacy of the tactile stimulation to current
      medical therapy. Participants randomized to the &quot;sham&quot; arm will be allowed to receive the
      real stimulation after 3 months of follow-up. All patients will be followed for total of 6
      months (both real and sham stimulation groups). If the results of this study suggest that
      vibrotactile CR stimulation is safe and effective for the treatment of Parkinson's disease,
      this non-invasive treatment approach would have a substantial impact on Parkinson's disease.
