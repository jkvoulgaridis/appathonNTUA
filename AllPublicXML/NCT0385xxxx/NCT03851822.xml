    <textblock>
      Chronic Critical Illness (CCI) is a condition associated to patients surviving an acute phase
      of disease and respiratory failure (ARF) although remaining dependent on mechanical
      ventilation (MV). The prevalence and the underlying mechanisms of CCI have not been
      elucidated in this population.An observational prospective cohort study was undertaken at the
      Respiratory Intensive Care Unit (RICU) of the University Hospital of Modena (Italy) from
      January 2016 to January 2018. Patients mechanically ventilated with ARF in this unit were
      enrolled. Demographics, diagnosis, severity scores (APACHEII, SOFA, SAPSII) and clinical
      conditions (septic shock, infections, acute respiratory distress syndrome [ARDS]) were
      recorded on admission. Respiratory mechanics and inflammatory-metabolic blood parameters were
      recorded on admission and within the first seven days of stay. All these variables were
      tested as potential predictors of CCI through appropriate univariate and multivariate
      analysis.
