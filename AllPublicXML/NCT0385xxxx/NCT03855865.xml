    <time_frame>Baseline to end of Week 6</time_frame>
    <description>The MADRS, a clinician-rated scale, will be used to assess depressive symptomatology. Participants are rated on 10 items to assess feelings of sadness, lassitude, pessimism, inner tension, suicidality, reduced sleep or appetite, difficulty concentrating, and lack of interest. Each item will be scored on a 7-point scale. A score of 0 indicates the absence of symptoms, and a score of 6 indicates symptoms of maximum severity.</description>
