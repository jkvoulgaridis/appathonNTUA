      Background:

      Central venous catheters are frequently used during cancer treatment with the aim of
      venepreservation. It can facilitate venous access for the safe administration of irritating
      or vesicant intravenous cancer medications and / or other fluids, to collect blood samples or
      to ensure accurate venous access for contrast during medical imaging. In addition, this means
      more comfort for the patient who needs to be punctured less peripherally. However, central
      venous catheters can also be a source of bloodstream infections and other complications,
      leading to increased morbidity and hospital costs (1). In our hospital, there is a general
      practice that if an infection of the device is suspected, the central venous catheter should
      be removed if antibiotics do not seem or prove to be effective.

      The objective of this trial is to assess the frequency of implanted port catheter-removal in
      cancer patients due to suspected infection of the device in a particular oncology center over
      a time period of seven years. Furthermore, evidence for real device infections
      (per/post-surgery) and the potential contribution of different (institution-specific) risk
      factors on device infection will be explored. There will be focused on implanted port
      catheters only, as this is the main used central venous access device within the oncological
      population.

      Trial objectives:

      The primary aim of this retrospective descriptive trial is to evaluate the frequency of
      implanted port catheter-removal in cancer patients due to suspected infection of the device,
      over a time period of seven years.

      The secondary aim is to examine whether the device infection could be confirmed during or
      after removal of the device.

      At last, the tertiary aim is to verify whether certain variables can be denoted as potential
      risk factors for central venous access infection. Selection of those variables of interest
      will be based on a thorough review of the literature and discussion with the responsible
      healthcare professionals.
