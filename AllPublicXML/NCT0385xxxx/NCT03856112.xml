    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial studies the best dose and side effects of venetoclax and how well it
      works in combination with ixazomib and dexamethasone in treating patients with t(11;14)
      negative multiple myeloma that has come back or does not respond to treatment. Ixazomib may
      stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs
      used in chemotherapy, such as venetoclax and dexamethasone work in different ways to stop the
      growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by
      stopping them from spreading. It is not yet known how well venetoclax works with ixazomib and
      dexamethasone in treating patients with multiple myeloma.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the safety profile and tolerability of oral combination therapy with ixazomib
      citrate (ixazomib) (I), venetoclax (V), dexamethasone (D) in non-t(11;14) relapsed/refractory
      multiple myeloma (RRMM) with dose-escalating design to determine the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) and recommended phase II dose (RP2D). (Phase I) II. To compare overall response rate
      (ORR; measured as best response) of IVD and ID in a proteasome inhibitor (PI)-non-refractory
      cohort. (Phase II, Cohort 1) III. To evaluate ORR of IVD in PI-refractory cohort. (Phase II,
      Cohort 2)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To observe and record anti-tumor activity. II. To determine the rate of very good partial
      response (VGPR) or better. III. To determine time to progression (TTP). IV. To determine
      duration of response (DOR). V. To determine progression-free survival (PFS). VI. To determine
      overall survival (OS).

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To correlate and predict responses with the following tests, using bone marrow aspirate
      samples at (a) baseline and (b) during treatment on day 8 (or day 9 to allow for scheduling
      flexibility): BCL2, NOXA, and MCL1 by flow cytometry; polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for
      BCL2, BCL2L1 (=BCL-XL), and MCL-1 messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) expression, and
      BCL2:BCL2L1 and BCL2:MCL1 ratios; and Ex vivo Mathematical Myeloma Advisor (EMMA).

      II. To evaluate the drug exposure and to correlate with toxicities using venetoclax
      peripheral blood pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of venetoclax followed by a phase II study.
      PI non-refractory patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive ixazomib citrate orally (PO) on days 1, 8, and 15, venetoclax PO once
      daily (QD) on days 1-28 and dexamethasone PO on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Cycles repeat every 28
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients receive ixazomib citrate PO on days 1, 8, and 15, and dexamethasone PO on
      days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM III: PI-refractory patients receive ixazomib citrate, venetoclax and dexamethasone as Arm
      I.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for 30 days.

             treatment previously and cured (i.e., undetectable HCV viral load).

          -  Patients with treated brain metastases are eligible if there is no evidence of
             progression for at least 4 weeks after central nervous system (CNS)- directed
             treatment, as ascertained by clinical examination and brain imaging (magnetic
             resonance imaging [MRI] or computed tomography [CT] scan) during the screening period.

          -  Patients with new or progressive brain metastases (active brain metastases) or
             leptomeningeal disease are eligible if the treating physician determines that
             immediate central nervous system (CNS) specific treatment is not required and is
             unlikely to be required for at least 4 weeks (or scheduled assessment after the first
             cycle of treatment), and a risk-benefit analysis (discussion) by the patient and the
             investigator favors participation in the clinical trial.

          -  The effects of MLN9708 and venetoclax in combination with dexamethasone on the
             developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason and because corticosteroids like
             dexamethasone are known to be teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential and men
             must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control;
             abstinence) prior to study entry, for the duration of study participation, and 3
             months after completion of the administration of the study agents. Should a woman
             become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating
             in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.

          -  Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients who meet the following
             criteria will be considered eligible:

               -  CD4 count &gt; 350 cells/mm^3

               -  Undetectable viral load

               -  Maintained on modern therapeutic regimens (utilizing non-CYP-interactive agents)

               -  No history of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-defining opportunistic
                  infections.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have been previously treated with MLN9708 or venetoclax or other direct
             BCL2 inhibitor.

          -  Patients who have not recovered from adverse events due to prior anti-cancer therapy
             (i.e., have residual toxicities grade &gt; 1), except for grade 2 peripheral sensory
             neuropathy.

          -  Patients who are receiving any other anti-myeloma chemotherapy or radiotherapy,
             immunotherapy, or investigational agents within 2 weeks or 5 half-lives (whichever is
             longer and/or applicable) of the start of the trial.

          -  Patients receiving dexamethasone &gt;= 40 mg/day or equivalent of any corticosteroids
             within 2 weeks of the start of the trial.

          -  Patients with non-secretory MM, plasma cell leukemia (i.e., &gt;= 20% plasma cells in
             peripheral blood differential or &gt;= 2,000/mcL circulating plasma cells), symptomatic
             primary light chain (AL) amyloidosis, POEMS syndrome (polyneuropathy, organomegaly,
             endocrinopathy, monoclonal protein, and skin changes).

          -  Prior allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) within the last 12 months
             and evidence of active graft-versus-host disease (GVHD).

          -  Prior autologous HCT within the last 3 months.

          -  History of active malignancies other than MM within the last 2 years unless treated
             with curative intent and has no evidence of active disease. Basal cell carcinoma of
             the skin or localized squamous cell carcinoma of the skin are excluded from this
             criterion.

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to MLN9708, venetoclax, or dexamethasone. This includes boron and
             boron-containing products.

          -  Patients requiring chronic administration of any medications or substances that are
             strong inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4 enzyme are ineligible. Because the lists of
             these agents are constantly changing, it is important to regularly consult a
             frequently-updated medical reference. As part of the enrollment/informed consent
             procedures, the patient will be counseled on the risk of interactions with other
             agents, and what to do if new medications need to be prescribed or if the patient is
             considering a new over-the-counter medicine or herbal product.

          -  Patients with uncontrolled intercurrent illness.

          -  Female patients who are lactating or have a positive serum pregnancy test during the
             screening period are excluded from this study because MLN9708 is a proteasome
             inhibitor with the potential for embryo-lethal effects, and an unknown but potential
             risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with
             MLN9708. Patients must stop breastfeeding while on MLN9708 and until 90 days have
             passed since their last dose. These potential risks may also apply to other agents
             used in this study.
