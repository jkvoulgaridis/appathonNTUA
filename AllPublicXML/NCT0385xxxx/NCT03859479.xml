      Diagnostic colonoscopy will be performed in all patients. If a polyp, appropriate for
      inclusion criteria, is identified, an endoscopic polypectomy will be assigned. All eligible
      polyps will be randomly assigned (1:1) to endoscopic polypectomy with either the cold snare
      resection or hot snare resection (control group). Randomization will be stratified using
      random numbers. After resection, the marginal mucosa will be carefully observed with used of
      magnification and image enhancement (near focus imaging or narrow band imaging) for determine
      residual tissue. The time period when the snare will be entered in the bowel lumen and until
      a polyp will be retrieved will be recorded by a stopwatch.

      All polyps will be retrieved for morphological examination to estimate R0/R1resetion. After
      polypectomy all patients will be observed for 3-4 days in-hospital to diagnose and eliminate
      complications (delayed bleeding and perforations). All patients will have a control
      colonoscopy 6 months after polypectomy to investigate long-term results.

    <description>After a target polyp was identified, it should be placed at the comfortable position. Then the snare will be opened and encircled the polyp without air aspiration. Then, the snare will be captured the polyp with at least 1-2 mm of surrounding normal tissue. The polyp will be guillotined and would not be lifted or tented until complete closure is achieved. After resection, the mucosal defect the marginal mucosa was carefully observed, with used of magnification and image enhancement. If residual polyp tissue was recognised, additional removal using the cold snare technique or biopsy forceps will be performed. If a submucosal injection prior to snaring was necessary it will be permitted. After polypectomy all patients will be observed for 3-4 days in-hospital</description>
