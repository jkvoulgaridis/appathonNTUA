  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently there is no clinical biomarker that can be used to select patients for
      CCR2-targeted therapy and to monitor response to such therapy. Considering the toxicity and
      the rate of response to CCR2-targeted therapy, it is crucial to be able to identify patients
      who may not response to this therapy in order to avoid the morbidity and expense associated
      with ineffective therapy.

      Therefore, the combination of the novel CCR2 imaging agent with the novel CCR2-targeted
      therapy in this trial is of great importance to promote science while prolonging the life and
      its quality in patients with PDAC. The investigators also believe that this combination will
      make substantial contributions to the fields of cancer immunotherapy and tumor
      monocyte/macrophage biology. Moreover, this imaging agent has the potential to not only
      facilitate development and testing of future CCR2-targeted therapeutic agents but also serve
      as a prescreen tool to select appropriate patients for imaging guided treatment.

      Eligible subjects enroll to 1 of 2 cohorts. Cohort 1 is subdivided to cohort 1A and enrolls
      subjects with a new diagnosis of pancreatic cancer scheduled to undergo surgical resection.
      Cohort 1A subjects undergo 1 imaging session which consists of 1 injection of 64Cu-DOTA-ECL1i
      followed by PET/CT imaging at 2 time points: immediately following injection and 75 minutes -
      6 hours post injection. Cohort 1B subjects are newly diagnosed, recurrent or metastatic
      pancreatic cancer patients scheduled to undergo treatment with standard of care therapy.
      Cohort 1B subjects undergo 1 imaging session (same as cohort 1A) prior to beginning therapy
      and a second imaging session either half way through therapy or at recurrence depending on
      the results of the first imaging session. Cohort 2 subjects are newly diagnosed pancreatic
      cancer patients scheduled to undergo treatment with a CCR2 inhibitor under a companion
      treatment protocol. Cohort 2 subjects undergo 1 imaging session prior to beginning therapy
      and a second imaging session after 2 cycles of therapy. All enrolled subjects who have tissue
      available for testing from biopsy or surgical resection consent to tissue testing for
      correlative studies.

    <description>Visual tumor uptake as compared to background blood/tissue uptake: 1=no uptake, 2=mild uptake, 3=moderate uptake, and 5=striking update
A decrease in visual tumor uptake from baseline to post therapy imaging in cohort 2 subject is hypothesized to represent response to CCR2 directed therapy while an increase in tumor uptake is expected in cohort 1b subjects who progress while receiving standard therapy.</description>
