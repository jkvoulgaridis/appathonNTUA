  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, single-arm, multicenter, phase-IV trial investigating the safety of
      osimertinib in Indian adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic EGFR-T790M
      mutation-positive NSCLC.

      Prior to data collection, all patients must sign an informed consent form (ICF) allowing data
      collection and source data verification in accordance with local requirements and sponsor
      policy.

      Patients with metastatic EGFR T790M mutation-positive NSCLC, who are eligible to osimertinib
      treatment as per locally approved prescribing information and ratified by an independent
      clinical judgment of treating physician will be evaluated for the inclusion into the current
      phase-IV study based on eligibility criteria. EGFR T790M positivity on plasma or tissue
      biopsy on PCR-based platform will be considered appropriate test. EGFR T790M must be
      performed after progressive disease on last line of therapy (on or after EGFR TKI therapy).
      In order to enroll approximately 60 patients, it is expected that approximately 70 patients
      will be screened.
