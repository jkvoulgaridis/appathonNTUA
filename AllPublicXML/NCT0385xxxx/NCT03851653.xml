  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is characterized by the presence in the polysomnogram test of
      more than five apnoea-hypopnoea episodes per hour of sleep (apnoea-hypopnoea index, AHI &gt; 5),
      each episode lasting more than 10 seconds and being accompanied by oxygen desaturation or
      arousal. The prevalence of this syndrome is worryingly high (9% to 38%), affecting more men
      than women. OSA has an important negative impact on physical/psychological health and on
      these patient's quality of life. The gold-standard treatment for OSA is the continuous
      positive airway pressure (CPAP). However, CPAP compliance is really low, this device
      requiring a continuous chronic use in order to improve OSA and to avoid the relapse.
      Furthermore, it does not address OSA risk factors such as obesity and unhealthy lifestyle
      habits. Consequently, non‐surgical and non‐pharmacological interventions such as weight loss
      and lifestyle interventions are necessary and recommended by the American Academy of Sleep
      Medicine (AASM). The objective of this project, therefore, is the development and evaluation
      of a cognitive-behavioural treatment program for patients with moderate-severe OSA. The
      treatment will pursued weight loss through hypocaloric diet and moderate exercise, smoking
      and alcohol avoidance, and sleep hygiene. The efficacy of this treatment will be assessed in
      comparison with CPAP, in a short and medium term. This intervention could be considered a
      good alternative/combined management to the usual treatment of OSA (CPAP) once its efficacy
      to reduce and even cure OSA symptoms is demonstrated, especially if it is still effective in
      the long-term.

ESS is a 4-point scale (0 = no chance of dozing, 1 = slight chance of dozing, 2 = moderate chance of dozing, 3 = high chance of dozing) that measures the usual chances of dozing off or falling asleep while engaged in eight different activities. An ESS total score from 0 to 9 is considered to be normal while an ESS total score &gt; 9 indicates high daytime sleepiness.</description>
