  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate whether sending educational and supportive mobile phone text
      messages to mothers of infants, from babies' day of birth until 6 months of age, increases
      the rate of exclusive breastfeeding in Roatan, Honduras.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Encouraging and educational text messages and animations were created based on barriers to
      breastfeeding found during preceding focus groups and a baseline survey. Messages were
      written in English and translated into Spanish, with back-translation to ensure accuracy.
      Mothers who plan to or are already breastfeeding will be recruited and invited to participate
      in the study in the post-partum ward after delivery at Public Hospital Roat√°n. Written
      informed consent will be obtained. Three animated videos will be shown to mothers at
      enrollment providing information regarding breastfeeding technique, breastfeeding
      encouragement and general breastfeeding information. SMS messages will start at time of
      enrollment and continue through six months after enrollment. Messages will be delivered
      through Telerivet, an SMS interactive platform designed to send the educational and
      motivational messages to mothers' cell phones.

      The intervention group will be polled when infants turn two months, four months, and six
      months regarding their infant feeding practices through Telerivet via SMS messaging. The
      primary outcome of this study is exclusive breastfeeding at 2 months of age, as compared to
      the exclusive breastfeeding rate obtained in our baseline cross sectional survey. Exclusive
      breastfeeding will be defined as giving only mother's breastmilk in the 24 hours preceding
      the interview. Mothers will also be asked if they are breastfeeding at all, age of infant
      when they last gave breast milk, the incidence of diarrheal illness in the past two weeks,
      and any other foods / liquids given to infant.

    <description>From their babies' day of birth until 6 months of age, participating mothers will receive supportive and educational text messages to promote breastfeeding. Messages will be on benefits of breastfeeding, newborn hunger cues, proper latch technique, healthy infant feeding practice, and maternal self care. Messages will be sent regularly, initially several messages every day during the babies' first few weeks of life, then few messages every week. A total of 158 (***) messages will be sent. Messages will be sent in English or in Spanish depending on participant language preference.</description>
