      We aimed to show the difference between balance and gait parameters in heart failure and
      healthy individuals.

      Heart failure is the inability of the heart to pump a sufficient amount of blood into our
      body. The reason is usually the decrease in the contractile capacity of myocardium due to
      decreased coronary blood flow. Symptoms and symptoms may be quite diverse in the underlying
      pathophysiology of heart failure, which is usually the only type. As a result of heart
      failure; problems such as dyspnoea, anemia, peripheral edema, peripheral muscle involvement
      and decreased muscle mass, confusion, sleep disorder, dementia, various cardiac symptoms and
      renal failure can be seen.

      Balance body with minimal muscle activity in static or dynamic position on the support base
      is to maintain the center of gravity. Patients with heart failure may have decreased postural
      control, exercise intolerance, breathing problems, and decreased cognitive function.

      Gait analysis, evaluation of neuro musculoskeletal system functions and interpretation of
      results with numbers and graphs. Gait analysis is an analysis method that plays a role in
      many cases of clinical diagnosis and follow-up. Heart failure is characterized by a
      significant reduction in walking distance, which leads to reduced quality of life. In a study
      conducted in heart failure, it is stated that gait velocity is a determinant of one year
      mortality and hospitalization, and should be considered for clinical evaluations and
      prognosis. All these causes of heart failure in chronic disease groups defined considering it
      is important to investigate the balance and gait parameters.

      This study will show the difference between the balance and walking parameters in heart
      failure according to the healthy participants.

    <description>Balance Assesment will be evaluated with Mini-Balance Evaluation Systems Test (Mini-BESTest) The Mini-BESTest includes four subscales: transitions/anticipatory postural control, reactive postural control, sensory orientation and stability in gait. Each item is rated on a three-point ordinal scale (0 = severe to 2 = normal). t the MiniBESTest consists of 14 items, with a maximum score of 28 points. The Mini-BESTest takes 10 to 15 minutes to administer.</description>
