  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is one of the most deleterious adverse
      effect of neurotoxic anticancer drugs affecting up to 40% of patients. These neurotoxic
      anticancer agents include mainly: cisplatin (bronchopulmonary cancers), oxaliplatin
      (colorectal cancers), paclitaxel (breast cancers and bronchopulmonary cancers), docetaxel
      (breast cancers and bronchopulmonary cancers) and bortezomib (multiple myeloma).

      CIPN affects not only the quality of life of patients, it also has a major impact on oncology
      strategy, forcing oncologists to reduce dose-intensity, to stop an ongoing chemotherapy
      regimen and to change therapeutic strategies, with a risk of compromising patients' survival.

      There is no real preventive or curative treatment (except duloxetine) for CIPN and it is not
      known what is the practice of oncologists in France? However, it is essential to know the
      degree of sensitivity of oncologists to this problem and their practice.

      With this study, the investigators propose to assess the current practices of management by
      oncologists in France in 2019, for any type of practitioners of university hospital, or
      general hospital, for all type of neurotoxic anticancer drugs.

      This observational and cross-sectional study will be conducted as a survey using the REDCap
      software and the response to this survey will be done online, in real time, with an
      automatic, secure and centralized data collection (CHU Clermont-Ferrand).

      French oncologist will be contacted by email thanks to the regional cancer networks. Answer
      to the survey will be done online.
