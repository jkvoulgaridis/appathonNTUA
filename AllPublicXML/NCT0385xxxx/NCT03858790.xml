  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of spinal cord stimulation
      (SCS) using the PINS spinal cord stimulator device for chronic and intractable pain.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adult patients with chronic intractable pain of the trunk and/or limbs who are candidates for
      a treatment with spinal cord stimulation will be prospectively randomized into 2 arms. Spinal
      cord stimulation parameters are programmed and adjusted during outpatient clinic visits,
      within the normal clinical practice.
