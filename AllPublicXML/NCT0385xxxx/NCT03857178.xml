    <measure>The main outcome will be a categorisation of SABA prescription in asthma patients.</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months retrospective from index date</time_frame>
    <description>Mild asthma patients will be categorised into 5 groups according to the number of SABA and ICS prescriptions in the 12 months prior to their index date (initial exposure window):
No prescriptions for asthma inhalers
Appropriate SABA prescription with no ICS
Appropriate SABA prescription with ICS
SABA over-prescription with no ICS
SABA over-prescription with ICS
Moderate/severe asthma patients will be categorised into 2 groups according to the number of SABA and ICS prescriptions in the 12 months prior to their index date:
Appropriate SABA prescription on top of maintenance therapy
SABA over-prescription on top of maintenance therapy</description>

        The selection of sites and investigators will be made with the aim to achieve
        representativeness in the way asthma is managed in each participating country. The study
        will include patients from either primary care centres, or specialist centres involved in
        the management of asthma, or a mix of both within a country to ensure representativeness.
