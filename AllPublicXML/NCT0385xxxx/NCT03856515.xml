      This trial studies potential differences between men and women when switching from the use of
      combustible cigarettes to the National Institute on Drug Abuse's Standard Research
      E-Cigarette (SREC). Studying the differences between men and women may increase understanding
      about the effects of switching from smoking regular cigarettes to electronic cigarettes.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To characterize the effects of switching to nicotine vs. placebo standard research
      E-cigarettes (SRECs) from combustible cigarettes (CCs) on product use, product acceptability,
      reinforcement, and nicotine dependence symptoms among adult daily CC smokers.

      II. To characterize the differences between male and female CC smokers when switching to
      nicotine versus (vs.) placebo SRECs from CCs on product use, product acceptability,
      reinforcement, and nicotine dependence symptoms.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To characterize which factors moderate or mediate the effects of switching to nicotine and
      placebo SRECs from CCs among male and female CC smokers.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants will be instructed to smoke their usual brand cigarette as they normally would
      in weeks 1-2 (Phase I) and to use only the SREC (with or without nicotine) in weeks 3-4
      (Phase II) and in weeks 5-6 (Phase III). Participant assignment to SREC type at Phases II and
      III will be counter-balanced within group, with half of men and women receiving the placebo
      SREC during Phase II and half during Phase III. Participants will attend 4 laboratory visits
      with study investigators for 3 hours each over 6 weeks of study participation.

    <description>Cotinine is a major metabolite of nicotine, with 70% to 80% of nicotine metabolized to cotinine. While cotinine is less sensitive to acute fluctuations in nicotine intake due to its longer half-life, we will also include measures of nicotine for generalization of our findings to the broader literature.</description>

    <time_frame>All in-person sessions (weeks 0, 2, 4, and 6)</time_frame>
    <description>Explicit product liking will be measured using Product Evaluation Scales (PES), which are modified versions of the Cigarette Evaluation Scale. The CES is an 11-item questionnaire that evaluates the cigarette smoking experience in terms of satisfaction, tastiness, dizziness, ability to calm, concentration, wakefulness, reduction of hunger, nausea, irritability, enjoyment of sensations of smoke, and craving reduction.

    <description>To assess perceived product harm, we will administer modified Perceived Health Risk Questionnaires (PHRQs) that will assess participants' beliefs about their risks of developing lung cancer, emphysema, bronchitis, other cancers, heart disease, risk of addiction, and stroke on a scale of 1 (very low risk of disease) to 10 (very high risk of disease). These scales will be modified so that participants will assess the perceived risks associated with their UB CC, e-cigs (e-cigs &quot;in general&quot;) at each time point, and a SREC-specific version at weeks 4 &amp; 6 only.</description>
