      To assess the effect of a single dose of BI 1358894 compared to placebo on BOLD responses in
      modulating brain processing of emotional and cognitive stimuli on the amygdala and related
      brain structure using fMRI in in unmedicated patients with depression.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients having a diagnosis of a MDD according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of
             Mental Disorders-V (DSM-V) (single episode or recurrent) with a MADRS total score
             between ≥ 7 and &lt; 26 at screening.

          -  Male or female aged 18 to 45 years, inclusive at screening.

          -  Male or female patients. Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) and men able to
             father a child must be ready and able to use highly effective methods of birth
             control.

          -  Patients must be, in the opinion of the Investigator, capable of and eligible for
             completing the fMRI and tasks.

          -  Patients must be right-handed.

          -  Patients must have acceptable weight as defined by BMI (weight [kg]/height [m]²) range
             of 18 to 30 kg/m², inclusive at Visit 1.

          -  Patients must be a non-smoker or light smoker (≤ 5 cigarettes per day).

          -  Patients must have signed the informed consent form prior to the first study-related
             procedure indicating they understand the purpose of and procedures required for the
             study and are willing to participate in the study.

          -  Further inclusion criteria apply

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Meeting any diagnostic criteria for a major psychiatric disorder (other than MDD), as
             determined by DSM-V at screening.

          -  Has received a prescribed medication (including antidepressants) within 28 days prior
             to Visit 1 (apart from the contraceptive pill) or having received over the counter
             medication (including pain killers) within 10 days prior to screening. Participants
             who have taken prescription medication may still be entered into the study, if, in the
             opinion of the Investigator, the medication received will not interfere with the study
             procedures or compromise safety.

          -  Patients where it is foreseen (per investigator judgement) that a delay of initiation
             of standard of care therapy for the depressive disorder to 14 days after day 1 of
             Visit 2 is medically not justifiable.

          -  A history of alcohol or substance dependence or abuse within the last 12 months from
             Visit 1.

          -  Has a current or recent history of clinically significant suicidal ideation within the
             past 6 months, corresponding to a score of 4 or 5 for ideation on the C-SSRS, or a
             history of suicidal behavior within the past year, as validated by the C-SSRS at
             screening or treatment visit.

          -  Has a history of, or presents (in the opinion of the Investigator) with, significant
             neurological or psychiatric conditions (such as stroke, traumatic brain injury,
             seizures, space occupying lesions, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, vascular
             dementia, transient ischemic attack, schizophrenia, blackouts requiring
             hospitalisation).

          -  A planned medical treatment within the study period that might interfere with the
             study procedures.
