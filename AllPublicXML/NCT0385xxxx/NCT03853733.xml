  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many patients with rectal cancer were not candidates for surgical resection because advanced
      age, comorbidities, or multiple synchronous metastases. In this scenario only comfort
      measures or different palliative radiotherapy regimens are applied, from single doses to
      treatments lasting several weeks. The aim of this prospective study is to describe the
      preliminary results of our protocol of hypofractionated palliative radiotherapy in patients
      with non-operable rectal cancer.

      Many patients with rectal cancer were not candidates for surgical resection because advanced
      age, comorbidities, or multiple synchronous metastases. In this scenario only comfort
      measures or different palliative radiotherapy regimens are applied, from single doses to
      treatments lasting several weeks. The aim of this prospective study is to describe the
      preliminary results of our protocol of hypofractionated palliative radiotherapy in patients
      with non-operable rectal cancer.

      Patients with rectal cancer who were not candidates for surgical resection because advanced
      age, comorbidities, or multiple synchronous metastases at the time of diagnosis were
      considered eligible.

      Patients were immobilized in the prone position with a belly-board in order to reduce small
      bowel irradiation. To limit organ motion patient were instructed to empty the bladder and
      drink 500cm3 of water 45-60 minutes before CT simulation and before every treatment fraction.

      A conformal three-dimensional radiotherapy technique was planned to deliver to the primary
      tumor and the enlarged pelvic nodes a total dose of 39Gy in 13 sessions of 3Gy in 17 days.

      Symptomatic response after the end of treatment has been measured for bleeding and pain and
      acute toxicity were reported according to CTCAEv4.0 scale.
