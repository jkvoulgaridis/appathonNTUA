  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy and also
      pharmacokinetics, immunogenicity and other pharmacodynamic effects to elucidate the mechanism
      of action of NG-350A in patients with advanced or metastatic epithelial tumours.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Phase Ia of this study is a dose escalation and safety expansion phase, investigating NG-350A
      administration by intratumoural (IT) injection and intravenous (IV) infusion. Phase Ib of
      this study will investigate efficacy in patients with specific epithelial tumour types.

               -  Tumour deemed accessible and safe for biopsy by the Investigator

               -  Willing to consent to tumour biopsies

          5. Safety expansion and efficacy cohorts only: at least one measurable site of disease
             according to RECIST criteria.

          6. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0 or 1

          7. Predicted life expectancy of 3 months or more

          8. Ability to comply with study procedures in the Investigator's opinion

          9. Recovered to Grade 1 from the effects (excluding alopecia) of any prior therapy for
             their malignancies

         10. Adequate lung reserve

         11. Adequate renal function

         13. Adequate bone marrow function

         14. Prothrombin time and aPTT within normal range or international normalised ratio ≤1.5,
             as appropriate

         15. Meeting the reproductive requirements of the study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Known history or evidence of significant immunodeficiency due to underlying illness.
