  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preoperative CTRT is considered the standard of care in the management of LARC. Preoperative
      CTRT approach results in significant tumor downstaging and local control with a complete
      pathological response rate of about 15% even if additional therapeutic strategies should be
      explored to improve outcomes, expecially for T4 cancers.

      Immunotherapy with PD-1/PD-L1 immunocheckpoint blockade (ICB), turned out a breakthrough in
      cancer treatment among different tumor types, including CRC. An ICB strategy could lead up to
      a 40% of response in metastatic CRC with deficient mismatch repair (MMR) status.
      Unfortunately, the activity of ICBs in MMR proficient mCRC is extremely low but it might be
      improved using immunomodulatory strategies as demonstrated by Bendell et al.

      In this context, the role of RT in revert the tolerance to a low neoantigen-burden (such as
      in MMR proficient CRCs) by the induction of antigen release from the tumour and activation of
      dendritic cells leading to a CD8+ T lymphocyte-mediated anticancer immune response has been
      widely elucidated. Moreover, antineoplastic agents can be exploited to target other crucial
      cellular effectors of immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (i.e. regulatory T cells and
      myeloid-derived suppressor cells).

      In line with these evidences, Hecht et al. have recently reported that in rectal cancer
      patients, neoadjuvant CTRT increases PD-L1 expression in tumor cells, strongly suggesting a
      neoadjuvant combinatory strategy with RT and PD-1/PD-L1 pathway blockade. The integration of
      immunotherapy in the neoadjuvant setting (instead of adjuvant one) for the management of LARC
      is also supported by preclinical findings showing that in metastatic breast cancer mice
      models, neoadjuvant immunotherapy is superior in inducing long-term survivors, compared with
      adjuvant strategy with a greater magnitude of tumor-specific T cell expansion in neoadjuvant
      treated mice and a better anti-tumor T cell-mediated immune response.

      On the basis of such considerations, there is a strong biological and clinical rationale for
      testing the addition of avelumab, an anti-PD-L1 moab, to capecitabine-based CTRT in patients
      with technically resectable, LARC. The aim of this strategy is to lead to significant
      improvements of pCR and, ultimately, patients' survival.
