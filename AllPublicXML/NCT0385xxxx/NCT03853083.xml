  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study is for women with lipedema, a painful fat disorder where fat cannot be
      lost from the legs and hips with diet and exercise. The study will compare the use of the
      specialized exercise equipment called HYPOXI, which is like a bike but you lie down and air
      circulates around the participant's legs like a vacuum with pressure increasing and
      decreasing in cycles over time. The goal of the study is to see if using a HYPOXI bike
      compared to a regular recumbent (sit down) bike helps women with lipedema lose weight. The
      women with lipedema in the study will have the option to use a whole-body suit that works
      like a pump and was designed to improve blood circulation in the body. The body suit is
      called Dermology and can be used before the HYPOXI exercise equipment but will be optional
      for the women in the study. The study is 16 weeks long for 20 women with lipedema. Ten women
      with lipedema will exercise with HYPOXI for 8 weeks then switch to a recumbent bike for the
      second 8 weeks. The other 10 women will exercise on a recumbent bike for 8 weeks then switch
      to HYPOXI for 8 weeks in the second half of the study. Baseline, mid-study, and end of study
      data will be collected including measurements of body composition and shape, a blood draw at
      the beginning, middle and end, and questionnaires. This study will be listed on
      clinicaltrials.gov for more information.
