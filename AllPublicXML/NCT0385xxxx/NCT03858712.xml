  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is research study is for participants with advanced breast or gastrointestinal cancer
      who have been taking oral chemotherapy medication (Oral Cancer Directed Therapy). This study
      is to help researchers better understand gaps in assessing oral chemotherapy patient toxicity
      at home, adherence to treatment and integrate toxicity/adherence reporting.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For patients with advanced breast or gastrointestinal cancer prescribed Oral Cancer Directed
      Therapy.

        -  Participants will complete ePRO clinic for all medical oncology scheduled provider
           appointments during the study period per standard practice

        -  Participants between clinic visits, will be asked to complete the oral weekly survey at
           home via the mobile or web based patient portal. The survey can be completed on a
           computer, tablet or smartphone at home or on a tablet at the time of scheduled visit.

             -  The first 100 participants to complete the survey will receive a passive care team
                alert for responses (per DFHCC policy)

             -  The second 100 participants to complete the survey will receive an active care team
                alert for responses.
