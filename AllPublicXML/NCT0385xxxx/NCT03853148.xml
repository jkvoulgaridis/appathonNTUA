  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Overall Aim of the present proposal is to evaluate the feasibility of an integrated
      mind-body intervention, Activate for Life, to improve overall physical activity and mental
      health and reduce pain and fatigue, resulting in increased likelihood of Aging in Place. Both
      subjective self-report (i.e., NIH PROMIS measures of pain, fatigue, depression and anxiety)
      and objective accelerometer data will be collected, along with standardized measures of
      balance, strength, and stability. In addition, the measures will be complemented with
      biomarker-based measures of stress, including cortisol based and 1,5-AG assays before,
      during, and after treatment that are correlated with stress, and fatigue symptoms.

    <description>The Otago exercise program consists of the following: 1) A series of warm-up exercises, 2) Select exercises from the 17 Otago exercises which challenge the participant's strength and balance for up to 30 minutes, three times a week, 3) A walking program for up to 30 minutes, three times a week. Each Otago will be tailored for each participant's ability level.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>The GYYB is a one-hour program containing gentle physical Yoga postures that participants could practice sitting on a chair for 30 minutes. These exercises are designed based on improving the overall flexibility, bodily control and mindfulness in movements. Following the gentle yoga postures, the participants will perform Yogic breathing exercises for 30 minutes. These exercises are known to promote relaxation, mood, pain and anxiety scores that are highly relevant to the target population and are reported to stimulate measurable biomarker changes in the saliva. During the in-person session the Yoga instructor will explain the GYYB program to participants in the Otago+GYYB group each exercise and their perceived benefits.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Otago + GYYB + Behavioral activation</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>This condition will incorporate OEP and GYYB as above and will also include behavioral activation to address motivation and affect. Behavioral Activation incorporates daily planners and worksheets to identify and rate reinforcing behaviors and is often used in conjunction with other interventions because components of these interventions are easily incorporated into the daily planner based activities. Each participant outlines general values and specific behaviors that 'demonstrate' each value, compiling a list of the latter. This list is then used to generate 10 to 20 highly defined values-based, reinforcing activities. Next, this list is combined with the activities outlines in Otago and GYYB and this master list is used to schedule these values-based activities for the next two days.</description>
