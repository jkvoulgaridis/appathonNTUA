  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this pilot study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of combined and
      simultaneous endoscopic variceal obliteration together with balloon occluded-retrograde
      transvenous obliteration (B-RTO) for the treatment of high-risk gastric varices

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although less frequent than esophageal varices, gastric varices constitute a severe and
      potentially life threatening complication of portal hypertension. Various methods have been
      described to treat gastric varices, including endoscopic and interventional radiology
      techniques. Endoscopic variceal obliteration (EVO) is currently considered as standard of
      care for the treatment of gastric varices in most centers. However, this technique is
      associated with significant rebleeding rates and incomplete obliteration is observed in about
      50% of patients. Alternatively, few centers also use an interventional radiology technique,
      called balloon-occluded retrograde transvenous obliteration (B-RTO) to treat gastric varices,
      which has been shown to be associated with less recurrence of gastric varices and high rates
      of eradication of about 90%. Both techniques have their inherent weaknesses, such as frequent
      incomplete eradication of varices and thromboembolic events for EVO, while data suggest that
      B-RTO may aggravate esophageal varices.

      The aim of this pilot study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of combined and
      simultaneous endoscopic variceal obliteration together with (modified) B-RTO. Stopping the
      outflow of gastric varices by endovascular balloon occlusion may allow better endoscopic
      visualization, blood stagnation and thus eradication of varices, while preventing
      thromboembolic events. Furthermore, during study follow-up, the eradication rates and
      recurrence of varices, short-term and long term complications, effects of the procedure on
      portal pressures/hemodynamics and liver function will be evaluated.

    <description>Catheterization of the left renal vein and the inferior diaphragmatic vein and occlusion with a balloon placed in the distal portion of this vein.
Endoscopic access to the gastric cavity, gastric varices identification and flow measurement, including velocity, by endoscopic Doppler ultrasound (US). The balloon in the draining vein will be inflated and the velocity will be reassessed. Endoscopic puncture of the varices will be done and the embolization will be conducted under balloon-occlusive conditions (Injection of Cyanoacrylate: Lipiodol mixture 1:1 slowly and gradually). Balloon will be kept inflated and a microcatheter will be used through its lumen inside the variceal bed to inject occlusive agent (cyanoacrylate) mixed with Lipiodol.
At the end of the procedure an occlusion device (plug amplatzer 2) will be placed.</description>
