  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although angiographic embolization has been introduced for preoperative management of spine
      metastases in 1975 and is suggested today by many authors in the management of such
      pathologies, it needs to be confirmed by RCT. It is a minimally invasive procedure, not free
      from complications. The recent meta-analyzes, due to the limited number of patients included
      are not exhaustive about the effectiveness of embolization in the reduction of the
      intraoperative bleeding, especially in the context of poor / moderate metastasis
      vascularization. We want to evaluate the efficacy of preoperative angiographic embolization
      of intermediate / poor vascularized spine metastases in reducing intraoperative blood loss
      during excision surgery.
