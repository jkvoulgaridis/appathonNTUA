  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the present randomized and single-blinded cross-over study was to compare the
      cleansing efficacy of waist-shaped interdental brushes with that of cylindric interdental
      brushes in interproximal sites.

    <textblock>
      Brushing efficacy of cylindric and waist-shaped interdental brushes was evaluated in a
      randomized, controlled, examiner-blinded, two-period crossover study. 20 periodontal
      maintenance patients of the University Hospital of Dental Prosthetics and Restorative
      Dentistry were recruited. Each subject was asked to attend three appointments. In the first
      visit (day one), baseline plaque and bleeding indices were assessed. Each proband was
      instructed by the same experienced dental hygienist with two sizes of waist-shaped and
      cylindric interdental brushes, respectively. Primary outcome measure plaque index and
      secondary outcome measure papillary bleeding index were assessed by two blinded and
      calibrated examiners at four sites per tooth.The odds ratio and confidence interval for
      establishing plaque free interdental sites were calculated with logistic regression analysis.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Turesky modification of the Quigley and Hein Plaque Index</measure>
    <time_frame>11 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This is a plaque index scored as 0 = no plaque; 1 = slight flecks of plaque at the cervical margin of the tooth; 2 = a thin continuous band of plaque (1 mm or smaller) at the cervical margin of the tooth; 3 = a band of plaque wider than 1 mm but covering &lt; 1/3 of the crown of the tooth; 4 = plaque covering at least 1/3 but &lt; 2/3 of the crown of the tooth or 5 = plaque covering 2/3 or more of the crown of the tooth. A higher grade is worse (more plaque) than a lower grade. After measuring plaque grades on four sites per tooh, the mode is calculated, which is defined as the plaque grade most often measured in an individual.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>papillary bleeding index by Saxer and Mühlemann</measure>
    <time_frame>11 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A periodontal probe is inserted into the gingival sulcus at the line angle on the mesial and distal aspect of the papilla and then moved coronally to the papilla tip (score 0 - no bleeding; score 1 - a single discreet bleeding point; score 2 - several isolated bleeding points or a single line of blood; score 3 - the interdental triangle fills with blood; score 4 - profuse bleeding occurs after probing and flows immediately into the marginal sulcus). A higher bleeding grade is worse (more inflammed tissues) than a lower grade. After measuring papillary bleeeding grades on four sites per tooh, the mode is calculated, which is defined as the papillary bleeding grade most often measured in an individual.</description>
