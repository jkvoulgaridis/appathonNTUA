      This study sets out to investigate the effect of a posture shirt on muscle activity during a
      sitting and standing repetitive upper limb task

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Posture shirts are designed, and marketed to the general public and health service providers
      to improve posture and consequently alter muscle activity, reduce musculoskeletal pain and
      discomfort. This study sets out to investigate the effect of a posture shirt on muscle
      activity during a sitting and a standing repetitive upper limb task.
