  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pregnancy is characterized by many biohumoral changes: circulation, respiratory mechanics,
      oncotic pressure, vascular permeability and many other systems are affected.

      Vascular permeability is controlled by endothelial glycocalyx. Several factors such as
      sepsis, ischemia / reperfusion, inflammatory mediators, trauma, surgery including the
      Cesarean Section and fluid overload can increase vascular permeability due to a glycocalyx
      damage.

      During Cesarean Section under subarachnoid anesthesia, hypotension may occur. It is a common
      side effect caused by reduced preload due to aortocaval compression by the uterus.
      Furthermore, subarachnoid anesthesia causes block of the sympathetic preganglionic fibers
      which is associated with vasodilation. These changes often require the use of vasopressors
      and fluids.

      A fluid overload associated with the physiological and pathological factors discussed earlier
      might cause an increased risk of pulmonary edema and acute respiratory failure (IRA) in women
      undergoing cesarean section under arachnoid anesthesia.

      IRA occurs in less than 0.2% of total pregnancies but it is one of the most common cause of
      admission to intensive care unit in pregnant women.

      Among the causes that can lead to IRA in the last trimester of pregnancy we find
      pneumopathies such as asthma, pulmonary embolism due to amniotic fluid and pulmonary edema
      related to severe preeclampsia.

      Diagnosis of pulmonary edema can be clinical or sub-clinical through laboratory tests such as
      BNP (b-type natriuretic peptide). It might also be necessary to execute instrumental
      examinations such as chest radiography (contraindicated in pregnancy) or trans-thoracic
      ultrasound.

      Hypothesis: correlation between subarachnoid anesthesia, fluidic therapy and BNP values and
      ultrasound pattern

        Patients' anthropometric data were collected, data related to the anesthetic technique,
        pharmacological and intraoperative fluid therapy, sensory level reached after subarachnoid
        anesthesia, sensory level and motor blockade at discharge from the operating room. We also
        collected BNP serum values and pulmonary ultrasound images at 6 and 24 h after the
        intervention. Diuresis collection at 6 and 24 h after the intervention was registered as
        well as water balance.
