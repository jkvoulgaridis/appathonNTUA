  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ertapenem, a broad-spectrum carbapenem antibiotic, has shown promising in vitro activity
      agenst ESBL-producing Enterobacteriacae. This agent was licensed in United State of America
      and Europe for several clinical use in complicated intraabdominal infections, complicated
      skin and skin-structure infections, acute pelvic infections, complicated urinary tract
      infections and community-acquired pneumonia. In common with other beta-lactams, ertapenem
      exhibits primarily time-dependent activity, and the percentage of the exposure time during
      which the free drug concentration remain above the MIC (%T&gt;MIC) is the
      pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) index that best correlates with efficacy.
      Pathophysiological changes in critically ill patients with severe infections resulting in
      altered PK patterns that may affect therapeutic plasma concentrations and achievement of PD
      have been found with several antimicrobial agents. The aim of the study was to determine the
      PK of ertapenem in patients with urosepsis.

    <description>Ertapenem PK studies were carried out on the 3rd dose of ertapenem administration. Blood samples (3 mL) were obtained by direct venipuncture at the following times: shortly before (time zero) and 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12 and 24 h after the start of ertapenem administration. All blood samples were added to a heparinized tube and centrifuged at 1,000 g for 10 min at 4Â°C within 5 min.</description>
