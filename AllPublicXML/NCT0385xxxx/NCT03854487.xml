    <textblock>
      This is a single-blinded randomized controlled trial to investigate the effects of mirror
      therapy (MT), with reference to sham mirror (a glass wall) and control (a covered mirror), in
      reducing unilateral neglect for patients with stroke in 2 centres.

    <textblock>
      Twenty-one subacute inpatients with left unilateral neglect after right-hemispheric stroke,
      recruited from 2 hospitals - Hong Kong and Guangzhou, in 1 and a half years, were randomly
      assigned to three groups; mirror therapy, sham therapy (in the form of a transparent glass
      wall), and control (covered mirror). The treatment programme for all groups consisted of 12
      sessions (4 per week for 3 weeks) movement practice for the hemiplegic arm involved 5
      table-top tasks graded according to the severity of patients' arm impairments. Blinded
      assessments were administered at baseline, 3-week postintervention, and 3-week follow-up upon
      completion of training.

    <description>A mirror is placed at the midsagittal plane of the patient. The patients in the mirror therapy group watched the mirror illusion of the non-affected arm in the mirror and moved together with the affected arm. The treatment programme for all groups consisted of 12 sessions (4 per week for 3 weeks), each lasting for 30 minutes. The movement practice involved 5 table-top tasks and the patient was instructed to perform as many trials as possible in each session with a maximum of 30 trials per task, giving a total of 150 trials per session. Treatment activities are graded according to the severity of the patient's upper extremity impairment.</description>
