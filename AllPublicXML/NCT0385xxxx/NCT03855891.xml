      The main purpose of this single-center study is to determine the spectrum and levels of
      cardiospecific circulating microRNAs in patients with different stages of atherosclerosis
      according to 640-slice multispiral computed tomography (MSCT).

      The study will be conducted in two phases. Phase one. After signing the informed consent,
      patients with coronary heart disease, angina pectoris II-IV functional class, who underwent
      MSCT angiography of the coronary arteries for medical reasons, regulated in the relevant ESC
      and the Russian Society of Cardiology guidelines, will be included in the study. According to
      the results of MSCT, the participants will be divided into 4 groups: those with
      atherosclerotic plaques with signs of instability; those with stable atherosclerotic plaques
      without marked calcification; those with calcined atherosclerotic plaques; those with no
      signs of atherosclerosis of the coronary arteries. Plasma samples will be analyzed by
      microarray, using a cardiospecific set.

      Phase two. Validation of the results obtained after the first phase will be performed on a
      larger sample of patients. Patients after signing an informed consent will also undergo MSCT
      angiography of coronary arteries and according to its results will be devided in 4 groups. To
      assess the level of microRNA expression in the blood of patients, real-time reverse
      transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) will be used.

      The expected result of the study. For the first time ever, there will be determined the
      profile of circulating regulatory RNA in patients who underwent MSCT angiography of coronary
      arteries. Features of expression of circulating microRNAs will be compared with different
      severity degrees of the atherosclerotic process based on MSCT criteria. The results will be
      compared with each other (including the &quot;control&quot; group), which will allow to identify common
      patterns and specific differences.
