  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to assess the safety and tolerability of single and multiple
      ascending subcutaneous (SC) doses of SHP681 in healthy adult participants.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study consists of a single ascending dose (SAD) portion and a multiple ascending dose
      (MAD) portion.

      The study duration for the SAD portion of the study consists of a screening period of up to
      28 days and 1 treatment period of 29 days. SAD portion of the study contains 5 cohorts and
      dose escalation will proceed sequentially to assess the following single SC doses of SHP681
      or SHP681 matched placebo: 0.2 milligram per kilogram (mg/kg), 0.5 mg/kg, 1 mg/kg, 2 mg/kg,
      and 4 mg/kg.

      The study duration of the MAD portion comprises of a screening period up to 28 days and a
      treatment period of 57 days for each cohort. MAD portion of the study contains 6 cohorts and
      dose escalation will proceed sequentially to assess the following SC doses of SHP681 or
      SHP681 matched placebo: 0.2 mg/kg, 0.5 mg/kg, 1 mg/kg, 2 mg/kg, and 4 mg/kg once weekly for 5
      weeks till 5 cohorts and the 6th cohort will receive 4 mg/kg SHP681 or matched placebo every
      2 weeks over a 6-week period (3 doses).
