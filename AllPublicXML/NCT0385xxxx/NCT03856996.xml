      The purpose of this study is to compare the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of
      CH505TF gp120 produced from stably transfected cells to CH505TF gp120 produced from
      transiently transfected cells in healthy, HIV-1-uninfected adult participants.

    <textblock>
      This study will compare the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of two experimental HIV
      vaccines in healthy, HIV-1-uninfected adult participants. The study vaccines are called
      Stable CH505TF gp120 and Transient CH505TF gp120. The vaccines are mixed with an adjuvant
      called GLA-SE.

      Participants will be randomly assigned to two groups. Participants in Group 1 will receive
      Stable CH505TF gp120; participants in Group 2 will receive Transient CH505TF. Depending on
      their group, participants will receive Stable CH505TF gp120 or Transient CH505TF gp120 by
      injection at Months 0, 2, and 6.

      Additional study visits will occur at Months 0.5, 2.5, 6.5, 9, and 12. Study visits may
      include physical examinations, medical history, vaccine injections, blood and urine
      collection, risk reduction counseling, and questionnaires. Participants will also be
      contacted for health information at Month 18.

               -  If a person has NOT been found to have elevated blood pressure or hypertension
                  during screening or previously, exclude for systolic blood pressure greater than
                  or equal to 150 mm Hg at enrollment or diastolic blood pressure greater than or
