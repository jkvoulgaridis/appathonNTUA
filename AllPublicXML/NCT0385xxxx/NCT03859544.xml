  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) is a diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) entity
      with a particularly poor prognosis (median survival less than 3 years). They are still poorly
      characterized biologically, largely because of their rarity (300 cases / year in France) and
      the difficulty for obtaining a material of sufficient quality and quantity. It is
      nevertheless assumed that their pathophysiology is particular, since they develop exclusively
      in an immunological sanctuary, and that they present some characteristic molecular
      abnormalities (mutation of MYD88 or TBL1XR1 for example).

      A collection of 74 PCNSLs has created, clinically annotated, from which frozen material is
      available in addition to the material fixed and included in paraffin (cohort ALYCE). Informed
      consent was gathered for all patients. Comparative Genomic Hybridization-array analysis of
      this cohort has already revealed abnormalities associated with a poor prognosis (unpublished
      data). The objective of this study is to complete this analysis by sequencing a panel of 96
      mutant genes recurrently in DLBCLs and PCNSLs, and the molecular determination of the
      original cell by the (RT-MLPA) Reverse Transcriptase-Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe
      Amplification technique.

      The integration of genetic, molecular and transcriptomic data may define prognostic markers
      and open perspectives for translational research in PCNSL.
