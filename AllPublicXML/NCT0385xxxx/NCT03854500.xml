    <textblock>
      Background: Alteplase is the only approved acute drug treatment in ischemic stroke and aims
      at dissolving arterial clots causing cerebral ischemia. The overall benefit of alteplase is
      substantial. However, there is considerable room for improvement as 2/3 of patients with
      large clots may not achieve reopening of the vessel and up to 40% of the patients remain
      severely disabled or die.

      Tenecteplase, a modified tissue plasminogen activator, has been shown to be a more efficient
      and safer thrombolytic drug than alteplase in pre-clinical studies. Tenecteplase has replaced
      alteplase as thrombolytic treatment in myocardial infarction and may also be the drug of
      choice in ischemic stroke.

      Tenecteplase and alteplase had a similar safety profile in the NOR-TEST trial and there were
      no differences in efficacy between the two treatment groups. However, a majority of patients
      had mild stroke which may be associated with a natural favorable prognosis.

      In spite of these neutral results, tenecteplase has the potential to replace alteplase as the
      drug of choice, based on a better pharmacological profile and a simpler practical
      administration. There is, however, need for a higher number of patients to prove the efficacy
      and safety of tenecteplase.

      Hypothesis: Tenecteplase 0.4 mg/kg has superior efficacy and similar safety profile compared
      with alteplase 0.9 mg/kg.

      Objectives: To compare efficacy and safety of tenecteplase 0.4 mg/kg (single bolus) vs.
      alteplase 0.9 mg/kg (10% bolus + 90% infusion/60 minutes) a) within 4½ hours after symptom
      onset; b) within 4½ hours after awakening with stroke symptoms, and c) as bridging therapy
      within 4½ hours before thrombectomy.

      Study design: NOR-TEST-2 is a multi-centre PROBE (prospective randomised, open-label, blinded
      endpoint) trial, designed to establish superiority of tenecteplase as compared with alteplase
      for consecutively admitted patients with acute ischaemic stroke treated within 4½ hours after
      symptom onset. Randomisation tenecteplase:alteplase is 1:1.

      Endpoints: Primary endpoint is functional outcome (mRS 0-1) at 90 days (efficacy). Secondary
      endpoints include rates of cerebral hemorrhages on CT/MR at 24-48 hours and mortality
      (safety).

      Patient recruitment: All patients admitted to hospital with acute ischaemic stroke eligible
      for standard iv thrombolysis with alteplase and with pre-stroke mRS&lt;3 and NIHSS score of &gt;5
      on admission are potentially eligible for NOR-TEST-2.

      Based on power calculations from NOR-TEST, NOR-TEST 2 aims at including 1342 patients.
