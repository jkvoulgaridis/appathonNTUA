      Brief Summary:*

      Aim of the study :

      To evaluate if the neck division level significantly influences the postoperative pancreatic
      fistula rate of pancreatico-jejunal anastomosis after pancreatoduodenectomy.

      Methods :

      Patients who underwent oncologic or non-oncologic pancreatoduodenectomy between 01 January
      2009 and 04 April 2018 will be included in this retrospective analysis. Two independent
      radiologists will measure the distance between the left side of the portal vein and the
      remnant pancreatic stump on post operative CT scan, blindly for postoperative course. This
      new variable will be integrated in a logistic regression model in addition to well known risk
      factors of POPF.

      The pancreatic neck is an anatomical area mainly vascularized by the arterial network derived
      from the gastroduodenal artery and branches of the superior mesenteric artery running in the
      pancreatic head.

      The neck arterial blood supply is probably reduced after pancreatoduodenectomy due to the
      ligation of gastroduodenal artery and collaterals of superior mesenteric artery.

      Postoperative pancreatic fistula (POPF) is the main complication after pancreatoduodenectomy.
      POPF has an estimated rate of 15 to 30%. So, this complication is frequent and could be
      lethal. Several studies have been driven to identify risks factors of POPF but there are no
      actual data on the impact of the neck division level and neck vascularization on POPF.

      By considering the level of neck division is variable, the investigator hypothesize that a
      long remnant neck, is a risk factor of POPF after pancreatoduodenectomy with pancreatojejunal
      anastomosis.

      The aim of the present study is to integrate this new variable in a logistic regression model
      in addition to well known risk factors of POPF.

      Cytolyt Samples:

      Liquid conservation samples from patients who underwent endoscopic ultrasound with fine
      needle aspiration/biopsy for suspicious pancreatic mass at the CHU de Montpellier were
      conserved at +4Â°c.

      Cytolyt samples do not contain any cell or tissue from patient, this liquid is systematically
      trashed in current practice. No genetics analysis will be performed from these particular
      samples in the present study.
