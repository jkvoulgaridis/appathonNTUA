  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A multicentre real life study is proposed. The study has as its goal primary to compare the
      levels of ketonemia measured in patients with albuminuria and patients normo albuminurici to
      evaluate a possible correlation between ketone level and alteration of renal function in the
      diabetic patient, comparing the eGFR values of patients with ketonemia high and of patients
      with low ketonemia. In these patients, the lack of insulin causes one imbalance between
      ketogenesis and ketolysis, with increased production and reduced body clearance ketones.
      Several studies explore the effects of ketone bodies on cell function and lesions diabetic
      complications: ketonemia induces oxidative stress and increases the risk and the progression
      of complications, moreover, the increase in ketone levels may have pro-inflammatory effects.
      However, ketonemia levels between normal and DKA are poorly studied and their effects are
      still unknown. It is hypothesized that

        -  in diabetic patients with DKD the level of ketones may be high;

        -  Increased ketone levels may promote an alteration of renal function.

      We want to evaluate the relationship between ketone levels and renal function, because the
      kidneys, as well as the heart, are among the main organs in which the ketone bodies are
      oxidized to produce energy and DKD has a high morbidity and mortality in diabetes. The main
      objectives for being able to demonstrate the hypothesis in question are:

        -  Evaluate the level of ketones in albuminurate patients with diabetes and in patients
           with renal function altered;

        -  Evaluate the association between ketone level and decline of renal function in the
           diabetic patient e therefore the impact of ketonemia on the progression of renal
           function loss.

      At the beginning and during the course of the study the glycemic and ketone index obtained by
      the homologous blood glucose monitoring will be evaluated. During the study, prognostic
      biomarkers (sP2X7R, KIM-1, sTNFR1, 11-dehydro-tromoxane B2 and 6-keto-prostaglandin-F-1a
      (PGF1α)), which are presumed to play an important role in inflammatory renal diseases, will
      also be measured in diabetic subject, in addition to the traditional marker that is the
      urinary albumin.

      Step 1. Visit Baseline: blood sampling and collection of a urinary sample, evaluation
      proteinuria, GFR and blood and urinary ketones Step 2. Visit at 6 months: blood collection
      and collection of a urinary sample, evaluation proteinuria, GFR and blood and urinary ketones
      Step 3. Visit at 12 months: blood collection and collection of a urinary sample, evaluation
      proteinuria, GFR and blood and urinary ketones. The study involves the enrollment of T1D and
      T2D subjects in diabetic nephropathy. The study involves the enrollment of T1D and T2D
      subjects in diabetic nephropathy A timetable will be prepared for the surgeries during the
      which the diabetic subject will be informed about the study protocol in question and will
      provide eventual informed consent to entry into the study, blood sampling and urinary sample
      collection. However, the analysis will be above all exploratory and will allow to foresee
      possible studies future properly sized.
