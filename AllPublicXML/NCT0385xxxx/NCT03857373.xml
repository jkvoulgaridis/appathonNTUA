  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We aim to experiment and implement various deep learning architectures in order to achieve
      human-level accuracy in Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems. In particular, we are
      interested in detecting renal tumors from CT urography scans in this project. We would like
      to classify renal tumor to cancer, non cancer, renal cyst I, renal cyst II, renal cyst III
      and renal cyst VI, with high sensitivity and low false positive rate using various types of
      convolutional neural networks (CNN). This task can be considered as the first step in
      building CAD systems for renal cancer diagnosis. Moreover, by automating this task, we can
      significantly reduce the time for the radiologists to create large-scale labeled datasets of
      CT-urography scans.
