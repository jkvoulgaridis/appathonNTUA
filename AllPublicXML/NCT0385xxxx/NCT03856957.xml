  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, especially
      in Western countries. CRC is currently considered a preventable disease and screening has
      been endorsed by several societies, since it has been shown that screening and surveillance
      are effective in reducing both CRC incidence and mortality. However, recently, concern has
      risen regarding colonoscopy effectiveness, especially in the right colon. The most accepted
      explanation for this effectiveness variability is attributed to sessile serrated lesions
      (SSL), which are more frequent in the proximal colon, more difficult to detect because of
      their flat morphology and associated with interval CRC, which is the occurrence of CRC after
      screening colonoscopy and before the next scheduled procedure. Several techniques are
      emerging to increase the sensitivity of colonoscopy for pre-cancerous lesions, especially
      adenomas. Recently an endoscopic cap, the Endocuff, was developed to improve adenoma
      detection. Several studies demonstrated improved adenoma detection with Endocuff-assisted
      colonoscopy when compared with conventional colonoscopy. Still, the available data for its'
      role in detecting SSL is very limited. The aim of this randomized controlled trial is to
      evaluate the effectiveness of Endocuff-assisted colonoscopy in detection of colorectal SSL.
