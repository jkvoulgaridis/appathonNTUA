  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of our study was to assess serum endocan levels in patients with Behcet disease and
      to correlate it with various disease clinical and laboratory parameters of disease activity
      as well as carotid intima media thickness.

      This study will be carried out on two groups:

      • Group (I): Forty two patients diagnosed to have Behcets disease fulfilling the
      International Criteria for BD .

      Group (II): including 42 age and sex matching healthy volunteers as control group.

      (A) Clinical evaluation

        1. Complete history taking.

        2. Thorough clinical examination including opthalmologic evaluation .

        3. Disease activity using The Behcet's disease current activity form (BD-DAF) . (B)
           Laboratory assessment:

      All patients will be subjected to the following measurements:

        1. ESR

        2. CRP

        3. CBC

        4. liver and kidney function tests

      d) Serum Endocan level e)triglycrides f) cholestrol C) carotid intima media thickness
