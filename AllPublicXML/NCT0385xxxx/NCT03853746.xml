  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Several disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) have been shown to be effective in reducing the
      disease activity in patients with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS) but these
      treatments, often need to be used continuously for an unknown duration, rendering the
      long-term use extremely expensive. In addition, chronic administration of DMTs is often
      associated with undesirable side effects. Among these medications, B-cell depleting
      monoclonal antibodies might have the properties of an ideal group of medications: i) B-cell
      depleting antibodies have proven to be extremely potent in reducing or stopping the disease
      activity in relapsing MS, ii) B-cell depleting antibodies are very safe if used for a short
      period and use for a short duration may stop the inflammatory disease activity over long
      term, although current clinical practice and protocols are based on continuing B-cell
      depletion for an unknown period of time. Indeed, early phase clinical trials of rituximab and
      ocrelizumab suggested that a short course treatment with B-cell depleting antibodies can have
      long term effects and disease activity will not return even long after B-cell repopulation in
      the blood.

      This long-term effect might be related to the specific pattern of B-cell tolerance defect in
      patients with MS and the potential of its normalization with B-cell depleting antibodies. By
      analyzing the reactivity of recombinant antibodies expressed from single B-cells, the
      investigators' collaborators have demonstrated that the pattern of B-cell tolerance defect is
      different in people with MS who only display an impaired removal of developing autoreactive
      B-cells in the periphery while central B-cell tolerance in the bone marrow is functional in
      most patients. In contrast, patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), type-1 diabetes (T1D) or
      Sjögren's syndrome (SS) show defective central and peripheral B-cell tolerance checkpoints.
      As a consequence, while anti-B-cell therapy does not correct defective early B-cell tolerance
      checkpoints in T1D and only temporarily slows down autoimmune processes before newly
      generated autoreactive B-cells likely induce patient relapse, the investigators postulate
      that the efficacy of B-cell depleting antibodies in MS may be linked to the B-cell depleting
      antibodies' normal central B-cell tolerance and the production of a normal B-cell and T-cell
      compartment after anti-B-cell therapy.

      The investigators' goal is to provide proof-of-concept that a short duration of treatment
      with B-cell depleting antibodies can correct B-cell tolerance defects in MS and allow for
      medication-free prolonged freedom from disease activity, at least in a proportion of subjects
      with relapsing MS.

      In an open label study, 10 patients with active relapsing MS will be treated with two courses
      of ocrelizumab and will be followed clinically and radiologically for at least two and a half
      years. Time to the return of disease activity (defined as clinical relapses or new or
      enhancing lesions on the MRI) will be the primary outcome of the study. The investigators
      will harvest B-cells before starting the treatment and after B-cell repopulation and assess
      the central and peripheral tolerance defects. The investigators hypothesize that in most
      participants, the disease activity will not come back, and this prolonged response to anti
      cluster of differentiation 20 (CD-20) therapy is associated with normalization of B-cell
      tolerance defect in these patients. Considering the safety of this approach, it can be
      adopted widely among people with MS. Hence, the proposed B-cell analyses before and after
      B-cell depletion in people with MS will provide novel insights regarding the mechanisms
      underlying the beneficial effect of B-cell depleting antibodies and the potential long-term
      suppression of disease activity. This strategy can therefore improve the approach to
      treatment of many people with relapsing MS.
