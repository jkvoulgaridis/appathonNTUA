      Acne vulgaris is one of the most common chronic skin diseases worldwide. The condition
      usually starts in adolescence, peaks at the ages of 14 to 19 years and frequently resolves by
      mid-twenties.

      Acne is characterized by seborrhea, formation of open and closed comedones, erythematous
      papules and pustules and in more severe cases present with nodules, deep pustules and pseudo
      cysts, in many cases a degree of scarring will ensue.

      Its pathophysiology includes hyperseborrhoea, abnormal follicular keratinization and
      Propionibacterium acnes proliferation in the pilosebaceous unit.

      Acne is a significant clinical problem with sever social, psychological, and emotional
      implications. A mainly genetically determined host response pattern combined with bacterial
      ''triggering'' is generally accepted as being important for the apparently unbalanced
      inflammatory activity.

      Acne is not an infectious disease, but three major organisms were isolated from the surface
      of the skin and the pilosebaceous duct of patients with acne including Propionibacterium
      acne, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Malassezia furfur.

      Platelet rich plasma is a good choice for the treatment of acne and atrophic scars
      reminiscent of the course of the disease. In addition, for being autologous, it reduces the
      possibility of side effects, such as skin dryness and rejection.

      It was demonstrated that PRP accelerates the healing process, regulates inflammation and
      promotes healing by inhibiting the P. acnes bacteria, additionally restoring collagen). The
      PRP's mechanism of action also involves the release of powerful antimicrobial peptides from
      the platelets' alpha granules.

      Although there are few studies on the PRP's effectiveness in acne, it emerges as a potential
      therapeutic option in Dermatology and Aesthetic Medicine.

      Due to development of resistance in microorganisms causing acne to common antibiotics and
      differences in species and strains of the microorganisms in different regions, this study
      will be undertaken to determine bacteria involve in acne vulgaris and the effect of PRP on
      it.

    <description>Ten mL of venous blood will be drawn in a syringe fill with 1.5 mL of anticoagulant solution (anticoagulant citrate dextrose solution formula A, Baxter, Deerfield, IL). The blood will be centrifuged at 160 g for 10 minutes. After the first spin, the lower red blood cell portion will be discarded, and the supernatant will be centrifuged at 400 g for 10 minutes. The resulting pellet of platelets will be mixed with 1.5 mL of supernatant, which make 1.5 mL of PRP. One mL of 3% calcium chloride will be added to the PRP to induce platelet activation.</description>

    <description>SA is a 2-hydroxybenzoic acid (from willow tree) used for superficial peeling due to its strong keratolytic and comedo- lytic properties. It promotes shedding of epidermal cells and due to its lipophilic properties can penetrate comedones and pores to prevent clogging and neutralize bacteria. It promotes desquamation of the upper lipophilic layers of the stratum corneum.19 These chemical properties explain its popularity and success in acne patients.It also has well- documented anti-inflammatory properties.</description>

    <description>is a superficial peeling agent used as adjuvant therapy for acne. it is generally proposed to break of the hydrogen bonds of keratin (keratolysis), disruption of cell membranes (cell death) and is bactericidal.</description>
