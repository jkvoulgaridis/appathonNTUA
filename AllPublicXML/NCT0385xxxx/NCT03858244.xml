      This study aimed to investigate the prevalence and clinical significance of sleep-disordered
      breathing (SDB) in children with mild-moderate idiopathic scoliosis (IS).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Idiopathic scoliosis (IS) is the most common pediatric musculoskeletal disorder that causes a
      three-dimensional spinal deformity affecting 2 to 4% of adolescent subjects. It can be
      progressive (in 3 out of 10 cases) and severe involving serious effects (spine pain,
      cardiopulmonary compromise, deformed torso, psychosocial issues) and heavy treatments
      (corset, surgery). However, there is still no reliable criteria to predict the occurrence and
      progression of IS, while the etiology of IS remains unclear.

      Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) in children is a common condition characterized by recurrent
      events of upper airway obstruction during sleep. The major symptom is snoring or noisy
      breathing. Preliminary evidence suggests that SDB in children is associated with low bone
      mass and postural stability, which might be mechanisms in the development of scoliosis.
      However, the influence of SDB on the progression of IS remains unknown.

      To fill those gaps, investigators will perform a prospective, unrandomized, observational
      cohort study to determine the prevalence and significance of SDB in children with
      mild-moderate IS. All subjects will be screened with a designated sleep questionnaire (PSQ),
      and children with either severe daytime sleepiness or frequent snoring or any degree of sleep
      pause will be requested to undergo further evaluation and an overnight polysomnography (PSG).
      Routine follow-up visits will be scheduled 6 months apart up to 24 months to assess the curve
      progression of scoliosis.
