  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Mexican Consulate runs a Ventanilla de Salud (VDS) (Health Window) program in fifty
      locations nationwide. The VDS provides an opportunity to provide health services to members
      of the Mexican community. Some of the concerns previously identified during the work at the
      VDS were that some individuals did not always get enough to eat, or do not always have enough
      money for food. This sometimes leads to unhealthy food choices-- buying and preparing foods
      that are inexpensive but really not good for the particpant. The investigators would like to
      conduct focus group to help make changes to a new diet and exercise program at the VDS called
      SANOS which stands for SAlud y Nutrición para todOS. SANOS aims to provide information for
      living a healthier lifestyle including on how to eat healthy on a small budget and how to
      become more physically active. The hope is that learning to eat healthy without spending a
      lot of money and to find simple ways to increase physical activity (like walking) will be a
      first step in reducing obesity rates within the Mexican community that have led to increased
      risks for cancer, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes.

    <description>Using the Dietary Screener of the 2011-12 California Health Interview Survey (CHIS)65 to measure diet behaviors of all participants. The information is collected through questions in the following format: &quot;During the past month [&quot;or in the past 7 days‟ for fast-food consumption], how often did you eat [food item name]?&quot; The questions are often followed by clarification of the food items. The response is standardized to reflect mean per-week intake frequency. (Administration time ~ 10 minutes).</description>

    <description>Participants will be placed in either individual or group interventions by convenience. Recruitment will be consecutive and participants will be placed in either intervention depending on what resource is available on a given day at the VDS, individual counselor or a group educator. Once either 200 individual or 200 group slots are filled, all of the remaining individuals will be assigned to the other arm, when resources for that arm are available.</description>

    <description>Conducting SANOS Focus Groups. We will conduct 3-5 focus groups (in Spanish) with 6-10 participants each, until saturation. Bilingual study staff will approach individuals visiting the VDS and VDS Mobile for potential participation. A brief screening questionnaire will be administered, and a BMI assessment conducted, to ascertain eligibility. Focus groups will be scheduled at the VDS Mobile unit at times convenient to participants. Participants will be verbally consented in Spanish, and will be apprised that their participation is purely voluntary and that their names will not be included in the final narrative. The 6-month follow-up and 24-hour dietary surveys can be done over phone . Study staff will access step counts (or obtain it through phone via the pedometer manual provided to the participant) and upload data onto the REDCap tracking tool.</description>
