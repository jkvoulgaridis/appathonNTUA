  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study compares the effect of a therapeutic physical exercise programme based on an
      individualized control of the exercise dose by monitoring the force-speed curves against the
      current best practice in the treatment of tendinopathies of the lower limb. Half of the
      participants will receive the experimental intervention, while the other half will receive
      the best current practice.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The current best practice is based on a progressive strength training sustained in the
      continuous model of tendinopathy proposed by Cook and Purdam (Cook &amp; Purdam, 2009), showing
      in the literature this methodology more effective than the wait and see approach or that the
      use of corticosteroid injections, accentuating the differences in long-term follow-up
      evaluations (Mellor et al., 2018). However, the current system lacks an objectification
      methodology for the severity of the pathology and objective criteria for the progression of
      the load, usually based on subjective feelings of discomfort or pre-established intensities.

      Therefore, the investigators hypothesize that the development and introduction of a
      methodology for the quantification and progression of the loads, with an individual control
      and management of the exercise dose, as well as the execution of specific exercises for each
      one of them, could improve the clinica and functional results. Moreover, achieving
      neuromuscular adaptations based on the characteristics of the neuromuscular system, could
      improve the times and results of the intervention, as well as the rate of treatment failures,
      in the tendinopathies of the lower limbs.

    <time_frame>Baseline, 1 week before start of the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>EQ-5D is a standardized instrument for measuring generic health status. The EQ-5D questionnaire has two components: health state description and evaluation. In the description part, health status is measured in terms of five dimensions (5D); mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Mobility dimension asks about the person's walking ability. Self-care dimension asks about the ability to wash or dress by oneself, and usual activities dimension measures performance in &quot;work, study, housework, family or leisure activities&quot;. In pain/discomfort dimension, it asks how much pain or discomfort they have, and in anxiety/depression dimension, it asks how anxious or depressed they are. Each dimension is rated in 5 levels from &quot;I have no problem with...&quot; to &quot;I am unable to...&quot;</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, 1 week before start of the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Non invasive surface HDEMG during maximal isometric voluntary contraction performed in a leg press machine. Surface HDEMG is recorded during 20 seconds. Data obtained is analysed to extract the mean discharge rate of the motor units (in fires per second) and the recruitment and derecruitment threshold (in Nw). This variable will only be assessed in a randomly selected subgroup of each arm.</description>
