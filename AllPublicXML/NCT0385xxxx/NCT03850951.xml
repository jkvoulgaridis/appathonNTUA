    <textblock>
      Patients who have moderate crowding that could be treated without extraction will be treated
      in this study using either lingual or labial fixed orthodontic appliances. All patients will
      receive a cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) scan in two different times (T0: before
      treatment, T1: after treatment). The dentoalveolar changes will be assessed.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lingual orthodontic appliances provide an ultimate esthetic solution for patients who do not
      want visible orthodontic appliances. Recently, lingual orthodontic treatment outcomes have
      become similar and comparable to those produced with labial orthodontic treatment. However,
      placement of orthodontic brackets on the lingual surfaces of teeth causes changes in their
      morphology, which results in articulation problems, chewing difficulties, tongue irritation
      and other impairments. In this respect, the main difference between the labial and lingual
      techniques is the distance between the point of application of the force that is transmitted
      through the bracket and the centre of resistance of the tooth. Consequently, the displacement
      and stress induced in bone by these two techniques will also differ, and these need to be
      evaluated so that useful comparisons can be made between these two techniques. Patients who
      have moderate crowding that could be treated without extraction will be treated in this study
      using either lingual or labial fixed orthodontic appliances. All patients will receive a
      cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) scan in two different times (T0: before treatment, T1:
      after treatment). The dentoalveolar changes will be assessed.

    <measure>ABO- Objective Grading System</measure>
    <time_frame>After treatment completion, an average of 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Objective grading system phase III examination will be done to systematically grade post treatment records. The ABO-OGS contains eight criteria: alignment, marginal ridges, buccolingual inclination, occlusal relationships, occlusal contacts, overjet, interproximal contacts and root angulation. Patients will be deducted for any discrepancy from ideal as described by the ABO. Every case that loses 30 or fewer points generally receives a passing grade for the ABO phase III examination.</description>

    <description>Patients in both groups will be given a questionnaire to be filled. The questionnaire to be used is called Oral-Health-Impact-Profile with 14 items (OHIP-14) which can be filled in 3 minutes. OHIP-14 includes a subjective evaluation of the individual's oral health, functional well being, emotional well being, expectations and satisfaction with care and sense of self.</description>
