  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to determine the influence of yoga breathing practices
      on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) circulation, and to find out primarily if a regular practice of
      8-week yoga breathing would enhance CSF circulation as well as if the intervention would
      improve participant's quality of life, quality of sleep, and reduce existing stress.
      Participants will be randomized into two arms for different breathing practices.

      The purpose of this research protocol is to determine the influence of an 8-week breathing
      intervention on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) circulation among healthy participants using a
      non-invasive real-time phase-contrast magnetic imaging (RT-PCMRI) technique. This aim will be
      examined by studying the changes in each participant's pre- and post-intervention CSF flow
      dynamics using the non-invasive RT-PCMRI technique during two MRI scans (one before and one
      after the 8-week intervention).

      The study protocol consists of 20 healthy participants (two groups; 10 in each group with
      different breathing practices) undergoing an 8-week intervention, and pre-and
      post-intervention outcome measures.

      The two 8-week interventions will be guided by two separate certified experienced yoga
      teachers. Both interventions will consist of 60-minute weekly group on-site sessions
      (1day/week) with a 20-minute daily home sessions (in between on-site sessions; 6 days/week)
      using home-aid practice materials. Participants' respiration data will be objectively tracked
      using a wearable respiration tracker device.
