  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Streptococcus pneumoniae, commonly called pneumococcus, can cause a wide range of diseases in
      children from mild ear infections to deadly pneumonia or meningitis. Vaccination is currently
      the single best way to protect children. Nutrition, especially the amount of vitamin A, may
      play a role in how well your body responds to infection or a vaccine. We call this an immune
      response. This research will look to see if children who take a vitamin with their vaccine
      have a better immune response than children who do not take a vitamin with their vaccine.

      Primary Objective

      To evaluate the influence of vitamin A supplementation on Prevnar vaccine immunogenicity
      based on changes in antibody scores in a commercial ELISA at Day 21 (after a booster vaccine
      dose) compared to pre-vaccine values.

      Secondary Objectives

        -  To evaluate the relationship between baseline vitamin levels and pneumococcal or
           hepatitis A vaccine antibody responses (based on in commercial ELISAs) at Days 0 and 21.

        -  To evaluate the influence of vitamin A supplementation on hepatitis vaccine
           immunogenicity based on changes in antibody scores in a commercial ELISA at Day 21
           compared to pre-vaccine values.

        -  To evaluate relationships between total serum antibodies (based on individual IgM, IgG1,
           IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, and IgA scores in a Luminex assay) at Day 0 and changes between Days 0
           and 21 with baseline (Day 0) vitamin levels in young children, and with vitamin A
           supplementation.

      Children between the ages of 1 and 4 years old (inclusive) will be enrolled. All will receive
      PCV and hepatitis A vaccination. Those randomized to the treatment arm will receive 10,000 IU
      orally at the time of vaccination, while those randomized to the control arm will only
      receive vaccines. Vitamin levels and antibody responses towards the vaccines will be measured
      at screening, Day 0 (vaccination day) and Day +21. Children will be randomized using a
      stratified permuted block method.

    <description>The seroconversion rate, defined as the proportion of 4X increases or conversion from undetectable to detectable response in vaccine-specific antibody after vaccinations (Day 21) versus the baseline (Day 0) antibody level in intervention and control groups will be estimated and 95% confidence interval will be described for both groups. The 95% confidence interval will serve as a measure of precision of the seroconversion rate estimate. Chi-square test will be performed to make the comparison between two arms.</description>
