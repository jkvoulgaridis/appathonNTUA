  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Educational programs are essential for cystic fibrosis patients who need to take several
      different drugs every day. Compliance is often klow in these patients, and clinicals and
      paramedics try to increase it, through educational programs. As for inhaled therapies, the CF
      center of Montpellier uses a video conference tool to educate patients. The program may
      involve either the physiotherapist or the doctor or both. Through the present study, the
      investigators would like to evaluate the current practice at the CF center of Montpellier and
      verify if patients feel that the physiotherapist could handle the program on his own, without
      the support of a physician.
