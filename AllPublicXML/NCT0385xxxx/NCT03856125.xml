  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lateral epicondylalgia is a common musculoskeletal condition that approximately affects 1-3%
      of the general population. Several authors have found greater mechanical pain sensitivity in
      the radial nerve when compared with healthy subjects. Radial tunnel syndrome exhibits a
      similar clinical presentation to lateral epicondylalgia. Percutaneous electrical stimulation
      has shown reduce pain in several conditions. Percutaneous electrical stimulation on the
      radial nerve could cause an important relief in lateral epicondylalgia.

      Hypothesis: Percutaneous electrical stimulation on radial nerve plus exercise therapy in
      patients with lateral epicondylalgia is better than sham percutaneous electrical stimulation
      plus exercise.

      Randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled clinical trial, using Percutaneous Electrical
      Nerve Stimulation (PENS). PENS is technique to provide a transcutaneous electrical nerve
      stimulation current throughout needling filaments place close to the nerve.

      Study Aims:

      Aim #1: The primary aim of the study is to compare the effect of the immediate, short, medium
      and long-term of PENS on intensity of pain as measured by visual analogue scale (VAS) in
      patients with lateral epicondylalgia with random assignment to two treatments: PENS plus
      exercise program or Sham PENS plus exercise program.

      Aim #2: The secondary aim of the study is to compare the effect of the immediate, short,
      medium and long-term of PENS on pain free grip strength, disability as measured by Patient
      Rated Tennis Elbow Evaluation (PRTEE) and DASH questionnaire and pressure pain threshold
      (PPT) and area and distribution of pain in patients with lateral epicondylalgia with random
      assignment to two treatments: PENS plus exercise program or Sham PENS plus exercise program,
      and determine if psychological factors (fear and avoidance and catastrophism) change with any
      of the treatments and if is related with the primary and secondary outcomes.

    <description>It is a 15-item questionnaire designed to measure forearm pain and disability in patients with lateral epicondylitis. The PRTEE allows patients to rate their levels of tennis elbow pain and disability from 0 to 10, and consists of 2 subscales: pain and function.</description>

    <measure>Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to 4 weeks; 8 weeks; 16 weeks; 28 weeks; 52 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>It includes 30 items assessing (1) degree of difficulty during the preceding week in performing several physical activities because of problems in a upper extremity (21 items), (2) severity of each of the symptoms of pain, activity-related pain, tingling, weakness, and stiffness (5 items), and (3) the problem's effect on social activities, work, and sleep and its psychological impact (4 items). Each item is answered on a 5-point scale ranging from 1 (no difficulty to perform, no symptom, or no impact) to 5 (unable to do, very severe symptom, or high impact). The responses to the 30 items are summed to form a raw score that is then converted to a scale from 0 to 100 with a formula. A higher score reflects greater disability.</description>
