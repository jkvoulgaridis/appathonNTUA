    <description>Sagittal abdominal diameter (SAD) or &quot;supine abdominal height&quot; is a simple anthropometric measure shown to be a marker of insulin resistance. SAD is measured after normal expiration at the level of iliac crest while in the supine position with bent knees on a firm examination table and without clothes in the measurement area. The measurement is performed with the Holtain-Kahn abdominal caliper.</description>
