  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a rare inherited metabolic disorder, where subjects are born with a
      genetic deficiency in the phenylalanine hydroxylase enzyme (PAH), which leaves them unable to
      convert Phenylalanine (Phe) into Tyrosine (Tyr). PKU patients have specific dietary needs and
      must follow a restrictive diet in the aim of preventing toxic levels of the amino acid
      phenylalanine (Phe) accumulation.

      The aim of this explorative cross-sectional study is to gain quantitative insights on blood
      nutrient levels of adult PKU patients on a protein substitute.
