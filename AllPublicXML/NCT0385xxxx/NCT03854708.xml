  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators want to observe whether different doses of pancreatic polypeptide infusions
      influence gastric accommodation (measured as intragastric pressure changes during a liquid
      meal infusion), gastric emptying and food intake.

    <textblock>
      As pancreatic polypeptide (PP) influences food behavior in humans, our research group
      suggests a role via the the gastric accommodation or gastric emptying. Twelve healthy
      volunteers participated in this single blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial. An
      infusion catheter and a manometry probe were positioned in the stomach. After a 15 min
      stabilization period, saline (placebo), PP 3 pmol/kg*min or PP 10 pmol/kg*min were
      intravenously infused. Thirty min after the condition, an intragastric nutrient drink (ND)
      infusion (60 ml/min) started until the volunteer felt maximal satiated. GE was evaluated
      using the 13C breath test during the 6 hours following the ND infusion. Satiation and hunger
      were scored on a visual analog scale every 5 minutes.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The effect of different doses of pancreatic polypeptide infusion on the gastric accommodation (intragastric pressure drop) after nutrient drink infusion.</measure>
    <time_frame>Until 2 hours after the start of the liquid meal. Liquid meal started 30 minutes after pancreatic peptide dose or placebo iv infusion.</time_frame>
    <description>Intragastric pressure measurements were assessed using a 36-channel high-resolution solid-state manometry probe. After nutrient drink infusion, the intragastric pressure drops to a minimum value (Nadir), which is a measurement for gastric accommodation, and the pressure restores after. The time point of reaching the Nadir is different between subjects, but pressure is measured until 2 hours after nutrient drink to assess the drop.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The effect of different doses of pancreatic polypeptide infusion on nutrient tolerance.</measure>
    <time_frame>Infusion of the liquid meal ends after 20 minutes or earlier if max satiation is reached by the subjects.</time_frame>
    <description>Liquid nutrient drink was infused at a constant speed of 60 ml/min. At 1-min intervals subjects were asked to score their satiation using a graphic rating scale that combines verbal descriptors on a scale graded from 0 to 5 (0 is threshold, 5 is maximal satiation. Infusion stopped when the subject reached maximal satiation. The time of infusion is a measurement of their nutrient tolerance.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The effect of different doses of pancreatic polypeptide infusion on gastric emptying rate.</measure>
    <time_frame>Breath samples were collected in exetainers, twice before and every 15 min after the meal until 6 hours thereafter.</time_frame>
    <description>Gastric emptying rate after placebo and PP 10 pmol/kg*min administration was quantified using the breath test. 13C-labeled sodium octanoate were added to the ND (200 mg/L) and emptying of the stomach was assessed by analysis of the exhaled 13CO2.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The effect of different doses of pancreatic polypeptide infusion on satiety and return of hunger.</measure>
    <time_frame>Satiety and hunger were scored twice before and every 15 min after the meal until 6 hours thereafter.</time_frame>
    <description>The subjects rate their feeling of satiety (in fasted state)/satiation (in fed state) and hunger using a 100 mm line ranging from 0 to 100, as a response on the questions: 'How hungry do you feel? ' and 'How satisfied do you feel?'. 0 means 'not at all', and 100 means 'extremely much'.
These feelings cannot be considered to have a better or worse outcome. One expect to have higher hunger and lower satiety scores in fasted state and lower hunger and higher satiation scores in the fed state.</description>
