  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Peanut allergy is a growing public health problem in developed countries with more and more
      hospitalizations for anaphylaxis. It has been determined that sensitization to certain peanut
      proteins such as rAra h 2, is predictive of allergy and could predict the severity of
      reaction (anaphylaxis) during Oral food challenges (OFC). So far, consensual threshold for
      cutaneous test and IgE as predictor in the positivity of OFC have not been determined.
      Identification of reactive doses for OFC and phenotype of patients would help to personalize
      management of patients subgroups, with an optimal security.

    <measure>Reactive doses of peanut (mg) at which an allergic reaction appears in patients with positive peanut Oral Food Challenge</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>An Oral Food Challenge consists in the ingestion of the suspected allergic food. The patient is given increased dose levels of this food throughout a day. The OFC is positive when the patient presents a clinical reaction (clinical symptoms linked to an allergic response) triggered by the food ingested.
We'll gather the data of all patients who came in our unit of Allergology and who had a positive peanut OFC.
The reactive dose is calculated from the total cumulative dose (mg) of peanut reached when the OFC peanut is considered positive.
The reactive dose is considered as a time dependent data and will be analyzed with survival data analysis methods.
The analyzed event is a positive OFC</description>

    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>To identify, among the collected data on the patient's clinical history detailled below, the risk factors of occurrence of an anaphylactic reaction during peanut OFC.
Anaphylaxis is defined as a severe allergic reaction that appears quickly and has a fatal potential. It is usually characterized by the appearance of several signs and symptoms that can affect one or more systems of our body.</description>
