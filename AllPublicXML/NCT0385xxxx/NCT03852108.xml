  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pulmonary transplant is a valid therapy and now accept in some case of respiratory disease at
      final state of their evolution in selected patients according to morbidity associated. This
      exceptionnal procedure (+/- 350 patients per year) brings benefits in terms of survival and
      quality of life but stay nevertheless, an experience very gruelling, anxiogenic and painful
      with sometimes extend hospitalizations in intensive care and then in pneumology unit.

      Transplant can generate several complications like infection or rejection which can be fatal.
      The rate of death a year after the transplant is around 27% and whom 5 years after is around
      48% according Biomedicine Agency, 2016) It's also mar of physical consequences (pain, scrars)
      specific to this act and expose the patient to several psychologic disruptions (decrease of
      body reflect, difficulty to accept organ of an other person...) So post transplant period is
      a painful and frightening moment. However, fear is not only sensory, it's also an affective
      side involving unpleasant feelings, fear and anxiety. It's a subjective and personnal
      experience influenced by the culture, context and other psychologic variables.

      The collateral effects of transplantation could be controlled through additionnal diverse
      comfort cares but no care protocoles can be validated, especially because of multiple
      confounding individuals factors.

      Recent studies showed that socio-aesthetic care allow an improvment of pain perception after
      cardiac surgery or oncology treatment.

      The investigators propose to evaluate by a randomized controlled study the effect of comfort
      care of socio-aesthetic type on anxiety and pain in the aftermath of a pulmonary transplant.

      In their hypothese, comfort care as socio-aethetic (body care, massage, manicure, corrective
      make up) could bring a personnalized answer to these patients, adapting to their complaint
      and waiting. It could ease the pain, anxiety, decrease level of corrective care and their
      side effects.

      In their study, socio-aesthetic care will be done by therapist with 15 years of experience
      and working since 2003 in the oncology unit at la Timone Hospital and since 2009 to
      psychiatry unit to la Conception Hospital
