  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Comorbidities, including sleep problems, are common in adult Attention Deficit Hyperactivity
      Disorder (ADHD). Treatment of choice for insomnia is cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT-i),
      but evidence is lacking for CBT-i in patients with ADHD and sleep problems.

      The purpose of this study was to investigate if patients at a specialist clinic for ADHD
      benefit from a group delivered CBT-i treatment; whether insomnia severity improves following
      this treatment.

      This pragmatic within-group pilot study with a pre to post and three-month follow-up design
      was set at a specialist psychiatric out-patient clinic for adult ADHD.

      As an adjunct to care-as-usual at the clinic, a CBT-i-based group treatment targeting sleep
      problems prevalent in the ADHD-population, designed for patients with executive difficulties,
      was offered as 10 weekly 90-minute group sessions and scheduled telephone support.

      All outcome measures were subjectively reported by participants. Data analyzed with dependent
      t-tests according to intent-to-treat.
