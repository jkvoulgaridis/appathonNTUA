  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite the improved treatment of acute stroke over the past decades, those suffering from
      stroke still are at an increased risk of functional and cognitive decline in the long term.
      The most common consequences of stroke are functional impairments, cognitive impairments,
      depression and fatigue. These are also regarded as barriers to achieve optimal adherence to
      the guidelines regarding secondary prevention. The primary aim of this project is to evaluate
      the effectiveness of a multimodal individualized intervention to prevent functional decline
      in the long term after stroke.

    <textblock>
      In a clinical randomized controlled trial, participants randomized to the intervention arm
      will be followed with monthly meetings by a stroke coordinator for 18 months.

      The stroke coordinator will assess the patients risk factors within the domains of physical
      function, cognitive function, social function, medication and lifestyle factors and make a
      treatment plan targeting the individual needs for further follow-up.

      Those randomized to the control group will receive standard care.

      Patients living in the municipalities of Trondheim, LÃ¸renskog and Skedsmo admitted to
      Akershus University Hospital or St. Olavs University Hospital will be included at the
      outpatients clinic 3 months after the stroke.

      All patients will be re-assessed at 6, 12 and 18 months after inclusion. Primary outcome will
      be modified Rankin Scale at 18 months.
