  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the China extension study, Chinese participants with programmed cell death ligand 1
      (PD-L1)-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) will be randomized to receive single
      agent pembrolizumab for up to 35 treatments or standard of care (SOC) platinum-based
      chemotherapy (carboplatin + paclitaxel or carboplatin + pemetrexed for 4 to 6 21-day cycles).
      Chinese participants in the platinum-based chemotherapy arms with non-squamous tumor
      histologies may receive pemetrexed maintenance therapy after the 4 to 6 cycles of
      chemotherapy. The primary extension study hypothesis is that pembrolizumab prolongs overall
      survival (OS) compared to SOC chemotherapy in Chinese participants.

    <description>An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a study treatment and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment.

        <description>OS was determined for participants with a TPS of ≥50% and was defined as the time from randomization to death due to any cause. Participants without documented death at the time of the interim analysis were censored at the date of the last follow-up. The OS was calculated using the product-limit (Kaplan-Meier) method for censored data. The OS for participants with a TPS ≥50% is presented.</description>

        <description>PFS was determined for participants with a TPS of ≥50% and was defined as the time from randomization to the first documented progressive disease (PD) or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. Per RECIST 1.1, PD was defined as ≥20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of ≥5 mm. The appearance of one or more new lesions or progression in non-target lesions was also considered PD. The PFS per RECIST 1.1 was calculated using the product-limit (Kaplan-Meier) method for censored data. The PFS for participants with a TPS ≥50% is presented.</description>

          <description>PFS was determined for participants with a TPS of ≥20% and was defined as the time from randomization to the first documented progressive disease (PD) or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. Per RECIST 1.1, PD was defined as ≥20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of ≥5 mm. The appearance of one or more new lesions or progression in non-target lesions was also considered PD. The PFS per RECIST 1.1 was calculated using the product-limit (Kaplan-Meier) method for censored data. The PFS for participants with a TPS ≥20% is presented.</description>

          <description>ORR was determined for participants with a TPS of ≥1%. ORR was determined per RECIST 1.1 and was defined as the percentage of participants in the analysis population who had a Complete Response (CR: Disappearance of all target and non-target lesions) or a Partial Response (PR: ≥30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters) per RECIST 1.1. The percentage of participants who had a TPS ≥1% and who experienced a CR or PR is presented.</description>

        <description>An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a study treatment and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product or protocol-specified procedure, whether or not considered related to the study treatment or protocol-specified procedure. Any worsening (i.e., any clinically significant adverse change in frequency and/or intensity) of a pre-existing condition that was temporally associated with the use of study treatment, was also an AE. The number of participants who experienced at least one AE is presented. These safety results are based on a 04-September-2018 data cutoff date.</description>
