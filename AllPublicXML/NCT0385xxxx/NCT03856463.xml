  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the Team Based Advance Care Planning CAREPLAN program is to understand if a
      trained lay navigator who engages with patients with advanced stages of cancer can help
      patients in advance care planning, improve patient activation, satisfaction, quality of life,
      and the quality of end of life cancer care while also ensuring goal concordant cancer care at
      the end of life.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stanford Cancer Institute plans to implement and evaluate several critical elements to be in
      alignment with the mission of the organization to provide high value care to their patients.
      The CAREPLAN (Coaches Activating, Reaching, and Engaging Patients in Their End of Life Care
      Plan) intervention is an innovative program aimed to strengthen provider-patient
      relationships and facilitate whole person care about matters important to patients diagnosed
      with advanced stages of cancer and important to patients' support network and family. The
      project is intended to help establish patients' Goals of Care Plan with appropriate
      documentation, develop, deploy, and evaluate a model of care for patients with cancer that is
      intended to improve clinical outcomes and their experiences with their cancer care. The
      intervention provides patients with lay navigators who assist them and their families in
      formulating and discussing their goals of care with their health care teams in hopes to
      engage in shared-decision making for goal concordant care. The goal of the project is to
      demonstrate that there is improved documentation of goals of care, patient experiences,
      patient activation, quality of life, and quality of care and communication and that the
      program helps to improve goal concordant care receipt at the end of life.

    <description>Each patient will receive a validated satisfaction with shared decision-making survey (The 9-item Shared Decision Making Questionnaire) at baseline and 3 months after study enrollment. Patient Satisfaction with Shared Decision Making will be assessed with the use of the 9-question Shared Decision Making Questionnaire, on which responses are &quot;completely disagree, strongly disagree, somewhat disagree, somewhat agree, strongly agree, or completely agree.&quot; Responses for each group will be assessed at 3 months after study enrollment.</description>

    <time_frame>Change in Quality of Life from baseline to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Each patient will receive a quality of life survey (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - General Survey) at baseline and 6 months. We will measure the change in quality of life at baseline to 6 months. Scores for quality of life will be assessed using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - General Survey-General survey.</description>

Responses are: disagree strongly, disagree, agree, agree strongly with higher activation correlated with responses of agree and agree strongly. Scores for each group will be averaged at 6 months after study enrollment.</description>
