  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endemic nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is invariably associated with Epstein-barr virus (EBV)
      infection. Plasma EBV DAN detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based assays can
      provide important informations of disease screening, disease relapse, and risks
      classification. In this study, the investigators will explore the impact of serial plasma EBV
      DNA during chemotherapy and radiotherapy on initial tumor response and long-term survival in
      patients with non-metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma
