  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      NALDEBAIN ER injection, invented by Taiwanese, launched in 2017, is a nalbuphine synthetic
      prodrug with oil-based solution to extend the release in human body by intramuscular
      injection. It was approved for the premedication use for moderate to severe pain relief,
      expected after surgery. There was limited experience with the combination of medication and
      different type of surgeries. Only the effect of operative analgesia on the hemorrhoidectomy
      patients have been well studied. Through reviewing the past medical cases, the pain intensity
      after receiving take down of anastomosis was about 4 to 7 points (moderate pain), lasing
      about 1 to 3 days. It was a suitable population with multi-day analgesic unmet need.

      At present, the standard treatment after take down of anastomosis in the CMUH was morphine as
      needed. This treatment might not provide for well-controlled postoperative pain management.
      Patients might receive more painkillers when they needed than before pain occurred. Plus, it
      also cost more postoperative medical care. Therefore, this study intended to compare the
      standard treatment and NALDEBAIN for postoperative outcomes, safety and satisfaction.

      The study will enroll patients scheduled to electively undergo take down of anastomosis.
      Eligible subjects were randomly divided into two groups, one receiving NALDEBAIN and the
      other receiving standard treatment. The study will evaluate pain intensity, dosage of
      supplement analgesics, incidence of adverse reactions, patient satisfaction, time of the
      first fart after surgery, and duration of postoperative hospital stay.

    <textblock>
      This is an open-labeled, randomized clinical trial. After ICFs are signed, patients' medical
      history will be gained for checking if they are eligible for this study or not. And then, on
      Day -1, eligible ones will randomly be divide into two separate group: NALDEBAIN or MORPHINE.
      Group NALDEBAIN will receive Nadebain by gluteus maximus injection between 12 and 24 hours
      prior to surgery for postoperative pain relief. Group MORPHINE will receive morphine as
      needed after surgery. All necessary data will be gain form EMR or patient dairies.
