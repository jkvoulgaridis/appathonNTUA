  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      On the one hand, transferring patient from bed to bed is usually handling by the manual
      lifting of several staffs or utilizing bedsheet, slide sheet , shovel-style stretcher or
      other devices to move and lift patients. Whatever, there are some advantages using these
      devices.

      On the other hand, nurses are among the professionals at the highest risk for musculoskeletal
      disorders. The Bureau of Labor Statistics has shown that overexertion in manual lifting was
      the main event or exposure leading to injury or illness involving time away from work.
      Excessive weights, awkward postures, and repetitive motions are some of the known risk
      factors that contribute to sprains/strains and back injuries. During the process of patient
      transferring , it refers to the above risk factors for health-care workers. It recommended
      that using appropriate assistive equipment can reduce the injuries. If staff is safe,
      patients are safer.

      The research team has designed and produced a new transport assistive devices—— biodegradable
      and air-suspending transfer mattress, which was precisely controlled by gas flow and based on
      ergonomics. And then apply it to the clinic in order to find whether it's benefit for
      patients and nursing staff.

      It is a randomized controlled trial design.

      Research design：randomized controlled trials. Computer generated random numbers. The patients
      were randomly divided into three groups, ① transfer patients by air-suspending mattress, ②
      transfer patients by slide board, ③ transfer patients by bedsheets.

      Participants: passive patient with transports needs, such as CT/ MRI examination etc. The
      sample size estimation was according to the formula of multiple parallel design. The main
      outcome measure was the perceived exertion.

    <description>Self-made satisfaction questionnaire was used to get nurse staffs' satisfaction about the assistive devices after transferring patients. It includes seven items about using the devices to move patients --no adverse events, saving energy, saving time, convenience, applicability, strong support and total satisfaction. All the answers take five levels, level five means very satisfied and level one represents very dissatisfied.(Satisfaction of patient in scores)</description>
