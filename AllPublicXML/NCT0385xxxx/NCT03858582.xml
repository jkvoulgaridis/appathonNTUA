    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II single center, open-label, single arm study in patients with unresectable
      thymic epithelial tumors (Masaoka stage III, IVA). Patients will be treated with
      Pembrolizumab 200 mg, Docetaxel 75mg/m2, Cisplatin 75mg/m2 every 3 weeks for 3 cycles and
      will be evaluated for the operability. Patients with R0 resection will receive pembrolizumab
      200mg for 32 cycles. Patient who had R1 resection will receive radiation 52.8Gy/24Fx with
      pembrolizumab 200mg for 32 cycles. Patients who had R2 resection will receive radiation
      59.4Gy/27Fx with pembrolizumab 200mg for 32 cycles. Patients who showed non-progressive
      disease (PD) to initial neoadjuvant therapy but remained unresectable will receive radiation
      59.4Gy/27Fx with 200mg for 32 cycles. Otherwise patients are off the study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male/female participants who are at least 19 years of age on the day of signing
             informed consent with histologically confirmed diagnosis of TETs will be enrolled in
             this study.

          2. Locally advanced stage (Modified Masaoka stage III or IVa)

          3. No previous chemotherapy treatment history

          4. Male subjects should agree to use an adequate method of contraception starting with
             the first dose of study therapy through 120 days after the last dose of study therapy.

          5. Female subject of childbearing potential should have a negative urine or serum
             pregnancy within 72 hours prior to receiving the first dose of study medication. If
             the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test
             will be required.

          6. Female subjects of childbearing potential should be willing to use 2 methods of birth
             control or be surgically sterile, or abstain from heterosexual activity for the course
             of the study through 120 days after the last dose of study medication. Subjects of
             childbearing potential are those who have not been surgically sterilized or have not
             been free from menses for &gt; 1 year.

          7. The participant (or legally acceptable representative if applicable) provides written
             informed consent for the trial.

          8. Have measurable disease based on RECIST 1.1.

          9. Have provided archival tumor tissue sample or newly obtained core or excisional biopsy
             of a tumor lesion not previously treated. Formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded (FFPE)
             tissue blocks are preferred to slides. Newly obtained biopsies are preferred to
             archived tissue.

         10. Have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 to 1.
             Evaluation of ECOG is to be performed within 7 days prior to the date of
             allocation/randomization.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Has received prior therapy with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, or anti PD L2 agent or with
             an agent directed to another stimulatory or co-inhibitory T-cell receptor (eg, CTLA-4,
             OX 40, CD137).

          2. Has received prior systemic anti-cancer therapy including investigational agents
             except patient had no active treatment for past 5 years.

          3. Has received prior radiotherapy.

          4. Has received a live vaccine within 30 days prior to the first dose of study drug.

             Calmette-Guérin (BCG), and typhoid vaccine. Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection
             are generally killed virus vaccines and are allowed; however, intranasal influenza
             vaccines (eg, FluMist®) are live attenuated vaccines and are not allowed.

          5. Is currently participating in or has participated in a study of an investigational
             agent or has used an investigational device within 4 weeks prior to the first dose of
             study treatment.

          6. Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving chronic systemic steroid therapy
             (in dosing exceeding 10 mg daily of prednisone equivalent) or any other form of
             immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to the first dose of study drug.

          7. Has a known additional malignancy that is progressing or has required active
             treatment. Exception include basal cell carcinoma of the skin, squamous cell carcinoma

             drugs). Replacement therapy (eg., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid
             replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a
             form of systemic treatment.
