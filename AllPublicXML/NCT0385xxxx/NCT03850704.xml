      Selinexor is an oral, first in class, slowly reversible, potent and Selective Inhibitor of
      Nuclear Export (SINE) compound that specifically blocks Exportin 1 (XPO1). It is one of the
      most promising investigational drugs available for this patient with clear risk and benefit
      assessment favoring potential benefit.

          -  Active gastrointestinal dysfunction interfering with the patient's ability to swallow
             tablets, or any active gastrointestinal dysfunction that could, in the treating
             physician's opinion, interfere with absorption of treatment.

          -  Any active, serious psychiatric, medical, or other conditions/situations which, in the
