  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an interventional study, to assess feasibility and safety of durvalumab (MEDI4736) in
      neo-adjuvant setting in patients with resectable NSCLC. Additional analyses of potential
      imaging biomarkers, e.g. Zr-89 labelled durvalumab (MEDI4736), ex vivo In-111-oxine labelled
      CD8+ T-cells and high-resolution immune cell imaging, in relation to immunotherapy induced
      immune responses on quantitative immune histochemical analysis of the resected tumor
      specimen, will be performed.

      This is an interventional study in 20 patients with resectable non-small cell lung cancer who
      will receive 2 courses of durvalumab (MEDI4736) in the neo-adjuvant setting, followed by
      surgery with curative intent.

      Experimental imaging procedures include 1) Zr-89-labelled durvalumab (MEDI4736) scan prior to
      neo-adjuvant treatment to determine accessibility and intra-tumoral distribution of
      durvalumab (MEDI4736) and 2) injection of ex vivo In-111-oxine labelled autologous CD8+
      T-cells 48 hours prior to surgery. The scan is scheduled on the day of surgery and after
      surgery, the resected tumor specimen with In-111-oxine labelled CD8+ T-cells in situ, is
      fixated for high-resolution ex vivo imaging on a preclinical U-SPECT scanner and quantitative
      histopathological analysis, next to standard histopathological evaluation.

      Total duration of the study is maximum 42 days (from injection therapeutic dose durvalumab
      (MEDI4736) to surgery).

    <description>Patient related outcome measurements (PROMS) will be evaluated based on the EORTC-QLQ-C30 (quality of life) questionnaire (in Dutch) at baseline, prior to surgery, at first post-operative visit and follow-up.
The QLQ-C30 is composed of both multi-item scales and single-item measures. These include five functional scales, three symptom scales, a global health status / QoL scale, and six single items. Each of the multi-item scales includes a different set of items - no item occurs in more than one scale. All of the scales and single-item measures range in score from 0 to 100. A high scale score represents a higher response level.
Thus a high score for a functional scale represents a high / healthy level of functioning, a high score for the global health status / QoL represents a high QoL, but a high score for a symptom scale / item represents a high level of symptomatology / problems.</description>
