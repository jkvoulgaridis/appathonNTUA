  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are bothersome and more likely to occur in postmenopausal
      women. Frequent UTIs, as well as other problems with the urinary and genital systems such as
      painful sex and urinary frequency/urgency, are part of a symptom complex called genitourinary
      syndrome of menopause (GSM). Prasterone (Intrarosa®) is a man-made steroid that helps with
      painful sex in postmenopausal women. Because previous studies have shown prasterone to help
      with other GSM problems, this study was designed to investigate if prasterone used in the
      vagina decreases the number of UTIs in postmenopausal women.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are costly contributing to more than 8 million ambulatory
      visits (84% women) in the United States in 2007. Recurrent urinary tract infections (rUTIs)
      are UTIs diagnosed on at least 2 urine cultures in 6 months, or at least 3 in 1 year. The
      incidence of rUTIs increases in menopause with an estimated 10-15% of women &gt; 60 years old
      having rUTIs. rUTIs contribute to a constellation of bothersome genitourinary symptoms in
      some postmenopausal women called genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM). Thus, menopause,
      rUTIs, and GSM are intimately linked.

      Prasterone (Intrarosa®) is a synthetic version of the steroid, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA),
      approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in 2016 for the treatment of moderate to
      severe dyspareunia due to GSM. Large, prospective studies have shown prasterone to safely
      decrease vaginal pH, decrease parabasal cells, increase superficial cells, and decrease
      symptoms related to atrophy like dyspareunia in women with GSM. Given prasterone's favorable
      treatment effects on some GSM symptoms, investigation of prasterone as a possible treatment
      option for rUTIs in the setting of GSM is warranted.

      This is a single center, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial comparing the
      efficacy of nightly intravaginal prasterone for 24 weeks to intravaginal placebo in
      decreasing rUTIs in women with GSM. The study hypothesis is that intravaginal prasterone
      decreases UTI incidence in women with GSM compared to placebo.
