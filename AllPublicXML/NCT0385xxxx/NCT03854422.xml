    <textblock>
      Colonoscopy is one of the most common endoscopic procedures today. However, it sometimes can
      be a serious challenging situation both for the clinicians and patients. In this study, the
      investigators tried to determine which colonoscopic position allows easy, fast and
      comfortable way.

    <textblock>
      colonoscopy and colonoscopic screening are the most common routine studies to reduce the
      incidence of colorectal cancer.In this process, the most important problem for the
      endoscopist and the patient is pain, loop formation, (the reason why the device is not able
      to progress in the bowel) and in some patients it takes a long time due to these reasons and
      the risk of complication development.The subject of what should be the most ideal position in
      colonoscopy has previously been studied in some specific subgroups.There is not enough study
      on what should be the ideal position in colonoscopy. In this study, the investigators tried
      to determine which colonoscopic position allows easy, fast and comfortable way.

    <description>Left position, the patient will be in the left-side position during the entire colonoscopy period. If necessary, change of position and pressure will be allowed. During this procedure, the time to reach the cecum and terminal ileum, patient comfort, and the process memory lost will be measured.Moreover, process recall, sedation amounts and pain scale will be measured after the procedure..During the process, it will be examined whether there is any need for loop formation, repositioning requirement and pressure requirements. The type and amount of anesthetic agent (midazolam) used during the process is paid attention to be equal. All procedures will be done with the same brand device. After the procedure, a mini questionnaire will be applied to the patients for the pain scale.</description>

    <description>Left Supine position, the patient will be in the left and supine ( after splenic flexura) position during the entire colonoscopy period. If necessary, change of position and pressure will be allowed.

During this procedure, the time to reach the cecum and terminal ileum, patient comfort, and the process memory lost will be measured..During the process, it will be examined whether there is any need for loop formation, repositioning requirement and pressure requirements. The type and amount of anesthetic agent used during the process is paid attention to be equal. The use of midazolam as an anesthetic agent was planned.All procedures will be done with the same brand device.
