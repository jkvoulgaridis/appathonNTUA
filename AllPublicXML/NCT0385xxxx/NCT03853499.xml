  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Safe operative vaginal delivery requires a careful assessment of the clinical situation.

      During the pushing efforts, the complexity of the delivery can lead to choose between an
      operative vaginal delivery attempt and a caesarean section straightaway. An emergency
      caesarean section for failed operative vaginal delivery is associated with a higher fetal and
      maternal morbidity, compared to a successful operative vaginal delivery and to a caesarean
      section straightaway.

      The objective of this study was to develop a risk score of failed vacuum extraction leading
      to an emergency caesarean section.

      This score could be an objective tool to help the obstetricians to choose between a vacuum
      extraction attempt and a caesarean section straightaway.

      The investigators included patients who benefited from a vacuum extraction attempt in the
      Regional Teaching Hospital of Besançon (France) between January 2010 and December 2015.
      Patients were separated into two groups : the vacuum extraction failure group and the vacuum
      extraction success group.

      The investigators selected maternal, fetal and labor characteristics which could influence
      success or failure of the vacuum extraction and compared them between the two groups.

      The score was developed with the characteristics which significantly influence the vacuum
      extraction failure.
