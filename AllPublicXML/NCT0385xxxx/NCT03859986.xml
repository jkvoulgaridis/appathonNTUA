         10. Subject is in good general health and free of any known disease state or physical
             condition which, in the investigator's opinion, might impair evaluation of the AD

          4. Subject has any clinically significant laboratory abnormality, medical condition or
             physical/vital signs abnormality that would, in the opinion of the investigator, put
             the subject at undue risk or interfere with interpretation of study results
