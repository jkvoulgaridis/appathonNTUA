  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this 12-week, interventional study is to determine the effects of oral
      supplementation with Indus810 (dietary supplement with active ingredient Fenugreek) on body
      composition, muscular performance, and training adaptations

    <textblock>
      This 12-week study is a randomized, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, clinical trial of
      N=66 recreationally, but normal to moderately overweight/obese male subjects to be recruited
      at a single investigational center in Northeast Ohio (i.e. The Center for Applied Health
      Sciences).

      Subjects will attend 4 study visits. At Visit 1, subjects will be screened for participation
      (i.e., medical history, physical exam, routine blood work, background baseline diet). At
      Visits 2 (day 0 - Baseline Testing), and 4 (week 12), measurements of various hemodynamic,
      hematologic &amp; biochemical biomarkers of safety (Total testosterone, CBC, and comprehensive
      metabolic panel) will be made. At Visits 2, 3, and 4, the following efficacy measures will be
      obtained: Body Composition assessment via DEXA, Upper and Lower Body Performance testing on a
      Smith Machine and a TENDO unit utilizing the bench press and squat exercises, and anchored
      100mm VAS scales (for various psychometric indices). In addition, a comprehensive side effect
      profile/ adverse event monitoring will take place throughout the 12-week study duration.

               -  22-25; Waist:Hip Ratio 0.9-1

               -  25-35; Waist:Hip Ratio 0.85-1

          -  Normotensive (supine, resting systolic blood pressure &lt;140 mm Hg and diastolic blood
             pressure &lt; 90 mm Hg. If the first measurement is slightly elevated above these limits,
             the subject will be given a brief (5 minute) rest period, and two more measurements
             will be taken. The average of all three measurements will be used to determine
             eligibility.

          -  Normal supine, resting heart rate (&lt;90 per minute).

          -  Willing to duplicate their previous 24-hour diet, and fast for 8-10 hours prior each
             of the treatments.

          -  Has been participating in regular exercise training, at least 3 days per week, for the
             past 1-2 months.

        Exclusion Criteria:

             colon resection, gastro paresis, Inborn-Errors-of-Metabolism (such as PKU).

          -  Chronic inflammatory condition or disease (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease,
             ulcerative colitis, Lupus, HIV/AIDS, etc.). -Known sensitivity to any ingredient in
             the test formulations as listed in the Certificates- of-Analysis.

          -  Currently participating in another research study with an investigational product or
             have been in another research study in the past 30 days.

          -  Concomitant use of corticosteroids or testosterone replacement therapy (ingestion,
             injection, or transdermal).
