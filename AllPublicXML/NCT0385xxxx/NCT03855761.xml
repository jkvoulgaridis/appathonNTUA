    <textblock>
      This study will perform a needs assessment within an outpatient mental health unit, deliver
      an occupational therapy model of care, track patient and organizational outcomes, and provide
      training to staff to implement the model.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this project the investigators' overall objective is to implement a narrative
      medicine-based occupational therapy (OT) model of care that brings client voices to the
      forefront of treatment planning and intervention to enhance the existing interdisciplinary
      system of service delivery within Midtown Community Mental Health (MCMH). The investigators
      hope to accomplish this objective via the following specific aims:1) Assess current
      programming - particularly processes surrounding client assessment, treatment planning,
      intervention, care-coordination/residential placement, and discharge - within MCMH sites to
      better understand limitations/gaps previously identified by the site manager that impact
      equitable and effective treatment 2) Adapt an existing care model - the Art of Healing
      Wellness Model (AoHW) - to meet the needs of MCMH, implement the model using an OT
      practitioner, and track feasibility/acceptability outcomes. 3) Re-assess MCMH programming
      post implementation to identify/demonstrate change resulting from the model 4) Using OT in
      the role of consultant, offer training to current MCMH staff to enable implementation of the
      adapted AoHW by MCMH (baccalaureate level) care coordinators 5) Preliminarily evaluate
      usability of the adapted AoHW by MCMH staff via focus groups following training and staff
      implementation

    <description>The &quot;Occupational Circumstances Assessment Interview and Rating Scale&quot; is a semi-structured interview that measures a person's current participation in life in 12 areas:roles, habits, personal causation, values, interests, skills, short-term goals, long-term goals, interpretation of past experiences, physical environment, social environment, &amp; readiness for change. The assessment provides an overall quantitative summed score of participation ranging from 12 to 48 with a higher number indicating greater participation as well as individual scores of 1-4 for each subsection.</description>
