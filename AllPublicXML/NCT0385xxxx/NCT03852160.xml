  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of treating participants with
      treatment-resistant depression (TRD) who have failed at least 2 (and no more than 6) prior
      antidepressant (AD) treatments in the current moderate to severe depressive episode with
      flexibly-dosed esketamine nasal spray plus a newly initiated oral standard-of-care AD
      compared with placebo nasal spray plus a newly-initiated standard-of-care oral AD, in
      achieving remission and staying relapse-free after remission.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Depression is a major cause of morbidity and mortality, with global estimates of 300 million
      treated and untreated individuals worldwide. In its severe forms, depression is the most
      common diagnosis associated with suicide. Esketamine (S-ketamine) is the S-enantiomer of
      ketamine. Ketamine profoundly affects fast excitatory glutamate transmission, increases
      brain-derived neurotrophic factor release, and stimulates synaptogenesis, in contrast to
      conventional antidepressants (ADs) which are modulatory transmitters. The goal of any new
      antidepressant (AD) treatment would be the rapid and long-lasting relief of depressive
      symptoms. The study includes screening phase (2 weeks, with possible extension up to 4
      weeks), Induction phase (Week 1 to Week 4), Maintenance once-weekly phase (Week 5 to Week 8),
      Maintenance flexible-frequency phase (Week 9 to Week 32) and Follow-up phase (2 Weeks
      Duration). Total duration of study will be approximately up to 36 weeks. The safety will be
      monitored throughout the study.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants with Remission as Assessed by the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) (Total Score of less than or Equal to [&lt;=] 10) at the end of Week 8</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage of participants with remission as assessed by the MADRS (total score of &lt;= 10) will be reported and compared between treatment arms. The MADRS is a clinician-rated scale designed to measure depression severity. The scale consists of 10 items, each of which is scored from 0 (item not present or normal) to 6 (severe or continuous presence of the symptoms).These item scores are summed up to yield a total score. The range of the total score is 0 to 60. Higher scores represent a more severe condition. The MADRS evaluates apparent sadness, reported sadness, inner tension, sleep, appetite, concentration, lassitude, inability to feel (interest level), pessimistic thoughts, and suicidal thoughts.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants with Remission at Week 8 Without Relapse Until Week 32</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 32</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage of participants with remission (as assessed by MADRS [total score of &lt;= 10) at Week 8 without relapse until Week 32 will be reported at Week 32. A relapse is defined any of following- a) Worsening of depressive symptoms in participants who have achieved remission, as indicated by MADRS total score greater than equal to (&gt;=) 22 confirmed by one additional assessment of MADRS total score &gt;= 22 within next 5 to 15 days (until Week 32). Date of second MADRS assessment will be used for date of relapse; b) Any psychiatric hospitalization for worsening of depression, hospitalization for suicide prevention or completed suicide. For any of these events, start date of hospitalization will be used for date of relapse, c) Suicide attempt or any other clinically relevant event determined per the investigator`s clinical judgment to be indicative of a relapse of depressive illness, but for which participant was not hospitalized. The onset of event will be used for date of relapse.</description>
