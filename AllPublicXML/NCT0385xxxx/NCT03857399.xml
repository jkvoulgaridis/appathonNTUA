    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is evaluating the efficacy and safety of generics caspofungin in
      the treatment of the patients with neutropenic and fever.Another purpose of this study is
      comparing the pharmacokinetic characteristics of generics caspofungin and original
      medicine(Cancidas®) for providing a basis for clinical rational administration.

    <textblock>
      Caspofungin, a member of the new echinocandin class of compounds，had been proved as effective
      as and generally better tolerated than liposomal amphotericin B when given as empirical
      antifungal therapy in patients with persistent fever and neutropenia，and It was approved by
      FDA in 2001.The generics caspofungin of Chia Tai TianQing Pharmaceutical Group Co. , Ltd.
      (CTTQ) will be approved by CFDA.The purpose of this study is evaluating the efficacy and
      safety of this generics caspofungin in the empirical antifungal therapy in patients with
      persistent fever and neutropenia.

      This is a prospective,multicenter,randomized,controlled,open label study,the designed cases
      are 60 subjects.This study is divided into two stages,one is pharmacokinetics study stage
      ,the purpose of this stage is comparing the blood concentration of generics caspofungin and
      original medicine(Cancidas®) ,24 of 60 subjects will participate in this stage,the
      randomization in a 1:1 ratio will be performed at each group.The other 36 subjects will
      participate in another stage that is a single study,all subjects will use generics
      caspofungin.

    <description>Patients will be assigned to receive intravenous local caspofungin (70 mg on day 1 and 50 mg once daily),If the study therapy was well tolerated but fever persisted for four or more days and the patient's clinical condition deteriorated, the dosage could be increased to 70 mg once daily.For patients who have no evidence of baseline or breakthrough fungal infection, study therapy was administered until the absolute neutrophil count was at least 500 per cubic millimeter and for up to 72 hours thereafter. The onsite investigator determined the duration of therapy for patients with baseline or breakthrough fungal infections; however,it was recommended that treatment be given for at least 14 days and for at least 7 days after neutropenia and symptoms resolved.</description>
