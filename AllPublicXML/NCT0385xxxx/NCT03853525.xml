  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, researchers want to learn more about the effect of dexpanthenol dermal spray
      on skin recovery after a dermatological procedure for hair removal (laser depilation) in the
      groin and intimate area in adult women.

      After the hair removal procedure, participants will return within 3 weeks for 3 visits to the
      study center to investigate the skin condition such as redness, irritation, softness of skin
      and possible side effects. Study participants will also be asked about their general
      acceptance of dexpanthenol dermal spray.

      The primary objective is to evaluate the efficacy of the test product to aid skin recovery
      after lasering depilation in the intima and inguinal region.

      Secondary objectives comprise clinical efficacy with respect to skin hydration, softness,
      vitality, appearance etc. and skin recovery, consumer judgement of product performance and
      acceptability, and safety.
