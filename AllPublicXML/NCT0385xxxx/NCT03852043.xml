  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Overweight and obesity are a public health problem for society, reflected by an increase in
      its prevalence worldwide, being more frequent in women and related to low levels of
      self-esteem, accumulation of subcutaneous fat and internal organs, reduction of muscle mass
      (MM) and basal metabolic rate (BMR). Women are more predisposed to present weight gain
      because they are metabolically less efficient, have greater food intake, greater physical
      inactivity, and genetic factors. The different methods of physical training used for weight
      control are continuous training (CT) and the high-intensity interval training (HIIT). Both CT
      and HIIT have shown benefits without finding superiority of any of these methods.
      Nevertheless, there is a trend to the use HIIT programs, since they are more time-efficient
      and supports their use to induce physiological and metabolic adaptations over time, since
      this is a barrier to adherence to exercise programs. Overweight and obesity causes individual
      alterations in body composition and exercise leads to increase in MM, increase in caloric
      expenditure during the training session and increase in BMR due to the onset of muscle
      growth, secondary to an increase in the activity of the mitochondrial enzymes (greater
      mitochondrial biogenesis in the muscle), adaptations that could depend on the type of
      exercise, its intensity and the volume of it, but it is not clear due to the lack of evidence
      regarding this.

      The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate that a HIIT program of short duration
      in a real-world setting has a standardized mean difference (SMD) higher than 0.84 in the
      improvement of self-esteem when comparing with a moderate-intensity continuous training
      (MICT) in women 18 to 44 years with overweight and obesity and low self-esteem, during eight
      weeks.

      The secondary objective is to demonstrate that a low-volume HIIT in a real-world setting
      improves MM in 2% compared with MICT during a period of eight weeks in women 18 to 44 years.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fifty women with low self-esteem will be randomly assigned to one of two training programs
      (MICT or HIIT) in a real-world setting. Both groups will perform three times a week for
      eight-weeks on alternate days.

      The women in each group will perform three workouts per week for a period of eight weeks. The
      moderate-intensity continuous training group will perform a training session of 40 min
      duration at an intensity between 65 and 75% of your HRmax. Women assigned to the group HIIT
      will perform a training session of 22 minutes of duration by performing intervals of high
      intensity between 90 and 95 % of the HRmax for 30 seconds in duration and with a recovery of
      one minute training at moderate intensity is between 50 and 60 % of the HRmax, doing 15 loads
      of 30 seconds at high intensity, with 60 seconds of recovery between loads at moderate
      intensity. At the beginning of each training session, both groups will complete strength
      exercises mainly including large muscle groups (hip, knees, and ankles) with Theraband® (blue
      color ) for 3 sets of 15 repetitions.

      All participants will be evaluated before initiating interventions and upon completion of the
      training program, after eight weeks, self-esteem will be assessed using the Rosenberg
      self-esteem scale, determination of anthropometric variables such as weight, height, waist
      circumference, arterial pressure, body composition by bioimpedance and the basal metabolic
      rate.

    <description>Self-esteem will be measured by applying the Rosenberg self-esteem scale and according to the scores obtained, the individual will be classified as low self-esteem (&lt;30 points) or normal (&gt; 30 points). The internal consistency of the scale shows a Cronbach's alpha with values ranging between 0.83 and 0.88, and the reliability shows a test-retest correlation of 0.84. Therefore, there is high internal consistency and adequate temporal reliability. Supporting the validity (of construct and known groups) of the instrument.</description>

    <measure>Change in basal metabolic rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline and after 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Basal metabolic rate will be quantified at the beginning of the study and at the end through a portable gas analyzer model K4b2 (Cosmed Inc, IL, USA), the test will be performed between 7:00 - 7:30 am, the participant must have a fast of at least five hours, and abstaining from consuming products with caffeine and alcoholic beverages 12 hours prior to the evaluation. During the test, the participant must remain seated at rest in an isolated room for 15 minutes. The measurement of the resting metabolic rate will be made during the next 10 minutes in the same position. The criteria to determine a valid measurement will be: the stay in a minimum of 10 minutes in steady state, determined by: discarding the first five minutes of the measurement, reaching a coefficient of variation ≤10% for VO2 and for VCO2 during the ten minutes remaining and a respiratory quotient between 0.7 to 1.0.</description>
