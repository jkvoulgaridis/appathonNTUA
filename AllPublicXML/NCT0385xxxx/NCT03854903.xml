  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single-arm, phase I trial. It is designed with a conservative dose
      escalation plan to ensure patient's safety and with a strong translational component to
      inform if target inhibition is achieved. With concerns regarding safety, based on extensive
      available pharmacokinetic data and clinical efficacy experience, bosutinib will be given
      5-days in a row followed by 2 days rest in a weekly basis, instead of daily.

      The protocol will enroll patients per 3+3 escalation design. The Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT)
      observation period is 28 days. At the end of DLT observation period of each cohort of 3
      patients, decision will be made regarding further escalation or de-escalation according to
      this plan. Once the MTD of the combination is reached, the safety data will be analyzed.
      There will be no dose reductions during DLT observation period. Dose reduction within
      patients (individually) is allowed after the 4-week DLT observation period. Treatment in this
      phase I trial will be administered until there is disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

    <description>This is a 3+3 escalation phase I study. Three patients will be enrolled at each dose cohort and an evaluation of dose escalation will take place after 3 patients have completed 28 days of therapy. If none of the 3 patients has a dose-limiting toxicity, the next cohort will be treated at the next dose level as per the dose escalation schema. At each dose level, if one patient experiences a dose-limiting toxicity, an additional 3 patients will be enrolled. If 2 or more patients experience dose-limiting toxicity in a single cohort (either 2/3 patients, or 2/6 patients in an expanded cohort), the MTD will have been exceeded and dose escalation will stop.</description>
