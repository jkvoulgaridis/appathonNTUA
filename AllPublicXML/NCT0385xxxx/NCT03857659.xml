  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study us to compare the rate of prenatal identification of abnormal fetal
      growth or amniotic fluid between clinical evaluation of uterine size by symphysis fundal
      height (SFH) measurements versus point-of-care ultrasound (POC-US) evaluation of abdominal
      circumference (AC) and maximum vertical pocket (MVP).

    <description>6. The total costs of care from the health system perspective during the study period (from the date of enrollment through the mothers' post-delivery discharge and the infants' post-birth discharge). The hospital costs (for ER visits, admissions, delivery, and neonatal care) will be obtained from the Memorial Hermann Hospital cost-accounting system. The costs of physician services received during the study period by the mothers and the newborns will be estimated using relative value units (RVUs) based on claims data. The intervention arm will be augmented by the cost of the POC-US examinations. The POC-US costs will include the costs of the POC provider time (estimated based on limited time-motion studies, salary, and fringe data) and the depreciation costs of the portable ultrasound equipment.</description>
