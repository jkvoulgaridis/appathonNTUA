      The MARKOV study is an investigator-sponsored single arm, prospective study to assess the
      effect of evolocumab on the improvement in coronary flow (FFRCT) after 18 and 36 months of
      treatment in patients with coronary atherosclerosis.

      The MARKOV study is an investigator-initiated, open-label, single arm, international,
      multicenter, prospective study to assess the effect of evolocumab on the improvement in
      coronary flow (FFRCT) after 18 and 36 months of treatment in patients with coronary
      atherosclerosis. The study will be conducted in 5 sites in 3 different countries in Europe.
      Patients will receive evolocumab for approximately 3 year. The expected duration of the
      entire study from First Subject First Visit to Last Subject Last Follow-up is 46 months (3
      year and 10 months).
