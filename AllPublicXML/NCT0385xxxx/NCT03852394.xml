  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although non-invasive mechanical ventilation (NIV) is the gold standard treatment for
      patients with acute exacerbation of COPD (AECOPD) who develop respiratory acidosis, failure
      rate are still high ranging from 5% to 40%. Recent studies have shown that the onset of
      severe diaphragmatic dysfunction (DD) during AECOPD increases risk of NIV failure and
      mortality in this subset of patients. Although the imbalance between the load and the
      contractile capacity of inspiratory muscles seems the main cause of AECOPD-induced
      hypercapnic respiratory failure, data regarding the influence of mechanical derangement on
      diaphragmatic performance in this acute phase are lacking. With this study we aim at
      investigating the impact of respiratory mechanics on diaphragm function in AECOPD patients
      who experienced NIV failure. AECOPD with respiratory acidosis admitted to the ICU of the
      University Hospital of Modena from 2017-2018 undergoing mechanical ventilation (MV) due to
      NIV failure were enrolled. The study protocol consisted of two consecutive phases; in the
      first step measurements of static respiratory mechanics and end expiratory lung volume (EELV)
      were performed after 30 minutes of MV in volume control mode. In the second step
      transdiaphragmatic pressure (Pdi) was calculated by means of a sniff maneuver (Maximal Pdi)
      after 30 minutes of spontaneous breathing trial. Linear regression analysis and Pearson's
      correlation coefficient was used to asses the association between Maximal Pdi values and
      static and dynamic mechanical features and the association between Maximal Pdi and
      Pdi/Maximal Pdi.
