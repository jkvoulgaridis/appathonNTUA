  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Datas are lacking concerning weaning from mechanical ventilation for tracheostomized
      patients. In particular, the effect of different modalities of spontaneous breathing trials
      on respiratory effort has not been extensively described.

      This crossover physiology study will include 18 tracheostomized patients ventilated for more
      than 72 hours.

      The objective of this study is to compare the effect of three different modalities of SBTs on
      respiratory effort in tracheostomized patients. The modalities tested are : Pressure Support
      Ventilation (PSV level 5 cmH2O, PEEP 5 cmH2O), T-piece test and high-flow Oxygen. Each
      modality is applied in a randomized order, during 30 minutes. During every modality tested,
      esophageal and gastric pressure, expired CO2, and comfort will be monitored, in addition to
      standard monitoring. Based on esophageal pressure monitoring, patient's respiratory efforts
      can be calculated either by esophageal pressure-time product and work of breathing. Pressure
      generated by inspiratory muscles will also be assessed.
