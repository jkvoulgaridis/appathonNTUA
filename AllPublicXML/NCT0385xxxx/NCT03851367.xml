      This study compares effect of swiss ball exercises with sling suspension exercises in the
      treatment of juvenile osteochondrosis in adolescent-girls

      One of the main tasks in the treatment of osteochondrosis related back pain is training trunk
      stabilizing muscles. This might be achieved by using a sling suspension exercise systems.
      Redcord is a trademark for Sling Exercise Therapy. Suspension exercise training has been
      shown to improves functional movement patterns more effectively than traditional exercise by
      creating a challenging and pain free environment for movement re-training. Another commonly
      used option in the treatment of juvenile osteochondrosis is Gymball, also known as Swissball
      core training programmes that are popular trends in physiotherapy and strength and
      conditioning programs. Benefits of Gymball core training exercises that facilitate spinal
      stability and balance have often been emphasized by researchers in development of strength
      and endurance, flexibility, and neuromuscular control as a cost effective and enjoyable way
      to treat and prevent back pain. Both exercises modes are used in treatment of back pain and
      muscle training in young people with juvenile osteochondrosis, what is why this study aims to
      compare Sling Suspension therapy with Gymball exercise in this population.

    <intervention_model_description>Subjects were recruited from an inpatient rehabilitation department, specializing in the treatment of children and adolescents with degenerative disorders. The research population consisted of 40 adolescents-girls, who were diagnosed with juvenile osteochondrosis (according to the International classification of Diseases - ICD M 42.0). All subjects were randomly divided into two groups: Sling Suspension Therapy, and Gymball therapy.</intervention_model_description>
