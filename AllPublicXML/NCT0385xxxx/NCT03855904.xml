      Title: The efficacy of hemostatic powder TC-325 versus standard endoscopic treatment for
      gastrointestinal bleeding from malignancy; a multi-center randomized trial

      Background: Gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding arising from malignant tumors is increasingly
      recognized as a result of oncological advances and improved detection methods. However,
      conventional endoscopic hemostatic methods are not reliable to control bleeding. It has a
      trend to be an effective hemostasis method for active GI bleeding from tumor, however, in
      view of the lack of RCTs and large-scale studies, the efficacy of TC-325 is still
      inconclusive.

      Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of TC325 in endoscopic hemostasis treatment for malignant
      gastrointestinal hemorrhage.The 24-hour, 72-hour, 30-day, 90-day and 180-day rebleeding rate
      were assessed as the outcomes of treatment as well as 6-month mortality.

      Study design: Single-blinded, multi-center, randomized-control trial study The intervention
      (experimental) arm: TC-325 alone (define failure if continued bleeding despite application of
      1 syringes) The control arm: Standard of (traditional) endoscopic treatments

      ** Crossover is possible. Inclusion criteria: Patients with acute upper or lower GIB from a
      lesion that is actively bleeding at index endoscopy (spurting or oozing) and is suspected to
      be malignant or diagnosed as malignancy from previous tissue diagnosis.

      Exclusion criteria: Patients less than 18 years old, previously included in the trial, ECOG
      score 3 or 4, pregnancy/lactation, and/or bleeding from GI sources suspected of not being
      malignant. If an endoscopist is unsure of the malignant likelihood of the lesion, he/she will
      not be enrolled.

      Sample size: 140 in total

      Duration of participation for each volunteer: 180 days

    <intervention_model>Parallel Assignment</intervention_model>
    <intervention_model_description>At the time of initial early endoscopy, following fulfillment of patient and bleeding lesion eligibility, central randomization is carried out in a 1:1 ratio, in blocks of 4. The confidential centralized random numbers allocation is obtained by using REDCap (https://www.project-redcap.org/), a web based platform available to all participating centres. An independent staff member maintained the randomization numbers in sealed opaque envelopes. After obtaining a written informed from an eligible patient, the gastroenterologists who were blinded to the sequence of treatment opened the next numbered sealed envelope with treatment allocation.Randomization is stratified by location of bleed (upper versus lower GI tract), considering the lack of comparative outcomes data in the literature, thus balancing known and unknown confounding more completely</intervention_model_description>
    <primary_purpose>Treatment</primary_purpose>
    <masking>Triple (Participant, Investigator, Outcomes Assessor)</masking>
    <masking_description>Due to the nature of the intervention and control arms, blinding of the endoscopist is not possible (visual clues as to the nature of endoscopic treatment are evident and no sham procedure can be delivered since both are active treatment groups). However, in order to minimize possible patient/observer bias, any research team member or investigator assessing the patient after the initial endoscopy and involved in data collection or analysis, as well as the patient, and research nurse will be blinded to treatment allocation.</masking_description>

    <description>TC-325 compounds of inorganic, non-absorbable powder which acts locally at the mucosal tissue. When spraying the powder on to the blood, it will become a stable barrier sheet because of the effect of clotting factors accumulation and, then the normal healing process can be promoted.</description>
