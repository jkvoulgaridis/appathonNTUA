  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Surgical site infection (SSI) is a major postoperative complication after abdominal surgery
      especially in colorectal field, which significantly increases length of stay (LOS),
      readmission incidence and expense. Therefore, identification of the effective method to
      reduce SSI incidence is critically important. Combination of oral antibiotics and mechanical
      bowel preparation was reported with lower SSIs and LOS in some retrospecitve data analysis,
      however a prospective randmized controlled trial was absent. Herein, the current randomized
      controlled trial comparing MBP+OA with MBP alone in postoperative complications in order to
      guide clinical practise was conducted.

      Surgical site infection (SSI) is a major postoperative complication after abdominal surgery
      especially in colorectal field, which significantly increases length of stay (LOS),
      readmission incidence and expense. Therefore, identification of the effective method to
      reduce SSI incidence is critically important. Colonic bacterial flora is the major cause of
      SSIs after elective colorectal procedures. For more than century, preoperative mechanical
      bowel preparation (MBP) has been utilized as it could theoretically decrease bacterial load
      within the surgical field, thus reduce risk of SSIs. Later afterwards with widely application
      of antibiotics, combination of oral antibiotics (OA) and MBP was conducted by surgeons to
      further decrease rates of SSIs. But SSIs still occurs despite of forehead mentioned methods,
      the best bowel preparation mode remains controversial. Since 2005, several RCTs and
      meta-analysises demonstrated MBP alone was not associated with reduced SSIs compared with no
      bowel preparation, while postoperative ileus, anastomotic leakage and other complications
      incidence increased paradoxically. Nevertheless, function of preoperative oral antibiotics
      remains debated. Recently, combination of oral antibiotics and MBP has been evaluated in
      several retrospective studies and demonstrated a significant decrease in the rate of SSIs.
      However, bias existence in these trials may affect result as information was exacted from
      national database without detailed matching. Herein, current randomized controlled trial
      comparing MBP+OA with MBP alone in postoperative complications in order to guide clinical
      practise was conducted.
