  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Interstitial lung diseases (ILDs) are a heterogeneous group of disorders, which encompass a
      wide range of conditions. In some patients with fibrosing ILDs, a progressive phenotype
      similar to that observed in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) may develop during the course
      of the disease (PF-ILD), including patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc)-related ILD.

      The aim of the study is to estimate the incidence and prevalence and to describe the
      characteristics of patients diagnosed with non-IPF PF-ILD and SSc-ILD, to describe the
      natural course of disease, and to explore the correlation between mortality and Forced Vital
      Capacity (FVC) of the patients with non-IPF PF-ILD.

      This study will be based on two data sources: the French national medico administrative
      database (SNDS) and the ILD cohort from the National French center for rare pulmonary
      diseases in Lyon, France.
