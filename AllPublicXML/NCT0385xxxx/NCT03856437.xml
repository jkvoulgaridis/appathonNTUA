  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to determine the effects of message framing (gain vs. loss) on
      African American parents' acceptance of the HPV vaccine and how such effects are moderated by
      parents' salient beliefs prior to message exposure. Participants are randomized into gain and
      loss conditions in which they view either gain-framed or loss-framed HPV vaccination
      messages. Key outcome variables include parents' attitudes and intentions toward vaccinating
      their children against HPV.

      The goal of this study is to determine the effects of message framing (gain vs. loss) on
      African American parents' acceptance of the HPV vaccine and how such effects are moderated by
      parents' salient beliefs prior to message exposure. Participants recruited from local
      communities and online panels will complete a computer-assisted survey. In the survey
      participants will first answer questions related to their beliefs about HPV and the HPV
      vaccine (e.g., perceived susceptibility, perceived severity, perceived efficacy, perceived
      safety, etc.), as well as other background information. Then they will be presented with
      either a gain-framed or loss-framed human papillomavirus vaccination message. After the
      message exposure, they will answer questions related to their attitudes toward HPV
      vaccination, intentions to vaccinate their children, as well as other message response
      measures. Eligible participants are at least 21 years old, self-identify as African American,
      and are custodial parents or caretakers of at least one child ages 11-17 who has not
      initiated the HPV vaccine series.

    <description>Attitudes toward HPV vaccination will be assessed by three semantic differential items adapted from previous research. Participants will be presented with a statement (i.e., vaccinating my child against HPV would be ____) followed by adjectives such as &quot;Bad/Good,&quot; &quot;Stupid/Wise,&quot; and &quot;A bad idea/A good idea.&quot;</description>

    <description>Behavioral intentions toward HPV vaccination will be assessed with three questions adapted from previous research. Participants will be asked questions such as &quot;how likely would you be to get your child vaccinated with the HPV vaccine sometime soon?&quot; Since cost of the vaccine is a potential barrier, all participants will be asked to indicate their intentions to get their children vaccinated for two scenarios: 1) if they have to purchase the vaccine for the full retail price at the time and 2) if the vaccine is offered to them free of cost. The two measures will be kept separate as outcome variables.</description>

    <description>Participants will be asked to list the thoughts they had while viewing the message. They will categorize the thoughts into positive (in support of the message), negative (in opposition to the message), and irrelevant.</description>
