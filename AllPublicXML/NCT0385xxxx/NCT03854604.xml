  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It has been demonstrated that infants and children experience pain in a similar manner to
      adults, however it used to be undertreated when compared to adult.

      Perfusion Index (PI) derived from pulse plethysmography waveform, represents a ratio of
      pulsatile signal (during arterial inflow) to non-pulsatile signal. PI can represent the
      peripheral perfusion dynamics due to change of peripheral vasomotor tone. Low PI values
      suggest peripheral vasoconstriction and high PI values suggest peripheral vasodilation.

      The sympathetic nervous system is inherently involved in the pathophysiological responses
      evoked by painful stimulation.

      In the current study, investigators hypothesise that the PI could be a good objective tool
      for assessment of postoperative pain in children undergoing adenotonsillectomy.
