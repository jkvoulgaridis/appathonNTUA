  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The treatment of lymphoedema and its associated complications represent a considerable drain
      on increasingly limited NHS resources. Intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC) represents an
      innovative treatment for this condition, however the efficacy of IPC as a treatment for lower
      limb lymphoedema needs to be investigated via robust clinical research.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this research is to evaluate the effectiveness of intermittent pneumatic
      compression (IPC) as a treatment for lower limb lymphoedema as a whole, and to compare the
      effectiveness of a new generation device, in this case the LymphAssist (Huntleigh
      Healthcare), against older sequential models. The study methodology consists of a pilot
      randomised control trial of two groups - Intervention group A will continue to receive their
      standard lymphoedema care but will also be provided with a LymphAssist IPC device to use,
      mimicking manual lymph drainage therapy. Participants in intervention group B will receive
      their standard care plus an IPC device that uses sequential therapy. Each participant will
      act as a control for a 5 week period continuing with their standard treatment only. Outcome
      measures include impact on limb volume, skin stiffness and elasticity score and impact on
      quality of life scores.
