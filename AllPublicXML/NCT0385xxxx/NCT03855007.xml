    <textblock>
      This study is designed to observed prospectively the efficacy and safety of 6 months
      treatment of iguratimod alone, or with methotrexate (MTX), hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and
      prednisone step by step on Chinese rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and early rheumatoid arthritis
      (ERA) patients who were naïve or shown insufficiency response or intolerance to DMARDs.

      This study will enroll 200 cases of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and early rheumatoid arthritis
      (ERA) patients in China, who are naïve or shown insufficiency response or intolerance to
      DMARDs. The participants plan to be treated with iguratimod alone, or along with methotrexate
      (MTX)/ hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) / prednisone (Pred) step by step if participants are in
      medium or high disease activity (DAS28≥3.2). The efficacy and safety of 6 month Iguratimod
      treatment in RA and ERA patients will be evaluated with DAS28-ESR and other disease activity
      indices.

    <measure>The percentage of patients who achieve clinical remission at week 24 using European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) response criteria DAS28</measure>
    <time_frame>week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The percentage of patients whose Disease Activity Score in 28 Joints (DAS28) achieve remission（DAS28-ESR≤ 2.6）and Low Disease Activity (DAS28-ESR ≤ 3.2). The DAS28 is a composite score derived from 4 of these measures，that is the count of tender joint count（TJC, 0-28）and swollen joint count（SJC, 0-28）, measure erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR, mm/h) or C reactive protein (CRP, mg/L) and to make a patient assessment of disease activity i.e. 'global assessment of health' (GH) using a 100 mm visual analogue scale (VAS) with 0 = best, 100 = worst. DAS28 values were calculated as follows: DAS28- ESR = 0.56√(TJC) + 0.28√(SJC) + 0.70 ln ESR + 0.014 x GH. High disease activity: DAS28-ESR &gt; 5.1; Moderate disease activity: 5.1≥ DAS28 &gt; 3.2 to 5.1; Low disease activity (LDA) and Remission mean Clinical remission.</description>
