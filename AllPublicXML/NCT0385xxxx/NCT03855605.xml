  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Home blood pressure measurement has been recommended to use in the diagnosis of hypertension.
      The investigators have developed diagnostic algorithm of hypertension by using 24-hour and
      home blood pressure measurement. However, the diagnostic agreement between home blood
      pressure measurement and 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure measurement is about 70 - 85%. The
      discrepancy of diagnosis between home blood pressure measurement and 24-hour ambulatory blood
      pressure is one of the barriers to introduce home blood pressure measurement in the diagnosis
      of hypertension.

      To solve the discrepancy, identifying the characteristic patients showing discrepancy of
      hypertension diagnosis between home blood pressure measurement and 24-hour ambulatory blood
      pressure measurement is needed.

      The purpose of the present study are (1) to validate the diagnostic algorithm of hypertension
      by using 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure and home blood pressure measurement the
      investigators have developed, and (2) to identifying the characteristics of patients showing
      discrepancy of diagnosis between 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure and home blood pressure
      measurement, and (3) lastly to improve the diagnostic algorithm of hypertension by using home
      blood pressure measurement.
