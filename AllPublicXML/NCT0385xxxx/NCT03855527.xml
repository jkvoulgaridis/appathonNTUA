  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of silver diamine fluoride (SDF)
      compared to chlorhexidine (CHX) as a cavity disinfectant in primary molars after Atraumatic
      Restorative Treatment approach (ART).

      This study is a three arm randomized controlled clinical trial, where children with an age
      range of 4-6 years indicated for Atraumatic Restorative Treatment (ART) are selected from the
      outpatient clinic of Pediatric Dentistry and Public Health Department, Faculty of Dentistry,
      Alexandria University after securing necessary consents. Sixty teeth are randomly allocated
      into 3 groups of Atraumatic restorative treatment approaches. Group I is assigned to silver
      diamine fluoride as an antibacterial agent, Group II is assigned to chlorhexidine as an
      antibacterial agent, and Group III serves as a negative control.

    <description>Atraumatic restorative technique will be performed. Then the cavities will be dried with a gentle flow of compressed air. One drop of silver diamine fluoride (Advantage Arrest Silver Diamine Fluoride 38% - Bottle) will be dispensed into a dappen dish. A micro brush will be bent, dipped into SDF and dabbed on the side of the dappen dish to remove excess liquid before application. SDF will be applied directly to affected tooth surface and dried with gentle flow of compressed air for 1 minute. Excess SDF will be removed with cotton roll. Teeth will be restored with glass ionomer cement (GC Fuji IX).</description>

    <description>Atraumatic restorative treatment will be performed. Then, the cavities will be disinfected by placing a cotton pellet soaked in chlorhexidine solution (Consepsis®2% Chlorhexidine Antibacterial Solution) for 1 minute, air dried and restored using glass ionomer cement.</description>

    <description>Cavities will be cleaned according to the ART approach.The cavity will be enlarged if needed using sterile hatchet.The carious dentin will be removed with excavators starting at the enamel-dentine junction. The unsupported thin enamel will be fractured off with the hatchet. The caries will be removed carefully until firm dentin is reached (physically resistant to hand excavation). The cavity will be cleaned with wet cotton pellets. Cavities will be restored immediately using conventional glass ionomer cement. All the cavities in the 3 groups will be temporary restored with glass ionomer cement handled according to manufacturer's instructions, however acid etching will not be carried out in order to make sample collection easier following the experimental period.</description>
