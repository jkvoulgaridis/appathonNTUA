  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a multicenter, open-label, randomized clinical trial. Patients with ovarian
      cancer receiving postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy were eligible to enroll in this study.
      Eligible patients were randomly allocated in a &quot;1:1&quot; to &quot;Standard group&quot; ( 6mg PEG-rhG-CSF
      was administrated subcutaneously in 24h after chemotherapy) and &quot;Adjusted group&quot; (6mg
      PEG-rhG-CSF was administrated subcutaneously when ANC &lt; 1000/mm3 after chemotherapy). All
      patients need to receive at least 2 cycles of PEG-rhG-CSF administration. The primary outcome
      is the incidence of grade 3/4 neutropenia, and the duration of grade 3/4 neutropenia, the
      second outcomes are the incidence of FN, neutropenia-related hospitalization, incidence of
      reduction and delay of chemotherapy dose and safety of PEG-rhG-CSF.

      Patients with ovarian cancer receiving postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy were recruited and
      randomly allocated in a &quot;1:1&quot; to &quot;Standard group&quot; (6mg PEG-rhG-CSF was administrated
      subcutaneously in 24h after chemotherapy) and &quot;Adjusted group&quot; (6mg PEG-rhG-CSF was
      administrated subcutaneously when ANC &lt; 1000/mm3 after chemotherapy). Eligible patients
      enrolled in this study need to receive 6 cycles of docetaxel or paclitaxel (including
      liposome paclitaxel) and carboplatin on day 1, every 3 weeks. All patients need to receive at
      least 2 cycles of PEG-rhG-CSF administration. The primary outcome is the incidence of grade
      3/4 neutropenia, and the duration of grade 3/4 neutropenia, the second outcomes are the
      incidence of FN, neutropenia-related hospitalization, incidence of reduction and delay of
      chemotherapy dose and safety of PEG-rhG-CSF.
