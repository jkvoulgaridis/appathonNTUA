    <textblock>
      This investigation is a prospective, multicenter clinical investigation. It is anticipated
      that a total of one hundred (100) subjects will be enrolled at approximately 4-7 sites. The
      clinical investigation has been designed to follow the surgeon's standard of care for joint
      arthroplasty subjects, which entails clinical evaluation on a regular ongoing basis, or as
      needed should the subject become symptomatic in the treated joint.

      The objective of this clinical investigation is to demonstrate the safety and
      efficacy/performance of the ReUnion TSA System. Efficacy/performance of the procedure will be
      measured the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) Shoulder Score. Safety of the
      ReUnion TSA System will be demonstrated through reporting of device-related intra-operative
      and post-operative Adverse Events (AEs). Enrolled subjects will be assessed at Pre-Operative,
      Operative/Discharge, and at 6 Weeks, 6 Months, 12 Months, 24 Months and annually thereafter
      up to 10 years following the index procedure.

    <description>The ReUnion TSA System is designed as an anatomical total shoulder or hemi-shoulder endoprosthesis to address advanced arthritic disorders affecting the shoulder joint in subjects having intact or repairable rotator cuff function. The ReUnion TSA System consists of a completely modular shoulder platform including a Humeral Stem, Humeral Head and Glenoid. The intended purposes of the ReUnion TSA System are to achieve pain relief, improvement of range of motion and restoration or improvement of the shoulder function while ensuring long-term replacement of the shoulder joint with sufficient stability of all endoprosthesis components.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject is willing to sign the informed consent.

          -  Subject is willing and able to comply with postoperative scheduled clinical and
             radiographic evaluations.

          -  Subject is male or non-pregnant female and 18 years or older at the time of surgery.

          -  Subject has one or more of the following:

               -  Aseptic necrosis of the humeral head

               -  Painful, disabling joint disease of the shoulder resulting from degenerative
                  arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis or post-traumatic arthritis

               -  Failed previous total shoulder replacement, resurfacing or other procedure

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has an active or suspected latent infection in or about the shoulder joint.

          -  Subject has mental or neuromuscular disorder which would create an unacceptable risk
             of prosthesis instability, prosthesis fixation failure or complications in
             postoperative care.

          -  Subject has bone stock compromised by disease, infection or prior implantation which
             cannot provide adequate support and/or fixation to the prosthesis.

          -  Subject has anticipated activities which would impose high stresses on the prosthesis
             and its fixation.

          -  Subject is obese such that he/she produces a load on the prosthesis which can lead to
             failure of fixation of the device or to failure of the device itself.

          -  Subject has absent, irreparable or non-functioning rotator cuff and other essential
             muscles.

          -  Subject has concomitant disease(s) which may significantly affect the clinical
             outcome.

          -  Subject has traumatic or pathologic fracture of the proximal humerus.
