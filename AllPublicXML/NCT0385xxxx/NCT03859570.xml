  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Glomerulonephritis is an important manifestation in about 1/2 of patients with Systemic Lupus
      Nephritis (SLE; lupus). Despite recent national guidelines recommending use of induction
      therapy with high-dose corticosteroids and immunosuppressive agents, followed by prolonged
      maintenance therapy, up to 1/3 of these patients continue to have active nephritis and
      ongoing protein in the urine (proteinuria). It has long been recognized that both the level
      and chronicity of proteinuria in patients with lupus nephritis are associated with disease
      severity and with long-term prognosis, including the possibility of progression to complete
      kidney failure, which may occur in about 1/4 of patients. Pentoxifylline (PTX) is an oral
      medication introduced 45 years ago for treatment of vascular insufficiency. It has also
      recently been found to reduce proteinuria in patients with diabetic nephropathy. The
      mechanism of this unexpected and intriguing finding is not certain, but may in part involve
      inhibiting the production of TNF-alpha, an inflammatory cytokine known to be present in urine
      and kidneys of patients with lupus nephritis. Our hypothesis is that this inexpensive,
      generic drug, PTX, can significantly reduce proteinuria in patients with lupus nephritis.

      To test this hypothesis, we plan to initiate a 6-month, double-blind, placebo-controlled
      randomized clinical trial of PTX or placebo in 40 patients with active lupus nephritis. This
      trial will include 6-8 patients from each of 5 different academic medical centers that
      specialize in the treatment of lupus nephritis. Our primary objective of this trial will be
      to measure urine protein each month to determine the extent to which PTX is able to reduce
      urine protein, and how rapidly this occurs.

      Concurrently, we will carefully follow these patients each month to determine whether PTX
      administration is also associated with stabilization of renal function, or with improvement
      in other manifestations of lupus, such as clinical disease activity or abnormal laboratory
      findings. A major secondary objective will be to explore the possible mechanism(s) whereby
      PTX reduces proteinuria. For this purpose, we will use the monthly urine specimens to measure
      TNF-alpha, and levels of several other proteins (IL-1, IL-6, IL-2, MCP-1, TGF-beta, PDGF, and
      IFN-alpha) that have been shown to contribute to inflammation and scarring in lupus
      nephritis. Comparison of levels of these inflammatory proteins with level of protein in the
      urine should help us to determine whether one or more of these proteins is a contributor to
      the severity or persistence of lupus nephritis.

      This information may also allow us to learn whether repeated measurements of these proteins
      can serve as biomarkers to assist in the ongoing management of patients with lupus nephritis.
      Finally, we hope to eventually measure levels of these inflammatory proteins in blood samples
      from the patients, to determine if PTX treatment can suppress (or enhance) such levels, and
      whether these changes are associated with reduced lupus disease activity, or improvement in
      other manifestations of lupus. Ultimately, it is our hope that the data from this clinical
      trial using a generic repurposed drug will permit us to conclusively confirm that PTX can
      significantly reduce proteinuria in patients with lupus nephritis, which would be of great
      benefit for the thousands of people who suffer with this most severe type of lupus.

      Glomerulonephritis occurs in up to one-half of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus
      (SLE) and is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Guidelines published by the American
      College of Rheumatology in 2012 (1) suggested a multi-targeted treatment approach that has
      been shown to lead to clinical remission in up to one-half of patients (2,3).

      However, at least one-third of patients continue to have active disease; many of these
      individuals may eventually develop renal failure. Therefore, there is an unmet need for more
      effective therapeutic approaches for lupus nephritis (LN). Although the pathogenesis of LN is
      almost certainly multifactorial, the presence and persistence of immune complexes are thought
      to play a major role in disease pathogenesis by attracting inflammatory cells of the innate
      immune system, such as neutrophils and monocytes, resulting in cell activation and secretion
      of inflammatory cytokines, including interferon alpha, TGF-beta, IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-alpha
      (6-7). Pentoxifylline (PTX) is a nonselective phosphodiesterase inhibitor with minimal
      toxicity. It has been in clinical use since 1972 for treatment of patients with intermittent
      claudication secondary to peripheral vascular disease. This generic drug has also recently
      been increasingly used off-label for several other conditions, including patients with
      diabetic nephropathy, in whom the unexpected finding of significant reduction of proteinuria
      has been repeatedly demonstrated (34-38). The mechanism of this phenomenon is unclear,
      although experimental studies in animals and humans have observed suppression of inflammatory
      cytokine production following PTX administration (24-28). In LN, 2 small, uncontrolled
      observational studies of PTX reported reduction in proteinuria following 2-6 months of
      treatment with PTX (8,9). The level and chronicity of proteinuria have long been associated
      with disease prognosis in patients with LN (10). Thus, a novel treatment that could
      significantly and persistently reduce or even eliminate proteinuria could result in
      substantial improvement in the long-term outcome of patients with this most serious
      manifestation of SLE.

                  characterized by more than 500 mg urine protein, quantitated either by 24-hour
                  urine collection or by urine protein/creatinine ratio (UPCR) more than 0.5 mg/mg,
                  measured on a first void morning specimen, in the absence of other
                  glomerulopathies; or

               3. Abnormal urine sediment, containing more than 5 RBC, more than 5 WBC, or cellular
                  casts on 2 occasions, at least 2 weeks apart, in the absence of infection,
                  concurrent menstruation, anatomic genitourinary abnormalities, or pathologic
                  disorders other than lupus nephritis.

          2. Absence of changes in immunosuppressive agents or dose of immunosuppressive agents

             months of initial induction therapy.

          3. Unless contraindicated, patients will be required to be taking an ACE inhibitor or
             ARB, with stable dose for at least 1 month prior to enrollment. Patients with
             intolerance of ACE/ARB therapies will be eligible to participate, but will be analyzed

             to screening.

         11. Myocardial infarction, percutaneous coronary intervention, coronary bypass graft
             surgery, or unstable angina within 6 months prior to screening

         12. BP greater than 150/95 on 2 measurements in the sitting position after 5 minutes of
             rest, using a manual BP cuff

         13. Known diagnosis of diabetes mellitus or hemoglobin A1c greater than 8.0
