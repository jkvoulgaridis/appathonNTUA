      TP53 mutation is commonly associated with poor cancer patient prognosis yet no mutant p53
      (mp53)-targeting regimen was clinically established. Here the investigators try to evaluate
      the side effect and treatment potential of DAC+ATO in p53 mutated high-risk AML/MDS patients.

      50 AML/MDS patients will be sequenced for TP53 sequence before recruitment. The investigators
      estimated 2-5 patients, based on the reported p53 mutation frequency in AML/MDS, will be
      p53-mutated. In the trial, the investigators will selectively recruit the mp53 AML/MDS
      patients that are predicted to respond to DAC+ATO regimen with highest chance (based on the
      relevant basic studies).

      The investigators designate mutant p53-based clinical trials as 'PANDA-Trials'.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      TP53 mutation is commonly associated with poor cancer patient prognosis yet no mutant p53
      (mp53)-targeting regimen was clinically established. In two independent clinical trials
      reported recently, DNA demethylating drug Decitabine (DAC) treatment yielded a surprisingly
      high rate of complete remission (CR) in mp53-expressing myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS)
      patients and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients. Notably, all of the mp53-expressing
      patients in the two clinical studies, despite of CR, relapsed quickly. This was attributed to
      a failure in thoroughly clearing all leukemia-specific mutations and the preexisting mp53
      subclone outgrew in all of the relapse patients. Indeed, The investigators also found p53
      dysfunctional cells quickly develop a DAC resistance mechanism in cultured tissue
      (unpublished data). Meanwhile, the investigators found arsenic trioxide (ATO) selectively
      inhibit p53-mutated cells involving mutant p53 degradation. In addition, DAC and ATO show
      synergy in inhibiting p53-mutated cells.

      In current phase I trial, the investigators try to evaluate the side effect and treatment
      potential of DAC+ATO in p53 mutated high-risk MDS patients. 50 AML/MDS patients will be
      recruited for TP53 sequencing before being trialed. The investigators estimated 2-5 patients,
      based on p53 mutation frequency in AML/MDS, will be sequenced to be mp53-positive. The
      mp53-positive AML/MDS patients are known to have an extremely poor prognosis. The
      investigators will select high-risk mp53 MDS patients that are predicted to respond to
      DAC+ATO with highest chance based on our relevant basic studies.

      The other participants (estimated 45-48) will be excluded from the trial.
