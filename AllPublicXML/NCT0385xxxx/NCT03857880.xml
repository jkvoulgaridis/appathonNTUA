  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mitochondrial diseases are complex diseases with great clinical and genetic heterogeneity and
      their diagnosis is difficult.

      The Medical Genetics Department includes among its activities the diagnosis of these
      diseases. It has been a reference centre for mitochondrial diseases at the national level
      since 2006 and was recently approved under the call for projects &quot;European Reference Network
      (ERN) for rare diseases&quot;, EURO-NMD, supported by the Nice University Hospital. The routine
      diagnostic strategy is based on high throughput mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequencing analysis
      and a panel of 281 targeted &quot;mitochondriopathies&quot; genes. When these analyses are negative, an
      exome analysis (high throughput sequencing of all exons in the genome) can be performed in a
      research setting. To date, about 40% of the patients analysed remain without genetic
      diagnosis. Indeed, it does not allow to identify large variations of deletion, duplication or
      CNV (copy number variation) type. Moreover, targeting only exons, exome sequencing does not
      allow the detection of intronic or localized mutations in regulatory regions.

      The identification of CNVs is made possible by chromosomal analysis on a DNA chip (CADC).
      This recognized technique is used routinely in the laboratory. The investigators use chips
      with a minimum resolution of approximately 13Kb for the genome-wide study of CNVs in patients
      with developmental disorders. However, this resolution is insufficient to detect rework
      events of the order of magnitude of an exon. There are high-resolution DNA chips, compatible
      with our platform, that would allow the investigators to more accurately visualize smaller
      rearrangements that could not be identified by exome analysis. The combined exome/CADC
      strategy has already proven its effectiveness in diagnosing various diseases by increasing
      yield.

      In this context, the investigators aim to use this strategy in this non-interventional study
      on a series of 15 patients with mitochondrial disease who remain undiagnosed after analysis
      of mtDNA, gene panel and exome. They will test 2 types of patients:

        -  In the first series, whose disease is supposed to be transmitted in an autosomal
           recessive mode, only one heterozygous variant was identified in a gene already described
           in a comparable clinical picture. It is therefore possible that these patients are
           carriers on the second allele of a CNV, which the exome sequencing could not identify.

        -  In the second series, the exome analysis did not allow the identification of a single
           responsible gene (several candidate genes without any certainty on the pathogenicity of
           the gene(s) or variant(s))
