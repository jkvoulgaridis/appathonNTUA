  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to improve health care for patients with chronic LBP and
      increase the likelihood that patients obtain outcomes that matter most to them. The
      investigators will accomplish our goal using a sequential multiple randomization (SMART)
      design comparing the effectiveness of Phase 1 (PT v. CBT) treatments for patients with
      chronic LBP; and among patient non-responsive to Phase I treatment, compare the effectiveness
      of Phase II treatments (switching to PT or CBT v. mindfulness). Effectiveness will be based
      on patient-centered outcomes. Sub-aims will compare main effects of Phase 1 and 2 treatment
      options and the sequencing effects of different treatment combinations.

    <textblock>
      The study uses a sequential multiple randomization (SMART) design. The study will compare the
      effectiveness of common first-line treatments for chronic LBP: PT or CBT. Initial treatment
      will be 8 weeks duration with re-evaluation at 10-weeks after enrollment to allow time to
      complete treatment. At the 10-week assessment researchers will examine if the patient has
      responded to initial treatment using a patient-centered, validated definition of successful
      response based on 50% improvement in the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI). Patients who are
      responders to initial treatment will receive up to 2 additional sessions of the same
      treatment to assist transition to self-management. Non-responders will be re-randomized to a
      second treatment strategy of either switching to the other initial treatment (i.e., patients
      receiving PT switch to CBT or vice versa), or mindfulness. The second treatment phase is also
      8 weeks in duration. Additional follow-ups occur 26- and 52 weeks after enrollment.

      The study has two co-primary outcomes; function and pain. The investigators will use the ODI,
      a well-validated, reliable and responsive patient-reported measure of LBP-related function
      recommended by the NIH Back Pain Task Force. The investigators will assess pain intensity
      with 0-10 ratings ('0' indicating no pain and '10' worst imaginable pain). Separate ratings
      are made for current, worst and best pain over the past 24 hours with an average computed to
      represent pain intensity. Secondary outcomes will assess dimensions of quality of life, work
      and healthcare utilization.
