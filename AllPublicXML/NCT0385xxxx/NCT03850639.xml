      The primary objective with this study is to investigate the feasibility of an
      internet-delivered cognitive-behavioral (CBT) intervention provided soon after trauma (within
      2 months). The secondary objective is to investigate the effects of the internet-delivered
      CBT intervention on intrusive memories compared to no treatment.

      Objective The primary objective with this study is to investigate the feasibility of an
      internet-delivered psychological intervention provided soon after trauma (within 2 months).
      The secondary objective is to investigate the effects of the internet-delivered CBT
      intervention on intrusive memories compared to no treatment.

      Trial design We will first pre-pilot test the intervention- and assessment procedures in five
      participants (no randomization) which will be followed by a randomized controlled trial with
      waitlist control. The wait list control group will also receive treatment after the first
      group has finished.

      SAMPLE SIZE 5 plus 30 participants.

      ENDPOINTS Self-report assessment of daily intrusions at baseline and post-treatment

      SECONDARY ENDPOINTS The Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5) at baseline
      (and post-treatment Montgomery Åsberg Depression Rating Scale - Self-report (MADRS-S) at
      baseline and post-treatment.

      Euroqol, EQ-5D at baseline and post-treatment.

      Recruitment Self-referral. Advertising will be made through national newspapers, social
      media, patient organisations' and ads directed to health care units, such as emergency
      departments, in Sweden.

      Safety parameters Participants will have the opportunity to report any adverse events during
      treatment at posttreatment and follow-up measurements.

      Data collection: Data will be collected electronically via the treatment platform and a safe
      app.

      Main statistical analysis:

      Between-group estimates on outcome are done using a mixed-effects regression model with a
      Poisson distribution. All analyses will be done according to intention to treat and post hoc
      per protocol analyses will also be conducted. The primary criterion is the estimated
      regression slope of daily intrusive memories between day 0-7 and day 28-35.

    <description>Change in self-report assessment of daily intrusions at baseline (day 0-7) and post-treatment (day 28-35). The participants are each day asked to report number of intrusive memories during morning, afternoon, evening and night through a smart phone app. If the participants don't have access to a smart phone, pen and stencil will be used.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline (day 0-7), post-treatment (day 28-35) and follow-up 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Change in symptoms of post traumatic stress from baseline to post treatment and follow up (6 months). The PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5) is a 20-item self-report measure that assesses the presence and severity of PTSD symptoms. All items are scored on a 0-4 scale. Higher score indicate worse severity.</description>

    <description>Change in depressive symptoms from baseline to post treatment and follow up (6 months). The Montgomery Åsberg Depression Rating Scale - Self-report (MADRS-S) is a 9 item self-report measure that assesses the presence and severity of depressive symptoms. All items are scored on a 0-6 scale. Higher score indicate worse severity.</description>

    <measure>Euroqol, EQ-5D</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (day 0-7), post-treatment (day 28-35) and follow-up 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Change in overall health from baseline to post treatment and follow up (6 months). EQ-5D is a standardised self-report measure of overall health status measured in terms of five dimensions; mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Mobility dimension asks about the person's walking ability. Self-care dimension asks about the ability to wash or dress by oneself, and usual activities dimension measures performance in &quot;work, study, housework, family or leisure activities&quot;. In pain/discomfort dimension, it asks how much pain or discomfort they have, and in anxiety/depression dimension, it asks how anxious or depressed they are. The respondents self-rate their level of severity for each dimension using a three-level scale: 1 having no problems, 2 having some problems and 3 having extreme problems. A higher score indicate worse severity.</description>

Other interventions include psychoeducation, and breathing retraining to facilitate exposure.</description>
