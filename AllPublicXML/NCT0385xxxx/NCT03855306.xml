      Comparative randomized, single dose, two-way crossover open-label study to determine the
      bioequivalence of Glibenclamide from Glibesyn 5 mg tablets (Manufactured by Medochemie LTD
      Cyprus) and Daonil 5 mg tablets (Sanofi-Aventis Cyprus Ltd. ) after a single oral dose
      administration of each to healthy adults under fasting conditions

      Primary Pharmacokinetic Parameters: Cmax, AUC0→t and AUC0→∞ Secondary Pharmacokinetic
      Parameters: Ke, tmax and t1/2e. ANOVA using 5% significance level for transformed (with the
      90% confidence intervals) and untransformed data of Cmax, AUC0→t and AUC0→∞ and for
      untransformed data of Ke, tmax and t1/2e. The confidence intervals of logarithmically
      transformed Test/Reference ratios for Cmax, AUC0→t and AUC0→∞ to be within 80.00-125.00%.

      A comprehensive final report will be issued upon the completion of the study.
