  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single arm, phase II study without blinding. The purpose is to determine the impact
      of hepatic artery infusion Floxuridine (FUDR) on liver metastases from pancreatic
      adenocarcinoma. Patients at Spectrum Health will receive standard of care chemotherapy. They
      will also receive chemotherapy via surgically placed hepatic artery infusion (HAI) pump.

      This study hypothesizes that the combination of Floxuridine (FUDR), a type of chemotherapy,
      delivered via a hepatic artery infusion (HAI) pump, with standard of care systemic
      chemotherapy will lead to improved survival in the treatment of pancreatic cancer liver
      metastases. Patients will receive 6 cycles of FUDR and will be followed for two years.

    <description>Once enrolled, patients will undergo surgical placement of the HAI pump. This can be accomplished using minimally invasive or open techniques with an anticipated hospital stay of approximately 3-5 days. Prior to discharge from the hospital or at the first postoperative visit the pump is filled with FUDR according to the following equation: 0.12 mg/kg/d (using ideal body weight). This fill initiates day 1 of a 4-week cycle. The chemotherapy is infused by the pump continuously over 14 days. On day 15 (+/-4 days), the remaining chemotherapy is removed from the pump which is refilled with heparinized saline (30,000 units). This remains for an additional 2 weeks until the pump is refilled with FUDR at the start of the next cycle. Treatment is continued for a maximum of 6 cycles or as limited by toxicity. This regimen has been utilized with an acceptable safety profile in the setting of colorectal liver metastases.</description>

    <description>Together the FUDR and the HAI pump are experimental because they are being used to treat hepatic liver metastases of Pancreatic adenocarcinoma. They have not yet been FDA approved for this indication, although they are both approved for other indications. The intervention is surgical placement of an HAI pump with subsequent delivery of FUDR via the pump in 28-day cycles. FUDR will be delivered via the HAI pump for 6 months, in 28 day cycles: 2 weeks of therapy, followed by 2 weeks of heparinized saline.</description>

They have not yet been FDA approved for this indication, although they are both approved for other indications. The intervention is surgical placement of an HAI pump with subsequent delivery of FUDR via the pump in 28-day cycles. The primary tumor will be resected or ablated with irreversible electroporation at the time of HAI pump placement. FUDR will be delivered via the HAI pump for 6 months, in 28 day cycles: 2 weeks of therapy, followed by 2 weeks of heparinized saline.</description>
