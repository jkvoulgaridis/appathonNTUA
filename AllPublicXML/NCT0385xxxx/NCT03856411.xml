  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is one randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center, phase III clinical
      study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Toripalimab injection (JS001) or placebo
      combined with standard 1st-line chemotherapy in treatment-naïve advanced non-small cell lung
      cancer (NSCLC); and evaluate the population with the best predictive biomarkers, i.e.,
      positive diagnosis population.

      About 450 subjects with advanced non-small cell lung cancer without activated EGFR mutation
      (exon 19 deletion, or exon 21 L858R, exon 21 L861Q, exon 18 G719X or exon 20 S768I mutations)
      and ALK fusion will be 2:1 randomized into two groups, JS001 combined with the standard
      1st-line chemotherapy will be given in the study group whereas placebo combined with standard
      1st-line chemotherapy will be given in the control group. The stratification will be based on
      the following factors:

      PD-L1 expression (TC≥1% vs TC＜1%); Smoking state (often smoking vs no smoking or infrequent
      smoking); Pathological type (squamous cell carcinoma vs non-squamous cell carcinoma).
