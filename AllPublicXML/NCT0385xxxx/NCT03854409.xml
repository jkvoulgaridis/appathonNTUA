    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this trial is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of aripiprazole
      long-acting injectable (LAI) (420 mg) following deltoid or gluteal muscle administration in
      adult subjects with schizophrenia or bipolar I disorder.

A numerical score will correspond to one of ten categories relating to suicidal ideation and suicidal behavior. A higher score indicates a higher risk of suicidal behavior, but an answer of 'yes' to any question indicates some risk.</description>

The first 3 items will be rated on a 4-point scale, with a score of 0 representing absence of symptoms and a score of 3 representing a severe condition. The global clinical evaluation will be made on a 6-point scale, with 0 representing absence of symptoms and 5 representing severe akathisia.</description>

    <description>The PANSS will be administered using the Structured Clinical Interview-PANSS. The PANSS consists of 3 subscales containing a total of 30 symptom constructs.13 For each symptom construct, severity is rated on a 7-point scale, with a score of 1 indicating the absence of symptoms and a score of 7 indicating extremely severe symptoms. This analysis will include participants with schizophrenia only.</description>

    <description>The subject's feeling of their own well-being will be assessed using the 20 question SWN-S. The questionnaire consists of 20 items and 5 subscales (mental functioning, social integration, emotional regulation, physical functioning, self-control) whose items follow in random order. For items marked with a '+', response choices and scoring are as follows: not at all = 1, hardly at all = 2, a little = 3, somewhat = 4, much = 5, very much = 6. For items marked with a '-', the scoring is reversed; response choices and scoring are as follows: not at all = 6, hardly at all = 5, a little = 4, somewhat = 3, much = 2, very much = 1.</description>
