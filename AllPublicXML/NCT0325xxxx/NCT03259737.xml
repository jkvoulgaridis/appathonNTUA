  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The intention is to study presumed changes in daily practice, probably due to New Guidelines
      concerning stroke patients. The impression is more frequent measurements of blood pressure,
      serum glucose, troponin and supplementary computer tomography or magnetic resonance imaging.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is in general a focus on misuse of health resources. An increasing amount of guidelines
      is produced to reduce the variation in treatment of patients with the same diagnosis. Many
      recommendations are weak but seems though to have considerable impact on in hospital care.
      The issues to be studied are all grounded on weak clinical evidence. A pilot study confirmed
      the suspicion of very frequent measurements of blood pressure, glucose, troponin and frequent
      supplementary CT and MRI. The intention is to study these issues in a larger population
      including an evaluation of utility of the different examinations and evaluations.
