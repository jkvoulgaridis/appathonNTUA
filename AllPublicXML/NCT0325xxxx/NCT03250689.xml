  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The inflammation associated with COPD is characterized by a prominent infiltration of
      neutrophils in lung tissue and airways. The CXC chemokine receptor type 2 (CXCR2) plays a
      pivotal role in neutrophil recruitment to the lungs resulting in progressive fibrosis, airway
      stenosis, and destruction of the lung parenchyma characteristic of COPD. There is a paucity
      of novel therapies that target these symptoms, and there are no currently available therapies
      that modify disease progression in COPD. Danirixin (GSK1325756) is a selective CXCR2
      antagonist being developed as a potential anti-inflammatory agent for the treatment of COPD
      and influenza. This study is a mechanistic study which aims to evaluate the effect of
      danirixin in reducing neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) formation (or NETosis). Subjects
      will be randomized (3:1) to receive danirixin hydrobromide (HBr) 35 milligram (mg) orally
      twice daily or matching placebo for 14 days. Subjects may continue to use rescue
      medication(s) and inhaled COPD maintenance medication(s) during the study. The study will
      consist of a screening period of up to 30 days, a 2 week treatment period, and a 1-week
      follow-up visit via phone call. Approximately 50 subjects will be screened to obtain
      approximately 24 subjects to complete the study.

    <measure>Percentage Change From Baseline in Sputum Neutrophil Extracellular Traps (NETs) Quantified by Histone-Elastase Complexes</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1), Day 7 and Day 14</time_frame>
    <description>Sputum samples were collected at indicated time points to assess NET formation via histone elastase complexes. Baseline was considered as Day 1. If Day 1 values were missing, screening value was imputed for Baseline. Change from Baseline was calculated as post-Baseline value minus Baseline value. Percentage change from Baseline was calculated by dividing change from Baseline value by Baseline value and multiplied by 100. Analysis was performed using a mixed effect repeated measures model with covariates of treatment group, log(Baseline NETs) and treatment group by day interaction. The response variable was the log of the ratio of post-Baseline NETs to Baseline NETs. Primary completer population consisted of all participants in the Modified Intent-To-Treat population who had completed the assessments supporting the primary endpoint (sputum NETs).</description>

          -  Current use of phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitors: Roflumilast, Crisaborole and
             Apremilast.

          -  Current use of Raloxifene.

          -  Current use of low molecular weight heparin.

          -  The subject has participated in a clinical trial and has received an investigational
             product within the following time period prior to the first dosing day in the current
             study: 30 days, 5 half lives, or twice the duration of the biological effect of the
             investigational product (whichever is longer).

          -  Exposure to more than four investigational products within 12 months prior to the
             first dosing day.

          -  Subjects with a peripheral blood neutrophil count &lt; 1.0x10^9/liter (L) at screening.

          -  Diagnosis of pneumonia (chest X-ray or computed tomography [CT] confirmed) within the
             3 months prior to screening.

          -  Chest X-ray (posterior with lateral) or CT scan reveals evidence of a clinically
             significant abnormality not believed to be due to the presence of COPD (historic data
             up to 1 year may be used).

          -  Abnormal and clinically significant 12-lead ECG finding at screening. The investigator
             will determine the clinical significance of each abnormal ECG finding in relation to
             the subject's medical history and exclude subjects who would be at undue risk by
             participating in the trial. An abnormal and clinically significant finding that would
             preclude a subject from entering the trial is defined as a 12-lead tracing that is
             interpreted as, but not limited to, any of the following:

          -  AF with rapid ventricular rate &gt; 120 beats per minute (bpm);

          -  Sustained or non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT);

          -  Second degree heart block Mobitz type II and third degree heart block (unless
             pacemaker or defibrillator has been implanted);

          -  QT interval corrected for heart rate by Fridericia's formula (QTcF) &gt;=500 millisecond
             (msec) in subjects with QRS &lt;120 msec and QTcF &gt;=530 msec in subjects with QRS &gt;=120
             msec.

          -  Affiliation with a study site: study investigators, sub-investigators, study
             coordinators, employees of a study investigator, sub-investigator or study site, or
             immediate family members of any of the above that is involved with the study.

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>The study was conducted at single center in United Kingdom. This study was terminated early due to a change in the benefit risk profile of danirixin observed in another study NCT03034967, leading to cessation of the overall danirixin development program.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>A total of 43 participants were screened, of which 23 were screen failures (23 participants did not meet inclusion/exclusion criteria). From the 20 participants who passed screening, 1 was not randomized due to study being terminated early. Hence, 19 participants were enrolled and received treatment in this study.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Percentage Change From Baseline in Sputum Neutrophil Extracellular Traps (NETs) Quantified by Histone-Elastase Complexes</title>
        <description>Sputum samples were collected at indicated time points to assess NET formation via histone elastase complexes. Baseline was considered as Day 1. If Day 1 values were missing, screening value was imputed for Baseline. Change from Baseline was calculated as post-Baseline value minus Baseline value. Percentage change from Baseline was calculated by dividing change from Baseline value by Baseline value and multiplied by 100. Analysis was performed using a mixed effect repeated measures model with covariates of treatment group, log(Baseline NETs) and treatment group by day interaction. The response variable was the log of the ratio of post-Baseline NETs to Baseline NETs. Primary completer population consisted of all participants in the Modified Intent-To-Treat population who had completed the assessments supporting the primary endpoint (sputum NETs).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Urinalysis Parameter: Specific Gravity</title>
        <description>Urinary specific gravity measurement is a part of routine urinalysis. Urine specific gravity is a measure of the concentration of solutes in the urine. It measures the ratio of urine density compared with water density and provides information on the kidney's ability to concentrate urine. The concentration of the excreted molecules determines the urine's specific gravity. Urine samples were collected from participants at indicated time points for analysis of specific gravity. Baseline was considered as Day 1. Change from Baseline was calculated as post-Baseline value minus Baseline value.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Peripheral Blood Neutrophil NETs Formation Quantified by DNA Release</title>
        <description>Blood samples were collected at indicated time points to analyze peripheral blood neutrophil NETs formation by DNA release. DNA-elastase complexes quantified NETs formation. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) was used to induce inflammation and NETs formation in the PMA stimulated samples. Blood from participants were tested at Baseline and Day 14 for non-PMA stimulated samples, and at Baseline and Day 14 in PMA-stimulated samples to test whether treatment had any effect on NETs formation either naturally (non PMA induced) or where NETs formation was already raised (PMA stimulated). Hence participants were counted in both the categories - PMA stimulated and not PMA stimulated. NETs formation in peripheral blood was measured with SYTOX green fluorescence quantification of extracellular DNA. Baseline was considered as Day 1. Change from Baseline was calculated as post-Baseline value minus Baseline value.</description>
