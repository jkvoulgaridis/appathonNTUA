  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a progressive demyelinating disorder that damages white matter in
      the central nervous system. Although individuals experience mobility (e.g., walking, balance)
      impairments that lower quality of life and limit participation in daily activities, one of
      the most prominent symptoms is fatigue. Up to 92% of individuals report fatigue that
      manifests as lack of energy, exhaustion or worsening of MS symptoms and ultimately
      contributes to increasing disability. The currently available pharmaceutical treatments fail
      to fully control fatigue in the majority of individuals with MS; non-pharmacologic therapies
      such as exercise and behavioral therapies offer the best hope for combating MS fatigue in the
      majority of individuals.

      Exercise therapy is effective in reducing MS fatigue. However, access to exercise therapy is
      seriously limited for many individuals with MS due to geographical location, limited
      resources (e.g., financial, transportation), and/or disability. Thus, the development and
      evaluation of an alternative delivery method for exercise therapy to target MS-related
      fatigue that increases participation and reduces barriers is critical.

      In this study, the investigators will compare traditional in-person delivered exercise
      therapy to telephone-delivered exercise therapy to target fatigue in persons with MS.

    <description>A combination of aerobic and resistance training has been shown to be most effective for reducing fatigue in persons with MS.
Aerobic training will consist of: 30 minutes of either cycling, treadmill walking or overground walking, 2x/week. Participants will be given a wrist-worn pedometer with heart-rate monitor to track their heart rate during training. Participants will be progressed to reach 60-70% of their maximal heart rate during aerobic training over the course of the study.
Strength training will consist of hip extension, hip flexion, hip abduction, knee extension and knee flexion movements with resistance bands performed 3x/week.
This home exercise program will be paired with a 1x/week telephone call with an investigator.</description>

          <title>Fatigue Severity Scale</title>
          <description>The Fatigue Severity Scale is a 9-item questionnaire in which participants rate their fatigue from 1-7 for each question. A higher score (max total = 63) indicates worse fatigue.
The total score is reported. The range of possible scores is 9-63.</description>

          <description>The PDDS requires a single response on a 0-8 scale that indicates the person's perceived level of disability from 0 (normal - I have some mild symptoms, mostly sensory due to MS but they do not limit my activity) to 8 (bedridden- unable to sit in a wheelchair for more than one hour).
The total score is reported, with higher numbers indicating worse disability.</description>

          <title>In-Person Delivered Exercise</title>
          <description>Participants in the in-person training group will:
participate in a home exercise program including aerobic training 2x/week and strength training 3x/week.
complete one of their prescribed training sessions (lasting 1 hour total) each week with a physical therapist or trained member of the research team. Training sessions will focus on progression of aerobic and strength training exercises.
In-Person Delivered Exercise Therapy: A combination of aerobic and resistance training has been shown to be most effective for reducing fatigue in persons with MS.
Aerobic training will consist of: 30 minutes of either cycling, treadmill walking or overground walking, 2x/week. Participants will be progressed to reach 60-70% of their maximal heart rate during aerobic training over the course of the study.
Strength training will consist of hip extension, hip flexion, hip abduction, knee extension and knee flexion movements with resistance bands performed 3x/week.</description>

          <description>Participants in the telephone-delivered training group will:
participate in a home exercise program including aerobic training 2x/week and strength training 3x/week.
receive a 60-minute, 1x/week telephone call from a trained research team member. Participants will report progress from the prior week, troubleshoot any issues, and receive progressions of both aerobic and strength exercises for the upcoming week.
