  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cellavita HD is a stem-cell therapy for Huntington's Disease. This is a prospective, phase
      II, single-center, randomized (2:2:1), triple-blind, placebo controlled study, with two test
      doses of Cellavita HD product.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II dose-response study in which participants with HD will receive three
      intravenous injections of the investigational product or placebo (one every month for three
      months) a total of three cycles. The subjects will be randomized in 2: 2: 1 ratio for the
      groups G1: lower dose (1x10^6 cells/weight range), G2: higher dose (2x10^6 cells/weight
      range) or G3: placebo. To identify the dose of the product that will provide the best
      clinical response, motor assessment will be performed with UHDRS scale and improvement will
      be evaluated by correlating before and after treatment scores. Additionally, also will be
      performed the combined score through the cUHDRS. Secondary evidences of efficacy will be
      evaluated through the data of functional state, total functional capacity, functional
      independence, psychiatric symptoms and cognition from UHDRS scale. Additionally, related data
      to clinical worsening, change of Body Mass Index (BMI), risk of suicide attempt and
      neurological image improvement will be evaluated. Safety evaluation will included the
      incidence and classification of the adverse events experienced by the subjects during the
      study.
