      Healthcare - Associated Infection Surveillance In Neonatal Intensive Care Unit of Assiut
      University Children's Hospital.The objective of study is to determine the incidence,
      infection sites, causative organisms and risk factors related to healthcare-associated
      infections in NICU in Assiut University Children hospital.

      Nosocomial infections (NIs) are a major public health problem worldwide . Nosocomial
      infections are those acquired in or associated with hospitals. They are also known as
      hospital-acquired or healthcare-associated infections. The usual deﬁnition of a
      hospital-acquired infection is one that was not present or incubating when the patient was
      admitted to a hospital or healthcare facility; where there is doubt, a cut-off period of 48
      hours after admission is used.The terms hospital-acquired and healthcare-associated are often
      used interchangeably, but 'healthcare-associated' also has the wider meaning of any infection
      acquired as a result of healthcare in any setting.

      Nosocomial infections are common, and may be serious or fatal. Some are unavoidable but
      doctors' duty of care to their patients extends to fundamental matters such as basic hygiene,
      which may prevent patients becoming infected, and avoidance of unnecessary antibiotics, to
      discourage development of resistance Health care-associated infections (HC-AIs) are a major
      cause of morbidity and mortality in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) and lead to
      increases in hospital length of stay and treatment cost. Higher nosocomial infection
      incidence in NICUs was related to longer duration of hospital stay, and invasive
      interventions and medical treatments. HC-AIs, especially device-associated health
      care-associated infections (DA-HAIs), were also common in newborns because of their
      insufﬁcient immune system and mechanical barriers, as well as lack of protective ﬂora
