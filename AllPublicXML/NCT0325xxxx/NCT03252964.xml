    <textblock>
      This study allows Type 2 diabetics to receive feedback from a continuous glucose monitor
      (CGM) as part of an educational program designed to help them better manage their glucose
      levels. Subjects will also wear an activity tracker to monitor their activity and observe its
      effect on their glucose levels. The educational program will involve calls from coaches to
      check subjects' progress and answer questions.

Participants were instructed to call the study doctor’s clinical research coordinator (CRC) to report all AE and SAE related to the study devices.
Study coaches listened for any reports of AE or SAE in their communications with participants and connected reporting patients with the CRC.
Reports of AE or SAE received by Dexcom’s Customer Care and Technical Support representatives were documented and reported to the Sponsor and CRC.</desc>
