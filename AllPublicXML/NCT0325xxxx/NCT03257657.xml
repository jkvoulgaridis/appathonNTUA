  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Low-income and minority women are at increased risk for postpartum weight retention (i.e.
      retaining weight after pregnancy) and consequent persistent obesity. Women who are obese
      pre-pregnancy are 3-5 times more likely to gain weight, rather than lose weight, in the
      postpartum period than non-obese women. Aims for this pilot study are listed below:

      Aim 1: To evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of a multi-component novel weight loss
      intervention delivered in a WIC setting to a population of low-income, predominantly
      racial/ethnic minority, obese, postpartum women.

      Aim 2: To evaluate differences in weight change, diet, physical activity, self-efficacy,
      readiness to change, motivations to eat between intervention and control participants to
      determine preliminary intervention efficacy over a 12-week period.

      Low-income and minority women are at increased risk for postpartum weight retention (i.e.
      retaining weight after pregnancy) and consequent persistent obesity. Women who are obese
      pre-pregnancy are 3-5 times more likely to gain weight, rather than lose weight, in the
      postpartum period than non-obese women.

      Obesity science supports that weight loss interventions should be multi-component with
      regular points of contact. Building upon this, we have designed a multi-component
      intervention that considers the demands on women in the postpartum period and utilizes
      technology for both provider decision support and for virtual contact with participants. The
      intervention will address diet, physical activity, and social support through the use of
      in-person meetings with WIC staff, text messaging, phone coaching, self-monitoring, and
      Facebook.
