  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Observational studies among patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) have shown an association
      with fluid accumulation and increased mortality. Trials among other subgroups of critically
      ill patients have demonstrated that restricting fluid input after the initial resuscitation
      appears safe.

      The objective if this study is to determine whether a fluid restrictive treatment regimen
      will lead to a lower cumulative fluid balance at 72 hours from randomization in critically
      ill patients with AKI and whether this approach is safe and feasible.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acute kidney injury (AKI) is common in the critically ill and associates with adverse
      outcomes. Patients with AKI are frequently have low urine output and are at high risk of
      developing fluid overload. Fluid overload has been associated with an increased risk for
      mortality in such patients. Previous trials in critically ill patients found that a
      'restrictive fluid therapy' after resuscitation was safe. Implementing a restrictive fluid
      therapy approach in patients with AKI may also be of benefit. To date, however, no randomized
      trial has been performed to evaluate the safety and feasibility of implementing a
      'restrictive fluid therapy' approach compared to standard fluid therapy in patients with AKI.

      In this pilot randomized controlled trial we will evaluate the implementation of a fluid
      restrictive approach, compared to standard therapy, in adult critically ill patients with
      acute kidney injury.
