      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability and clinical activity of
      RO6870810 in combination with venetoclax and when co-administered with rituximab in
      participants with relapse/refractory (R/R) diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and/or
      high-grade B-cell lymphoma with myelocytomatosis oncogene (MYC) and/or B-cell lymphoma 2
      (BCL2) and/or B-cell lymphoma 6 (BCL6) gene rearrangements (HGBL-DH/TH).
