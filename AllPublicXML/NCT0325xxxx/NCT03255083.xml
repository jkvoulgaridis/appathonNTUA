  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study has two parts: dose escalation and dose expansion.

      The primary objectives are:

        -  For Dose Escalation, to assess the safety and tolerability of DS-1205c when combined
           with osimertinib in the study population and to determine the recommended dose for
           expansion of DS-1205c when combined with osimertinib in the study population

        -  For Dose Expansion, to assess the safety and tolerability of DS-1205c when combined with
           osimertinib in the study population

      In Dose Escalation, after a 7-day run in period (Cycle 0), there will be 21-day cycles (Cycle
      1 onward). In Dose Expansion, there will be 21-day cycles.

      The number of treatment cycles is not fixed in this study. Participants will continue study
      treatment until they decide not to (withdraw consent), their disease gets worse [progressive
      disease (PD)], or side effects become unacceptable (unacceptable toxicity).
