  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      CCTA is a common way to evaluate coronary artery disease. It stands for coronary computed
      tomography angiography. It uses scanning to look at the arteries that supply blood to the
      heart. It is noninvasive, widely available, and generally accurate. But it does expose people
      to radiation. Exposure to high amounts of radiation can increase a person s risk of getting
      cancer. Researchers want to learn more about the relationship between CCTA and radiation
      exposure.

      Objective:

      To see how much radiation is used to take pictures of the heart and how measures to reduce
      radiation are used around the world.

      Eligibility:

      People ages 18 years and older who need a computed tomography (CT) scan of the heart

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with a review of their medical records.

      Participants may have a pregnancy test.

      Participants will have the scheduled scan. Small, sticky discs will be placed on the chest. A
      small tube will be placed into a vein in the arm. A contrast material (dye) will be given
      through it. Participants will lie on the CT scanning table.

      A CCTA scan usually takes about 15 minutes if the heart rate is slow and steady.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cardiac CT angiography is a commonly used test to take detailed pictures of the heart to
      diagnose heart disease; however, it is associated with radiation exposure. Several
      technological advances in both scanner hardware and software are now available to reduce the
      radiation exposure to patients. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the worldwide usage
      of these radiation dose saving strategies in daily practice and analyze their effect on image
      quality.

    <description>We will assess the variation of radiation dose with respect to vendors, CT systems and study sites. Furthermore, we will evaluate the usage of dose saving strategies including the abovementionedin daily practice and analyze their effect on diagnostic image quality. On the basis of the collected data, we will evaluate the potential use of additional dose savings for each individual site.</description>

        Data confirming the inclusion/exclusion criteria will be confirmed at the study visit.
        Overall, up to 100 subjects will be enrolled locally at the NIH. A member of the study team
        will review the CT procedures and confirm that the participants do not have any serious
        health problems or concomitant conditions or medications that would prevent them from
        having the CT. A member of the study team will perform a pregnancy test (if applicable) in
        female participants of childbearing potential. If @@@you are nursing, you will be excluded
        from this study. All tests will follow NIH Clinical Center policies and clinical consent
        forms for individual tests may be obtained in addition to the study protocol consent as
        applicable. Sites outside the NIH will use similar standard of care procedures for cardiac
        CT eligibility.
