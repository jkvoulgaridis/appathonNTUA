  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this project is to improve patient experience of cystoscopy using a
      non-pharmacologic modification of procedure. Cystoscopy is a common outpatient procedure for
      urology patients and is usually performed without sedation. However, there is limited
      research into reduction of patient discomfort throughout this procedure. The proposed
      modification technique was selected based on a well-documented psychological phenomenon in
      which only particular moments over the course of an aversive event determine the resultant
      perception of the experience. It is hypothesized that implementation of the technique will
      decrease the recalled pain intensity of the cystoscopy.
