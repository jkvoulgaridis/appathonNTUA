  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational study in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF)
      presenting to the hospital with a first acute ischemic stroke based on existing data recorded
      in the SITS International Registry (located in Sweden) by physicians in several European
      countries, such as Italy, United Kingdom, Czech Republic, Sweden, Germany, Poland, Spain,
      Finland, Portugal, Slovakia, Denmark, Estonia, Norway Belgium, Hungary, Slovenia, Croatia,
      Austria, Lithuania, France, Greece, Netherlands, Ireland, Ukraine and Iceland.

      The aim of this study is to explore the current real world use of dabigatran for stroke
      prevention in NVAF patients in the post-stroke setting. Secondary data from eligible European
      patients registered in the SITS registry will be considered; countries of origin are not
      known a priori.

    <description>The National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score on patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation and dabigatran initiation timing information. The NIHSS is a scale of stroke severity with 15 items and a score range from 0 to 42. 0 = no stroke; 1-4 = minor stroke; 5-15 = moderate stroke; 15-20 = moderate/severe stroke; 21-42 = severe stroke. Results were reported according to their dabigatran initiation timing categories.</description>

    <time_frame>At first ever ischaemic stroke (index event) date, up to 1 day.</time_frame>
    <description>Previous Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) collected at first ever ischaemic stroke (index event). The Modified Rankin scale (mRS) is Scored as follows: 0 = No symptoms, 1 = No significant disability. Able to carry out all usual activities, despite some symptoms, 2 = Slight disability. Able to look after own affairs without assistance, but unable to carry out all previous activities, 3 = Moderate disability. Requires some help, but able to walk unassisted, 4 = Moderately severe disability. Unable to attend to own bodily needs without assistance, and unable to walk unassisted, 5 = Severe disability. Requires constant nursing care and attention, bedridden, incontinent, 6 = Death. Higher scores indicate worse outcome. Results were reported according to their dabigatran initiation timing categories.</description>

    <measure>Age of Patients According to Dabigatran Initiation Time Period</measure>
    <time_frame>At first ever ischaemic stroke (index event), up to 1 day.</time_frame>
    <description>Age of patients according to their start dabigatran time period. Results were reported according to their dabigatran initiation timing categories. CHA2DS2-VASc and HAS-BLED were used in the statistical analysis. CHA2DS2-VASc is the Congestive heart failure, Hypertension, Age (&gt; 75), Diabetes mellitus, Stroke/transient ischemic attack(TIA), Vascular disease, Age 65-74, Sex Category score. HAS-BLED is the Hypertension, Abnormal renal and liver function, Stroke (1 point), Bleeding history or predisposition, Labile international normalised ratio (INR), Elderly (&gt;65 years), Drugs and Alcohol Score.</description>

    <description>The Congestive heart failure, Hypertension, Age (&gt; 75), Diabetes mellitus, Stroke/TIA, Vascular disease, Age 65-74, Sex Category (CHA2DS2-VASc) score of patients according to their start dabigatran time period. CHA2DS2-VASc is used to determine the need for an anticoagulation therapy, relating the high scores to a great risk of stroke and a low score corresponds to a lower risk of stroke. CHA2DS2-VASc stroke risk score ranges from 0 to 9 with 0 being the best outcome. Results were reported according to their dabigatran initiation timing categories.</description>
