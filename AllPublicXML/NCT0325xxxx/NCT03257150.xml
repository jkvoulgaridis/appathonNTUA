  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This I/II study will evaluate to see how safe and useful irreversible electroporation (also
      called NanoKnife) is in patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this phase I/II trial, patients with locally advanced pancreatic ductal carcinoma will be
      assigned to receive interventional treatment of irreversible electroporation (IRE).

      IRE will be performed by laparotomy under general anesthesia in the operating room.

      All patients enrolled in the study will have a biopsy at the time of laparotomy. Blood will
      be collected for regular blood tests and correlative studies at baseline and during the
      study. Computed tomography (CT) scans will be done at baseline, 4 weeks post treatment, 12
      weeks, 24 weeks, and 36 weeks follow up. Quality of Life (QOL) questionnaires will be
      completed at baseline and during the study. Patients will be given optional consent for
      storage of any leftover tissue and blood samples for future analysis. Patients will be
      followed up 4 weeks post treatment, then every 12 weeks until death.

    <description>Irreversible electroporation (IRE) is a process that uses the NanoKnife system to sent electrical currents to a cancer tumor which will disrupt the tumor cell and therefore causing the cell to die. Eligible patients will undergo in situ IRE performed via laparotomy surgery.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically proven pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC)

          -  Locally advanced unresectable primary tumor

          -  Tumors ≤5 cm in largest dimension at the time of enrollment that is technically
             amenable to treatment with irreversible electroporation (IRE)

          -  At least 4 months of combination chemotherapy

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of ≤ 2

          -  Acceptable organ and bone marrow function

          -  Life expectancy estimated ≥6 months

          -  Ability and willingness to sign informed consent form

          -  Have a measurable primary tumor at the time of study enrollment

          -  Suitable and fit to undergo general anesthetic and laparotomy

          -  Women of child-producing potential must agree to use effective contraceptive methods
             prior to study entry, during study participation, and for at least 30 days after the

          -  Previous local treatments for locally advanced PDAC including IRE or radiotherapy

             with clinical study procedures (e.g.: infection/inflammation, intestinal obstruction,
             unable to swallow medication, social/ psychological issues, etc.)

          -  History of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection

          -  Progression of the primary lesion as judged by the Investigator
