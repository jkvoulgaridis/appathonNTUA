             used and the test result must be in the participant's source documentation if
             performed locally. Acceptable IGRA products include QuantiFERON TB Gold Plus In-Tube
             Test.

          2. If the results of the IGRA are indeterminate, the test may be repeated, and if a
             negative result is obtained, enrollment may proceed. In participants with no history
             of treated active or latent TB, a positive test on repeat will exclude the
             participant. Participants with a history of active or latent TB infection must follow
             instructions for &quot;Participants with a prior diagnosis of active or latent TB are
             excluded unless both of the following criteria are met&quot; in this criterion.

          3. Participants with repeat indeterminate IGRA results, with no prior TB history, may be
             enrolled after consultation with a pulmonary or infectious disease specialist who
             determines low risk of infection (ie, participant would be acceptable for
             immunosuppressant [eg, anti-TNF] treatment without additional action). This
             consultation must be included in source documentation.

        Results from a chest x-ray, taken within the 12 weeks before or during screening must show
        no abnormalities suggestive of active TB infection as determined by a qualified medical
        specialist.

        Participants with a prior diagnosis of active or latent TB are excluded unless both of the
        following criteria are met:

          1. The participant has previously received an adequate course of treatment for either
             latent (eg, 9 months of isoniazid or an acceptable alternative regimen, in a locale
             where rates of primary multidrug TB resistance are &lt;5%. Participants from regions with
             higher rates of primary multidrug TB resistance are excluded) or active (acceptable
             multidrug regimen) TB infection. Evidence of diagnosis and treatment must be included
             in source documentation. Consultation with a pulmonary or infectious disease
             specialist to confirm adequate treatment (ie, participant would be acceptable for
             immunosuppressant [eg, anti-TNF] treatment without additional action) must be
             performed during the screening period. The consultation report must be included in
             source documentation prior to enrollment.

          2. A chest x-ray performed within 12 weeks before screening or during screening indicates
             no evidence of active or recurrent disease, and documentation of interpretation by a
             qualified medical specialist must be included in source documentation.

               -  Participants with a pre-existing demyelinating disorder such as multiple
                  sclerosis or new onset seizures, unexplained sensory motor, or cognitive
                  behavioral, neurological deficits, or significant abnormalities noted during
                  screening.

               -  Participants with any unexplained symptoms suggestive of progressive multifocal
                  leukoencephalopathy (PML) based on the targeted neurological assessment during
                  the screening period.

               -  Participants with a transplanted organ. Skin grafts to treat pyoderma gangrenosum
                  are allowed.

               -  Participants with a significant concurrent medical condition at the time of
                  screening or baseline, including, but not limited to, the following:

          1. Any major illness/condition or evidence of an unstable clinical condition (eg, renal,
             hepatic, hematologic, gastrointestinal (except disease under study), endocrine,
             cardiovascular, pulmonary, immunologic [eg, Felty's syndrome], or local active
             infection/infectious illness) that, in the investigator's judgment will substantially
             increase the risk to the participant if he or she participates in the study.

          2. Cancer or history of cancer or lymphoproliferative disease within the previous 5 years
             (other than resected cutaneous basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, or
             carcinoma in situ of the uterine cervix that has been treated with no evidence of
             recurrence).

          3. Presence of acute coronary syndrome (eg, acute myocardial infarction, unstable angina
             pectoris) within 24 weeks before screening.

          4. History of significant cerebrovascular disease within 24 weeks before screening.

             - Participants who have had significant trauma or major surgery within 4 weeks before
             the screening visit, or with any major elective surgery scheduled to occur during the
             study.

             - Participants with evidence of cirrhosis with or without decompensation.

             - Participants with primary sclerosing cholangitis.

             - Participants with evidence of positive hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) or
             hepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb).

             Note: If a participant tests negative for HBsAg, but positive for HBcAb, the
             participant would be considered eligible if no presence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA
             is confirmed by HBV DNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) reflex testing performed in
             the central laboratory.

               -  Participants with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) (positive HCV antibody [HCVAb]
                  and HCVRNA).

             Note: Participants who are HCVAb positive without evidence of HCV RNA may be
             considered eligible (spontaneous viral clearance or previously treated and cured
             [defined as no evidence of HCVRNA at least 12 weeks prior to baseline]).

               -  Participants with any of the following abnormalities in hematology and/or serum
                  chemistry profiles during screening.

             Note: Screening laboratory tests, if the results are considered by the investigator to
             be transient and inconsistent with the participant's clinical condition, may be
             repeated once during the screening period for confirmation. Results must be reviewed
             for eligibility prior to the screening endoscopy procedure.

          1. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels &gt;=3.0×upper
             limit of normal (ULN).

          2. Total bilirubin level &gt;=1.5×ULN or &gt;2.0×ULN if the participant has a known documented
             history of Gilbert's syndrome.

          3. Hemoglobin level &lt;=80 gram per liter (g/L) (8.0 gram per deciliter [g/dL]).

          4. Platelet count &lt;=100×10^9 per liter (/L) (100,000 cells per cubic millimeter [mm^3])
             or &gt;=1000×10^9/L (1,000,000 cells/mm^3).

          5. White blood cell count &lt;=3.5×10^9/L (3500 cells/mm^3).

             - Absolute neutrophil count (ANC)&lt;2×10^9/L (2000 cells/mm^3).

             - Serum creatinine level &gt;1.5 × ULN or estimated glomerular filtration rate &lt;30
             ml/min/1.73m^2 based on the abbreviated Modification of Diet in Renal Disease Study
             Equation.

             Note: If platelet count is &lt;150,000 cells/mm^3, a further evaluation should be
             performed to rule out cirrhosis, unless another etiology has already been identified.

               -  Participants with known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection based on
                  documented history, with positive serological test, or positive HIV serologic
                  test at screening, tested at the site's local laboratory in accordance with
                  country requirements or tested at the central laboratory.

             Note: A documented negative HIV test within 6 months of screening is acceptable and
             does not need to be repeated.

             - Participants who have, or who have a history of (within 2 years before screening),
             serious psychiatric disease, alcohol dependency, or substance/drug abuse or dependency
             of any kind, including abuse of medical marijuana (cannabis).

             - Participants with any other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition
             or laboratory or electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormality that may increase the risk
             associated with study participation or investigational product administration or may
             interfere with the interpretation of study results and, in the judgment of the
             investigator, would make the participant inappropriate for entry into this study.

             - Female participants who are planning to become pregnant during the study period.

               -  Participants who do not agree to postpone donation of any organ or tissue,
                  including male participants who are planning to bank or donate sperm and female
                  participants who are planning to harvest or donate eggs, for the duration of the
                  study and through 16 weeks after last dose of investigational product.

               -  Participants who are investigational site staff members or relatives of those
                  site staff members or Participants who are Shire employees directly involved in
                  the conduct of the study.
