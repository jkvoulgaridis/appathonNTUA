      Study objective: The primary objective of the clinical investigation is to evaluate the
      accuracy of BioStamp nPoint system algorithm measurements.

      Study design: A single-site, non-significant risk, open-label, prospective non-randomized
      clinical investigation designed to validate the accuracy of the various physiological
      parameters that the Wearable Sensor Patches acquire and the system processes.

The device's Posture Classification will be compared to the observer's annotation. The percentage of correct classifications by the device against indicated visual observation is presented. The percent correct is not a per subject average, but is the percentage of all posture classifications which were correct when compared to ground truth observation.</description>

    <measure>Number of Sensors That Remained Sufficiently Adhered to Subjects for 24 Hours as Assessed by a 5 Point Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>2 days after informed consent</time_frame>
    <description>The level of sensor adhesion will be assessed by a 5 point scale (0- sensor is greater than or equal to 90% of sensor adhered, 4-sensor completely detached from subject). Sensors receiving scores of 0 and 1 will be determined to have acceptable adhesion, while scores of 2, 3, and 4 will be considered unacceptable adhesion. The percentage of sensors which had acceptable adhesion at sensor removal is presented.</description>
