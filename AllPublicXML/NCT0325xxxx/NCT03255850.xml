      This study aims to examine the psychological well-being and QoL of Hong Kong Chinese
      adolescents with CHD by

        -  comparing the self-esteem level, depressive symptoms, and quality of life of adolescents
           suffering from CHD with healthy norms and cancer survivors.

        -  identifying possible factors affecting the quality of life of adolescents suffering from
           CHD.

      Congenital heart disease (CHD) is the most common type of congenital malformation in the
      world with birth prevalence as 8 per 1000 live births. Survival rate has been drastically
      improved as a result of improvement in surgical treatments and intensive care but adolescents
      with CHD still suffer from limitations on their psychological functioning and restrained
      quality of life. Number of evidences have indicated that adolescents with CHD experience more
      depressive symptoms and lower self-esteem level than their healthy counterparts. In addition,
      adolescents with CHD are more prone to develop emotional and behavioral problems than their
      healthy norms. Given the above issues, It is imperative for nurses to develop psychological
      interventions to promote psychological well-being among adolescents with CHD, with the goal
      of improving their quality of life. There have been increasing concerns worldwide on the
      quality of life of such population especially on how does the disease pose threats on their
      daily living. However, at present, there is no study examining how does CHD affect the
      psychological well-being and quality of life in Hong Kong Chinese adolescents. It is explicit
      that Hong Kong has a distinctively different cultural context from that of the West. Hence,
      the effects of CHD and its treatments are likely to differ markedly in the two regions .To
      conclude, results of previous studies from the West may not fit into Hong Kong Chinese
      cultural context.

    <description>Quality of life is measured by Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory 4.0 Generic Core Scales (PedsQL) which aims at measuring patient's perceptions of the patient's HRQOL in various aspects namely the impact of disease and treatment on an individual's physical functioning(8 items ), emotional functioning(5 items), social functioning(5 items), and school functioning(5 items). The 5-point Likert scale is used for indicating the frequency of a problem has been during the past one month ,0=never a problem, 1=almost never a problem, 2=sometimes a problem, 3=often a problem and 4=almost always a problem. The PedsQL core scales can be completed within 10-15 minutes. Reversed scoring will be used to evaluate the items and linear transformed into 0-100 scale, thus higher PedsQL scores represents greater HRQOL.</description>
