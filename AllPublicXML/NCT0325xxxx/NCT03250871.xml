  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypnosis has already shown to decrease pain and anxiety in different surgical specialities.
      Nevertheless, its input has never been studied in cardiology. This research is a prospective,
      monocentric, controlled and randomized study.

      Patients over 18 years old and hospitalized for atrial flutter ablation may be included and
      randomized into one of the arms: placebo or hypnosis.

      Global pain will be assessed by a visual analogue pain scale. Anxiety, morphine consumption,
      and patient sedation will also be assessed.

      The aim of this study is to improve the care given to patient undergoing atrial flutter
      ablation.

    <description>Placebo will be the suggestion of self-relaxation methods (for example, &quot;try to relax&quot; ,&quot;try to think of pleasant moment &quot;) and the diffusion of &quot;white noise&quot; during surgery.</description>

    <description>Hypnosis will be associated with the usual anesthesia. Hypnosis is a temporary modification of consciousness technique based on suggestion.
It is divided into three phases:
induction: attention of the patient fixed on an object or a part of the body,
the dissociation where the patient cuts off auditory, visual and tactile perceptions,
and finally the opening towards a hypnotic experience thanks to the imaginary.</description>
