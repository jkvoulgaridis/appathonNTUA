    <textblock>
      The primary objectives of this pilot trial are to evaluate the feasibility, safety and
      acceptability of an integrative care pathway that includes chiropractic care, for the
      coordinated care for Veterans Administration (VA) patients with chronic low back pain (cLBP),
      with an emphasis on those with mental health comorbidity, in preparation for the conduct of
      an appropriately powered multi-site randomized controlled trial (RCT). The secondary
      objectives are to collect study outcomes at the baseline visit (BV) and at weeks 3, 5, 7, and
      10 to: 1) assess the success of collecting outcomes; 2) determine the outcome measures to use
      in a future RCT; and 3) determine preliminary intervention effect sizes and variability to
      aid in sample size determination for a future RCT. The investigators hypothesize that
      chiropractic care offers relief for pain and mental health symptoms through the direct
      effects of treatment-focused CMT, as well as through the indirect, non-specific effects of
      the team-based relationship with the clinician.

      This pilot study is a single-arm trial. All participants will be asked to complete study
      outcomes which include the Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ), LBP intensity and
      interference as measured by the Defense and Veterans Pain Rating Scale (DVPRS), as well as
      the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item Scale
      (GAD-7), Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT), Post-traumatic Stress Disorder
      Checklist-Civilian Version (PLC-C), self-care behaviors, Keele Start Back Screening Tool
      (STarT Back), Healing Encounters and Attitudes Lists (HEAL), Expectations for Complementary
      and Integrative Treatments Questionnaire (EXPECT), and Pain Intensity, Enjoyment of Life,
      General Activity Assessment Tool (PEG) questionnaires, and the Pain Assessment Screening Tool
      and Outcomes Registry (PASTOR) assessment, which includes measures of pain, disability,
      mental health, quality of life enjoyment and satisfaction. All participants will receive up
      to 10 weeks of chiropractic care and will complete outcome assessments at weeks 3, 5, 7, and
      10 of the study.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The coinciding problems of chronic pain and mental illness are of great concern for patients
      seeking care within the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) healthcare facilities. Of the 5.7
      million veterans treated in VA facilities in 2012, more than half reported chronic pain
      syndromes, including chronic low back pain (cLBP). Veterans also experience many mental
      health comorbidities, such as depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and
      substance abuse. Veterans in pain are often managed using prescription drugs, including
      opioids, psychotropic medications, and sleep agents. Non-pharmacological treatments for
      chronic pain, which also may provide relief of mental health symptoms, may be welcomed
      complementary therapies for veterans suffering from these conditions.

      Patients with musculoskeletal (MSK) pain and pain at multiple locations often report
      depression, anxiety and other mental health symptoms. Chronic pain may perpetuate mental
      health comorbidity as these conditions share common pathophysiological pathways. Research has
      shown that the non-specific effects of empathetic doctor communication and therapeutic
      alliance improves clinical outcomes. The investigators hypothesize that chiropractic care
      offers relief for pain and mental health symptoms through the direct effects of
      treatment-focused chiropractic manipulative therapy (CMT), as well as through the indirect,
      non-specific effects of the team-based relationship with the clinician.

      However, chiropractic care is not delivered in isolation from other treatments within the VA.
      Thus, the investigators will test a feasible, effective, patient-centered, guideline-based,
      integrative care model that integrates chiropractic into VA Patient Aligned Care Teams
      (PACTs). This integrative care pathway will involve primary care providers, mental health
      professionals, and doctors of chiropractic (DCs) engaged in the treatment of veterans with
      cLBP, with or without mental health comorbidity. While DCs are providing services within VA
      in increasing numbers over the past 13 years, as with any new service, adoption and
      appropriate placement faces challenges. Many VA providers may know little about the clinical
      approaches used by DCs. Similarly, DCs may not be fully aware of the processes involved in
      the delivery of primary care services within VA or the healthcare needs of veterans with
      mental illness. The purpose of this pilot clinical trial is to evaluate the feasibility,
      safety and patient perceptions of an integrative care pathway, developed through a
      consensus-based process, for the coordinated care for VA patients with cLBP and mental health
      comorbidity.

      As this is a pragmatic trial, chiropractic care will consist of usual chiropractic procedures
      for the management chronic low back pain (cLBP). Treatment approaches will be based on
      clinical evaluation, which may include diagnostic testing, to determine a working diagnosis,
      rule out pathology, and/or to screen for conditions requiring referral or other
      co-management. The investigators anticipate that chiropractic care often will include some
      form of chiropractic manipulative therapy (CMT). DCs will likely also recommend
      rehabilitative exercise, stretching, or nutritional and lifestyle advice based upon clinical
      findings and patient goals/preferences. The investigators will evaluate treatments through
      electronic health records (EHR) data abstraction following completion of chiropractic care at
      Week 10. As per typical VA care, DCs will monitor the participant's health status throughout
      the trial and initiate referrals as clinically indicated. Referrals to primary care and
      mental health providers will be consistent with the chiropractic integrated care pathway
      developed during a prior phase of the study. The investigators anticipate the most common
      communication and referral methods will occur through note-review and countersign procedures,
      which are already established among VA providers using the VA electronic health record, but
      may also occur in person or via phone conversations. Chiropractic care will be administered
      by licensed DCs who are current employees of the Iowa City VA Health Care System (ICVAHCS).

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain Assessment Screening Tool and Outcomes Registry (PASTOR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline visit and weeks 5 and 10</time_frame>
    <description>PASTOR is an on-line data collection tool based on the NIH Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) and adopted by the DoD/VA Pain Management Task Force. Specific measures include the Defense &amp; Veterans Pain Rating Scale (DVPRS), an enhanced 11-item (total range 0-10, 0=no pain, 10=worst pain) numeric rating scale (NRS) that improves on standard pain NRS by including a Faces Rating Scale component; 'traffic light' color-coding system to delineate mild, moderate and severe pain; and word descriptors, paired with 4, 0-10 NRS items to quantify the impact of pain on general activity, sleep, mood, and stress. PASTOR incorporates PROMIS measures for mental health conditions (PTSD, depression, anxiety, anger, and alcohol use), physical and social function, fatigue, and pain interference with daily activities to provide graphical representation of improvements or declines in patient status that are compared to matched US samples on age, race/ethnicity and sex.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>STarT Back Screening Tool</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline visit and week 10</time_frame>
    <description>This is a 9-item, validated tool developed by Keele University to be used as a screening tool for patients with low back pain. It stratifies patients based on their prognosis of persistent disabling symptoms and allows practitioners to group patients into 3 categories (low, medium, or high risk of poor outcome).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Self-Efficacy for Managing Symptoms (SF8a)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline visit and week 10</time_frame>
    <description>Developed by the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS), this 8-item, self-reported tool will assess a person's level of confidence to manage/control symptoms, to manage their symptoms in different settings and to keep symptoms from interfering with work, sleep, relationships or recreational activities. Each question usually has five response options ranging in value from 1 to 5. The total raw score for a measure is converted to into a T-score for each participant. The T-score rescales the raw score into a standardized score with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation (SD) of 10. Therefore a person with a T-score of 40 is one SD below the mean. A higher PROMIS T-score represents more of the concept being measured. For example, a T-score of 55 on the PROMIS Self-Efficacy for Managing Symptoms indicates that the respondent has greater self-efficacy for managing their symptoms than the general chronic condition population (half a standard deviation higher).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline visit and week 10</time_frame>
    <description>This instrument is self-reported with nine items and will be used to assess depressive disorder. Total scores range from 0 to 27 with a score of 10-14 considered to be in the moderate range (0-27, 0=No Depression, 27=Severe Depression). It has been tested in primary care settings and has a test-retest reliability of 0.81 to 0.96.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline visit and week 10</time_frame>
    <description>This instrument is self-reported with seven items and will be used to assess generalized anxiety disorder. At a cut off score of 10 (0-21, 0=No Anxiety Disorder, 21=Severe Anxiety Disorder), it has a sensitivity of 0.89 and specificity of 0.82 for identifying patients with GAD in primary care settings.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline visit and week 10</time_frame>
    <description>Developed by the World Health Organization (WHO), this 10-item screening questionnaire determines harmful or hazardous consumption of alcohol, correctly classifying 95% of people as having a clinical diagnosis of an alcohol abuse disorder (0-12, 0=No Alcohol Use).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>PTSD Checklist-Civilian (PCL-C)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline visit and week 10</time_frame>
    <description>This 17-item, self-reported instrument will assess PTSD. A total severity score is determined by summing scores from each of 17 items. A change of 5-10 points represents the minimum threshold for determining treatment response; a 10-20 point change represents a clinically significant change in PTSD symptom severity (17-85, 17=Not at all Severe PTSD Symptoms, 85=Extremely Severe PTSD Symptoms).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Healing Encounters and Attitudes Lists (HEAL)</measure>
    <time_frame>After the initial chiropractic visit</time_frame>
    <description>HEAL is a validated item-bank comprised of 6 domains developed through the Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) methodology. Investigators will use HEAL to assess nonspecific factors known to influence patient outcomes, including perceptions of the patient-provider connection, healthcare environment, treatment expectancy, spirituality, positive or negative outlook, and attitudes toward complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). A higher T-score represents more of the concept being measured. A T-score of 50 is equal to the mean and is considered normal. Lower numbers indicate values lower than the mean and higher numbers indicate values higher than the mean. Higher values are indicative of more positive perception. For example, a T-score of 55 on Patient-Provider Connection indicates that the respondent has a more positive perception toward the patient-provider connection than the general chronic condition population (half a standard deviation higher).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain, Enjoyment, and General Activity (PEG)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 3 and Week 7</time_frame>
    <description>The PEG is a 3-item tool to improve assessment and monitoring of chronic pain. The overall PEG-3 score ranges from 0-10 with 10 indicating more pain, more interference with enjoyment of life, and more interference with general activity. Questions assess average pain intensity (P) (AVERAGE pain in past week: 0-10, 0= No Pain, 10=Pain as bad as you can imagine), interference with enjoyment of life (E), and interference with general activity (G) (In past week, how pain interfered with...(0-10, 0=Does not interfere, 10=Completely interferes).</description>

        <description>PASTOR is an on-line data collection tool based on the NIH Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) and adopted by the DoD/VA Pain Management Task Force. Specific measures include the Defense &amp; Veterans Pain Rating Scale (DVPRS), an enhanced 11-item (total range 0-10, 0=no pain, 10=worst pain) numeric rating scale (NRS) that improves on standard pain NRS by including a Faces Rating Scale component; 'traffic light' color-coding system to delineate mild, moderate and severe pain; and word descriptors, paired with 4, 0-10 NRS items to quantify the impact of pain on general activity, sleep, mood, and stress. PASTOR incorporates PROMIS measures for mental health conditions (PTSD, depression, anxiety, anger, and alcohol use), physical and social function, fatigue, and pain interference with daily activities to provide graphical representation of improvements or declines in patient status that are compared to matched US samples on age, race/ethnicity and sex.</description>

        <title>Self-Efficacy for Managing Symptoms (SF8a)</title>
        <description>Developed by the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS), this 8-item, self-reported tool will assess a person's level of confidence to manage/control symptoms, to manage their symptoms in different settings and to keep symptoms from interfering with work, sleep, relationships or recreational activities. Each question usually has five response options ranging in value from 1 to 5. The total raw score for a measure is converted to into a T-score for each participant. The T-score rescales the raw score into a standardized score with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation (SD) of 10. Therefore a person with a T-score of 40 is one SD below the mean. A higher PROMIS T-score represents more of the concept being measured. For example, a T-score of 55 on the PROMIS Self-Efficacy for Managing Symptoms indicates that the respondent has greater self-efficacy for managing their symptoms than the general chronic condition population (half a standard deviation higher).</description>

        <title>Healing Encounters and Attitudes Lists (HEAL)</title>
        <description>HEAL is a validated item-bank comprised of 6 domains developed through the Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) methodology. Investigators will use HEAL to assess nonspecific factors known to influence patient outcomes, including perceptions of the patient-provider connection, healthcare environment, treatment expectancy, spirituality, positive or negative outlook, and attitudes toward complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). A higher T-score represents more of the concept being measured. A T-score of 50 is equal to the mean and is considered normal. Lower numbers indicate values lower than the mean and higher numbers indicate values higher than the mean. Higher values are indicative of more positive perception. For example, a T-score of 55 on Patient-Provider Connection indicates that the respondent has a more positive perception toward the patient-provider connection than the general chronic condition population (half a standard deviation higher).</description>
