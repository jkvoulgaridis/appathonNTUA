  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety of subcutaneous (SC)
      risankizumab and oral FUMADERM provided as study medication in participants with moderate to
      severe plaque psoriasis who are naïve to and candidates for systemic therapy.

      The efficacy analysis was performed in the Intent to Treat (ITT) set which included all
      participants who were randomized. The safety analysis was performed in the safety set which
      included all participants who received at least one dose of study drug. No participants were
      excluded from the efficacy analysis. Three participants in the FUMADERM® group discontinued
      after randomization prior to receiving any study drug and were thus not included in the
      safety set.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Achieving 90% Improvement in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI90) at Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) is a composite score based on the degree of effect on body surface area of psoriasis and the extension of erythema (reddening), induration (thickness), desquamation (scaling) of the lesions and area affected as observed on the day of examination. The severity of each sign was assessed using a 5-point scale, where 0=no symptoms, 1=slight, 2=moderate, 3=marked, 4=very marked. The PASI score ranges from 0 to 72, where 0 indicates no psoriasis and 72 indicates very severe psoriasis. PASI90 is defined as at least a 90% reduction in PASI score compared with the Baseline PASI score. The percent reduction in score is calculated as (PASI score at Baseline - score at follow-up visit) / PASI score at Baseline * 100. Non-responder imputation (NRI) was used for missing data.</description>

    <description>The PBI is a patient-reported outcome instrument that assesses the benefit of psoriasis treatment.The PBI assessment consists of 2 steps: before treatment, every participant defines his/her treatment needs according to a standardized list (Patient Needs Questionnaire [PNQ]). After treatment, the participant rates the degree of benefits achieved (Patient Benefits Questionnaire [PBQ]). 25 items are rated on a 5-point scale with values from 0 (not at all) to 4 (very), allowing for &quot;did not apply to me&quot; (5) and missing. For each treatment goal the PNQ importance is derived by dividing the respective PNQ item by the sum of all PNQ items. The weighted sum of each PBQ item with its respective PNQ importance yields the PBI score. An increase in PBI indicates improvement. LOCF imputation was used for missing data.</description>

    <description>The NAPPA-CLIN is an investigator assessment used to assess the severity of nail matrix psoriasis (leukonychia, red spots, dots, nail plate crumbling) and psoriasis of the nail bed (oil drop, splinter haemorrhage, subungual hyperkeratosis, onycholysis). NAPPA-CLIN has been developed from the Nail Psoriasis Severity Index (NAPSI) score, a nail psoriasis-specific score, which in its original version comprises the assessment of matrix and nail bed involvement in every finger and toe by 2 criteria for each nail. The NAPPA-CLIN is a simplified version of the NAPSI which only assesses the least and the worst involved nail of both hands or both feet respectively. Thus, the NAPPA-CLIN scores for hands or feet range from 0 to 16. A higher score indicates a worse involvement. LOCF imputation was used for missing data.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Achieving Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) Score of 0 or 1 at Week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The DLQI is a 10-question questionnaire that asks the participant to evaluate the degree that psoriasis has affected their quality of life in the last week and includes 6 domains (symptoms and feelings, daily activities, leisure, work and school, personal relationships, and treatment). Responses to each domain are not relevant (0), not at all (0), a little (1), a lot (2), and very much (3). The DLQI is calculated by summing the scores of the questions and ranges from 1 to 30, where 0-1 = no effect on patient's life, 2-5 = small effect, 6-10 = moderate effect, 11-20 = very large effect, and 21-30 = extremely large effect on patient's life. The higher the score, the more the quality of life is impaired. A 5-point change from baseline is considered a clinically important difference. NRI was used for missing data.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The physician assessed the severity of scalp psoriasis using the PSSI, which consists of an assessment of erythema, induration, and desquamation on a scale from 0 (none) to 4 (very severe) and the percentage of scalp involved on a scale from 0 (0% of scalp involved) to 6 (90-100% of scalp involved). The composite score is calculated as the sum of symptom scores multiplied by the score for the area of scalp involved. The PSSI ranges from 0 (best) to 72 (worst). A negative change from Baseline indicates improvement. LOCF imputation was used for missing data.</description>

    <measure>European Quality of Life 5 Dimensions (EQ-5D-5L) Total Score: Change From Baseline to Week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D-5L is a standardized non-disease specific instrument for describing and valuing health-related quality of life. The EQ-5D-5L descriptive system comprises 5 dimensions of health (mobility, self -care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression) to describe the subject's current health state. Each dimension comprises 5 levels with corresponding numeric scores, where 1 indicates no problems, and 5 indicates extreme problems. A unique EQ-5D-5L health state is defined by combining the numeric level scores for each of the 5 dimensions and the total score is normalized from -0.594 to 1.000, with higher scores representing a better health state. An increase in the EQ-5D-5L total score indicates improvement. LOCF imputation was used for missing data.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Achieving 90% Improvement in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI90) at Week 24</title>
        <description>The Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) is a composite score based on the degree of effect on body surface area of psoriasis and the extension of erythema (reddening), induration (thickness), desquamation (scaling) of the lesions and area affected as observed on the day of examination. The severity of each sign was assessed using a 5-point scale, where 0=no symptoms, 1=slight, 2=moderate, 3=marked, 4=very marked. The PASI score ranges from 0 to 72, where 0 indicates no psoriasis and 72 indicates very severe psoriasis. PASI90 is defined as at least a 90% reduction in PASI score compared with the Baseline PASI score. The percent reduction in score is calculated as (PASI score at Baseline - score at follow-up visit) / PASI score at Baseline * 100. Non-responder imputation (NRI) was used for missing data.</description>

          <title>Percentage of Participants Achieving 90% Improvement in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI90) at Week 24</title>
          <description>The Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) is a composite score based on the degree of effect on body surface area of psoriasis and the extension of erythema (reddening), induration (thickness), desquamation (scaling) of the lesions and area affected as observed on the day of examination. The severity of each sign was assessed using a 5-point scale, where 0=no symptoms, 1=slight, 2=moderate, 3=marked, 4=very marked. The PASI score ranges from 0 to 72, where 0 indicates no psoriasis and 72 indicates very severe psoriasis. PASI90 is defined as at least a 90% reduction in PASI score compared with the Baseline PASI score. The percent reduction in score is calculated as (PASI score at Baseline - score at follow-up visit) / PASI score at Baseline * 100. Non-responder imputation (NRI) was used for missing data.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Achieving 50% Improvement in PASI Score (PASI50) at Week 20</title>
        <description>PASI is a composite score based on the degree of effect on body surface area of psoriasis and the extension of erythema (reddening), induration (thickness), desquamation (scaling) of the lesions and area affected as observed on the day of examination. The severity of each sign was assessed using a 5-point scale, where 0=no symptoms, 1=slight, 2=moderate, 3=marked, 4=very marked. The PASI score ranges from 0 to 72, where 0 indicates no psoriasis and 72 indicates very severe psoriasis. PASI50 is defined as at least a 50% reduction in PASI score compared with the Baseline PASI score. The percent reduction in score is calculated as (PASI score at Baseline - score at follow-up visit) / PASI score at Baseline * 100. NRI was used for missing data.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Achieving 75% Improvement in PASI Score (PASI75) at Week 12</title>
        <description>PASI is a composite score based on the degree of effect on body surface area of psoriasis and the extension of erythema (reddening), induration (thickness), desquamation (scaling) of the lesions and area affected as observed on the day of examination. The severity of each sign was assessed using a 5-point scale, where 0=no symptoms, 1=slight, 2=moderate, 3=marked, 4=very marked. The PASI score ranges from 0 to 72, where 0 indicates no psoriasis and 72 indicates very severe psoriasis. PASI75 is defined as at least a 75% reduction in PASI score compared with the Baseline PASI score. The percent reduction in score is calculated as (PASI score at Baseline - score at follow-up visit) / PASI score at Baseline * 100. NRI was used for missing data.</description>

        <description>PASI is a composite score based on the degree of effect on body surface area of psoriasis and the extension of erythema (reddening), induration (thickness), desquamation (scaling) of the lesions and area affected as observed on the day of examination. The severity of each sign was assessed using a 5-point scale, where 0=no symptoms, 1=slight, 2=moderate, 3=marked, 4=very marked. The PASI score ranges from 0 to 72, where 0 indicates no psoriasis and 72 indicates very severe psoriasis. PASI100 is defined as 100% reduction in PASI score compared with the Baseline PASI score. The percent reduction in score is calculated as (PASI score at Baseline - score at follow-up visit) / PASI score at Baseline * 100. NRI was used for missing data.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Achieving 100% Improvement in PASI (PASI100) at Week 20</title>
        <description>PASI is a composite score based on the degree of effect on body surface area of psoriasis and the extension of erythema (reddening), induration (thickness), desquamation (scaling) of the lesions and area affected as observed on the day of examination. The severity of each sign was assessed using a 5-point scale, where 0=no symptoms, 1=slight, 2=moderate, 3=marked, 4=very marked. The PASI score ranges from 0 to 72, where 0 indicates no psoriasis and 72 indicates very severe psoriasis. PASI100 is defined as 100% reduction in PASI score compared with the Baseline PASI score. The percent reduction in score is calculated as (PASI score at Baseline - score at follow-up visit) / PASI score at Baseline * 100. NRI was used for missing data.</description>

        <description>The sPGA is an assessment by the investigator of the overall disease severity at the time of evaluation. Erythema (E), induration (I), and desquamation (D) are scored on a 5-point scale ranging from 0 (none) to 4 (severe). The sPGA ranges from 0 to 4, and is calculated as Clear (0) = 0 for all three; Almost clear (1) = mean &gt;0, &lt;1.5; Mild (2) = mean ≥1.5, &lt;2.5; Moderate (3) = mean ≥2.5, &lt;3.5; and Severe (4) = mean ≥3.5.

        <title>Percentage of Participants Achieving sPGA Score of Clear at Week 20</title>
        <description>The sPGA is an assessment by the investigator of the overall disease severity at the time of evaluation. Erythema (E), induration (I), and desquamation (D) are scored on a 5-point scale ranging from 0 (none) to 4 (severe). The sPGA ranges from 0 to 4, and is calculated as Clear (0) = 0 for all three; Almost clear (1) = mean &gt;0, &lt;1.5; Mild (2) = mean ≥1.5, &lt;2.5; Moderate (3) = mean ≥2.5, &lt;3.5; and Severe (4) = mean ≥3.5.

        <title>Summary of Patient Benefit Index (PBI) at Week 16</title>
        <description>The PBI is a patient-reported outcome instrument that assesses the benefit of psoriasis treatment.The PBI assessment consists of 2 steps: before treatment, every participant defines his/her treatment needs according to a standardized list (Patient Needs Questionnaire [PNQ]). After treatment, the participant rates the degree of benefits achieved (Patient Benefits Questionnaire [PBQ]). 25 items are rated on a 5-point scale with values from 0 (not at all) to 4 (very), allowing for &quot;did not apply to me&quot; (5) and missing. For each treatment goal the PNQ importance is derived by dividing the respective PNQ item by the sum of all PNQ items. The weighted sum of each PBQ item with its respective PNQ importance yields the PBI score. An increase in PBI indicates improvement. LOCF imputation was used for missing data.</description>

        <title>Clinical Severity of Nail Psoriasis (NAPPA-CLIN) Total Score: Change From Baseline to Week 16</title>
        <description>The NAPPA-CLIN is an investigator assessment used to assess the severity of nail matrix psoriasis (leukonychia, red spots, dots, nail plate crumbling) and psoriasis of the nail bed (oil drop, splinter haemorrhage, subungual hyperkeratosis, onycholysis). NAPPA-CLIN has been developed from the Nail Psoriasis Severity Index (NAPSI) score, a nail psoriasis-specific score, which in its original version comprises the assessment of matrix and nail bed involvement in every finger and toe by 2 criteria for each nail. The NAPPA-CLIN is a simplified version of the NAPSI which only assesses the least and the worst involved nail of both hands or both feet respectively. Thus, the NAPPA-CLIN scores for hands or feet range from 0 to 16. A higher score indicates a worse involvement. LOCF imputation was used for missing data.</description>

        <title>NAPPA-CLIN Total Score: Change From Baseline to Week 24</title>
        <description>The NAPPA-CLIN is an investigator assessment used to assess the severity of nail matrix psoriasis (leukonychia, red spots, dots, nail plate crumbling) and psoriasis of the nail bed (oil drop, splinter haemorrhage, subungual hyperkeratosis, onycholysis). NAPPA-CLIN has been developed from the NAPSI score, a nail psoriasis-specific score, which in its original version comprises the assessment of matrix and nail bed involvement in every finger and toe by 2 criteria for each nail. The NAPPA-CLIN is a simplified version of the NAPSI which only assesses the least and the worst involved nail of both hands or both feet respectively. Thus, the NAPPA-CLIN scores for hands or feet range from 0 to 16. A higher score indicates a worse involvement. LOCF imputation was used for missing data.</description>

For purposes of clinical estimation, the total surface of the palm plus 5 digits was to be assumed to be approximately equivalent to 1% BSA.

          <description>BSA affected by psoriasis was measured by the physician selecting the participant's right or left hand as the measuring device. For purposes of clinical estimation, the total surface of the palm plus 5 digits was to be assumed to be approximately equivalent to 1% BSA. Measurement of the total area of involvement by the physician was aided by imagining if scattered plaques were moved so that they were next to each other and then estimated the total area involved. A decrease in BSA affected by psoriasis indicates improvement. LOCF imputation was used for missing data.</description>

        <description>The PtGA is a patient-reported outcome instrument to assess the patient's assessment of disease severity. This self-reported measure is used to assess disease activity using a 4-point scale where a higher score indicates a higher level of disease activity. Disease activity is assessed from 0 (&quot;complete disease control&quot;) to 3 (&quot;uncontrolled disease&quot;). LOCF imputation was used for missing data.</description>

        <description>The HADS was a patient-reported questionnaire used to assess the level of anxiety and depression in the setting of a hospital medical outpatient clinic. The anxiety and depression subscales each have a range from 0-21, higher scores indicated higher levels of anxiety and depression, respectively. LOCF imputation was used for missing data.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Achieving Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) Score of 0 or 1 at Week 16</title>
        <description>The DLQI is a 10-question questionnaire that asks the participant to evaluate the degree that psoriasis has affected their quality of life in the last week and includes 6 domains (symptoms and feelings, daily activities, leisure, work and school, personal relationships, and treatment). Responses to each domain are not relevant (0), not at all (0), a little (1), a lot (2), and very much (3). The DLQI is calculated by summing the scores of the questions and ranges from 1 to 30, where 0-1 = no effect on patient's life, 2-5 = small effect, 6-10 = moderate effect, 11-20 = very large effect, and 21-30 = extremely large effect on patient's life. The higher the score, the more the quality of life is impaired. A 5-point change from baseline is considered a clinically important difference. NRI was used for missing data.</description>

          <title>DLQI: Change From Baseline to Week 24</title>
          <description>The DLQI is a 10-question questionnaire that asks the participant to evaluate the degree that psoriasis has affected their quality of life in the last week and includes 6 domains (symptoms and feelings, daily activities, leisure, work and school, personal relationships, and treatment). Responses to each domain are not relevant (0), not at all (0), a little (1), a lot (2), and very much (3). The DLQI is calculated by summing the scores of the questions and ranges from 1 to 30, where 0-1 = no effect on patient's life, 2-5 = small effect, 6-10 = moderate effect, 11-20 = very large effect, and 21-30 = extremely large effect on patient's life. The higher the score, the more the quality of life is impaired. A 5-point change from baseline is considered a clinically important difference. LOCF imputation was used for missing data.</description>

        <title>Psoriasis Scalp Severity Index (PSSI): Change From Baseline at Week 16</title>
        <description>The physician assessed the severity of scalp psoriasis using the PSSI, which consists of an assessment of erythema, induration, and desquamation on a scale from 0 (none) to 4 (very severe) and the percentage of scalp involved on a scale from 0 (0% of scalp involved) to 6 (90-100% of scalp involved). The composite score is calculated as the sum of symptom scores multiplied by the score for the area of scalp involved. The PSSI ranges from 0 (best) to 72 (worst). A negative change from Baseline indicates improvement. LOCF imputation was used for missing data.</description>

        <description>The EQ-5D-5L is a standardized non-disease specific instrument for describing and valuing health-related quality of life. The EQ-5D-5L descriptive system comprises 5 dimensions of health (mobility, self -care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression) to describe the subject's current health state. Each dimension comprises 5 levels with corresponding numeric scores, where 1 indicates no problems, and 5 indicates extreme problems. A unique EQ-5D-5L health state is defined by combining the numeric level scores for each of the 5 dimensions and the total score is normalized from -0.594 to 1.000, with higher scores representing a better health state. An increase in the EQ-5D-5L total score indicates improvement. LOCF imputation was used for missing data.</description>

        <description>The EQ-5D-5L is a standardized non-disease specific instrument for describing and valuing health-related quality of life. The EQ-5D-5L VAS records the participant's self-rated health on a vertical visual analogue scale numbered from 100 (best health imagined) to 0 (worst health imagined). The VAS score from the scale is then entered as a number by the participant. This can be used as a quantitative measure of health outcome that reflects the participant's own judgement. An increase in the EQ-5D-5L VAS score indicates improvement. LOCF imputation was used for missing data.</description>

        <title>Nail Psoriasis Severity Index (NAPSI): Change From Baseline to Week 16</title>
        <description>The NAPSI score is calculated by summing the scores of all the nails which for each nail are the sum of the nail matrix score and nail bed score. Each of these is scored as 0=none, 1=present in 1/4 nail, 2=present in 2/4 nail, 3=present in 3/4 nail, 4=present in 4/4 nail. Each nail has a matrix score (0-4) and a nail bed score (0-4). The total nail score is the sum of those 2 (nail matrix and nail bed) individual scores (0-8). The sum of the total score of all involved fingernails is then the total NAPSI score. The NAPSI score is calculated only if all questions in the case report form are completed. A negative change from Baseline indicates improvement. LOCF imputation was used for missing data.</description>

        <title>Participants With Baseline NAPSI ˃0: Change From Baseline to Week 16</title>
        <description>The NAPSI score is calculated by summing the scores of all the nails which for each nail are the sum of the nail matrix score and nail bed score. Each of these is scored as 0=none, 1=present in 1/4 nail, 2=present in 2/4 nail, 3=present in 3/4 nail, 4=present in 4/4 nail. Each nail has a matrix score (0-4) and a nail bed score (0-4). The total nail score is the sum of those 2 (nail matrix and nail bed) individual scores (0-8). The sum of the total score of all involved fingernails is then the total NAPSI score. The NAPSI score is calculated only if all questions in the case report form are completed. A negative change from Baseline indicates improvement. LOCF imputation was used for missing data.</description>
