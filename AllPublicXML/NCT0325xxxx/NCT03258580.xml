      Background:

      People can feel different levels of pain. This may depend on social, cultural, and biological
      factors. These factors can also influence how people respond to each other, and how they
      judge other people s experiences. Researchers want to learn more about these relationships.

      Objective:

      To study if social and cultural factors lead to differences in pain experience and how pain
      is interpreted by other individuals.

      Eligibility:

      Healthy adults ages 18-60

      Design:

      Participants will have 1 or 2 visits.

      Participants will be screened with a medical history and nursing assessment.

      Participants may have the following:

      Electric shock through small sticky pads on the arm, leg, or foot.

      Thermal stimulation. A device called a thermode will be placed on the arm, leg, or foot. A
      computer controls the thermode temperature.

      Lowering their hand into very cold water.

      Videos or pictures of the face will recorded while participants get painful stimulation.

      A test to record heart electrical activity. Small metal disc or sticky pad electrodes will be
      placed on the chest.

      Pulse rate and breathing measured. Sweating will be measured with two small sensors stuck on
      the hand.

      A test to measure the electrical activity of facial muscles. Small metal disk or sticky pad
      electrodes will be attached to the skin.

      Viewing pictures and/or videos of other people who get painful and nonpainful stimulation.

      Participants will make decisions about the images. They will respond by keyboard, mouse, or
      button.

      Eye tracking. A camera will measure participants pupil size and follow their eye movements.

      Objective

      The current proposal investigates behavioral, psychophysiological, and social processes that
      may help explain biases and disparate outcomes in pain. Health disparities, or health
      outcomes that adversely affect disadvantaged populations, are pervasive and apparent in many
      diseases and symptoms, including pain. Pain is the number one reason individuals seek medical
      treatment. Health disparities in pain encompass both differences in pain experience and
      treatment for pain. For instance, research indicates that Black individuals report increased
      pain and have reduced pain tolerance relative to White individuals, yet doctors are less
      likely to treat minority patients pain and underestimate their pain experience. This project
      aims to address this systemic discrepancy by focusing on interpersonal processes that may
      contribute to these disparities, including socially-relevant responses to pain (i.e. pain
      expression) and pain assessment (e.g. visual attention). The proposed research aims to
      determine whether the study of pain expressions and their assessment can yield insights on
      how social factors shape pain and its treatment. Further, we test the efficacy of potential
      interventions designed to improve accuracy and reduce biases in pain assessment. If
      successful, this work will form the foundation of a new research program that will link the
      field of pain research with the field of social neuroscience, and forge new insights on the
      critical problem of health disparities in pain.

      Study population

      We will accrue up to 320 total healthy volunteers to target 257 completers.

      Design

      Our overall aim is to understand how social factors influence the assessment and management
      of pain, and to gain insight into psychosocial processes that may underlie health disparities
      in pain. We propose a series of studies designed to test these links. First, we will measure
      pain perception and physiological responses to painful stimuli in a diverse group of
      individuals to test for sociocultural and biological influences on pain and pain-related
      responses. In subsequent studies, new participants ( perceivers ) will view images of these
      initial participants ( targets ) and will provide estimates of targets pain experience. We
      will measure a) whether perceivers can accurately estimate targets pain experience; b)
      whether accuracy and directed attention differ as a function of similarity between target and
      perceiver (ingroup vs outgroup) for both healthcare providers and non-medical volunteers; and
      c) whether individuals can improve accuracy through feedback and/or instruction.

      Outcome measures

      Primary outcome measures for all experiments will be decisions about pain (experienced by
      self or other) measured with visual analogue scales, reaction time, and/or categorical
      judgments (pain/no pain). We will also measure physiological responses (e.g., facial muscle
      response, skin conductance, pupil dilation) as secondary outcome measures. We will test
      whether pain and pain-related responses varies as a function of sociocultural/demographic
      factors (e.g. race, ethnicity, gender) and whether accuracy in assessing others pain is
      influenced by group similarity (i.e. ingroup vs. outgroup) and training (e.g. health
      practitioners versus na(SqrRoot) ve volunteers; performance-related feedback).
