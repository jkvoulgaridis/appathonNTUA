      A Laboratory Study to Evaluate Urine and Blood Biomarkers That Can Distinguish Between the
      Presence or Absence of Aggressive Prostate Cancer
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The over-arching goal of this study is to evaluate if biomarkers within the blood or urine of
      men with localized prostate cancer can distinguish between those with indolent cancer,
      defined as Gleason Grade Groups 1 and 2 and those with more aggressive disease (Gleason Grade
      Groups 3, 4, and 5).
