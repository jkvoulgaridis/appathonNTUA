  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare plasma and urine PK parameters of MK-3866 between
      participants with impaired renal function and healthy control participants, to investigate
      the extent to which MK-3866 is removed from the plasma by hemodialysis (HD), and evaluate the
      safety and tolerability of MK-3866 in participants with impaired renal function.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, 2-part single dose study: Part 1 will include participants with mild,
      moderate, and severe renal impairment (as well as healthy control participants), and Part 2
      will include participants with end stage renal disease (ESRD) undergoing HD. Participants in
      Part 1 will receive a single IV dose of MK-3866, and plasma and urine samples will be
      collected over pre-specified time intervals. Participants in Part 2 will receive a single IV
      dose of MK-3866 on two separate occasions: in Period 1 immediately following their
      normally-scheduled HD, and in Period 2 approximately 30 minutes prior to their
      normally-scheduled HD. Plasma, urine, and dialysate samples will be collected over
      pre-specified time intervals for Part 2.

    <description>Plasma dialysis samples were collected at pre-specified time points and AD,total was assessed. AD,total was obtained by integrating the rr versus time profile over the dialysis session duration, using actual times relative to the start time of dialysis. Concentrations of MK-3866 were determined using HPLC-MS/MS. Method of dispersion used for these data is geometric %CV.</description>

    <description>Plasma dialysis samples were collected at pre-specified time points and CLD,dialysate was assessed. CLD,dialysate was calculated as AD.total / AUCD. Concentrations of MK-3866 were determined using HPLC-MS/MS. Method of dispersion used for these data is geometric %CV.</description>

    <description>An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product or protocol-specified procedure, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product or protocol-specified procedure. Any worsening of a preexisting condition that is temporally associated with the use of the Sponsor's product, is also an AE.</description>

Concentrations of MK-3866 were determined using HPLC-MS/MS. Method of dispersion used for these data is geometric %CV.</description>

        <description>An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product or protocol-specified procedure, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product or protocol-specified procedure. Any worsening of a preexisting condition that is temporally associated with the use of the Sponsor's product, is also an AE.</description>
