      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of Brivaracetam
      (BRV) in focal epilepsy subjects with partial seizures and to evaluate the maintenance of
      efficacy of BRV over time.

    <measure>Percent change in partial seizure frequency per 28 days from Baseline of EP0083 or N01358 to the Evaluation Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline of EP0083 or N01358 and by 3-month periods over the Evaluation Period (up to 70 months)</time_frame>
    <description>The seizure frequency is calculated as number of seizures per 28 days. This evaluation will be done every 3 months of the Evaluation Period (by 3-month periods). Change in seizure frequency from Baseline of EP0083 (NCT03083665) or N01358 (NCT01261325) is calculated as the seizure frequency at the evaluation time point minus the seizure frequency at Baseline of EP0083 or N01358.</description>

    <description>The seizure frequency is calculated as number of seizures per 28 days. This evaluation will be done every 3 months of the Evaluation Period (by 3-month periods). A responder is defined as a subject with a &gt;= 50% reduction in seizure frequency from the Baseline Period of EP0083 or N01358.</description>
