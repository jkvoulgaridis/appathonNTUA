      micronutrients with placebo in 135 children with ADHD.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study examines a broad spectrum micronutrient treatment for children with ADHD. The goal
      is to broaden the scope of evidence-based treatments, and to address the public desire for
      non-pharmacological treatment options. This study will use a randomized controlled trial
      design, comparing micronutrients with placebo in 135 children, ages 6-12, with ADHD plus
      irritability or anger based on parent-report of symptoms. The study will also collect
      biological samples (saliva, stool, urine, hair, and blood) from the children to examine
      physiological mechanisms of micronutrient effects. If the micronutrient treatment
      successfully diminishes symptoms, the clinical implication is to offer this as a legitimate
      non-pharmacological alternative to stimulant medication.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>CASI-5 Parent Report</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Primary outcome measure, defined a priori, reflecting the often-comorbid ADHD symptoms of emotional dysregulation irritable mood, anger or aggression), are the parent-rated Child and Adolescent Symptom Inventory (CASI-5) subscales of ADHD, Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD), Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder (DMDD) and peer conflict. The CASI-5 is based on the DSM-5 symptom criteria. Item range is 0-3 (never, sometimes, often, very often). Higher scores represent a worse outcome. The subscales for ADHD, ODD, and DMD will be composite scores.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical Global Impression (CGI)</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Second primary measure is the blinded clinician-rated CGI-Improvement (CGI-I) is a subscale of the CGI that rates overall improvement of symptoms based on all relevant data. Item range is 1-7 (very much improved, much improved, minimally improved, no change, minimally worse, much worse, very much worse); lower score is better. A treatment responder is defined as a participant who is rated a 1 or 2 on the CGI-I. The CGI-Severity (CGI-S) subscale will also be scored at baseline and week 8, with scores compared at the two time points. Item range is 1-7 (normal, borderline ill, mildly ill, moderately ill, markedly ill, severely ill, among the most extremely ill patients); lower score is better; most participants will be a 4 or 5 at baseline.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Biological Samples</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks, 3 time points; optional at one year</time_frame>
    <description>Collect and store biological samples of blood, hair, saliva, urine, and stool at three time points. The blood samples are being collected per a request from the FDA for safety screening. Additional blood will be collected to look at nutrient level changes and metabolomics, both targeted and untargeted, blood. Collection of other biological samples will enable future examination of nutrient mechanisms including markers of methylation, inflammation, metabolism, and microbiome biodiversity, as funds are available. Outcome is mechanistic investigation of cytokines (IL-1B, IL-6, TNF-a and MCP-1) and neurotransmitter levels (DA, NE and GABA) in urine and blood.</description>

             study appointments and complete questionnaires.

          -  Meet criteria for ADHD as assessed by the clinical cut-off (6+ questions scored as 2's
             or 3's, &quot;often,&quot; or &quot;very often&quot;) on the Category A: ADHD questions from on the Child
             &amp; Adolescent Symptom Inventory-5 (CASI-5) with at least several symptoms present in
             more than one setting, based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) 5 symptom
             criteria, including significant impairment in functioning socially and/or
             academically.

          -  Demonstrate at least one symptom of irritability or anger as assessed by a score of 2
             or 3 on one question from Category B or Rz from the CASI-5.

          -  Be medication-free, or washout with medical supervision to be provided by the child's
             pediatrician or primary care physician, reliant on the parent/guardian to work with
             that physician, for at least two weeks prior to in-person study assessment. Washout
             will be recorded as occurring on the date reported by the parent/guardian, with a
             faxed copy of the progress note, visit summary or signed letter from participant's
             doctor.

        Exclusion Criteria:

             suspected intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder, epilepsy, multiple
             sclerosis, narcolepsy) or other major psychiatric condition requiring hospitalization
             (e.g. significant mood disorder, active suicidal ideation, or psychosis), based on
             parent/guardian self-report of child's condition and responses to category M on the
             CASI-5 subscale.

          -  Any serious medical condition, including inflammatory bowel disease, history of
             cancer, kidney or liver disease, hyperthyroidism, diabetes Type I or II.

          -  Taking any other medication with primarily central nervous system activity, including
             stimulants, within the last two weeks prior to in-person assessment; participants must
             be off these medications for a minimum of two weeks prior to the screening.

          -  Severe separation anxiety that would preclude separating from parent/guardian to
             answer study questionnaires.

          -  Any disability that would interfere with participant answering questions verbally.

          -  Non-English speaking.

          -  Pregnancy or sexually active at baseline. Exclusion criteria 1-6 and 9, will be based
             on parent/guardian self-report of child's condition. If the parent/guardian reports
             medical exclusion criteria, or concerns about eligibility, data provided by
             parent/guardian will be confirmed by review of medical records with release of
             information signed by parent/guardian. Potential participant may be reviewed in-person
             by a study physician in the case of any concerns about participation.
