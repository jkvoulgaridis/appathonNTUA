    <measure>Clinical Exacerbation of COPD (CE-COPD) Rate: Percentage of Participants Who Experienced at Least 1 Moderate or Severe CE-COPD</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1) to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>CE-COPD was an occurrence of either severe CE-COPD or moderate CE-COPD. Severe CE-COPD was defined as an event that involved worsening respiratory symptoms for at least 2 consecutive days requiring treatment with systemic corticosteroids (SCS; at least 10 milligrams [mg] prednisone equivalent above baseline) and/or systemic antibiotics and a hospitalization for CE COPD.
Moderate CE-COPD was defined as an event that involved worsening respiratory symptoms for at least 2 consecutive days requiring treatment with SCS (at least 10 mg prednisone equivalent above baseline), and/or systemic antibiotics, and an unscheduled encounter (such as a phone call, an office visit, an urgent care visit, or an emergency care visit) for a CE-COPD, but not a hospitalization.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Total Number of Albuterol Inhalations in the Days Preceding the Symptom Peak of a CE-COPD Event</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Severe CE-COPD: an event that involved worsening respiratory symptoms for at least 2 consecutive days requiring treatment with SCS (at least 10 mg prednisone equivalent above baseline) and/or systemic antibiotics and a hospitalization. Moderate CE-COPD: an event that involved worsening respiratory symptoms for at least 2 consecutive days requiring treatment with SCS (at least 10 mg prednisone equivalent above baseline), and/or systemic antibiotics, and an unscheduled encounter (such as a phone call, office visit, urgent care visit, or emergency care visit), but not a hospitalization. Total number of inhalations taken in 1 day(24-hour period on day prior to date of CE-COPD symptom peak) and at 3,5,7,10,14, and 21 days preceding the date of CE-COPD symptom peak were reported. If a participant experienced multiple CE-COPD events, number of inhalations preceding symptom peak of a subsequent event was counted since end of previous event. Average of inhalations of all events were presented.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Days Prior to the Symptom Peak of a CE-COPD Event When Albuterol Use Increased</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>CE-COPD: occurrence of moderate or severe CE-COPD. Severe CE-COPD: an event that involved worsening respiratory symptoms for at least 2 consecutive days requiring treatment with SCS (at least 10 mg prednisone equivalent above baseline) and/or systemic antibiotics and a hospitalization. Moderate CE-COPD: an event that involved worsening respiratory symptoms for at least 2 consecutive days requiring treatment with SCS (at least 10 mg prednisone equivalent above baseline), and/or systemic antibiotics, and an unscheduled encounter (such as a phone call, an office visit, an urgent care visit, or an emergency care visit), but not a hospitalization. Number of days of increased albuterol use prior to the symptom peak of a CE-COPD was reported for first increase of daily albuterol use; 2 and 4 inhalations in a single day from baseline. increased daily albuterol use was defined as single-day increase of greater than (&gt;) 20 percent (%) from baseline.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Albuterol Uses in the 24 Hours Preceding a CE-COPD</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>CE-COPD referred to occurrence of moderate or severe CE-COPD. Severe CE-COPD was defined as an event that involved worsening respiratory symptoms for at least 2 consecutive days requiring treatment with SCS (at least 10 mg prednisone equivalent above baseline) and/or systemic antibiotics and a hospitalization for CE COPD. Moderate CE-COPD was defined as an event that involved worsening respiratory symptoms for at least 2 consecutive days requiring treatment with SCS (at least 10 mg prednisone equivalent above baseline), and/or systemic antibiotics, and an unscheduled encounter (such as a phone call, an office visit, an urgent care visit, or an emergency care visit) for a CE-COPD, but not a hospitalization. Number of albuterol inhalations used in the 24 hours preceding a moderate or severe CE-COPD was reported.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence that develops or worsens in severity during the conduct of a clinical study and does not necessarily have a causal relationship to the study drug. Severity was rated by investigator on a scale of mild, moderate and severe, with severe= an inability to carry out usual activities. Relation of AE to treatment was determined by investigator. SAEs included death, a life-threatening adverse event, inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, persistent or significant disability or incapacity, a congenital anomaly or birth defect, or an important medical event that jeopardized the participant and required medical intervention to prevent 1 of the outcomes listed in this definition. A summary of serious and non-serious AEs regardless of causality is located in 'Reported Adverse Events module'.</description>

          <description>Participants received 90 micrograms (mcg) of albuterol sulfate (ABS) via a multidose dry powder inhaler (MDPI) with an eModule (eMDPI) (that had a sensor on the top of device for the purposes of detecting and storing usage information), 1 to 2 inhalations every 4 hours, as needed for 12 weeks. ABS eMDPI was a rescue/reliever agent that included an eModule on top of the approved PROAIR RESPICLICKÂ® inhaler. Participants were allowed to continue use of other COPD and non-COPD medications as advised by their physician without changes unless deemed necessary by their physician.</description>

        <title>Clinical Exacerbation of COPD (CE-COPD) Rate: Percentage of Participants Who Experienced at Least 1 Moderate or Severe CE-COPD</title>
        <description>CE-COPD was an occurrence of either severe CE-COPD or moderate CE-COPD. Severe CE-COPD was defined as an event that involved worsening respiratory symptoms for at least 2 consecutive days requiring treatment with systemic corticosteroids (SCS; at least 10 milligrams [mg] prednisone equivalent above baseline) and/or systemic antibiotics and a hospitalization for CE COPD.
Moderate CE-COPD was defined as an event that involved worsening respiratory symptoms for at least 2 consecutive days requiring treatment with SCS (at least 10 mg prednisone equivalent above baseline), and/or systemic antibiotics, and an unscheduled encounter (such as a phone call, an office visit, an urgent care visit, or an emergency care visit) for a CE-COPD, but not a hospitalization.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs)</title>
        <description>AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence that develops or worsens in severity during the conduct of a clinical study and does not necessarily have a causal relationship to the study drug. Severity was rated by investigator on a scale of mild, moderate and severe, with severe= an inability to carry out usual activities. Relation of AE to treatment was determined by investigator. SAEs included death, a life-threatening adverse event, inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, persistent or significant disability or incapacity, a congenital anomaly or birth defect, or an important medical event that jeopardized the participant and required medical intervention to prevent 1 of the outcomes listed in this definition. A summary of serious and non-serious AEs regardless of causality is located in 'Reported Adverse Events module'.</description>
