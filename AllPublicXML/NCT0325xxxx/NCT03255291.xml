  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Epidemiology seeks to improve public health by identifying risk factors for cancer and other
      diseases and conveying that information to relevant audiences (e.g., physicians, the public).
      The audience is presumed to understand and use that information to make appropriate decisions
      about lifestyle behaviors and medical treatments. Yet, even though a single risk factor can
      affect the risk of multiple health outcomes, this information is seldom communicated to
      people in a way that optimizes their understanding of the importance of engaging in a single
      healthy behavior. Providing individuals with the ability to understand how a single behavior
      (obtaining sufficient physical activity) could affect their risk of developing multiple
      diseases could foster a more coherent and meaningful picture of the behavior's importance in
      reducing health risks, increase motivation and intentions to engage in the behavior, and over
      time improve public health.

      The proposed study translates epidemiological data about five diseases that cause significant
      morbidity and mortality (i.e., colon cancer, breast cancer (women), heart disease, diabetes,
      and stroke) into a visual display that conveys individualized risk estimates in a
      comprehensible, meaningful, and useful way to diverse lay audiences.

    <intervention_model_description>Participants were randomly assigned by a computer algorithm to one of six intervention arms according to a 3 (risk display format: text, table, ladder) x 2 (imagery behavior: exercise, sleep) between-subjects factorial design. Although randomization was done at the same time and at the beginning of the study, participants received the risk display intervention first, then answered a survey containing two of the primary outcomes, then received the mental imagery intervention followed by another survey.</intervention_model_description>

    <measure>Difference in Gist Comprehension of Risk Information by Risk Display Format</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Risk display format = risk ladder, table, or text
Gist comprehension of risk information: being able to extract the bottom-line meaning of information provided by the website (e.g., if exercising decreased heath risk)
Measured by the sum of (4) questions coded as correctly comprehending risk information (1 point) or incorrectly comprehending risk information (0 points), with a total score range of 0=low comprehension to 4=high comprehension. Higher comprehension is considered a better outcome.
All comprehension questions have an additional &quot;don't know&quot; option, which is counted as incorrect.
To limit participant burden, the investigators assessed comprehension for diabetes only, instead of all diseases as planned.
Comprehension will not be assessed for people who report a history of diabetes because they are not given risk information.</description>

Verbatim comprehension of risk information: being able to recall the exact information specific to diabetes risk and hours of recommended weekly physical activity
Measured by the sum of (3) questions coded as correctly comprehending information (1 point) or incorrectly comprehending information (0 points), with a total score range of 0=low comprehension to 3=high comprehension. Higher comprehension is considered a better outcome.

          <description>With help from a research assistant, participants complete the Risk Assessment App. The App asks demographic &amp; health questions. It then provides personalized risk estimates for participants’ current activity level &amp; how it would change with regular exercise.
Participants take Baseline Survey 1.
Participants listen to an audio recording that guides them through a mental imagery activity. They write down an exercise goal &amp; are asked to practice the mental imagery twice a day for 3 weeks.
Participants take Baseline Survey 2.
Participants receive text messages reminding them to practice the mental imagery twice daily for 5 minutes each time (3 texts a week for 3 weeks).
Participants take surveys via text at the end of each week for 4 weeks.
90 days post-baseline, participants complete a survey sent through the mail.
Participants may be contacted for another survey 1 year later.</description>

Gist comprehension of risk information: being able to extract the bottom-line meaning of information provided by the website (e.g., if exercising decreased heath risk)
Measured by the sum of (4) questions coded as correctly comprehending risk information (1 point) or incorrectly comprehending risk information (0 points), with a total score range of 0=low comprehension to 4=high comprehension. Higher comprehension is considered a better outcome.
All comprehension questions have an additional &quot;don't know&quot; option, which is counted as incorrect.
To limit participant burden, the investigators assessed comprehension for diabetes only, instead of all diseases as planned.
Comprehension will not be assessed for people who report a history of diabetes because they are not given risk information.</description>
