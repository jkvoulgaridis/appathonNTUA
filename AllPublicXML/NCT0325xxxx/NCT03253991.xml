      A Study to Evaluate the Effectiveness and Safety of ExAblate Transcranial MRgFUS Thalamotomy
      Treatment of Medication Refractory Essential Tremor Subjects

      The objective of this prospective, single-arm study is to test the efficacy of treatment
      using the ExAblate Transcranial System and to further demonstrate safety in
      medication-refractory tremor inpatients with essential tremor (ET).

      The Indications for Use claim for this system is as follows: Treatment of
      medication-refractory tremor in patients with essential tremor.

      The objective of this prospective, multi-site, single-arm study is to test the efficacy of
      treatment using the ExAblate Transcranial System and to further demonstrate safety in
      medication-refractory tremor in subjects with essential tremor (ET).

      Safety: To evaluate the incidence and severity of adverse events (AE/AEs) associated with
      ExAblate Transcranial MRgFUS treatment of medication-refractory ET Effectiveness: To
      determine the effectiveness of the ExAblate Transcranial MRgFUS treatment of
      medication-refractory tremor (i.e. ET). Efficacy will be determined utilizing the Clinical
      Rating Scale for Tremor (CRST) in ET from examinations at baseline and 3-Months post-ExAblate
      treatment.

      • This study is designed as a prospective, multi-site, single-arm study. Assessments of
      primary efficacy endpoints will compare the three months after ExAblate treatment to Baseline
      measurements for clinical symptom relief. Safety of ExAblate in the treatment of ET will be
      collected for one year after ExAblate treatment. Relative Safety will be evaluated using a
      common description of Significant Clinical Complications for patients treated in this study.
      This study will be performed on the 3T MR scanners.

      The secondary endpoints of the study are as follows:

        1. Quality life claims: Questionnaire for Essential Tremor (QUEST) outcome (upper extremity
           questions) at Months 3 change from Baseline

        2. Durability (as measured by QUEST upper arm extremity questions) of the procedure as
           reflected by the efficacy data through change from baseline measures through Month 12
           follow up

        3. Subject daily functionalities: as measured by CRST Part-C (subscales)Month 12 as
           compared to Baseline.
