      The investigators conduct a randomized controlled trial among 70 healthy college students in
      Shanghai, China. These students fulfilling the recruitment criteria will be randomly divided
      into two parallel groups to receive either fish oil [marine-derived n-3 polyunsaturated fatty
      acids (PUFA)] or sunflower seed oil. Participants in fish oil group receive 2.5 g/day (two
      1.25-g capsules daily) in divided doses. The sunflower seed oil capsules are identical. All
      interventions started at 7:30 a.m.to avoid issues related to diurnal variation. Health
      endpoints, including blood pressure, fractional exhaled nitric oxide and pulmonary function
      were evaluated and biological samples such as morning urine, fast blood, saliva sample,buccal
      cells and skin tape stripping will be collected at week 1 before supplemenatation, and week
      8, week 10, week 12 as well as week 14 during the supplementation phase.The investigators
      measure personal real-time exposure to PM2.5 and personal temperature and relative humidity.

Fish oil supplementation: Participants of this randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial include 70 healthy Chinese adults. The investigators randomly assign participants to two parallel groups at baseline using a random-number table. Compliance is determined by directly observed supplement intake.

Fish oil supplementation: Participants of this randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial include 70 healthy Chinese adults. The investigators randomly assign participants to two parallel groups at baseline using a random-number table. Compliance is determined by directly observed supplement intake. Participants in fish oil group are assigned to receive 2.5 g/day in divided doses. Each capsule contains 60% n-3 PUFA [24% docosahexanoic acid (C22:6 n-3 DHA) and 36% eicosapentaenoic acid (C20:5 n-3 EPA)].</description>

The investigators randomly assign participants to two parallel groups at baseline using a random-number table. Compliance is determined by directly observed supplement intake. Participants in fish oil group are assigned to receive 2.5 g/day in divided doses. Each capsule contains 60% n-3 PUFA [24% docosahexanoic acid (C22:6 n-3 DHA) and 36% eicosapentaenoic acid (C20:5 n-3 EPA)].</description>

            <title>Fish Oil Supplementation</title>
            <description>This group receive 2.5 g/day (two 1.25-g capsules daily) of fish oil (marine-derived n-3 PUFA) for 4 consecutive months.
Fish oil supplementation: Participants of this randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial include 70 healthy Chinese adults. The investigators randomly assign participants to two parallel groups at baseline using a random-number table. Compliance is determined by directly observed supplement intake. Participants in fish oil group are assigned to receive 2.5 g/day in divided doses. Each capsule contains 60% n-3 PUFA [24% docosahexanoic acid (C22:6 n-3 DHA) and 36% eicosapentaenoic acid (C20:5 n-3 EPA)].</description>

Sunflower seed oil supplementation: Participants of this randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial include 70 healthy Chinese adults. The investigators randomly assign participants to two parallel groups at baseline using a random-number table. Compliance is determined by directly observed supplement intake. Participants in sunflower seed oil group receive 2.5 g/day in divided doses, and the capsules are identical as the fish oil capsules. Each capsule containes 14.4% palmitic acid (C16:0), 16.0% oleic acid (C18:1 n-9), and 57.6% linoleic acid (C18:2 n-6).</description>
