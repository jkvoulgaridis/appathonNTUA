    <textblock>
      The study is an open-label, dose escalation and expansion clinical trial to evaluate the
      safety, tolerability, and PK of fruquintinib in patients with advanced solid tumors. The
      study will consist of two phases:

        -  A dose escalation phase - A 3+3 design will be used for this portion of the study.

        -  A dose expansion phase - Five cohorts will be evaluated in Dose Expansion. Cohort A will
           evaluate the MTD/RP2D in patients with advanced solid tumors. Cohort B and Cohort C will
           evaluate the MTD/RP2D in metastatic colorectal cancer patients. Cohort D and Cohort E
           will evaluate the MTD/RP2D in metastatic breast cancer patients.

      Study will be conducted in up to 9 sites in the US.

             will be excluded;

             screening;

          -  Inability to take medication orally, dysphagia or an active gastric ulcer resulting
             from previous surgery (eg, gastric bypass) or a severe gastrointestinal disease, or

             investigational product;

          -  Other disease, metabolic disorder, physical examination anomaly, abnormal laboratory
             result, or any other condition that investigators suspect may prohibit use of the
             investigational product, affect interpretation of study results, or put the patient at
             undue risk of harm based on the investigator's assessment;

          -  Known hypersensitivity to fruquintinib or any of its excipients.
