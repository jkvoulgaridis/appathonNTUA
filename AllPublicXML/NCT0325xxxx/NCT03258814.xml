  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a non-interventional, longitudinal and non-confirmatory study to compare an
      active supervised training (AST) with standard of care (SOC) physiotherapy in patients with
      axial spondyloarthritis and stable response to adalimumab (HUMIRA®) with respect to
      health-related outcomes. The primary objective is the improvement in spinal mobility after a
      6 month training program.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Treatment of axSpA patients with adalimumab (HUMIRA®) was according to the local adalimumab
      product label and local standard of care. AxSpA patients who responded to newly initialized
      adalimumab treatment based on physicians' decision, and who were eligible for active
      physiotherapy were enrolled in the study. Although this was a non-interventional study,
      participants were randomly assigned to receive either active supervised and standardized
      training physiotherapy or standard of care physiotherapy in order to provide adequate numbers
      of participants in each comparison group.

      Participants who consented to participate in the study were observed for up to 12 months from
      Baseline (defined as the Randomization visit where participants were assigned to one of the
      two physiotherapy options).

    <measure>Change Form Baseline in Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Metrology Index (BASMI) at Month 6</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>BASMI measures the range of motion based on five clinical measurements: 1) cervical rotation, 2) tragus to wall distance, 3) lumbar side flexion, 4) lumbar flexion (modified Schober's) and 5) intermalleolar distance. The total BASMI score ranges from 0 to 10 reflecting mild to moderate disease activity and functional ability in the spinal column. The higher the BASMI score the more severe the patient's limitation of movement due to their ankylosing spondylitis</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and Month 3</time_frame>
    <description>The Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index (BASFI) is a validated index to determine the degree of functional limitation in patients with AS. BASFI consists of 10 questions assessing participants' ability to perform activities, each on a numeric rating scale (NRS) ranging from 0 (easy to perform an activity) to 10 (impossible to perform an activity). The overall score is the mean of the 10 items and ranges from 0 to 10 with higher score indicating more limitations.</description>

    <description>The ASAS HI measures functioning and health across 17 aspects of health in patients with AS, including pain, emotional functions, sleep, sexual function, mobility, self care, and community life. The ASAS HI consists of 17 questions, each answered by the participant as agree (1) or disagree (0). The responses to the 17 dichotomous items are summed up to give a total score ranging from 0 to 17, with a lower score indicating a better and a higher score indicating an inferior health status.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Month 3</time_frame>
    <description>The Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) assesses disease activity by asking the participant to answer 6 questions (each on an 11 point numeric rating scale [NRS]) pertaining to symptoms experienced for the past week. For 5 questions (level of fatigue/tiredness, level of AS neck, back or hip pain, level of pain/swelling in joints, other than neck, back or hips, level of discomfort from any areas tender to touch or pressure, and level of morning stiffness), the response is from 0 (none) to 10 (very severe); for Question 6 (duration of morning stiffness), the response is from 0 (0 hours) to 10 (≥ 2 hours). The overall BASDAI score ranges from 0 to 10 where lower scores indicate less disease activity.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>This study enrolled participants with axial spondyloarthritis (AS) at 7 study sites in Germany. Eligible participants were receiving treatment with adalimumab (HUMIRA®) based on therapist’s decision and local label requirements, must have had a response to adalimumab and have been eligible for active physiotherapy.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>An enrollment period of treatment initiation and response assessment for 3 to 5 months preceded Randomization. This study was terminated early due to slow enrollment. Up to study termination 17 patients met all inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria and were enrolled in the study. A total of 7 of these patients were randomized into the study.</pre_assignment_details>

          <description>BASMI measures the range of motion based on five clinical measurements: 1) cervical rotation, 2) tragus to wall distance, 3) lumbar side flexion, 4) lumbar flexion (modified Schober's) and 5) intermalleolar distance. The total score ranges from 0 to 10, reflecting mild to moderate disease activity and functional ability in the spinal column. The higher the BASMI score the more severe the patient’s limitation of movement due to their ankylosing spondylitis.</description>

        <description>The Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index (BASFI) is a validated index to determine the degree of functional limitation in patients with AS. BASFI consists of 10 questions assessing participants' ability to perform activities, each on a numeric rating scale (NRS) ranging from 0 (easy to perform an activity) to 10 (impossible to perform an activity). The overall score is the mean of the 10 items and ranges from 0 to 10 with higher score indicating more limitations.</description>

For 5 questions (level of fatigue/tiredness, level of AS neck, back or hip pain, level of pain/swelling in joints, other than neck, back or hips, level of discomfort from any areas tender to touch or pressure, and level of morning stiffness), the response is from 0 (none) to 10 (very severe); for Question 6 (duration of morning stiffness), the response is from 0 (0 hours) to 10 (≥ 2 hours). The overall BASDAI score ranges from 0 to 10 where lower scores indicate less disease activity.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Achieving an ASAS 40 Response</title>
        <description>ASAS40 response was defined as improvement of ≥ 40% relative to baseline and absolute improvement of ≥ 2 units (on a scale from 0 to 10) in ≥ 3 of the following 4 domains with no deterioration in the potential remaining domain:
Patient's global assessment of disease activity, measured on a numeric rating scale (NRS) from 0 (none) to 10 (severe);
Pain, measured by the total back pain NRS from 0 (no pain) to 10 (most severe);
Function, measured by the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index (BASFI) which consists of 10 items assessing participants' ability to perform activities on an NRS ranging from 0 (easy) to 10 (impossible);
Inflammation, measured by the mean of the 2 morning stiffness-related Bath AS Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) NRS scores (items 5 [level of stiffness] and 6 [duration of stiffness]) each on a scale from 0 (none/0 hours) to 10 (very severe/2 hours or more duration).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Fear-Avoidance Belief Questionnaire Score (FABQ)</title>
        <description>The FABQ measures patients' fear of pain and consequent avoidance of physical activity because of their fear. The questionnaire consists of 16 items in which a patient rates their agreement with each statement on a 7-point Likert scale, where 0 = completely disagree, 6 = completely agree. There is a maximum score of 96. A higher score indicates more strongly held fear avoidance beliefs.</description>
