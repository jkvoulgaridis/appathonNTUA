    <textblock>
      This study is going to apply neuropsychological battery tests to measure cognitive function
      across multiple cognitive domains in our cohort of 600 maintenance hemodialysis patients and
      evaluate:

        1. The presence and patterns of cognitive impairment in domains of executive function,
           perceptual-motor function, language, learning and memory, and complex attention;

        2. Clinical characteristics of participants with and without cognitive impairment;

        3. the risk factors which might be related to cognitive impairment in this group of
           population;

        4. The association between cognitive impairment and all-cause mortality, stroke and
           non-fatal cardiovascular events;

      We hypothesize that hemodialysis patient is going to have cognitive impairment which might be
      associated with some risk factors. We also anticipate that cognitive impairment might have
      some kind of association with the clinical outcomes like all-cause mortality, stroke and
      other common clinical outcomes that we mentioned above.

      Neuropsychological assessment All neuropsychological assessments were performed by the
      research staff that was centrally trained and certified by the study neuropsychologist to
      conduct the assessments before study commencement. All research staff and patients were
      native Chinese speakers. Neuropsychological assessment was conducted individually in a
      separate room on the day after a dialysis session and required on average approximately 90
      minutes. Global cognitive function was screened by the Chinese Beijing version of the
      Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA-BJ).10 The comprehensive battery of neuropsychological
      tests was designed to assess five cognitive domains: (1) attention/processing speed, using
      Symbol Digit Modalities Test and the Chinese modified version of the Trail Making Test
      A,11,12(2) executive function, using the Chinese modified version of the Trail Making Tests B
      , and a modified version of the Stroop Color-Word Test;13 (3) verbal memory, using the
      Chinese version of the Auditory Verbal Learning Test for short-delay and long-delay free
      recall14 and Complex Figure for visual memory (delayed recall test; Chinese version);12 (4)
      language, using the Chinese modified versions of Boston Naming Test (the 30-item version) and
      Animal Fluency Test;15,16and (5) visuospatial function, using the Rey-Osterrieth Complex
      Figure (copy test).17,18 Depression was assessed using the Hamilton Depression Scale, with
      scores ranging from 0 to 63 and a score of 7 or above suggested as the optimal cutoff for
      suspected depression.

    <description>The cognitive impairment classification algorithm We classified subjects as having no, mild, or major cognitive impairment using criteria from the fifth version of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-V) as a guideline.20 The age and/or education-adjusted raw score of each individual cognitive test was calculated and compared with the age and/or education-adjusted published norms for Chinese populations.14 Specifically, age- and education-adjusted scores less than 1.5 standard deviations (SDs) below the adjusted mean of the published population norms on all tests in all domains indicated no cognitive impairment; scores of 1.50 to 1.99 SDs and 2.0 or more SDs below the adjusted mean of the published norms on at least one test in at least one domain indicated mild cognitive impairment and major cognitive impairment, respectively</description>
