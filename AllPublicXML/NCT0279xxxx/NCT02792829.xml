  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted in adult healthy participants and will consist of two phases:
      Prerandomization and Randomization. The Prerandomization Phase will consist of 2 periods: a
      Screening Period and a Baseline Period. The Randomization Phase will consist of 2 Periods
      (each 6 days long) separated by a 1-day long Baseline Period and End of Treatment (EOT)
      Period. A total of 60 participants will be enrolled into one of three arms. Arms 1 and 3
      consist of 2 sequences, and Arm 2 consists of 4 sequences (as this is an incomplete block
      design with 2 factors [number of capsules and whether water or apple juice is used as
      vehicle]). Each participant will be randomized into one of 8 sequences.

    <description>Blood samples were collected during each Treatment Period at predose and at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 48, 72, 96, and 120 hours postdose. Plasma concentrations of lenvatinib were quantified by a high-performance liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method using a previously validated assay.

    <time_frame>From date of first dose of study treatment to date of last dose of study treatment, up to approximately 2 months 10 days</time_frame>
    <description>Safety assessment consisted on monitoring and recording all treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and SAEs; as well as laboratory evaluations for hematology, blood chemistry, and urine values; periodic measurement of vital signs, electrocardiograms (ECGs); and physical examinations. A TEAE was defined as an adverse events that: 1) emerged during treatment and up to 7 days from the last treatment, having been absent before treatment or at baseline, 2) reemerged during treatment, having been present at Baseline but stopped before treatment, or 3) worsened in severity during treatment relative to the state before treatment, when continuous.</description>

    <measure>Summary Scores for Palatability of Lenvatinib</measure>
    <time_frame>Treatment Period 1, Day 1 (Visit 2); Treatment Period 2, Day 8 (Visit 8)</time_frame>
    <description>A hedonic Visual Analog Scale (VAS) was used to assess taste likability or &quot;palatability&quot; between a) lenvatinib suspension formulated with water versus the capsule formulation, b) a lenvatinib suspension formulated with with apple juice versus one formulated with water, and c) a lenvatinib suspension formulated with water administered 23 hours versus 2 hours after preparation. All participants selected one face based on flavor, smell, sweetness, acidity, saltiness, bitterness, and texture or mouth feel for each formulation they consumed. Each face had an associated score (1: Very Bad (angry face), 2: Bad (sad face), 3: Maybe Good or Maybe Bad (neutral face), 4: Good (smiling face), 5: Very Good (laughing face)). The VAS hedonic scale scores were summarized using descriptive statistics separately for each arm by formulation (Arm 1), number of capsules (2 vs 5 capsules) and preparation type (water vs apple juice) (Arm 2), and time of administration relative to preparation (Arm 3).</description>

Plasma concentrations of lenvatinib were quantified by a high-performance liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method using a previously validated assay. The lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) was 0.25 ng/mL. Plasma pharmacokinetics (PK) data were analyzed using a non-compartmental analysis approach to obtain individual participant estimates of AUC(0-t), which were then summarized as the mean and standard deviation for all participants and expressed as hours·nanogram/milliliter (hr·ng/mL).</description>

        <population>The PK Analysis Set was the group of subjects who had sufficient PK data for at least 1 PK parameter to be derived. Subjects with predose lenvatinib concentration &gt;5% of their own Cmax, and subjects who experienced emesis at or before 2x median tmax were excluded from data analysis for bioavailability.</population>

Plasma concentrations of lenvatinib were quantified by a high-performance LC-MS/MS method using a previously validated assay. The LLOQ was 0.25 ng/mL. Plasma PK data were analyzed using a non-compartmental analysis approach to obtain individual participant estimates for the AUC(0-inf), which were then summarized as the mean and standard deviation for all participants and expressed as hr·ng/mL.</description>

          <title>Maximum Concentration (Cmax) of Lenvatinib in Plasma</title>
          <description>Blood samples were collected during each Treatment Period at predose and at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 48, 72, 96, and 120 hours postdose. Plasma concentrations of lenvatinib were quantified by a high-performance LC-MS/MS method using a previously validated assay. The LLOQ was 0.25 ng/mL. Plasma PK data were analyzed using a non-compartmental analysis approach to obtain individual participant estimates of Cmax, which were then summarized as the mean and standard deviation for all participants and expressed as nanograms/milliliter (ng/mL).</description>

Plasma concentrations of lenvatinib were quantified by a high-performance LC-MS/MS method using a previously validated assay. The LLOQ was 0.25 ng/mL. Plasma PK data were analyzed using a non-compartmental analysis approach to obtain individual participant estimates of t1/2, which were then summarized as the median and full range for all participants and expressed in hours.</description>

        <title>Summary Scores for Palatability of Lenvatinib</title>
        <description>A hedonic Visual Analog Scale (VAS) was used to assess taste likability or &quot;palatability&quot; between a) lenvatinib suspension formulated with water versus the capsule formulation, b) a lenvatinib suspension formulated with with apple juice versus one formulated with water, and c) a lenvatinib suspension formulated with water administered 23 hours versus 2 hours after preparation. All participants selected one face based on flavor, smell, sweetness, acidity, saltiness, bitterness, and texture or mouth feel for each formulation they consumed. Each face had an associated score (1: Very Bad (angry face), 2: Bad (sad face), 3: Maybe Good or Maybe Bad (neutral face), 4: Good (smiling face), 5: Very Good (laughing face)).

          <title>Summary Scores for Palatability of Lenvatinib</title>
          <description>A hedonic Visual Analog Scale (VAS) was used to assess taste likability or &quot;palatability&quot; between a) lenvatinib suspension formulated with water versus the capsule formulation, b) a lenvatinib suspension formulated with with apple juice versus one formulated with water, and c) a lenvatinib suspension formulated with water administered 23 hours versus 2 hours after preparation. All participants selected one face based on flavor, smell, sweetness, acidity, saltiness, bitterness, and texture or mouth feel for each formulation they consumed. Each face had an associated score (1: Very Bad (angry face), 2: Bad (sad face), 3: Maybe Good or Maybe Bad (neutral face), 4: Good (smiling face), 5: Very Good (laughing face)). The VAS hedonic scale scores were summarized using descriptive statistics separately for each arm by formulation (Arm 1), number of capsules (2 vs 5 capsules) and preparation type (water vs apple juice) (Arm 2), and time of administration relative to preparation (Arm 3).</description>
