      Analysis of freely circulating DNA in liquid biopsies using the BEAMing method

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Analysis of freely circulating DNA in liquid biopsies using the BEAMing method is proposed as
      a technique that may be useful for analysing the RAS mutation status in different types of
      cancer. However, first it is necessary to evaluate the concordance between the results
      obtained in tumour samples and liquid biopsies.

      Primary objective

      • To evaluate the RAS mutation status at baseline in liquid biopsies in subjects with RAS
      wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer.

      Secondary objectives

        -  To evaluate the appearance of new RAS mutations using liquid biopsies at the moment of
           disease progression.

        -  To evaluate the appearance of new RAS mutations using liquid biopsies prior to
           radiological documentation of disease progression.

    <description>To evaluate the RAS mutation status at baseline in liquid biopsies in two cohorts of subjects with RAS wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer: one analysed with the BEAMing (Sysmex-Inostics) technique (Cohort 1) and the other one analysed with the IdyllaTM (Biocartis) tests (Cohort 2).</description>

    <description>The blood samples will be collected according to the site's routine clinical practice usually prior to each treatment cycle and at the follow-up visits. Analysis of the RAS mutation status will be carried out on blood samples taken at baseline, on those carried out at 20 +/-2 weeks after the start of treatment (in any case, prior to the second tumour assessment) and on the sample obtained upon progression, coinciding with routine clinical practices for collecting blood. Blood Samples will be collected to all subjects participating (119 subjects.)Objective to evaluate the RAS mutation status at baseline in liquid biopsies in subjects with RAS wild type metastatic colorectal cancer.</description>

    <description>As in cohort 1 blood samples will be collected for all subjects participating (119) 10 ml will be used for analysis of the RAS mutation status. The mutation status of BRAF and EGFR will be also analysed with the IdyllaTM (Biocartis) tests in this Cohort 2. In 20 patients included in Cohort 2, 10 ml additional taken at baseline will be used in order to determine the RAS mutation status by the BEAMing technique and 10 ml additional taken at disease progression will be used to determine the mutational profile in genes other than RAS by a NGS technique.</description>
