    <textblock>
      The main objective of this trial is to investigate the effects of foot muscle strengthening
      in daily activity of patients with diabetic neuropathy.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A randomized controlled trial will be performed with 77 patients with diabetic neuropathy.
      The participants will be randomly assigned into either a control group (recommended foot care
      by international consensus with no exercises) or an intervention group which will receive
      12-week physical therapy exercises, twice a week, under the supervision of a physiotherapist,
      and twice a week being remotely supervised by a software at home. Every exercise has its own
      progression depending on the subjects' execution, increasing in intensity and difficulty.

      The subjects will be evaluated in 5 different moments (Baseline, 6 weeks, 12 weeks, 24 weeks
      and 1 year follow-up)

      The hypothesis of this study is that the intervention group will increase daily activity
      levels, increase self-selected and rapid walking speed, reduce the incidence of plantar
      ulcers, increase foot health and functionality, improve symptoms, increase tactile and
      vibration sensitivity, increased passive range of motion, improved quality of life, increased
      isometric strength of the feet and production of beneficial biomechanical changes during
      walking compared to the control group after 12 weeks of intervention and follow-up year.
