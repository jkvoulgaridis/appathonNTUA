      The purpose of this study is to determine whether corneal transplantation by Descemet
      Membrane Endothelial Keratoplasty more favourable and cost-effective is compared to Descemet
      Stripping Automated Endothelial Keratoplasty for Fuchs Endothelium Corneal Dystrophy.

      FECD is a progressive, multifactorial and irreversible disease characterized by accelerated
      loss of corneal endothelial cells in the innermost layer of the cornea that leads to vision
      impairment and potential blindness if left untreated. FECD is responsible for more than 50%
      of the 1.300 annual corneal transplantations in the Netherlands.

      Corneal transplantation improves vision and quality of life in patients with corneal disease.
      Currently, the standard of care for patients with Fuchs Endothelial Corneal Dystrophy (FECD)
      is Descemet Stripping Automated Endothelial Keratoplasty (DSAEK), in which only the posterior
      layers of the cornea are transplanted. However, visual recovery following DSAEK is
      suboptimal. Descemet Membrane Endothelial Keratoplasty (DMEK), the latest technique in
      corneal transplantation involves transplantation of only a monolayer of corneal endothelium
      and Descemet's membrane providing the thinnest endothelial graft possible. DMEK has been
      suggested to result in faster and better visual recovery compared to DSAEK. While the
      economic burden, both medical and social, from this disease has not been assessed to date,
      costs associated with corneal transplantation reach $ 110 million dollars yearly for the
      47.000 transplantations in the USA.

      The objective of this project is to assess the effects and costs of DMEK vs. DSAEK in order
      to determine whether the new technique is effective and cost-effective over the standard
      technique.

      The primary outcome measure is best-corrected visual acuity. Secondary outcome measures are
      contrast acuity, astigmatism, quality of vision, endothelial cell loss, incidence of graft
      rejection, primary graft failure, cornea donor loss due to preparation, and generic and
      vision-related quality of life.
