      Research question: Is lymphaticovenous anastomosis (LVA) for the treatment of breast
      cancer-related lymphedema of the arm (BCRL) more effective and cost-effective compared to
      standard conservative treatment? Hypothesis: LVA improves the health-related quality of life
      of patients who developed BCRL after breast cancer treatment and is cost-effective compared
      to conservative treatment. Study design: A multicenter randomised controlled trial (RCT)
      consisting of two treatment groups: conservative treatment (group A) and LVA (group B). The
      study is conducted in Maastricht University Medical Center, Radboud University Medical
      Center, Zuyderland Medical Center and Canisius-Wilhelmina Hospital. Study population: Women
      over 18 years old who underwent (axillary) treatment for breast cancer presenting with early
      stage lymphedema of the arm for which they received at least three months conservative
      treatment Intervention: LVA involves anastomosing lymphatic vessels to small veins to bypass
      obstructions in the lymphatic system.

      Usual care: Complex decongestive therapy (CDT) which includes skin care, manual lymphatic
      drainage, and compression therapy. Outcome measures: The primary outcome is health-related
      quality of life after 12 months follow-up measured with the Lymph-ICF questionnaire.
      Secondary outcomes are (in)direct costs, QALYs, cost-effectiveness ratio, the discontinuation
      rate of conservative treatment, and excess limb volume. Sample size: A total of 120 patients
      will be included and randomised in two groups of 60 patients each.

      Cost-effectiveness analysis: A trial-based economic evaluation is performed from the societal
      perspective to determine the cost-effectiveness, expressed in an incremental
      cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) (i.e. cost per QALY gained), of LVA compared to CDT. Direct
      and indirect cost data is collected on the patient-level. The difference in QALYs is assessed
      with the EQ-5D-5L questionnaire. A Budget Impact Analysis (BIA) will be performed to analyse
      the financial consequences related to implementing LVA. Time schedule: Patient inclusion will
      take maximally 21 months. With a follow-up of 24 months, the total study period will be 48
      months. The last three months are used for data analysis. Outcome assessment is at inclusion
      (before randomisation) and 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months later.

    <description>To assess the efficacy of the treatment on disease-related symptoms we will use the &quot;Lymphedema Functioning, Disability and Health&quot; (Lymph-ICF)&quot; questionnaire. This disease-specific questionnaire assesses the impairments in function, activity limitations, and participation restrictions of patients with arm lymphedema. This is a validated questionnaire, based on 5 domains with 29 questions. Each of the 29 questions corresponds to a score between 0-100. The total score on the Lymph-ICF is equal to the sum of the scores on the questions divided by the total number of answered questions. A higher score on the Lymph-ICF indicates more problems with functioning related to arm lymphedema.</description>

    <measure>Cost-effectiveness of LVA compared to complex decongestive therapy</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>A trial-based economic evaluation is performed to determine the cost-effectiveness of LVA compared to complex decongestive therapy from the societal perspective. Cost data is collected on the patient-level and includes health care related costs, costs to patient and family, and costs due to lost productivity. The primary outcome measure for the effects is the quality-adjusted life year (QALY). Cost-effectiveness is expressed in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) (i.e. cost per QALY gained). In addition, a Budget Impact Analysis (BIA) will be performed from a budget holder perspective.</description>

    <description>LVA is a minimally invasive procedure that can be performed under local anesthesia. Indocyanine green (ICG) lymphography is used to visualize the (obstructed) lymphatic vessels. When using the images as a guide, the lymphatic pathways and the sites for incisions for lymphaticovenous anastomoses are marked with a pen. The patient's limb is then prepared for surgery. Under a surgical microscope the lymphatic vessels are identified and viable lymphatic vessels are anastomosed to similarly sized adjacent recipient venules in the subdermal plane.</description>
