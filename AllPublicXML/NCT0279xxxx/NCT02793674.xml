  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      High-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) is a method of non-invasive respiratory support used to
      decrease the effort of breathing (EOB) in patients with a wide variety of respiratory
      diseases in the pediatric intensive care unit. While its use has shown association with
      decreased rates of mechanical ventilation, there is a paucity of data examining its direct
      effect upon objective measurements of EOB. This study will aim to evaluate objective
      measurements of EOB in response to different levels of HFNC support, characterize the natural
      course of respiratory diseases treated with HFNC, evaluate changes in EOB secondary to the
      administration of supplemental medical therapies used in conjunction with HFNC, and compare
      different physiologic metrics for quantifying EOB in patients on HFNC.

    <measure>Percent Change in Pressure-rate Product (PRP) as a Function of Increasing HFNC Flow Rate on Both Types of HFNC Delivery System (FP and VT)</measure>
    <time_frame>median percent change in PRP over 5 minute measurement period</time_frame>
    <description>PRP is a validated objective metric of effort of breathing which is derived from the product of the peak-to-trough change in esophageal pressure (in cmH20) and the respiratory rate (breaths per minute).
The percent change in PRP is derived from the quotient of the absolute PRP at increased HFNC flow rates (1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 L/kg/min) divided by the absolute PRP at a baseline HFNC flow rate (0.5 L/kg/min). Percent change in PRP was used because a) there was a large degree of heterogeneity in baseline absolute PRP values in our study population based upon patient size, disease severity, and time point of illness, and b) we allowed for repeated measures on the same patient which would bias absolute PRP values in favor of those who were measured more frequently.
It was not pre-specified to compare the two different HFNC delivery systems.</description>

    <measure>Pressure-rate Product (PRP) as a Function of Increasing HFNC Flow Rate on Both Types of HFNC Delivery System (FP and VT)</measure>
    <time_frame>median PRP over a 5 minute period</time_frame>
    <description>PRP is a validated objective metric of effort of breathing which is derived from the product of the peak-to-trough change in esophageal pressure (in cmH20) and the respiratory rate (breaths per minute). These values were obtained from 5 minute flow titration periods. For this outcome, the PRP was obtained for all titrations on both types of HFNC delivery system (FP and VT).

    <measure>Phase Angle as a Function of Increasing HFNC Flow Rate on Both Types of HFNC Delivery System (FP and VT)</measure>
    <time_frame>median phase angle over a 5 minute period</time_frame>
    <description>Phase angle is a measure of asynchrony between thoracic and abdominal breathing compartments that has correlated with increased effort of breathing. It is derived by measuring the relative expansion of these two breathing compartments and describing the synchrony between them as an angle (theta). For this outcome, the phase angle was obtained for all titrations on both types of HFNC delivery system (FP and VT).

    <measure>Percent Change in Pressure-rate Product (PRP) From Baseline as a Function of Increasing HFNC Flow Rate, Comparing Different HFNC Delivery Systems</measure>
    <time_frame>median PRP over a 5 minute period</time_frame>
    <description>For this outcome, a subgroup of patients (N=12) were examined who had PRP measurements obtained on two different HFNC delivery systems (Fisher &amp; Paykel (FP) and Vapotherm (VT)) in back-to-back flow titration periods. With one exception, patients were first studied on the FP and then transitioned to the VT HFNC delivery system.</description>

    <time_frame>medain percent change in PRP over a 5 minute period</time_frame>
    <description>To assess the relationship between patient size and dose-response of HFNC flow rate, we compared subgroups stratified by weight (patients &lt;8 kg and &gt;8 kg). For this outcome, the median percent change in PRP was obtained for all titrations on both types of HFNC delivery system (FP and VT).

    <description>Exploratory analysis of patients by further stratified weight groupings (&lt;5 kg, 5-8 kg, and &gt;8 kg) was performed to determine the greatest observed benefit of HFNC flow titration in patients of different sizes. For this outcome, the maximum percent change in PRP was obtained for all titrations on both types of HFNC delivery system (FP and VT).

          <title>Fisher &amp; Paykel (FP) HFNC</title>
          <description>A subgroup was studied on Fisher &amp; Paykel (FP) high flow nasal cannula (HFNC) exclusively (N=9). The flow rate of the HFNC was adjusted to determine if there existed a change in their effort of breathing (EOB) at different conditions.
Measurements of effort of breathing was obtained at flow rates of 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 L/kg/min. Adequate time was allowed at each flow rate for stabilization of EOB and flow levels were trialed in a random order, each for approximately 5 minutes.</description>

          <description>A subgroup was studied on Vapotherm (VT) high flow nasal cannula (HFNC) (N=12). These patients then crossed over to the other arm and had back-to-back titrations on both types of HFNC (FP and VT). The flow rate of the HFNC was adjusted to determine if there existed a change in their effort of breathing (EOB) at different conditions.
Measurements of effort of breathing was obtained at flow rates of 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 L/kg/min. Adequate time was allowed at each flow rate for stabilization of EOB and flow levels were trialed in a random order, each for approximately 5 minutes.</description>

        <title>Percent Change in Pressure-rate Product (PRP) as a Function of Increasing HFNC Flow Rate on Both Types of HFNC Delivery System (FP and VT)</title>
        <description>PRP is a validated objective metric of effort of breathing which is derived from the product of the peak-to-trough change in esophageal pressure (in cmH20) and the respiratory rate (breaths per minute).
The percent change in PRP is derived from the quotient of the absolute PRP at increased HFNC flow rates (1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 L/kg/min) divided by the absolute PRP at a baseline HFNC flow rate (0.5 L/kg/min). Percent change in PRP was used because a) there was a large degree of heterogeneity in baseline absolute PRP values in our study population based upon patient size, disease severity, and time point of illness, and b) we allowed for repeated measures on the same patient which would bias absolute PRP values in favor of those who were measured more frequently.
It was not pre-specified to compare the two different HFNC delivery systems.</description>

The flow rate of the HFNC was adjusted to determine if there existed a change in their effort of breathing (EOB) at different conditions.
Measurements of effort of breathing was obtained at flow rates of 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 L/kg/min. Adequate time was allowed at each flow rate for stabilization of EOB and flow levels were trialed in a random order, each for approximately 5 minutes.</description>

        <title>Phase Angle as a Function of Increasing HFNC Flow Rate on Both Types of HFNC Delivery System (FP and VT)</title>
        <description>Phase angle is a measure of asynchrony between thoracic and abdominal breathing compartments that has correlated with increased effort of breathing. It is derived by measuring the relative expansion of these two breathing compartments and describing the synchrony between them as an angle (theta). For this outcome, the phase angle was obtained for all titrations on both types of HFNC delivery system (FP and VT).
It was not pre-specified to compare the two different HFNC delivery systems.</description>
