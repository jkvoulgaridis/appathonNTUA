  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety, infectivity, and immunogenicity of a
      single dose of a recombinant live-attenuated respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine in
      RSV-seronegative infants 6 to 24 months of age.

      This study was a companion study to CIR 311.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most common viral cause of serious acute lower
      respiratory illness in infants and children under 5 years of age worldwide. This study
      evaluated the safety, infectivity, and immunogenicity of a single dose of a recombinant
      live-attenuated RSV vaccine, RSV LID ΔM2-2 1030s, in RSV-seronegative infants 6 to 24 months
      of age.

      Participants were randomly assigned to receive a single dose of the RSV LID ΔM2-2 1030s
      vaccine or placebo (administered as nose drops) at study entry (Day 0).

      Participants could be enrolled in the study between April 1 and October 14 (outside of RSV
      season) and remained on study until they completed the post-RSV season visit between April 1
      and April 30 in the calendar year following enrollment. Participants' total study duration
      was between 6 to 10 months, depending on when they enrolled in the study. Participants
      attended several study visits throughout the study, which included blood collection, nasal
      washes, and/or physical examinations. Participants' parents or guardians were contacted by
      study staff at various times during the study to monitor participants' health.

    <measure>Number of Participants With Solicited Adverse Events (AEs) by Grade</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured from Day 0 through Day 28</time_frame>
    <description>Solicited adverse events included fever; otitis media; upper respiratory illness (URI); lower respiratory illness (LRI) and cough (without LRI). The number of participants who experienced solicited adverse events was presented. A participant was only counted once in each solicited AE category, and that is in the line corresponding to the highest grade adverse event they had in that category. These events were graded (Grade 1-mild to Grade 4-life-threatening) following protocol-defined grading system outlined in Table 4 and Table 5 in the protocol document.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Unsolicited AEs by Grade</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured from Day 0 through Day 28</time_frame>
    <description>Unsolicited adverse events were other events, not included in the solicited AEs. The number of participants who experienced solicited adverse events was presented. A participant was only counted once in each unsolicited AE category, and that is in the line corresponding to the highest grade adverse event they had in that category. AE grading (Grade 1- mild to Grade 4-life-threatening) was done by DAIDS AE Grading table v2.0 (see References).</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured from Day 0 through Day 56</time_frame>
    <description>A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is an AE, whether considered related to the study product or not, that:
Results in death during the period of protocol-defined surveillance
Is life threatening: defined as an event in which the patient was at immediate risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event that hypothetically might have caused death were it more severe
Requires inpatient hospitalization (or prolongation of existing hospitalization): defined as at least an overnight stay in the hospital or emergency ward for treatment that would have been inappropriate if administered in the outpatient setting
Results in a persistent or significant disability/incapacity
Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect
Is an important medical event that may not be immediately life threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the patient or may require intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Solicited Adverse Events (AEs) by Grade</title>
        <description>Solicited adverse events included fever; otitis media; upper respiratory illness (URI); lower respiratory illness (LRI) and cough (without LRI). The number of participants who experienced solicited adverse events was presented. A participant was only counted once in each solicited AE category, and that is in the line corresponding to the highest grade adverse event they had in that category. These events were graded (Grade 1-mild to Grade 4-life-threatening) following protocol-defined grading system outlined in Table 4 and Table 5 in the protocol document.</description>

        <description>Unsolicited adverse events were other events, not included in the solicited AEs. The number of participants who experienced solicited adverse events was presented. A participant was only counted once in each unsolicited AE category, and that is in the line corresponding to the highest grade adverse event they had in that category. AE grading (Grade 1- mild to Grade 4-life-threatening) was done by DAIDS AE Grading table v2.0 (see References).</description>

        <description>A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is an AE, whether considered related to the study product or not, that:
Results in death during the period of protocol-defined surveillance
Is life threatening: defined as an event in which the patient was at immediate risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event that hypothetically might have caused death were it more severe
Requires inpatient hospitalization (or prolongation of existing hospitalization): defined as at least an overnight stay in the hospital or emergency ward for treatment that would have been inappropriate if administered in the outpatient setting
Results in a persistent or significant disability/incapacity
Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect
Is an important medical event that may not be immediately life threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the patient or may require intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants Who Had Symptomatic, Medically Attended Respiratory and Febrile Illness, by Grade, Among Those Who Experienced Natural Infection With wt RSV During the Subsequent RSV Season</title>
        <description>The number of participants who had symptomatic, medically attended respiratory and febrile illness among those who had RSV detected in nasal washes or greater than or equal to 4 fold rise in serum antibodies during the subsequent RSV season were presented. A participant was only counted once in each solicited AE category, and that was in the line corresponding to the highest grade adverse event they had in that category. These events were graded (Grade 1-mild to Grade 4-life-threatening) following protocol-defined grading system outlined in Table 4 and Table 5 in the protocol document.</description>
