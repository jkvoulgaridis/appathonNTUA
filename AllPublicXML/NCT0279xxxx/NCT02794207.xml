  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objectives of this study are to identify what outcomes related to the management
      of neutropenia are most important to children with AML and their caregivers. Patients who
      have completed treatment for AML and their caregivers will be interviewed in order to better
      understand the impact of neutropenia management on children with AML and their families. The
      primary outcome of these interviews is to identify patient-centered outcomes related to
      neutropenia management to include in a subsequent comparative-effectiveness analysis.
      Investigators will use these data to develop a structured survey for administration to
      prospectively identified patients in subsequent studies.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Treatment for pediatric acute myeloid leukemia (AML) involves intensive chemotherapy regimens
      that result in periods of profound neutropenia leaving patients susceptible to severe
      infectious complications. There are little clinical data to inform whether management of
      neutropenia post AML chemotherapy should occur in an outpatient or inpatient setting.
      Further, no studies have been conducted that assess the impact of neutropenia management
      strategy on the quality of life of pediatric patients with AML. Given that infectious
      complications are the leading cause of treatment related mortality among AML patients, it is
      important to identify the neutropenia management strategy that will lead to the best
      clinician- and patient- identified outcomes in order to improve the care of these patients.

      This is a qualitative interview study where interviews of patients and/or caregivers will be
      performed. Participants will be patients less than 19 years of age at diagnosis (and their
      caregivers) receiving or having received chemotherapy for AML from eleven participating
      pediatric hospitals across the United States. Participants (children and caregivers) will be
      interviewed in an effort to develop a survey that captures patient- and caregiver- identified
      outcomes related to neutropenia management.

    <description>One qualitative, semi-structured interview will be conducted. Each interview will last approximately 30-45 minutes and may be audio recorded (if consent is provided). Interviews will consist of several open-ended questions focusing on having the participant reflect upon past experiences with neutropenia management and the impact of the participant's illness and treatment. Several close-ended questions regarding participant's thoughts on potential outcomes will also be included.</description>

      <time_frame>Adverse events were not collected while interviews were being conducted. Interviews were conducted when a patient was within 6-12 months of the completion of their second course of chemotherapy or up to 3 years out following the completion of all their frontline AML chemotherapy. The time relative to treatment, therefore, varied by family.</time_frame>
      <desc>There is no study intervention; this is a qualitative interview study only, thus adverse events were a non-issue and not monitored or assessed.</desc>
