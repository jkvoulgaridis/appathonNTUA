      The primary aim is to determine the accuracy of CAP in the quantification of liver steatosis
      using liver biopsies as reference. Secondarily, investigators will correlate transient
      elastography (TE) and CAP results, analyze possible associations between CAP/TE and
      post-liver transplant (LT) clinical outcomes, and evaluate the change in CAP after LT. The
      study aims to include as many donors as needed to achieve 120 transplanted liver allografts.

      This is a coordinated study utilizing 3 recruitment centers (University of Arkansas for
      Medical Sciences [UAMS], Stanford University, and Mayo Clinic) 2 liver pathology reading
      centers (University of Michigan and Mayo Clinic), and 1 coordinating center (University of
      Arkansas). The cohort study with a cross-sectional component for the primary aim has been
      completed (through independent Institutional Review Board [IRB] agreements) at UAMS, Stanford
      University, and the Mayo Clinic. The samples collected at the three recruitment centers will
      be sent to the biopsy center at the University of Michigan and Mayo Clinic for evaluation.
      The Liver Transplant Program at each of the 3 recruiting centers will identify study subjects
      during the process of liver allocation to their listed recipients. Criteria for recruitment
      are as follows:

      Inclusion criteria - Liver Recipient

        -  Men and women, Age 18-years old to 80-years old inclusive Inclusion criteria - Liver
           Donor

        -  Valid TE with Fibroscan 530, defined as:

             -  At least 10 valid measurements

             -  Interquartile Range (IQR)/Median stiffness value &lt;30% (only in cases with &gt;7.1 kPa)
                Exclusion criteria - Liver Recipient

        -  Patient did not undergo liver transplantation Exclusion criteria - Liver Donor

        -  Donation after circulatory death (DCD)

        -  No liver biopsy obtained during organ procurement process
