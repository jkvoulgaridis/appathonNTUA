  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to assess the effect of umeclidinium/vilanterol
      (UMEC/VI) versus tiotropium/olodaterol (TIO/OLO) in subjects with moderated COPD.

      This is a multicentre, randomized, open label, 2 period crossover complete block design
      study.

      Eligible subjects, who complete a 2-week run-in period, will be randomized to receive a
      sequence consisting of UMEC/VI inhalation powder (62.5/25 microgram [mcg] once-daily [QD])
      administered as 1 inhalation via the ELLIPTA® Inhaler and TIO/OLO 5/5 mcg inhalation spray
      administered as 2 inhalations via the RESPIMAT® inhaler, for 8 weeks each. This will be
      followed by a 3-week washout period and one-week follow-up period. The total duration of
      subject participation in the study will be approximately 22 weeks.

    <description>FEV1 is a measure of lung function and is defined as the maximal amount of air that can be forcefully exhaled in one second. Trough FEV1 was defined as 23 and 24 hour post-dose FEV1 measurements. All par. in the Intent To Treat (ITT) Population who were not identified as full protocol deviators were included in Per-Protocol (PP) Population.

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>This is a multicenter, randomized, open label, 2 period crossover complete block design study. Participants (par.) with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) were enrolled across 4 countries: Germany, Spain, the United Kingdom and the United States.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Study consisted of a run-in period of approximately 2 weeks followed by two 8-week treatment periods with a washout of approximately 3 weeks. The total duration of the study was approximately 22 weeks including follow-up. A total of 443 par. were screened, of which 236 par. were randomized (207 par. were pre-screen, screen and run-in failures).</pre_assignment_details>

It was followed by a washout period of 3 weeks. Par. received Tiotropium/Olodaterol (TIO/OLO) 5/5 mcg inhalation spray as 2 inhalations of 2.5/2.5 mcg each via the RESPIMAT® inhaler for 8 weeks in TP2.

        <title>Trough Forced Expiratory Volume in One Second (FEV1) at Week 8</title>
        <description>FEV1 is a measure of lung function and is defined as the maximal amount of air that can be forcefully exhaled in one second. Trough FEV1 was defined as 23 and 24 hour post-dose FEV1 measurements. All par. in the Intent To Treat (ITT) Population who were not identified as full protocol deviators were included in Per-Protocol (PP) Population. ITT Population, comprised of all randomized subjects, who received at least one dose of study medication.</description>
