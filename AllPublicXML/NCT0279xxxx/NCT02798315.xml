  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The interferon-free combination regimen of paritaprevir/r - ombitasvir with or without
      dasabuvir (ABBVIE REGIMEN) ± ribavirin (RBV) for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C (CHC)
      has been shown to be safe and effective in randomized controlled clinical trials with strict
      inclusion and exclusion criteria under well controlled conditions.

      This observational study is the first effectiveness research examining the ABBVIE REGIMEN ±
      RBV, used according to local label, under real world conditions in Kuwait in a clinical
      practice patient population.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in the PAM-13 Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 48 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The PAM-13 item scale is a measure used to assess the patient knowledge, skill, and confidence for self-management. Each of the 13 items can be answered with one of four possible response options, which are &quot;disagree strongly&quot; (1), &quot;disagree&quot; (2), &quot;agree&quot; (3), &quot;agree strongly&quot; (4). Based on responses to the 13-item measure, the score is calculated by adding up the raw scores (range of the sum: 13 - 52) and mapping up the value onto a scale of 0-100 indicating strength of agreement with the 13 items. A higher score indicates that the patient is likely to participate more actively in health care processes and takes more responsibility for his or her health.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the PAM-13 Questionnaire</title>
        <description>The PAM-13 item scale is a measure used to assess the patient knowledge, skill, and confidence for self-management. Each of the 13 items can be answered with one of four possible response options, which are &quot;disagree strongly&quot; (1), &quot;disagree&quot; (2), &quot;agree&quot; (3), &quot;agree strongly&quot; (4). Based on responses to the 13-item measure, the score is calculated by adding up the raw scores (range of the sum: 13 - 52) and mapping up the value onto a scale of 0-100 indicating strength of agreement with the 13 items. A higher score indicates that the patient is likely to participate more actively in health care processes and takes more responsibility for his or her health.</description>
