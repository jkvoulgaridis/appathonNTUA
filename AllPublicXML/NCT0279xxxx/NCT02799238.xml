    <textblock>
      This is a randomised, open-label, multi-centre, Phase II study in patients with newly
      diagnosed glioblastoma.

      62 patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma are enrolled in the study in a 1:2 allocation
      (standard of care (SOC): ALECSAT as an adjunct therapy to SOC).

      Patients recruited into this study will receive either:

        -  ALECSAT as an adjunct therapy to standard of care for newly diagnosed glioblastoma
           (first line therapy: Stupp regimen, followed by second line therapy at the
           Investigator's discretion) or

        -  Standard of care therapy for newly diagnosed glioblastoma (first line therapy: Stupp
           regimen, followed by second line therapy at the Investigator's discretion).
