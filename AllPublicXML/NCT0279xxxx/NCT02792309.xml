      Mathematica was awarded a contract by ACF to conduct the evaluation of selected grantees
      offering Healthy Marriage and Relationship Education Programs.This particular evaluation will
      focus on the University of Denver's MotherWise program, which offers relationship education
      and other supports to low-income women expecting a baby. The program has three core
      components: (1) 18 hours of core workshop sessions using the Within My Reach relationship
      education curriculum supplemented with content on mother-infant relationships; (2) case
      management services; and (3) optional relationship education workshops for couples. The
      evaluation will test the effect of this full package of services on mothers' relationship
      outcomes, as well as other outcomes related to child well-being, such as co-parenting and
      father involvement.

      The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Administration for Children and
      Families (ACF), is conducting an evaluation of healthy marriage and relationship education
      (HMRE) programs. Mathematica was awarded a contract by ACF to conduct the evaluation of
      selected programs/grantees.This segment of the larger evaluation will focus on the University
      of Denver's MotherWise program.

      The Mother Wise program will offer relationship education and other supports to low-income
      women expecting a baby. The program will have three core components: (1) 18 hours of core
      workshop sessions using the Within My Reach relationship education curriculum supplemented
      with content on mother-infant relationships; (2) case management services; and (3) optional
      relationship education workshops for couples. The evaluation will test the effect of this
      full package of services on mothers' relationship outcomes, as well as other outcomes related
      to child well-being, such as co-parenting and father involvement. If feasible, the evaluation
      will also examine some measures available through hospital records, such as birth weight.

      Mother Wise will enroll women who are expecting a baby and those who have had a baby within
      the past month.

      Control group members will not be eligible for Mother Wise but will be eligible for other
      services available in the community.

      To document the outcomes of study participants, survey data will be collected at two time
      points: (1) a baseline survey administered at study enrollment, a (2) a 12-month follow-up
      survey, and (3) a 30-month follow-up survey. Surveys will be conducted by staff at
      Mathematica's Survey Operations Center using computer-assisted telephone interviewing (CATI).
      Survey data may be supplemented with administrative records data from the Denver Health
      system.
