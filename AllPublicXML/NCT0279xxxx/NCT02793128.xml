  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is investigating the ability of UroGen's MitoGel™ procedure to treat urothelial
      carcinoma tumors from the upper urinary tract. If this treatment will prove to be effective
      this will lead to the development of a new treatment approach for patients suffering from Low
      Grade Upper Urinary Urothelial Carcinoma (UTUC).

      Trial TC-UT-03 is a prospective, open label, single-arm trial, designed to assess the
      efficacy, safety, and tolerability of treatment with MitoGel™ instilled in the upper urinary
      system of patients with non-invasive low-grade (LG), UTUC.

      Upon signing of informed consent, the patients will undergo a screening visit for eligibility
      evaluation. Eligible patients will be treated with MitoGel™ once weekly for a total of 6
      times; in a retrograde fashion. Patients who will demonstrate CR will be treated with
      MitoGel™ once monthly as a maintenance therapy for a total of 11 instillations or up to the
      first recurrence whichever comes first.

      Five (5) weeks (± 1 w) following the last instillation, the PDE Visit, during which safety
      and efficacy will be assessed, will take place. During this visit, the ablative effect of the
      MitoGel™ will be assessed visually, by upper tract washed urine cytology, and if there are
      remaining tumors, by biopsy or brush biopsy if technically feasible.

      Patient demonstrating CR at PDE will undergo monthly maintenance instillations of MitoGel™ up
      to 11 months post PDE. Safety follow-up for these patients will be done until one month post
      last instillation or at the end of the follow-up period in FU visit 12, which is the earlier.

      For patients who did not demonstrate Complete Response, to the extent that it is possible,
      all remaining tumors lesions will be biopsied. The patients shall undergo any additional
      surgical or other treatment the PI decides deem necessary to remove remaining tumor.

      An independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) was assigned to this trial. Accumulating
      safety, tolerability and efficacy data will be monitored periodically by the DMC according to
      a pre-specified process and frequency detailed in the DMC charter.
