  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial is designed to evaluate, in adult participants with Type 2 diabetes mellitus
      (T2DM) and inadequate glycemic control on sub-maximal metformin mono-therapy (1000 mg/day),
      the effect of up-titration of metformin plus the addition of sitagliptin compared to
      up-titration of metformin alone on glycemic control. The primary hypothesis of this study is
      that up-titration of metformin to 2000 mg/day (1000 mg/twice a day) plus the addition of
      sitagliptin 100 mg/day provides greater reduction in hemoglobin A1C (A1C) compared to
      metformin up-titration alone. Another primary objective of this study is to evaluate the
      safety and tolerability of this treatment.

    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 20</time_frame>
    <description>Hemoglobin A1C is a blood marker used to report average blood glucose levels over prolonged periods of time. Percentage A1C is the ratio of glycated hemoglobin to total hemoglobin x 100. The change from baseline represents the Week 20 A1C value minus the Week 0 (baseline) A1C value.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Who Experienced at Least One Adverse Event (AE)</measure>

    <description>An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a study participant administered a pharmaceutical product that does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not related to the medicinal product.</description>

          <description>An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a study participant administered a pharmaceutical product that does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not related to the medicinal product.</description>
