      TRACR will provide a data/biospecimen repository for translational research to better
      diagnose, prognose, treat and cure breast cancer (and related diseases/treatment conditions).
      Patients at the Rowan Breast Center will be consented for donation of blood and if available
      tumor/healthy/archived tissue. Patients will be consented to give permission to use said
      specimens for future research and to be contacted in the future about other research
      participation and additional information.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  RBC patients with known invasive cancer pre-surgery (greater or equal to 1.5cm) are
             given priority in recruitment.

          -  RBC patients with known invasive cancer pre-surgery (less then 1.5cm). 3. RBC patients
             who are postsurgery for invasive breast cancer (performed at UPHS or non-UPHS
             entities).

          -  Patients that are of high risk for breast cancer (family history, known deleterious
             genetic mutation(s)) seeking a prophylactic mastectomy at the breast clinic.

          -  Only persons who can understand and give informed consent will be eligible to
             participate in this study. Furthermore, no persons belonging to vulnerable populations
             with as children (below 18 years of age), fetuses, neonates or prisoners will be
             recruited in this study. Pregnant women, who are pre-surgery and having surgery for
             clinical reasons, can still be recruited for tissue and blood collection.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Individual who cannot understand and give informed consent (cognitively impaired
             persons)

          -  Children (below 18 years of age), fetuses and neonates

          -  Prisoners
