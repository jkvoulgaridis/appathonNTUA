  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the long-term persistence of immunity to hepatitis B
      in adolescents aged 14-15 years who were vaccinated with four doses of Infanrix™-Hexa in the
      first two years of life and to assess the anamnestic response, immunogenicity, safety and
      reactogenicity of a single challenge dose of the hepatitis B vaccine Engerix™-B Kinder.

          -  Subjects' parent(s)/Legally Acceptable Representative(s) [LAR(s)] who, in the opinion
             of the investigator, can and will comply with the requirements of the protocol.

          -  Written informed consent obtained from the parent(s)/LAR(s) of the subject prior to
             performance of any study specific procedure.

          -  In addition to the informed consent that will be signed by the parents/LAR(s), written
             informed assent of the subject will be sought.

          -  A male or female between the ages of 14 to 15 at the time of vaccination.

          -  Healthy subjects as established by medical history and clinical examination before
             entering into the study.

          -  Subjects with documented evidence of previous vaccination with four consecutive doses
             of Infanrix hexa as part of routine vaccination in Germany: three doses of primary
             vaccination received by 9 months of age and one booster dose received between 11 and
             18 months of age.

          -  Female subjects of non-childbearing potential may be enrolled in the study.
