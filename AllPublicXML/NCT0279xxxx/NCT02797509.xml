  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current study has the following objectives:

        1. To determine additional stroke patient (SP) and stroke caregiver (SC) factors including
           their perceptions of the stroke experience, hospitalization, and how they cope with its
           challenges; identify additional appropriate points to intervene (maladaptive coping
           styles, unrealistic expectations, inappropriate prioritization, misinformation about
           illness, and self care), and assess SP and SC preferences for the structure, mode of
           delivery (including potential for phone, video or a combination of these) and timing of
           an intervention.

        2. To develop, [using the preliminary data and information from aim 1], and test the
           feasibility and acceptability (primary outcomes) of a skills-based intervention for
           preventing chronic depression, anxiety, PTSD and decreased QoL in dyads at risk.

    <description>Based on information from Phase I (semi-structured interviews), the investigators will develop a detailed psychosocial intervention manual. The intervention will be tailored consistent with American Heart Association (AHA) recommendations for stroke skills based interventions and will include 2 general and 4 specific modules (selected from 7 available). Generally, in the intervention, stroke patients and stroke caregivers will learn skills to cope and manage stroke-related stressors. It is anticipated that the intervention will have 6 sessions with 2 general sessions delivered within the NICU face to face and 4 tailored specific sessions to be delivered via live video using Vidyo. Participants in the intervention group will also receive treatment as usual.</description>

    <description>Those in the MEUC will continue with their current care. This may include meeting with nurses, physical therapist, medical doctors, and other members of the stroke patient's medical team. Treatment as usual may also involve administration of Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) to those patients with motor problems. They will also received a pamphlet with educational information on stroke and recovery</description>
