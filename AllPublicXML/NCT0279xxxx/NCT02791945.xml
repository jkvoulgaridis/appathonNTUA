      The goal of the project is to improve the care of Veterans with mild traumatic brain injury
      (mTBI) and unhealthy alcohol use.

    <textblock>
      This is a pilot controlled clinical trial that aims to assess the efficacy of
      N-acetylcysteine (NAC) to reduce alcohol use and improve brain injury symptoms in Veterans
      with mTBI who consume alcohol at hazardous or harmful levels.
