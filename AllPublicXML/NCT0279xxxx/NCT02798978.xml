  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is an ascending dose first-time-in-human study to determine the safety,
      tolerability, pharmacodynamic (PD), and pharmacokinetics (PK) profile of GSK1795091 in
      healthy subjects. The results will support the design of future clinical trials of GSK1795091
      administered to subjects with advanced malignancies in combination with immune system
      modulators.

      Part 1 will be a randomized, double-blind (sponsor-unblinded), placebo-controlled, single
      center, single dose escalation, sequential group evaluation of intravenously administered
      GSK1795091 to evaluate the safety and tolerability in healthy subjects. Part 2 will be an
      open-label, parallel group evaluation of 2 doses of GSK1795091 administered, either 1 week
      apart (Part 2, Cohort 1) or 2 weeks apart (Part 2, Cohort 2). In Part 2, on Day 1, subjects
      will receive intravenous GSK1795091 at a dose determined by results from Part 1. The total
      duration of this study is approximately 10 weeks from screening to the last study visit.

        <title>Number of Participants With Hematology Parameters Outside Reference Range Part 1</title>
        <description>Hematology parameters included hemoglobin (HGB), hematocrit (HCT), Red Blood Cell (RBC) count, White Blood Cell (WBC) count with differential (neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, basophils), platelet count, mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC). Reference range for basophil was 0.01 - 0.07*10^9/Liters (L), eosinophils 0.03 - 0.5*10^9/L, HCT 0.38 - 0.48 proportion of RBC in blood, HGB 126 - 165*gram (g)/L, lymphocytes 1.08 - 3*10^9/L, MCH 26.3 - 32.8*picogram (pg), MCHC 324 - 359*g/L, MCV 77 - 94.9*femtoliter (fL), monocytes 0.3 - 0.92*10^9/L, neutrophils 1.46 - 5.85*10^9/L, platelets 155 - 342*10^9/L, erythrocytes 4.12 - 5.74*10^12/L, leukocytes 3.19 - 8.71*10^9/L. Values below these ranges were considered as low and above these ranges were considered as high (H). Data for participants from any visit post-screening with values &gt; reference range high and &lt; reference range low are report.</description>

          <title>Percentage Fold Change of Concentration of Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF)-Alpha From Baseline for Part 1</title>
          <description>Blood samples were collected at indicated time points for the assessment of TNF-alpha. Baseline (Day 1) was taken as the mean of the planned pre-dose measurements. Change from Baseline was defined as difference between the post-Baseline visit value and the Baseline value. Percentage fold change equals to 100*change from Baseline divided by Baseline. Data from multiplex immunoassay has been reported. Only those participants with data available at the specified data points were analyzed (represented by n=X in category titles).</description>

        <title>Percentage Fold Change of Concentration of Interferon (IFN)-Gamma From Baseline for Part 1</title>
        <description>Blood samples were collected at indicated time points for the assessment of IFN-gamma. Baseline (Day 1) was taken as the mean of the planned pre-dose measurements. Change from Baseline was defined as difference between the post-Baseline visit value and the Baseline value. Percentage fold change equals to 100*change from Baseline divided by Baseline. Data from multiplex immunoassay has been reported. Only those participants with data available at the specified data points were analyzed (represented by n=X in category titles).</description>

        <description>Blood samples were collected at indicated time points for the assessment of MCP-1. Baseline (Day 1) was taken as the mean of the planned pre-dose measurements. Change from Baseline was defined as difference between the post-Baseline visit value and the Baseline value.

          <title>Change From Baseline in WBC Differential for Part 1</title>
          <description>WBC differential included Lymphocytes Count, Monocytes Count, Granulocytes Count including neutrophils and eosinophil. Baseline (Day 1) was taken as the mean of the planned pre-dose measurements. Change from Baseline was defined as difference between the post-Baseline visit value and the Baseline value. Only those participants with data available at the specified data points were analyzed (represented by n=X in category titles).</description>
