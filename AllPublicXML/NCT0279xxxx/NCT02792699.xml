  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial is designed to determine what effects the human body has on the investigational
      medicine, ABP 798, and what effects the body has on the investigational medicine after you
      have been given it, and if this is comparable to what is seen for the licensed medicine,
      rituximab, in patients with moderate or severe RA.

      This study will also assess if the investigational medicine is safe and effective in treating
      moderate or severe RA compared to the licensed medicine.

    <measure>Hybrid ACR</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and weeks 8, 12, 24, 40, and 48</time_frame>
    <description>The hybrid ACR combines the ACR 20/50/70 response with the mean percent change in all 7 ACR core components, thus providing a percent improvement from baseline on a continuous scale. For each participant, the mean percent improvement from baseline across the 7 ACR core set measures (tender joint count, swollen joint count, Patient's Global Assessment of Disease Activity, Investigator's Global Assessment of Disease Activity, disability index of the HAQ, and CRP) was calculated (a positive change indicates improvement, and the maximum worst change is limited to -100%) and the ACR20, ACR50, and ACR70 response is determined. The hybrid ACR is determined from a reference table taking into account both ACR response and mean percent improvement in the core set measures. Scores can range from -100% (maximal worsening) to 100% (maximal improvement).</description>

    <ipd_time_frame>Data sharing requests relating to this study will be considered beginning 18 months after the study has ended and either 1) the product and indication (or other new use) have been granted marketing authorization in both the US and Europe or 2) clinical development for the product and/or indication discontinues and the data will not be submitted to regulatory authorities. There is no end date for eligibility to submit a data sharing request for this study.</ipd_time_frame>
    <ipd_access_criteria>Qualified researchers may submit a request containing the research objectives, the Amgen product(s) and Amgen study/studies in scope, endpoints/outcomes of interest, statistical analysis plan, data requirements, publication plan, and qualifications of the researcher(s). In general, Amgen does not grant external requests for individual patient data for the purpose of re-evaluating safety and efficacy issues already addressed in the product labelling. Requests are reviewed by a committee of internal advisors, and if not approved, may be further arbitrated by a Data Sharing Independent Review Panel. Upon approval, information necessary to address the research question will be provided under the terms of a data sharing agreement. This may include anonymized individual patient data and/or available supporting documents, containing fragments of analysis code where provided in analysis specifications.

          <title>Disease Activity Score 28 – C-Reactive Protein (DAS28[CRP])</title>
          <description>DAS28 measures the severity of disease at a specific time and is derived from the following variables:
28 tender joint count
28 swollen joint count
C-reactive protein (CRP)
Patient's global health assessment measured on a 100 mm visual analog scale. DAS28(CRP) scores range from 0 to approximately 10, with the upper bound dependent on the highest possible level of CRP. A DAS28 score higher than 5.1 indicates high disease activity, a DAS28 score less than 3.2 indicates low disease activity, and a DAS28 score less than 2.6 indicates clinical remission.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Disease Activity Score 28-CRP at Week 24</title>
        <description>The DAS28 measures the severity of disease at a specific time and is derived from the following variables:
28 tender joint count
28 swollen joint count
C-reactive protein (CRP)
Patient's global health assessment measured on a 100 mm VAS, where 0 mm = no RA activity and 100 mm = worst RA activity imaginable.
DAS28(CRP) scores range from 0 to approximately 10, with the upper bound dependent on the highest possible level of CRP. A DAS28 score higher than 5.1 indicates high disease activity, a DAS28 score less than 3.2 indicates low disease activity, and a DAS28 score less than 2.6 indicates clinical remission.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Disease Activity Score 28-CRP at Weeks 8, 12, 40, and 48</title>
        <description>The DAS28 measures the severity of disease at a specific time and is derived from the following variables:
28 tender joint count
28 swollen joint count
C-reactive protein (CRP)
Patient's global health assessment measured on a 100 mm VAS, where 0 mm = no RA activity and 100 mm = worst RA activity imaginable.
DAS28(CRP) scores range from 0 to approximately 10, with the upper bound dependent on the highest possible level of CRP. A DAS28 score higher than 5.1 indicates high disease activity, a DAS28 score less than 3.2 indicates low disease activity, and a DAS28 score less than 2.6 indicates clinical remission.</description>

        <description>The hybrid ACR combines the ACR 20/50/70 response with the mean percent change in all 7 ACR core components, thus providing a percent improvement from baseline on a continuous scale. For each participant, the mean percent improvement from baseline across the 7 ACR core set measures (tender joint count, swollen joint count, Patient's Global Assessment of Disease Activity, Investigator's Global Assessment of Disease Activity, disability index of the HAQ, and CRP) was calculated (a positive change indicates improvement, and the maximum worst change is limited to -100%) and the ACR20, ACR50, and ACR70 response is determined. The hybrid ACR is determined from a reference table taking into account both ACR response and mean percent improvement in the core set measures. Scores can range from -100% (maximal worsening) to 100% (maximal improvement).</description>

      <pi_employee>Principal Investigators are NOT employed by the organization sponsoring the study.</pi_employee>
      <restrictive_agreement>The Clinical Trial Agreement generally does not restrict an investigator's discussion of trial results after completion. The Agreement permits Amgen a limited period of time to review material discussing trial results (typically up to 45 days and possible extension). Amgen may remove confidential information, but authors have final control and approval of publication content. For multicenter studies, the investigator agrees not to publish any results before the first multi-center publication.</restrictive_agreement>
