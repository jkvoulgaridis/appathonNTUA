  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Idarucizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody fragment (Fab) that binds to dabigatran with
      very high affinity. Idarucizumab potently and specifically binds to dabigatran and its
      metabolites and neutralises its anticoagulant effect. A clinical development program is
      ongoing to support marketing authorisation submissions for idarucizumab indicated in patients
      treated with dabigatran who require emergency surgery/urgent procedures or who have a
      life-threatening or uncontrolledbleeding when rapid reversal of the anticoagulant effects of
      dabigatran is required.
