      A 52-Week, Open-Label, Multicentre Study to Evaluate the Safety of Tralokinumab in Japanese
      Adults and Adolescents with Asthma Inadequately Controlled on Inhaled Corticosteroid plus
      Long-Acting β2-Agonist

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a 52-week, open-label, multi-centre study designed to evaluate the safety of
      tralokinumab in a fixed 300 mg dose every 2 weeks, administered subcutaneously in adults and
      adolescents with indequately controlled asthma on medium to high dose inhaled corticosteroid
      plus long acting β-2 antagonist. Approximately 26 Japanese subjects will be recruited to
      receive 22 completed.
    </textblock>
  </detailed_description>
  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    The study was terminated due to the discontinuation of the tralokinumab asthma program (as per
    the results of the Phase III study [D2210C00008])

    <time_frame>From Screening (Day -14) up to 14 weeks after end of treatment (Week 66).</time_frame>
    <description>An AE was development of an undesirable medical condition or deterioration of a pre-existing medical condition following or during exposure to a pharmaceutical product, whether or not considered causally related to product. An undesirable medical condition can be symptoms, signs or the abnormal results of an investigation. In clinical studies, an AE can include an undesirable medical condition occurring at any time, including run-in or washout periods, even if no study treatment has been administered. A SAE was an AE occurred during any study phase that fulfils one or more of the following criteria: death; immediately life-threatening, in-patient or prolongation of existing hospitalization; persistent or significant disability/incapacity or substantial disruption of ability to conduct normal life functions; congenital abnormality or birth defect; important medical event that may jeopardise participant or may require medical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Clinical Laboratory Abnormalities</measure>
    <time_frame>From Screening (Day -14) up to 14 weeks after end of treatment (Week 66).</time_frame>
    <description>Blood and urine samples for determination of clinical chemistry, haematology and urinalysis parameters were taken at the times. Changes in haematology and clinical chemistry variables between baseline and each subsequent scheduled assessment were evaluated. Baseline is defined as the last available value measured prior to the first dose of study treatment. The change from baseline is defined as the treatment period value minus the baseline period value. Absolute values were compared to the relevant reference range and classified as low (below range), normal (within range or on limits) or high (above range). The AstraZeneca extended reference ranges were used for laboratory variables (where they exist). All values (absolute and change) falling outside the reference ranges were flagged. Urinalysis data were categorised as negative (0), trace or positive (+) at each time point.</description>

    <description>Physical examination included assessment of general appearance, skin, head and neck (including eyes, ears, nose, mouth and throat), lymph nodes, abdomen, musculoskeletal (including spine and extremities), cardiovascular, respiratory, and neurological systems. Criteria for abnormal physical findings were based on investigator's discretion.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Adult participants with asthma inadequately controlled on inhaled corticosteroid plus long-acting beta 2 agonist were recruited at 4 sites in Japan from 01 November 2016 until study termination on 24 January 2018. No adolescent participants were enrolled in the study.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Of all enrolled participants, 3 were considered screen failures and 28 participants were received study treatment. Following initial screening, there was a run-in period of up to 2 weeks to allow adequate time for eligibility criteria to be evaluated prior to entry to planned 52-week treatment period followed by a 14 week extended follow-up period.</pre_assignment_details>

        <description>An AE was development of an undesirable medical condition or deterioration of a pre-existing medical condition following or during exposure to a pharmaceutical product, whether or not considered causally related to product. An undesirable medical condition can be symptoms, signs or the abnormal results of an investigation. In clinical studies, an AE can include an undesirable medical condition occurring at any time, including run-in or washout periods, even if no study treatment has been administered. A SAE was an AE occurred during any study phase that fulfils one or more of the following criteria: death; immediately life-threatening, in-patient or prolongation of existing hospitalization; persistent or significant disability/incapacity or substantial disruption of ability to conduct normal life functions; congenital abnormality or birth defect; important medical event that may jeopardise participant or may require medical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.</description>

        <description>Blood and urine samples for determination of clinical chemistry, haematology and urinalysis parameters were taken at the times. Changes in haematology and clinical chemistry variables between baseline and each subsequent scheduled assessment were evaluated. Baseline is defined as the last available value measured prior to the first dose of study treatment. The change from baseline is defined as the treatment period value minus the baseline period value. Absolute values were compared to the relevant reference range and classified as low (below range), normal (within range or on limits) or high (above range). The AstraZeneca extended reference ranges were used for laboratory variables (where they exist). All values (absolute and change) falling outside the reference ranges were flagged. Urinalysis data were categorised as negative (0), trace or positive (+) at each time point.</description>
