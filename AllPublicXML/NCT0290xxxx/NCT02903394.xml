  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to develop a multiplexed low coherence interferometry (mLCI)
      endoscopic probe for mapping the epithelial types of the cervix. This vaginal mLCI probe will
      obtain optical measurements from the cervix. These measurements can be used to create a map
      of the surface cells that distinguishes ectocervical epithelia, endocervical epithelia, and
      the squamocolumnar junction (t-zone), which is the region where cervical dysplasia is most
      likely to occur.

Exclusion criteria included history of cervical dysplasia or previous surgery on the cervix, complaint of vaginal discharge or suspicion of sexually transmitted infection at the time of presentation, or positive urine pregnancy test.
Women were examined by speculum to visualize the cervix. Wallach colposcope was used to acquire a photograph of the cervix. mLCI probe was then inserted through speculum and placed against the cervix by endoscopic visual guidance provided through the probe. Optical interferometric data was acquired within a 20 mm field of view, and results were analyzed to determine tissue type.</description>

            <description>Primary arm of present study. 50 women from ages 18 to 42 recruited from routine care population at New York City Health + Hospitals / Jacobi (Bronx, New York, NY). Exclusion criteria included history of cervical dysplasia or previous surgery on the cervix, complaint of vaginal discharge or suspicion of sexually transmitted infection at the time of presentation, or positive urine pregnancy test.
Women were examined by speculum to visualize the cervix. Wallach colposcope was used to acquire a photograph of the cervix. mLCI probe was then inserted through speculum and placed against the cervix by endoscopic visual guidance provided through the probe. Optical interferometric data was acquired within a 20 mm field of view, and results were analyzed to determine tissue type.</description>
