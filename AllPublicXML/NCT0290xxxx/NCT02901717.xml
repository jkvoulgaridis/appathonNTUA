  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 3, multi-center, randomized, open-label, assess-blind study to determine the
      efficacy and safety of MLT, a novel antibiotic lock therapy that combines minocycline with
      edetate disodium in 25% ethanol solution as an adjuctive therapy for the treatment of
      catheter-related or central line associated bloodstream infection (CRBSI/CLABSI).

      Approximately 144 subjects who have been diagnosed with CRBSI/CLABSI and who meet all
      necessary criteria for the study will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to 1 of 2 treatment arms:

        -  MLT Arm: Mino-Lok therapy; or

        -  Control Arm: Antibiotic lock (±heparin). The antibiotic lock (ALT) should be comprised
           of the best available therapy at the sites based on standard institutional practices or
           recommendations from the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines.

      This is a Phase 3, multi-center, randomized, double-blind study to determine the efficacy and
      safety of MLT, a novel antibiotic lock therapy that combines minocycline with edetate
      disodium in 25% ethanol solution.

      Mino-Lok Therapy is being developed as an adjunctive therapy for the treatment of
      catheter-related or central line associated bloodstream infection (CRBSI/CLABSI) in
      combination with appropriate systemic antibiotic(s), to preserve central venous access and to
      avoid the complications and morbidities associated with catheter removal and reinsertion.

      Approximately 144 subjects who have been diagnosed with CRBSI/CLABSI and who meet all
      necessary criteria for the study will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to 1 of 2 treatment arms:

        -  MLT Arm: MLT + SOC intravenous (IV) antibiotic therapy; or

        -  Control Arm (subjects randomized to the Control Arm will receive treatment based on the
           type and virulence of the infecting organism as documented by the Investigator prior to
           randomization): The antibiotic lock should be comprised of the best available therapy at
           the sites. Prior to randomization, the Investigator at each site will determine the
           antibiotic used in the lock, the dose, the dwell time, and the number of days of
           administration (minimum of 7 days) based on standard institutional practices or
           recommendations from the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines. In
           the event that the subject is being treated with more than 1 systemic SOC IV antibiotic,
           the Investigator will specify a single antibiotic that should be used for the antibiotic
           lock. It is acceptable for the SOC antibiotic lock to differ from the SOC IV
           antibiotics, as necessary per local SOC.

      All infecting organism types are permitted (eg, S. aureus, S. epidermidis, Candida spp.,
      Pseudomonas aeruginosa). Randomization will be stratified by type of CVC, presence of
      neutropenia, and by virulence of the infecting organism.

      The primary endpoint for this study is the time (in days following randomization) to a
      catheter failure event between randomization and TOC (Week 6) in the Intent-to-Treat (ITT)
      Population.

      A catheter failure event is ANY of the following:

        -  All-cause mortality at TOC (Week 6). The event time is the day of death;

        -  Catheter removal for any infection-related reasons (including worsening of symptoms or
           failure to eradicate the infection). The event time is the day the catheter is removed;

        -  Inability to administer study drug. The event time is the day the Investigator
           determines the catheter is no longer functional;

        -  Worsening of systemic signs and symptoms of infection that result in change in systemic
           anti infective treatment. Note that changes in treatment based on susceptibility data
           will be permitted. The event time is the day the treatment is changed;

        -  Demonstration that the baseline pathogen is not eradicated from the blood culture
           collected within 72 hours following randomization despite 72 hours of antibiotic therapy
           to which the infecting organism is susceptible. Best clinical practice and subject
           safety may dictate changes in treatment prior to 72 hours. The event time is the day of
           the positive culture;

        -  Demonstration that the baseline pathogen has recurred based on blood culture results by
           Week 6 of the study. The event time is the day of the positive blood culture documenting
           the recurrence. If a subject does not show any signs and symptoms of an infection and
           there is a negative blood culture prior to Week 6, then a blood culture does not have to
           be performed at Week 6. Subjects whose catheter was removed for reasons not related to
           the baseline infection also do not need to have a blood culture at Week 6; or

        -  Demonstration that the baseline pathogen is part of a newly diagnosed deep-seated
           infection by Week 6 of the study. The event time is the day of the new diagnosis.

      Removal of the CVC prior to TOC because the catheter is no longer needed will not be
      considered a catheter failure and these subjects will be censored at the time of catheter
      removal.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Subjects with CRBSI/CLABSI for whom, in the Investigator's opinion, catheter retention is
        reasonable or required due to lack of alternative venous access. This includes subjects
        with bacterial pathogens and Candida spp.

        Inclusion Criteria

          1. Subject or a legally authorized representative must provide a signed informed consent
             form;

          2. Male or female at least 12 years of age;

          3. Subject must have a bloodstream infection with no other apparent source other than the
             CVC that meets one of the following criteria:

               -  A recognized single pathogen cultured from 1 or more blood cultures; OR

               -  A common skin contaminant cultured from 2 or more blood cultures drawn on the
                  same or consecutive calendar days from a subject with fever (greater than or

                  than 90 mmHg); NOTE: When possible, it is recommended to collect from both the
                  CVC and peripheral venipuncture.

          4. Inpatient or outpatient with presence of indwelling CVC (ie, totally implantable port,
             tunneled or non-tunneled CVC, hemodialysis catheter, or peripherally inserted CVC)
             that has been in place for at least 5 days;

          5. A bloodstream infection documented within 96 hours prior to enrollment (and from which
             an isolate of the baseline pathogen(s) is still available for analysis at the central
             laboratory) and demonstrates the protocol definition of CRBSI or CLABSI;

             NOTE: Subjects may be enrolled and randomized while awaiting results of standard blood
             cultures from the local laboratory:

               -  If an organism has been identified from blood specimen testing using an
                  FDA-cleared rapid diagnostic test (eg, T2MR®); or

               -  If a positive blood culture specimen shows an organism by 1 of the following:

             Gram stain; or An FDA-cleared molecular rapid diagnostic test (eg, FilmArray® BCID or
             Verigene®); If the pending blood culture does not confirm a qualifying organism by
             standard methods and an isolate is not available for testing at the central
             laboratory, the subject will be withdrawn from study drug treatment and managed at the
             Investigator's discretion.

             NOTE: Subjects with a positive blood culture identified up to 120 hours prior to
             enrollment and in whom the baseline pathogen is still available for analysis at the
             central laboratory may be considered on a case by-case basis with prior approval from
             the Medical Monitor.

          6. Subjects for whom, in the Investigator's opinion, catheter retention for the duration
             of the study (6 weeks) is reasonable or required;

          7. Female subjects of childbearing potential must have a negative urine and/or serum
             pregnancy test within 5 days prior to randomization;

             NOTE: The following are considered women who are NOT of childbearing potential:

               -  Postmenopausal (defined as no menses for at least 12 consecutive months); or

               -  Documented to be surgically sterile;

          8. Female subjects of childbearing potential and male subjects who are sexually active
             must agree to use a highly effective method of contraception from the time of informed
             consent until 30 days post dose; NOTE: Highly effective methods of contraception
             include hormonal contraceptives, intrauterine device, double-barrier method, partner
             sterility, or abstinence.

          9. Male subjects must agree to refrain from sperm donation throughout the duration of the
             study and for 90 days following the last dose of study drug; and

         10. Subject must be willing to comply with all study procedures, whether inpatient or
             outpatient, for the duration of the study.

        Exclusion Criteria

          1. Subjects with hypersensitivity or allergy to tetracycline antibiotics or edetate
             disodium;

          2. Subjects with septic shock that requires inotropic support or is unresponsive to fluid
             resuscitation;

          3. Subjects taking disulfiram at the time of randomization or who are expected to take
             disulfiram at any time during treatment with study drug;

          4. Subjects with prosthetic cardiac valves, vascular grafts, pacers, automatic
             implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, or other non-removable vascular foreign body,
             with the exception of coronary stents and peripheral stents;

          5. Subjects with the presence of a deep-seated intravascular source of infection (eg,
             endocarditis [as evidenced by vegetations on an echocardiogram or clinical suspicion]
             or septic thrombosis);

          6. Subjects with bacteremia with documented microbiological evidence of another source of
             infection (eg, osteomyelitis, pneumonia, skin infection, urinary tract infection,
             joint infection, or abdominal infection) known to be due to the same organism cultured
             from the blood;

          7. Subjects with polymicrobial CRBSI/CLABSI caused by pathogens that would require
             multiple antibiotics to be used for adequate lock therapy treatment. For example, a
             subject with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli
             requiring treatment with vancomycin and meropenem would be excluded from the study. A
             subject with S. aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, where both are identified as
             pathogens and where both could be treated with vancomycin, would be eligible; NOTE: If
             more than 1 organism is isolated, the Investigator should decide which of the
             organisms are pathogens and require therapy. Isolates of all organisms should be sent
             to the central laboratory. In the event that the subject is being treated with more
             than 1 systemic standard of care (SOC) anti-infective, the Investigator will specify a
             single antibiotic that should be used for the antibiotic lock. It is acceptable for
             the SOC antibiotic lock to differ from the SOC anti infectives, as necessary per local
             SOC.

          8. Subjects with the presence of a tunnel or catheter exit site infection or an infusion
             port pocket abscess as manifested by purulence at the exit site, or inflammation with
             erythema, or induration of at least 1 cm in diameter;

          9. Subjects who have been previously randomized into the present study;

         10. Subjects who are pregnant or breastfeeding;

         11. Subjects with proven or suspected persistent bacteremia or fungemia despite 72 hours
             of both systemic anti-infective therapy and lock therapy to which the infecting
             organism is susceptible;

         12. Subjects with short-term CVCs indwelling at least 5 days;

         13. Subjects with a central line-related mycobacterial infection or fungi other than
             Candida; or

         14. Subjects who, in the opinion of the Investigator, have a high probability of death
             within 3 months of randomization due to a disease process other than the CRBSI/CLABSI.
