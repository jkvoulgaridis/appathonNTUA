        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who, in the opinion of the investigator, can and will comply with the
             requirements of the protocol.

          -  A male or female between and including 40 and 60 years of age (from and including the

          -  Written informed consent obtained from the subject.

          -  Documented evidence of previous vaccination with three or four consecutive doses of
             Engerix-B administered in adulthood (i.e. at least 18 years of age) with

               -  Non-childbearing potential is defined as pre-menarche, hysterectomy, ovariectomy
                  or post-menopause.

             subject:

               -  has practiced adequate contraception for 30 days prior to vaccination, and

               -  has a negative pregnancy test on the day of vaccination, and

               -  has agreed to continue adequate contraception during the entire treatment period

             diabetes).

          -  Acute disease and/or fever at the time of enrolment.

               -  Fever is defined as temperature ≥37.5°C for oral, axillary or tympanic route, or
