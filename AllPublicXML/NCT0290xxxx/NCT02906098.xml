      This study evaluates behavioral interventions to increase adolescent's motivation for self
      performed periodontal infection control, by means of adequate oral hygiene. Study subjects
      will be allocated to test and control group where the test will be subjected to an
      individually tailored oral health education program, based on cognitive- behavioral theory
      and principles, and the control to standard educational intervention.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of chronic periodontitis is about 40% among the Swedish adult population. The
      key-factor for the prevention of periodontal disease progression is the establishment of
      periodontal infection control, by means of adequate daily oral hygiene. Hence, a main task
      for dental professionals is to educate and motivate the patient to such beneficial behavior.
      A hypothesis for the current study is that patient centered health promotion programs based
      on cognitive behavioral theory and principles and with a directive communicative approach,
      i.e. motivational interviewing techniques, add positive and lasting effects to standard
      educational interventions on self-performed periodontal infection control.

      This randomized clinical field study involves 30 professionals (dental hygienists) and about
      350 adolescent patients at 16 dental clinics in the Västra Götaland Region, Sweden. The
      approach in the evaluation is on patient-centered outcomes and health economics.

    <description>The program is based on cognitive behavioral theory and principles. Hence, the intervention is adapted to each individual's problem, capacity and goals were the dental hygienist use motivational interviewing skills in communication and act as a guiding resource during the process of behavioral change. The program follows a specific structure including components such as formulation of personal goals, continuous self-monitoring by diary and planning of behavior. The initial intervention phase contain 3 treatment sessions (45-60 min each) during a period of 12 weeks (baseline, 2-3 weeks and 10-12 weeks). Follow up are performed at 6- and 18-months.</description>
