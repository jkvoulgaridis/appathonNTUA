      For participants enrolled prior to Version 6 of the protocol: This is a Phase II
      multi-center, randomized, double-blind, 24-week, 3-arm, parallel group, placebo-controlled
      study to investigate the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of balovaptan in children and
      adolescents aged 5-17 years with ASD who are high functioning (intelligence quotient [IQ]
      greater than or equal to [&gt;=] 70).

      For participants enrolled according to Version 6 of the protocol: This is a Phase II
      multi-center, randomized, double-blind, 24-week, parallel group, placebo-controlled, 2-arm
      study with participants assigned either to a 10 milligram (mg) or equivalent dose of
      balovaptan, or placebo. All other study parameters remain as stated above.

      All participants that complete the 24-week treatment period will be eligible to participate
      in an optional 52-week open-label extension (OLE) during which they will receive balovaptan
      treatment.
