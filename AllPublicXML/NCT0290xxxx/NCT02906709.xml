  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the efficacy of omarigliptin 25 mg once weekly compared to placebo in
      Japanese patients with T2DM who have inadequate glycemic control on insulin monotherapy in
      addition to diet and exercise therapy. The primary hypothesis of the study is that
      omarigliptin 25 mg once weekly provides greater reduction in hemoglobin A1C (HbA1c) compared
      with placebo as assessed by change from baseline to Week 16 [Phase A (double-blind period)].

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After a screening period of up to 2 weeks followed by a pretreatment period of 2 or 10 weeks,
      each participant will be receiving assigned double-blind treatment (omarigliptin 25 mg or
      placebo once weekly) for approximately 16 weeks (Phase A) followed by 36 weeks of open-label
      treatment (omarigliptin 25 mg once weekly, Phase B). After the end of treatment each
      participant will be followed for 21 days.

    <measure>Constrained Longitudinal Data Analysis of Change From Baseline in Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) at Week 16 Excluding Data After Glycemic Rescue (Phase A)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1) and Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>HbA1c is a measure of the percentage of glycated hemoglobin in the blood. Participant whole blood samples were collected at baseline and Week 16 to determine the Constrained Longitudinal Data Analysis least squares mean HbA1c change from baseline (i.e., HbA1c at Week 16 minus HbA1c at baseline). Participants that met rescue criteria had their insulin dose adjusted as determined clinically appropriate by the investigator to manage glycemic control. Data after glycemic rescue were excluded from this analysis. Negative data values indicated a reduction in HbA1c levels.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1) and Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>Blood glucose was measured on a fasting basis. FPG is expressed as mg/dL. Blood was drawn at predose on Day 1 and after 16 weeks of treatment to determine Constrained Longitudinal Data Analysis change in plasma glucose levels (i.e., FPG at Week 16 minus FPG at baseline). Participants that met rescue criteria had their insulin dose adjusted as determined clinically appropriate by the investigator to manage glycemic control. Data after glycemic rescue were excluded from this analysis. Negative data values indicated a reduction in FPG levels.</description>

    <description>HbA1c is a measure of the percentage of glycated hemoglobin in the blood. Participants that met rescue criteria had their insulin dose adjusted as determined clinically appropriate by the investigator to manage glycemic control. Data after glycemic rescue were excluded from this analysis. Each of the 10 imputed data sets was summarized to obtain the percentage of responders within each group and were combined using standard multiple imputation techniques to yield an overall estimate of response rate and associated variance for each group. A constrained longitudinal data analysis was used to analyze the data and Wilson score method by treatment groups used for the analysis of percentages of individuals at the HbA1c goals of &lt;7.0% at Week 16 and the 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Miettinen &amp; Nurminen (M&amp;N) method after imputations were used to calculate the treatment differences of the percentages of individuals and the 95% CIs.</description>

    <measure>Constrained Longitudinal Data Analysis of Change From Baseline in 1,5-anhydroglucitol (1,5-AG) at Week 16 Excluding Data After Glycemic Rescue (Phase A)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1) and Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>1,5-anhydroglucitol (1,5-AG) is a marker of short-term glycemic control especially postprandial hyperglycemia. 1,5-AG accurately predicts rapid changes in glycemia and is tightly associated with glucose fluctuations and postprandial glucose. Participants that met rescue criteria had their insulin dose adjusted as determined clinically appropriate by the investigator to manage glycemic control. Data after glycemic rescue were excluded from this analysis. Data (1,5-AG at Week 16 minus 1,5-AG at baseline) was analyzed by Constrained Longitudinal Data Analysis. Positive data values indicate an increase in 1,5-AG levels and correlate with an improvement in glycemia.</description>

        <description>HbA1c is a measure of the percentage of glycated hemoglobin in the blood. Participant whole blood samples were collected at baseline and Week 16 to determine the Constrained Longitudinal Data Analysis least squares mean HbA1c change from baseline (i.e., HbA1c at Week 16 minus HbA1c at baseline). Participants that met rescue criteria had their insulin dose adjusted as determined clinically appropriate by the investigator to manage glycemic control. Data after glycemic rescue were excluded from this analysis. Negative data values indicated a reduction in HbA1c levels.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Achieving Hemoglobin A1c Goals (&lt;7.0%) at Week 16 Constrained Longitudinal Data Analysis Using Multiple Imputation Excluding Data After Glycemic Rescue (Phase A)</title>
        <description>HbA1c is a measure of the percentage of glycated hemoglobin in the blood. Participants that met rescue criteria had their insulin dose adjusted as determined clinically appropriate by the investigator to manage glycemic control. Data after glycemic rescue were excluded from this analysis. Each of the 10 imputed data sets was summarized to obtain the percentage of responders within each group and were combined using standard multiple imputation techniques to yield an overall estimate of response rate and associated variance for each group. A constrained longitudinal data analysis was used to analyze the data and Wilson score method by treatment groups used for the analysis of percentages of individuals at the HbA1c goals of &lt;7.0% at Week 16 and the 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Miettinen &amp; Nurminen (M&amp;N) method after imputations were used to calculate the treatment differences of the percentages of individuals and the 95% CIs.</description>

        <title>Constrained Longitudinal Data Analysis of Change From Baseline in 1,5-anhydroglucitol (1,5-AG) at Week 16 Excluding Data After Glycemic Rescue (Phase A)</title>
        <description>1,5-anhydroglucitol (1,5-AG) is a marker of short-term glycemic control especially postprandial hyperglycemia. 1,5-AG accurately predicts rapid changes in glycemia and is tightly associated with glucose fluctuations and postprandial glucose. Participants that met rescue criteria had their insulin dose adjusted as determined clinically appropriate by the investigator to manage glycemic control. Data after glycemic rescue were excluded from this analysis. Data (1,5-AG at Week 16 minus 1,5-AG at baseline) was analyzed by Constrained Longitudinal Data Analysis. Positive data values indicate an increase in 1,5-AG levels and correlate with an improvement in glycemia.</description>

Participants that met rescue criteria had their insulin dose adjusted as determined clinically appropriate by the investigator to manage glycemic control. Negative data values indicated a reduction in FPG levels.</description>
          <population>The analysis population consisted of all randomized participants who received at least one dose of study treatment and had at least one measurement (baseline or post randomization) for the outcome measure. Three participants in the Placebo group did not have data to contribute to the analysis.</population>
