  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One-third of all primary brain tumors are astrocytomas, the most common type of glioma. Grade
      4 astrocytomas, more commonly known as glioblastomas (GBMs), represent about 50% of all
      gliomas (annual incidence of over 3 per 100,000) and are associated with high mortality rates
      and median patient survival of just 12-15 months post-diagnosis. Treatment response is
      assessed by measuring post-treatment tumor size on contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance
      images (MRI). However, radiation and chemotherapy cause inflammatory and necrotic changes
      which, like actual tumor progression itself, demonstrate contrast enhancement on the first
      post-treatment MRI scan. This enhancement eventually subsides (typically within 6 months of
      treatment) and is known as pseudoprogression (PsP). Currently, there is no gold standard
      noninvasive tool for distinguishing between pseudoprogression and progressive disease.
      Dynamic susceptibility-weighted contrast-enhanced perfusion MRI (DSC perfusion MRI) permits
      measurement of hemodynamic imaging variables. Previous literature reports attempted to use
      some or all of these metrics to assess their utility in distinguishing PsP from true cancer
      progression. These studies showed mixed results, likely due to a number of factors, including
      poor statistical power, poorly defined PsP, analysis of multiple cancer grades and types, and
      varied analysis methodologies. The investigators aim to address these issues in this study.

    <description>The primary outcome of this study is to assess the utility of peak height, peak signal recovery, apparent diffusion coefficient, and cerebral blood volume (and their relative values) in determining, positive predictive values (PPV), negative predictive values (NPV), and likelihood ratios (LR) for identifying pseudo progression versus true tumor growth.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants must be 18 years of age or older.

          -  Participants must be able to read and comprehend the English language.

          -  In agreement with the care providing physician, participants must be willing to have
             surgery to remove possible brain tumor.

          -  Participants must have a MRI scan within 24 hours after the tumor is removed (if a
             tumor is confirmed).

          -  Participants must have the tumor analyzed by the laboratory and pathology departments
             and receive the diagnosis of glioblastoma.

          -  Participants must be willing to follow the Stupp treatment protocol (this treatment
             plan and its' procedures are considered the standard for treating glioblastoma). (The
             Stupp protocol is the name of the radiation and chemotherapy plan that has been found
             to help in many cases of glioblastoma.)

          -  Participants must be willing to follow any additional study procedures (including
             having all follow-up MRIs performed at St. Vincent 86th St).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants are less than 18 years of age.

          -  Participants have had surgery for your brain tumor and NOT received the diagnosis of
             glioblastoma

          -  Participants and care providing physician have decided NOT to follow the Stupp
             protocol (treatment plan) for glioblastoma treatment. (Deviations or interruptions are
             allowed if clinically indicated)

          -  Participants are not having a MRI scan within 24 hours after brain tumor surgery.

          -  Participants are not willing to follow the study procedures.
