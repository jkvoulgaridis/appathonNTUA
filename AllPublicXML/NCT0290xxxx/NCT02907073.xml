  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this proposal is to perform first-in-man evaluation of and experimental imaging
      agent F-18 tetrafluoroborate (BF4) or (TFB).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      F-18 tetrafluoroborate (BF4) or (TFB) is being used as a PET (Positron Emission Tomography)
      imaging biomarker for expression of the human sodium/iodide symporter (hNIS) in tissues.
      Imaging of functional hNIS activity in tissues with [18F]BF4 is anticipated to provide
      superior sensitivity and image quality to I-123 or Tc-99m SPECT for monitoring hNIS
      transduction effected by viral therapies. The proposed work is designed to 1) evaluate its
      safety, biodistribution, metabolism and radiation dosimetry characteristics in 8 healthy
      human volunteers and 2) evaluate the imaging feasibility in comparison with I-123 or Tc-99m
      SPECT of hNIS expression in a) 10 myeloma patients treated with Edmonston Measles virus-NIS
      (MV-NIS) and b) 10 endometrial cancer patients treated with vesicular stomatitis virus
      engineered to express human interferon and NIS (VSV-hINF-NIS). This data will be necessary to
      support future regulatory submissions.

    <description>At the study visit, healthy subjects will have an initial physical exam, urine pregnancy test (if applicable) and will have catheters placed for i.v. drug administration and blood sampling. Vital signs, and blood samples will be obtained. Subjects will receive an infusion [18F]BF4 over 1 minute and PET imaging will begin. Three (3) PET/CT scanning procedures will be performed over a period of approximately 4 hours with two rest breaks in between. Venous blood samples for clinical laboratory tests will be taken before radiotracer administration and at 1.5 hours post-administration of radiotracer. In addition, venous blood samples will be taken during the PET/CT scans to determine blood pharmacokinetics and metabolite evaluation. Physical exam will be repeated at the end of the study.</description>

        <description>F-18 BF4 concentrations in major tissues (e.g., heart, blood pool, lung, liver, thyroid, stomach, kidney, brain, muscle) will be evaluated from the PET images from 0-240 minutes post-administration. Results will be used to compute radiation dosimetry estimates.</description>

        <population>Outcome measures were performed in study arm of eight healthy volunteers. F or the myeloma and endometrial cancer arms of the study, the study was terminated due to pursuing Investigational New Drug application (IND).</population>

            <description>At the study visit, healthy subjects will have an initial physical exam, urine pregnancy test (if applicable) and will have catheters placed for i.v. drug administration and blood sampling. Vital signs, and blood samples will be obtained. Subjects will receive an infusion [18F]BF4 over 1 minute and PET imaging will begin. Three (3) PET/CT scanning procedures will be performed over a period of approximately 4 hours with two rest breaks in between. Venous blood samples for clinical laboratory tests will be taken before radiotracer administration and at 1.5 hours post-administration of radiotracer. In addition, venous blood samples will be taken during the PET/CT scans to determine blood pharmacokinetics and metabolite evaluation. Physical exam will be repeated at the end of the study.

            <description>For cancer patients undergoing virus treatments, subjects will undergo [18F]BF4-PET/CT imaging at baseline before virus administration and at day 9 following virus treatment. Subjects will be screened by physician specialists within their clinics. Subjects who qualify for the study will return to the clinic within 30 days of screening, have a urine pregnancy test (if applicable) and will have catheters placed for i.v. drug administration. Vital signs will be obtained. All subjects will then receive a single i.v. bolus of [18F]BF4 for injection and PET/CT imaging will begin. Biopsies will be performed to confirm NIS expression in tissue of tumor regions showing uptake of [18F]BF4 in up to three myeloma patients when the site is accessible for biopsy.

            <description>At the study visit, healthy subjects will have an initial physical exam, urine pregnancy test (if applicable) and will have catheters placed for i.v. drug administration and blood sampling. Vital signs, and blood samples will be obtained. Subjects will receive an infusion [18F]BF4 over 1 minute and PET imaging will begin. Three (3) PET/CT scanning procedures will be performed over a period of approximately 4 hours with two rest breaks in between. Venous blood samples for clinical laboratory tests will be taken before radiotracer administration and at 1.5 hours post-administration of radiotracer. In addition, venous blood samples will be taken during the PET/CT scans to determine blood pharmacokinetics and metabolite evaluation. Physical exam will be repeated at the end of the study.

Subjects will be screened by physician specialists within their clinics.

Vital signs will be obtained. All subjects will then receive a single i.v. bolus of [18F]BF4 for injection and PET/CT imaging will begin. Biopsies will be performed to confirm NIS expression in tissue of tumor regions showing uptake of [18F]BF4 in up to three myeloma patients when the site is accessible for biopsy.
