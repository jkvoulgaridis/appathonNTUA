    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the role of the Nitric Oxide system in cognition in patients with
      schizophrenia. Participants will be randomised to 2 equal groups and receive either the
      Nitric Oxide donor molecule glyceryl trinitrate, or a placebo. Performance on several
      cognitive tasks will be assessed.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nitric oxide [NO] is a gaseous neurotransmitter substance found in the brain. Nitric oxide is
      integrated with the glutamate system. Glutamate has received considerable attention as an
      important factor in the cognitive distortions and cognitive impairments that underlie
      schizophrenia. Deficits in glutamate in schizophrenia may impact upon cognition via the NO
      system, as glutamate receptors signal by way of NO.

      Here the investigators aim to extend knowledge of glutamate-NO systems by directly examining
      the role of NO in cognition in patients with psychosis. We aim to assess the role of the NO
      system in cognition, downstream of glutamate and before patients are started on any
      anti-psychotic medication which perturb brain neurochemistry.

      The primary outcome measure is change in a particular style of cognition referred to as
      'jumping to conclusions' following the administration of a potent Nitric Oxide donor molecule
      [glyceryl trinitrate (GTN)], under placebo-controlled, double-blind conditions. This will
      shed light on the direct role of NO in cognition in psychosis, beyond the glutamate system.
