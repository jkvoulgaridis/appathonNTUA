  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this randomized controlled trial is to determine if a nutritional supplement
      containing broccoli sprout and seed extracts, a rich source of sulforaphane, is effective in
      reducing core symptoms of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The study will also explore the
      safety and tolerability of a sulforaphane supplement in young men with ASD, as well as its
      effects on challenging neuropsychiatric symptoms that are commonly associated with ASD, such
      as hyperactivity, irritability, and repetitive movements.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder affecting 1 in 68 children,
      including 1 in 42 boys, characterized by marked social communication impairment and
      restricted, repetitive behaviors and interests. Evidence-based pharmacological treatments
      available for the treatment of the defining symptoms of ASD are currently lacking.

      While the etiology of ASD is not fully understood, the pathogenesis is hypothesized to
      involve cellular dysfunction, including increased oxidative stress, aberrant
      neuroinflammation, and reduced mitochondrial capacity, leading to synaptic dysfunction in at
      least a subset of individuals. Sulforaphane is a powerful upregulator of antioxidant response
      elements and heat shock proteins, which may lead to improved redox capacity, decreased
      inflammation, and improved mitochondrial functioning in individuals with ASD. A trial by
      Singh and colleagues (2014) provided preliminary evidence suggesting that sulforaphane
      derived from broccoli sprout extract can have beneficial effects for improving symptoms of
      autism.

      In this study, young men ages 13-30 years old with moderate to severe autism spectrum
      disorder will be randomly assigned to receive either a sulforaphane supplement or placebo for
      a 12 week treatment treatment period, followed by a 4 week blinded discontinuation phase. The
      uncoated tablets each contain 125 mg broccoli seed extract and 50 mg broccoli sprout extract,
      corresponding to approximately 15 Âµmol sulforaphane per tablet. The dose will vary from 3-8
      tablets daily depending upon the participant's weight. Matched placebo tablets contain only
      inert ingredients

      A serum sample will be collected prior to starting treatment and at the end of the treatment
      phase to quantify sulforaphane metabolites. Clinical response will be assessed through
      clinician- and caregiver-rated measures of autism symptoms (Social Responsiveness Scale-2;
      Repetitive Behavior Scale- Revised), challenging symptoms commonly observed in individuals
      with developmental disabilities (Aberrant Behavior Checklist), and global severity of
      symptoms and improvement (Clinical Global Impression Scale). A blood sample will be collected
      at baseline and at the end of the treatment phase to check safety labs, and a saliva sample
      will be collected at baseline for a future study of genetic biomarkers associated with
      treatment response.

    <description>The Social Responsiveness Scale-2 (SRS-2) is a 65-item caregiver report that includes 5 subscales covering core symptom domains of ASD (Social Awareness, Social Cognition, Social Communication, Social Motivation, and Restricted Interests/ Repetitive Behaviors). The SRS-2 provides a T-score that is scaled such that the mean is 50 and the SD is 10. Higher scores indicate a higher presence and severity of autistic social impairment. A T-score of 76 or higher is considered &quot;severe&quot;. T-scores between 66 and 75 are considered as &quot;moderate&quot;. T-scores between 60 and 65 are considered &quot;mild&quot;. A T-score below 60 is considered typical. The theoretical range of a T-score is 10 to 90. The actual range of the SRS-2 in this study is 45 to 90.</description>

        <title>Social Responsiveness Scale-2 (SRS-2) Total Score at Baseline</title>
        <description>The Social Responsiveness Scale-2 (SRS-2) is a 65-item caregiver report that includes 5 subscales covering core symptom domains of ASD (Social Awareness, Social Cognition, Social Communication, Social Motivation, and Restricted Interests/ Repetitive Behaviors). The SRS-2 provides a T-score that is scaled such that the mean is 50 and the SD is 10. Higher scores indicate a higher presence and severity of autistic social impairment. A T-score of 76 or higher is considered &quot;severe&quot;. T-scores between 66 and 75 are considered as &quot;moderate&quot;. T-scores between 60 and 65 are considered &quot;mild&quot;. A T-score below 60 is considered typical. The theoretical range of a T-score is 10 to 90. The actual range of the SRS-2 in this study is 45 to 90.</description>

        <title>Social Responsiveness Scale-2 (SRS-2) Total Score at Week 12</title>
        <description>The Social Responsiveness Scale-2 (SRS-2) is a 65-item caregiver report that includes 5 subscales covering core symptom domains of ASD (Social Awareness, Social Cognition, Social Communication, Social Motivation, and Restricted Interests/ Repetitive Behaviors). The SRS-2 provides a T-score that is scaled such that the mean is 50 and the SD is 10. Higher scores indicate a higher presence and severity of autistic social impairment. A T-score of 76 or higher is considered &quot;severe&quot;. T-scores between 66 and 75 are considered as &quot;moderate&quot;. T-scores between 60 and 65 are considered &quot;mild&quot;. A T-score below 60 is considered typical. The theoretical range of a T-score is 10 to 90. The actual range of the SRS-2 in this study is 45 to 90.</description>

The SRS-2-Social Awareness subscale measures a participant's ability to recognize social cues. This subscale comprises 8 items with scores ranging from 1 to 4 for a total range of scores from 8 to 32. A higher score represents a greater ability to recognize social cues.
Subscales are not diagnostic in nature, but they provide some insight into individual behaviors. This subscale was measured at Baseline, Week 4, Week 8, Week 12, and Week 16.</description>

This subscale comprises 12 items with scores ranging from 1 to 4 for a total range of scores from 12 to 48. A higher score represents a greater ability to interpret social behaviors. Subscales are not diagnostic in nature, but they provide some insight into individual behaviors. This subscale was measured at Baseline, Week 4, Week 8, Week 12, and Week 16.</description>

          <description>The Social Responsiveness Scale-2 (SRS-2) is a 65-item caregiver report that includes 5 subscales covering core symptom domains of ASD (Social Awareness, Social Cognition, Social Communication, Social Motivation, and Restricted Interests/ Repetitive Behaviors). The SRS-2-Restricted Interests/Repetitive Behaviors subscale assesses the participant's level of stereotypy and circumscribed interests. This subscale comprises 12 items with scores ranging from 1 to 4 for a total range of scores from 12 to 48. A higher score represents a greater level of stereotypy and circumscribed interests. Subscales are not diagnostic in nature, but they provide some insight into individual behaviors. This subscale was measured at Baseline, Week 4, Week 8, Week 12, and Week 16.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Clinical Global Impression-Improvement (CGI-I) Score of Much Improved or Very Much Improved</title>
        <description>The clinician-rated CGI-Improvement (CGI-I) scale rates overall improvement or worsening of illness (ie, ASD) relative to baseline. The CGI-Improvement (CGI-I) scale rates overall improvement or worsening of illness (ie, ASD) relative to baseline. Possible scores on this scale range from 1-6 with the following assigned values: 1 = &quot;Very Much Improved&quot;; 2 = &quot;Much Improved; 3 = &quot;Minimally improved&quot;; 4 = &quot;No change&quot;; 5 = &quot;Minimally worse&quot;; 6= &quot;Much worse.&quot; A higher score indicates worsening of illness (ie, ASD), whereas a lower score indicates improvement of illness. This scale was measured at Week 4, Week 8, Week 12, and Week 16. In this measure, the number of participants in each treatment arm determined by the study physician to be &quot;Much Improved&quot; or &quot;Very Much Improved&quot; (indicative of meaningful clinical improvement) were counted.</description>

        <description>The RBS-R is a 43-item, informant-based questionnaire designed to quantify a range of restricted, repetitive behaviors (RRB) observed in ASD. Scores for each item range from 0 = &quot;Behavior does not occur&quot; to 3 = &quot;Behavior occurs and is a severe problem&quot;. Thus the total range is 0 to 129. A higher score indicates a higher breadth of repetitive behaviors. This scale was measured at Baseline, Week 4, Week 8, Week 12, and Week 16.</description>
