  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done to determine if treatment with metformin, a drug widely used for the
      treatment of diabetes type 2, is safe and well tolerated by individuals with Autosomal
      Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD) who are not diabetic and who have slightly
      decreased kidney function. The study will also evaluate the effects of metformin on kidney
      growth and kidney function.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with ADPKD are still in need for a well-tolerated treatment that can be used
      long-term to prevent cyst growth and kidney function decline. Metformin has a long track
      record of a low risk-to-benefit profile in patients with diabetes or at risk for diabetes.
      Metformin inhibits two key processes responsible for the growth of polycystic kidneys, i.e.
      fluid secretion and cell proliferation, as shown in cell cultures and animal models of ADPKD.
      Experiments in animal models of chronic kidney disease demonstrate that metformin
      administration prevents kidney fibrosis and preserves kidney function. Diabetic patients who
      are treated with metformin appear to develop less kidney failure and live longer than
      patients who are treated with other anti-diabetic medications. Therefore this drug is
      promising for people with ADPKD, with the potential to slow cyst enlargement and preserve
      kidney function.
