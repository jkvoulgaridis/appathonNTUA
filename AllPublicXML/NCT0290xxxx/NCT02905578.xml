  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial adds high-dose ascorbate (vitamin C) to the standard of care regimen for
      metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma (a type of pancreatic cancer). Subjects are randomized
      between a control group (standard treatment) and an intervention group (pharmacologic
      ascorbate in addition to the standard treatment).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One of the standard treatments for metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma is nab-paclitaxel
      with gemcitabine. This standard therapy administers chemotherapy once per week for three
      weeks; patients then get a 'rest week' to complete the cycle (1 cycle = 4 weeks).

      This study adds 75 grams of ascorbate (vitamin C, sometimes called pharamcological ascorbate
      because the dose is so high) to standard therapy. The ascorbate is administered intravenously
      - through a vein in the arm.

      Participants in the control group will:

        -  receive gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel chemotherapy, which is standard for their cancer.

        -  undergo imaging which is standard for their cancer and therapy. This can include CT
           scans, PET scans, and X-rays

      Participants in the intervention group will:

        -  receive 75 grams of ascorbate 3 times per calendar week for each week of the
           chemotherapy cycle.

        -  undergo imaging which is standard for their cancer and therapy. This can include CT
           scans, PET scans, and X-rays

        -  provide blood samples to determine the biological effects, if any, the ascorbate has on
           the body during therapy.

      This active therapy portion lasts until the disease progresses and a new treatment needs to
      be adopted - this can be months to years. If disease progresses, participants go back to
      standard follow-up for their caner and the new/additional therapy their doctors prescribe.

      However, it is very important we remain in contact with participants; they will have
      life-long follow-up for this study.
