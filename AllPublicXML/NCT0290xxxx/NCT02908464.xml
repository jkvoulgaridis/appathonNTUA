  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to determine whether using a brain training program in the time
      leading up to as well as after heart surgery will reduce confusion and cognitive loss that
      can occur after surgery.

    <textblock>
      Randomized, controlled pilot study with a convenience sample of 45 adult cardiac surgical
      patients. The main intervention to be studied will be the use of a neurocognitive training
      program (Lumosity) for 10 days preoperatively, and then for four weeks postoperatively. The
      prescribed regimen of training will focus on the areas of cognitive function most commonly
      affected in the postoperative period, including working memory, attention, and processing
      speed. Patients in the control arm will undergo current standard cardiac surgical
      postoperative care and will be asked to refrain from obtaining a Lumosity account.

    <measure>Postoperative Survey</measure>
    <time_frame>Postoperative visit (usually within 1 month after discharge)</time_frame>
    <description>Satisfaction with CT was assessed postoperatively at the follow up visit. Survey questions were both structured and open-ended. Quantitative scales were used to assess the level of agreement with prompted statements, using slide bars with visible anchors of &quot;strongly disagree&quot; (0), &quot;neutral&quot; (50), and &quot;strongly agree&quot; (100). The final question was only asked of the control patients to gauge their theoretical interest in using cognitive training for a future surgery.</description>

Quantitative scales were used to assess the level of agreement with prompted statements, using slide bars with visible anchors of &quot;strongly disagree&quot; (0), &quot;neutral&quot; (50), and &quot;strongly agree&quot; (100). The final question was only asked of the control patients to gauge their theoretical interest in using cognitive training for a future surgery.</description>

            <description>Patients in the Lumosity arm will be prescribed a perioperative neurocognitive training program created in collaboration with Lumos Labs, Inc. The program will contain &quot;brain games&quot; that focus on enhancing cognitive abilities in working memory, attention, and processing speed. Participants will be expected to complete at least 2, but no more than 3, 15 minute sessions of training per day. The protocol will be prescribed for 10 days preoperatively, and then for four weeks postoperatively.
