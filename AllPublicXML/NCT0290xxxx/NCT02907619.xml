  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is an open-label extension to protocol B5161002 and will provide an assessment of
      the long term safety, efficacy, pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of intravenous dosing
      of PF 06252616 in boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Approximately 105 eligible subjects
      will be assigned to receive a monthly individualized maximum tolerated dose based on their
      tolerability profile/data from B5161002. This study will not contain a placebo comparator.
      Subjects will undergo safety evaluations (Laboratory, cardiac monitoring, physical exams,
      x-ray, MRI), functional capacity evaluations (4 stair climb, range of motion, strength
      testing, Northstar Ambulatory Assessment, upper limb functional testing, six minute walk test
      and pulmonary function tests) and pharmacokinetic testing.

      <pre_assignment_details>Study B5161004 was an open-label extension (OLE) to study B5161002. The parent study B5161002 was a Phase 2, randomized, 2-period, blinded, placebo controlled study to evaluate the safety, efficacy, PK and PD of domagrozumab administered to ambulatory boys diagnosed with DMD.</pre_assignment_details>

          <title>Sequence 1</title>
          <description>In study B5161002 (parent study) participants randomized to Sequence group 1 received domagrozumab (PF-06252616) in a dose escalating fashion (5, 20 and 40 mg/kg) in Period 1. At each dose level, domagrozumab was administered over 2 hours by intravenous (IV) infusion every 4 weeks for a total of 16 weeks. In Period 2, participants received domagrozumab every 4 weeks for a total of 48 weeks at 40 mg/kg, the maximum tolerated dose identified in Period 1. There was no pause between Period 1 and Period 2 (48 weeks each). In study B5161004 (OLE) participants received domagrozumab 40 mg/kg every 4 weeks until early termination of this study. The OLE study reports participants within the treatment assignment they received in the parent study.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Dose Reduced or Temporary Discontinuation Due to AEs</title>
        <description>An adverse event (AE) was any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a product; the event did not need to have a causal relationship with the treatment or usage. Treatment-related AEs were determined by the investigator. The number of participants with dose reduced or temporary discontinuation due to both all-causality and treatment-related AEs are presented below.</description>

            <description>In study B5161002 (parent study) participants randomized to Sequence group 3 received placebo in Period 1 (48 weeks). In Period 2, participants received domagrozumab (PF-06252616) in a dose escalating fashion (5, 20 and 40 mg/kg). At each dose level, domagrozumab was administered over 2 hours by IV infusion every 4 weeks for a total of 16 weeks. There was no pause between Period 1 and Period 2 (48 weeks each). In study B5161004 (OLE) participants received domagrozumab 40 mg/kg (the maximum tolerated dose from B5161002) every 4 weeks until early termination of this study. The OLE study reports participants within the treatment assignment they received in the parent study.</description>

          <description>An AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a product; the event did not need to have a causal relationship with the treatment or usage. TEAEs were AEs occurred following the start of treatment or AEs increasing in severity during treatment. Treatment-related TEAEs were determined by the investigator. The number of participants who discontinued from the study due to both all-causality and treatment-related TEAEs are presented below.</description>

            <description>In study B5161002 (parent study) participants randomized to Sequence group 1 received domagrozumab (PF-06252616) in a dose escalating fashion (5, 20 and 40 mg/kg) in Period 1. At each dose level, domagrozumab was administered over 2 hours by intravenous (IV) infusion every 4 weeks for a total of 16 weeks. In Period 2, participants received domagrozumab every 4 weeks for a total of 48 weeks at 40 mg/kg, the maximum tolerated dose identified in Period 1. There was no pause between Period 1 and Period 2 (48 weeks each). In study B5161004 (OLE) participants received domagrozumab 40 mg/kg every 4 weeks until early termination of this study. The OLE study reports participants within the treatment assignment they received in the parent study.</description>

In study B5161004 (OLE) participants received domagrozumab 40 mg/kg (the maximum tolerated dose from B5161002) every 4 weeks until early termination of this study. The OLE study reports participants within the treatment assignment they received in the parent study.</description>

At each dose level, domagrozumab was administered over 2 hours by intravenous (IV) infusion every 4 weeks for a total of 16 weeks. In Period 2, participants received domagrozumab every 4 weeks for a total of 48 weeks at 40 mg/kg, the maximum tolerated dose identified in Period 1. There was no pause between Period 1 and Period 2 (48 weeks each). In study B5161004 (OLE) participants received domagrozumab 40 mg/kg every 4 weeks until early termination of this study. The OLE study reports participants within the treatment assignment they received in the parent study.</description>

            <description>In study B5161002 (parent study) participants randomized to Sequence group 1 received domagrozumab (PF-06252616) in a dose escalating fashion (5, 20 and 40 mg/kg) in Period 1. At each dose level, domagrozumab was administered over 2 hours by intravenous (IV) infusion every 4 weeks for a total of 16 weeks. In Period 2, participants received domagrozumab every 4 weeks for a total of 48 weeks at 40 mg/kg, the maximum tolerated dose identified in Period 1. There was no pause between Period 1 and Period 2 (48 weeks each). In study B5161004 (OLE) participants received domagrozumab 40 mg/kg every 4 weeks until early termination of this study. The OLE study reports participants within the treatment assignment they received in the parent study.</description>

At each dose level, domagrozumab was administered over 2 hours by IV infusion every 4 weeks for a total of 16 weeks. There was no pause between Period 1 and Period 2 (48 weeks each). In study B5161004 (OLE) participants received domagrozumab 40 mg/kg (the maximum tolerated dose from B5161002) every 4 weeks until early termination of this study. The OLE study reports participants within the treatment assignment they received in the parent study.</description>

        <title>Summary of Pubertal Development by Tanner Stage</title>
        <description>Tanner staging was performed before the first dose of this study to monitor for signs of accelerated sexual development. The physical changes in pubertal development (pubic hair, penis and testes) were assessed using the system described by Marshall and Tanner. Stage 1 is preadolescent, Stages 2, 3, and 4 are initiation of puberty and Stage 5 is mature adult. Details about the system can be referred to Tanner JM. Growth at Adolescence. Blackwell Scientific Publications 1962; 2nd edition.
Participant's Week 97 visit within study B5161002 (parent study) was collected as screening data.
Baseline was defined as the last assessment prior to dosing on Day 1 in B5161004. Week 1 was counted starting from the study treatment in study B5161004.</description>

At each dose level, domagrozumab was administered over 2 hours by intravenous (IV) infusion every 4 weeks for a total of 16 weeks. In Period 2, participants received domagrozumab every 4 weeks for a total of 48 weeks at 40 mg/kg, the maximum tolerated dose identified in Period 1. There was no pause between Period 1 and Period 2 (48 weeks each). In study B5161004 (OLE) participants received domagrozumab 40 mg/kg every 4 weeks until early termination of this study.

        <title>Change From Baseline in Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) by Cardiac MRI - B5161004 Baseline</title>
        <description>The LVEF was the ratio of blood ejected during systole to blood in the ventricle at the end of diastole. LVEF was measured by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or echocardiography. The same method of cardiac imaging was used consistently for each participant. Cardiac MRIs were read by a central imaging vendor, while echocardiograms were read locally (at each site). The table presents the results from cardiac MRIs. Baseline was defined as the last assessment prior to dosing on Day 1 in B5161004. Week 1 was counted starting from the study treatment in study B5161004.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline and Week 49.</time_frame>
        <population>Analysis population included all participants who had received at least 1 dose of study medication in current study B5161004. Number of participants analyzed signifies number of participants who were evaluable for this outcome measure. Number analyzed refers to number of participants evaluable for specified rows of categories.</population>

            <description>In study B5161002 (parent study) participants randomized to Sequence group 3 received placebo in Period 1 (48 weeks). In Period 2, participants received domagrozumab (PF-06252616) in a dose escalating fashion (5, 20 and 40 mg/kg). At each dose level, domagrozumab was administered over 2 hours by IV infusion every 4 weeks for a total of 16 weeks. There was no pause between Period 1 and Period 2 (48 weeks each). In study B5161004 (OLE) participants received domagrozumab 40 mg/kg (the maximum tolerated dose from B5161002) every 4 weeks until early termination of this study.

          <description>Bone age assessment was evaluated by the ratio of the bone age to the chronological age using the X rays of the hand and wrist. Ratio of bone age to chronological age was calculated by bone age/chronological age at scan date. Chronological age at scan date was calculated by (scan date - date of birth + 1)/365.25.
Baseline was defined as the last assessment prior to dosing on Day 1 in B5161004. Week 1 was counted starting from the study treatment in study B5161004.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Suicidal Ideation or Suicidal Behavior</title>
        <description>The Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) was performed to identify the risk of suicide ideation or behavior. C-SSRS was conducted with the participant's caregiver/legal guardian on the participant's behalf throughout the study, rather than administering this evaluation directly with the study participants. If at any visit the participant endorsed a 4 or 5 on the C-SSRS ideation section or reported any suicidality behavior, then an evaluation of suicide risk (risk assessment) had to be completed and the participant must have been discontinued. The significant result of C-SSRS was determined by the investigator.</description>

            <description>In study B5161002 (parent study) participants randomized to Sequence group 3 received placebo in Period 1 (48 weeks). In Period 2, participants received domagrozumab (PF-06252616) in a dose escalating fashion (5, 20 and 40 mg/kg). At each dose level, domagrozumab was administered over 2 hours by IV infusion every 4 weeks for a total of 16 weeks. There was no pause between Period 1 and Period 2 (48 weeks each). In study B5161004 (OLE) participants received domagrozumab 40 mg/kg (the maximum tolerated dose from B5161002) every 4 weeks until early termination of this study. The OLE study reports participants within the treatment assignment they received in the parent study.</description>

          <title>Number of Participants With Suicidal Ideation or Suicidal Behavior</title>
          <description>The Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) was performed to identify the risk of suicide ideation or behavior. C-SSRS was conducted with the participant's caregiver/legal guardian on the participant's behalf throughout the study, rather than administering this evaluation directly with the study participants. If at any visit the participant endorsed a 4 or 5 on the C-SSRS ideation section or reported any suicidality behavior, then an evaluation of suicide risk (risk assessment) had to be completed and the participant must have been discontinued. The significant result of C-SSRS was determined by the investigator.</description>

            <description>In study B5161002 (parent study) participants randomized to Sequence group 3 received placebo in Period 1 (48 weeks). In Period 2, participants received domagrozumab (PF-06252616) in a dose escalating fashion (5, 20 and 40 mg/kg). At each dose level, domagrozumab was administered over 2 hours by IV infusion every 4 weeks for a total of 16 weeks. There was no pause between Period 1 and Period 2 (48 weeks each). In study B5161004 (OLE) participants received domagrozumab 40 mg/kg (the maximum tolerated dose from B5161002) every 4 weeks until early termination of this study. The OLE study reports participants within the treatment assignment they received in the parent study.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline on the 4SC - Overall Baseline</title>
          <description>The 4SC quantified the time required for a participant to ascend 4 standard steps. The functional assessment of 4SC was conducted by a physiotherapist (or exercise physiologist). In order to provide optimal testing conditions and consistency in endpoint measurements, the functional assessments were completed at approximately the same time of day.
This is the overall change from baseline which included the change since enrolling in the parent study B5161002.
Overall baseline was defined as the last pre-dose assessment prior to the first day of dosing in study B5161002. Week 1 was counted starting from the study treatment in study B5161002.</description>
          <population>The analysis population included all participants who had received at least 1 dose of study medication in current study B5161004. Number of participants analyzed signifies number of participants who were evaluable for this outcome measure. Number analyzed refers to number of participants evaluable for specified rows of categories.</population>

        <population>The analysis population included all participants who had received at least 1 dose of study medication in current study B5161004. Number of participants analyzed signifies number of participants who were evaluable for this outcome measure.

At each dose level, domagrozumab was administered over 2 hours by intravenous (IV) infusion every 4 weeks for a total of 16 weeks. In Period 2, participants received domagrozumab every 4 weeks for a total of 48 weeks at 40 mg/kg, the maximum tolerated dose identified in Period 1. There was no pause between Period 1 and Period 2 (48 weeks each). In study B5161004 (OLE) participants received domagrozumab 40 mg/kg every 4 weeks until early termination of this study. The OLE study reports participants within the treatment assignment they received in the parent study.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline on the FVC - Overall Baseline</title>
        <description>Forced vital capacity (FVC) was measured using the FVC maneuver by spirometry to evaluate respiratory muscle function. The best (largest) FVC measurement from a set of 3 was captured on the database. This is the overall change from baseline which included the change since enrolling in the parent study B5161002.
Overall baseline was defined as the last pre-dose assessment prior to the first day of dosing in study B5161002. Week 1 was counted starting from the study treatment in study B5161002.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 9,17,25,33,41,49,57,65,73,81,89,97,110,122,146,170.</time_frame>
        <population>The analysis population included all participants who had received at least 1 dose of study medication in current study B5161004. Number of participants analyzed signifies number of participants who were evaluable for this outcome measure. Number analyzed refers to number of participants evaluable for specified rows of categories.</population>

            <description>In study B5161002 (parent study) participants randomized to Sequence group 1 received domagrozumab (PF-06252616) in a dose escalating fashion (5, 20 and 40 mg/kg) in Period 1. At each dose level, domagrozumab was administered over 2 hours by intravenous (IV) infusion every 4 weeks for a total of 16 weeks. In Period 2, participants received domagrozumab every 4 weeks for a total of 48 weeks at 40 mg/kg, the maximum tolerated dose identified in Period 1. There was no pause between Period 1 and Period 2 (48 weeks each). In study B5161004 (OLE) participants received domagrozumab 40 mg/kg every 4 weeks until early termination of this study. The OLE study reports participants within the treatment assignment they received in the parent study.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline on the Northstar Ambulatory Assessment (NSAA) Score - B5161004 Baseline</title>
        <description>The NSAA was a 17-item test that measured gross motor function. Each individual item was evaluated with either 0-unable to perform independently, 1-able to perform with assistance, 2-able to perform without assistance. A total score was achieved by summing all the individual items. The total score could range from 0 to 34 (fully-independent function).
Baseline was defined as the last assessment prior to dosing on Day 1 in B5161004. Week 1 was counted starting from the study treatment in study B5161004.</description>

        <population>The analysis population included all participants who had received at least 1 dose of study medication in current study B5161004. Number of participants analyzed signifies number of participants who were evaluable for this outcome measure.

        <title>Change From Baseline on the NSAA Score - Overall Baseline</title>
        <description>The NSAA was a 17-item test that measured gross motor function. Each individual item was evaluated with either 0-unable to perform independently, 1-able to perform with assistance, 2-able to perform without assistance. A total score was achieved by summing all the individual items. The total score could range from 0 to 34 (fully-independent function). This is the overall change from baseline which included the change since enrolling in the parent study B5161002.
Overall baseline was defined as the last pre-dose assessment prior to the first day of dosing in study B5161002. Week 1 was counted starting from the study treatment in study B5161002.</description>

            <description>In study B5161002 (parent study) participants randomized to Sequence group 3 received placebo in Period 1 (48 weeks). In Period 2, participants received domagrozumab (PF-06252616) in a dose escalating fashion (5, 20 and 40 mg/kg). At each dose level, domagrozumab was administered over 2 hours by IV infusion every 4 weeks for a total of 16 weeks. There was no pause between Period 1 and Period 2 (48 weeks each). In study B5161004 (OLE) participants received domagrozumab 40 mg/kg (the maximum tolerated dose from B5161002) every 4 weeks until early termination of this study. The OLE study reports participants within the treatment assignment they received in the parent study.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline on the NSAA Score - Overall Baseline</title>
          <description>The NSAA was a 17-item test that measured gross motor function. Each individual item was evaluated with either 0-unable to perform independently, 1-able to perform with assistance, 2-able to perform without assistance. A total score was achieved by summing all the individual items. The total score could range from 0 to 34 (fully-independent function). This is the overall change from baseline which included the change since enrolling in the parent study B5161002.
Overall baseline was defined as the last pre-dose assessment prior to the first day of dosing in study B5161002. Week 1 was counted starting from the study treatment in study B5161002.</description>
          <population>The analysis population included all participants who had received at least 1 dose of study medication in current study B5161004. Number of participants analyzed signifies number of participants who were evaluable for this outcome measure. Number analyzed refers to number of participants evaluable for specified rows of categories.</population>

        <description>Rise from supine was a timed functional test within NSAA. This test of time-to-stand from supine was analyzed separately for summary tabulation along with the total NSAA score.
Baseline was defined as the last assessment prior to dosing on Day 1 in B5161004. Week 1 was counted starting from the study treatment in study B5161004.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 13, 25, 49, 73.</time_frame>
        <population>The analysis population included all participants who had received at least 1 dose of study medication in current study B5161004. Number of participants analyzed signifies number of participants who were evaluable for this outcome measure. Number analyzed refers to number of participants evaluable for specified rows of categories.</population>

            <description>In study B5161002 (parent study) participants randomized to Sequence group 1 received domagrozumab (PF-06252616) in a dose escalating fashion (5, 20 and 40 mg/kg) in Period 1. At each dose level, domagrozumab was administered over 2 hours by intravenous (IV) infusion every 4 weeks for a total of 16 weeks. In Period 2, participants received domagrozumab every 4 weeks for a total of 48 weeks at 40 mg/kg, the maximum tolerated dose identified in Period 1. There was no pause between Period 1 and Period 2 (48 weeks each). In study B5161004 (OLE) participants received domagrozumab 40 mg/kg every 4 weeks until early termination of this study. The OLE study reports participants within the treatment assignment they received in the parent study.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline on the NSAA - Time to Stand From Supine - Overall Baseline</title>
        <description>Rise from supine was a timed functional test within NSAA. This test of time-to-stand from supine was analyzed separately for summary tabulation along with the total NSAA score. This is the overall change from baseline which included the change since enrolling in the parent study B5161002.
Overall baseline was defined as the last pre-dose assessment prior to the first day of dosing in study B5161002. Week 1 was counted starting from the study treatment in study B5161002.</description>

        <population>The analysis population included all participants who had received at least 1 dose of study medication in current study B5161004. Number of participants analyzed signifies number of participants who were evaluable for this outcome measure. Number analyzed refers to number of participants evaluable for specified rows of categories.</population>

            <description>In study B5161002 (parent study) participants randomized to Sequence group 1 received domagrozumab (PF-06252616) in a dose escalating fashion (5, 20 and 40 mg/kg) in Period 1. At each dose level, domagrozumab was administered over 2 hours by intravenous (IV) infusion every 4 weeks for a total of 16 weeks. In Period 2, participants received domagrozumab every 4 weeks for a total of 48 weeks at 40 mg/kg, the maximum tolerated dose identified in Period 1. There was no pause between Period 1 and Period 2 (48 weeks each). In study B5161004 (OLE) participants received domagrozumab 40 mg/kg every 4 weeks until early termination of this study. The OLE study reports participants within the treatment assignment they received in the parent study.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline on the NSAA - Time to Complete 10 m Run/Walk - B5161004 Baseline</title>
        <description>A time to event analysis was performed for loss of ambulation. Loss of ambulation was defined as the inability to walk unassisted and without braces for at least 10 m, as assessed and reported by the investigator at each study visit, and confirmed by the inability to walk/run 10 m (as 1 component of the NSAA) evaluated at the next visit at which timed function tests were performed.
Baseline was defined as the last assessment prior to dosing on Day 1 in B5161004. Week 1 was counted starting from the study treatment in study B5161004.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 13, 25, 49, 73.</time_frame>
        <population>The analysis population included all participants who had received at least 1 dose of study medication in current study B5161004. Number of participants analyzed signifies number of participants who were evaluable for this outcome measure. Number analyzed refers to number of participants evaluable for specified rows of categories.</population>

        <title>Change From Baseline on the Ankle Range of Motion (ROM) - B5161004 Baseline</title>
        <description>ROM of the ankle was evaluated by goniometry and any occurrences of ankle contractures were recorded. In order to provide optimal testing conditions and consistency in endpoint measurements, the functional assessment of ankle ROM was completed at approximately the same time of day.
Baseline was defined as the last assessment prior to dosing on Day 1 in B5161004. Week 1 was counted starting from the study treatment in study B5161004.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 13, 25, 49 and 73.</time_frame>
        <population>The analysis population included all participants who had received at least 1 dose of study medication in current study B5161004. Number of participants analyzed signifies number of participants who were evaluable for this outcome measure. Number analyzed refers to number of participants evaluable for specified rows of categories.</population>

At each dose level, domagrozumab was administered over 2 hours by intravenous (IV) infusion every 4 weeks for a total of 16 weeks. In Period 2, participants received domagrozumab every 4 weeks for a total of 48 weeks at 40 mg/kg, the maximum tolerated dose identified in Period 1. There was no pause between Period 1 and Period 2 (48 weeks each). In study B5161004 (OLE) participants received domagrozumab 40 mg/kg every 4 weeks until early termination of this study. The OLE study reports participants within the treatment assignment they received in the parent study.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline on the Ankle ROM - Overall Baseline</title>
        <description>ROM of the ankle was evaluated by goniometry and any occurrences of ankle contractures were recorded. In order to provide optimal testing conditions and consistency in endpoint measurements, the functional assessment of ankle ROM was completed at approximately the same time of day. This is the overall change from baseline which included the change since enrolling in the parent study B5161002.
Overall baseline was defined as the last pre-dose assessment prior to the first day of dosing in study B5161002. Week 1 was counted starting from the study treatment in study B5161002.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 9,17,25,33,41,49,57,65,73,81,89,97,110,122,146,170.</time_frame>
        <population>The analysis population included all participants who had received at least 1 dose of study medication in current study B5161004. Number of participants analyzed signifies number of participants who were evaluable for this outcome measure. Number analyzed refers to number of participants evaluable for specified rows of categories.</population>

At each dose level, domagrozumab was administered over 2 hours by intravenous (IV) infusion every 4 weeks for a total of 16 weeks. In Period 2, participants received domagrozumab every 4 weeks for a total of 48 weeks at 40 mg/kg, the maximum tolerated dose identified in Period 1. There was no pause between Period 1 and Period 2 (48 weeks each). In study B5161004 (OLE) participants received domagrozumab 40 mg/kg every 4 weeks until early termination of this study. The OLE study reports participants within the treatment assignment they received in the parent study.</description>

        <description>The PUL scale was used to assess motor performance of the upper limb for individuals with DMD. The PUL scale includes 22 items; an entry item defining the starting functional level, and 21 items subdivided into 3 levels; shoulder (4 items), middle (9 items) and distal (8 items). Scoring options per item may not be uniform and may vary from 0-1 to 0-6, according to the performance, with higher values corresponding to better performance. A total maximum score of 74 is achieved by adding the individual level scores; shoulder maximum 16, middle level maximum score 34 and distal level maximum score 24. In order to provide optimal testing conditions and consistency in endpoint measurements, the functional assessment of PUL was completed at approximately the same time of day.
Baseline was defined as the last assessment prior to dosing on Day 1 in B5161004. Week 1 was counted starting from the study treatment in study B5161004.</description>

        <description>The 6MWD evaluated ambulation ability by measuring the distance walked in 6 minutes. In order to provide optimal testing conditions and consistency in endpoint measurements, the functional assessment of 6MWD was completed at approximately the same time of day.
Baseline was defined as the last assessment prior to dosing on Day 1 in B5161004. Week 1 was counted starting from the study treatment in study B5161004.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 13, 25, 49 and 73.</time_frame>
        <population>The analysis population included all participants who had received at least 1 dose of study medication in current study B5161004. Number of participants analyzed signifies number of participants who were evaluable for this outcome measure. Number analyzed refers to number of participants evaluable for specified rows of categories.</population>

At each dose level, domagrozumab was administered over 2 hours by intravenous (IV) infusion every 4 weeks for a total of 16 weeks. In Period 2, participants received domagrozumab every 4 weeks for a total of 48 weeks at 40 mg/kg, the maximum tolerated dose identified in Period 1. There was no pause between Period 1 and Period 2 (48 weeks each). In study B5161004 (OLE) participants received domagrozumab 40 mg/kg every 4 weeks until early termination of this study. The OLE study reports participants within the treatment assignment they received in the parent study.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline on the 6MWD - Overall Baseline</title>
        <description>The 6MWD evaluated ambulation ability by measuring the distance walked in 6 minutes. In order to provide optimal testing conditions and consistency in endpoint measurements, the functional assessment of 6MWD was completed at approximately the same time of day. This is the overall change from baseline which included the change since enrolling in the parent study B5161002.
Overall baseline was defined as the last pre-dose assessment prior to the first day of dosing in study B5161002. Week 1 was start of the study treatment in parent study B5161002.</description>

            <description>In study B5161002 (parent study) participants randomized to Sequence group 1 received domagrozumab (PF-06252616) in a dose escalating fashion (5, 20 and 40 mg/kg) in Period 1. At each dose level, domagrozumab was administered over 2 hours by intravenous (IV) infusion every 4 weeks for a total of 16 weeks. In Period 2, participants received domagrozumab every 4 weeks for a total of 48 weeks at 40 mg/kg, the maximum tolerated dose identified in Period 1. There was no pause between Period 1 and Period 2 (48 weeks each). In study B5161004 (OLE) participants received domagrozumab 40 mg/kg every 4 weeks until early termination of this study. The OLE study reports participants within the treatment assignment they received in the parent study.</description>

        <description>The FEV1 was recorded as an absolute volume in litres and in terms of predicted values according to age, height, race and gender. The best single FEV1 measurement from a set of 3 was recorded in the database.
Baseline was defined as the last assessment prior to dosing on Day 1 in B5161004. Week 1 was counted starting from the study treatment in study B5161004.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 13, 25, 49 and 73.</time_frame>
        <population>The analysis population included all participants who had received at least 1 dose of study medication in current study B5161004. Number of participants analyzed signifies number of participants who were evaluable for this outcome measure. Number analyzed refers to number of participants evaluable for specified rows of categories.</population>

            <description>In study B5161002 (parent study) participants randomized to Sequence group 1 received domagrozumab (PF-06252616) in a dose escalating fashion (5, 20 and 40 mg/kg) in Period 1. At each dose level, domagrozumab was administered over 2 hours by intravenous (IV) infusion every 4 weeks for a total of 16 weeks. In Period 2, participants received domagrozumab every 4 weeks for a total of 48 weeks at 40 mg/kg, the maximum tolerated dose identified in Period 1. There was no pause between Period 1 and Period 2 (48 weeks each). In study B5161004 (OLE) participants received domagrozumab 40 mg/kg every 4 weeks until early termination of this study. The OLE study reports participants within the treatment assignment they received in the parent study.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline on the Myometry Based Muscle Strength - B5161004 Baseline</title>
        <description>Muscle strength was quantified by means of a handheld dynamometer. The following muscle groups were evaluated: knee extension, elbow flexion, elbow extension, hip abduction and shoulder abduction. 95% Confidence Interval was not calculated when less than or equal to 3 participants' data were available.
Baseline was defined as the last assessment prior to dosing on Day 1 in B5161004. Week 1 was counted starting from the study treatment in study B5161004.</description>

        <population>The analysis population included all participants who had received at least 1 dose of study medication in current study B5161004. Number of participants analyzed signifies number of participants who were evaluable for this outcome measure.

At each dose level, domagrozumab was administered over 2 hours by intravenous (IV) infusion every 4 weeks for a total of 16 weeks. In Period 2, participants received domagrozumab every 4 weeks for a total of 48 weeks at 40 mg/kg, the maximum tolerated dose identified in Period 1. There was no pause between Period 1 and Period 2 (48 weeks each). In study B5161004 (OLE) participants received domagrozumab 40 mg/kg every 4 weeks until early termination of this study. The OLE study reports participants within the treatment assignment they received in the parent study.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline on the Myometry Based Muscle Strength - Overall Baseline</title>
        <description>Muscle strength was quantified by means of a handheld dynamometer. The following muscle groups were evaluated: knee extension, elbow flexion, elbow extension, hip abduction and shoulder abduction. 95% Confidence Interval was not calculated when less than or equal to 3 participants' data were available.
Overall baseline was defined as the last pre-dose assessment prior to the first day of dosing in study B5161002. Week 1 was start of the study treatment in parent study B5161002.</description>

At each dose level, domagrozumab was administered over 2 hours by intravenous (IV) infusion every 4 weeks for a total of 16 weeks. In Period 2, participants received domagrozumab every 4 weeks for a total of 48 weeks at 40 mg/kg, the maximum tolerated dose identified in Period 1. There was no pause between Period 1 and Period 2 (48 weeks each). In study B5161004 (OLE) participants received domagrozumab 40 mg/kg every 4 weeks until early termination of this study. The OLE study reports participants within the treatment assignment they received in the parent study.</description>

          <description>In study B5161002 (parent study) participants randomized to Sequence group 1 received domagrozumab (PF-06252616) in a dose escalating fashion (5, 20 and 40 mg/kg) in Period 1. At each dose level, domagrozumab was administered over 2 hours by intravenous (IV) infusion every 4 weeks for a total of 16 weeks. In Period 2, participants received domagrozumab every 4 weeks for a total of 48 weeks at 40 mg/kg, the maximum tolerated dose identified in Period 1. There was no pause between Period 1 and Period 2 (48 weeks each). In study B5161004 (OLE) participants received domagrozumab 40 mg/kg every 4 weeks until early termination of this study. The OLE study reports participants within the treatment assignment they received in the parent study.</description>
