      Among the impairments associated to Parkinson's disease, gait disturbance is one of which
      that has the most negative impact on the independence in daily living activities and quality
      of life of people living with Parkinson's disease. Despite the considerable amount of
      research, we have no consensus about the most efficient physiotherapeutic approach to improve
      the gait disturbance. Mental practice is considered an efficient strategy to improve the
      motor performance in healthy individuals and people with stroke. However, there is scarce
      evidence about its therapeutic results to improve the gait performance in people living with
      Parkinson's disease. Thus, the aim of this study is to investigate the effects of gait mental
      practice associated to physical practice to improve the gait performance in people living
      with Parkinson's disease.

      Background: Among the impairments associated to Parkinson's disease, the gait disturbance is
      one of which that has the most negative impact on the independence in daily living activities
      and quality of life of people living with Parkinson's disease. Despite the considerable
      amount of research, we have no consensus about the most efficient physiotherapeutic approach
      to improve the gait disturbance. Mental practice is considered an efficient strategy to
      improve the motor performance in healthy individuals and people with stroke. However, there
      is scarce evidence about its therapeutic results to improve the gait performance in people
      living with Parkinson's disease.

      Objectives: To investigate the effects of mental gait practice associated with physical
      practice to improve the gait performance of people living with Parkinson's disease.

      Design: Parallel, prospective, double-blind, multicentre randomized clinical trial.

      Setting: Brazilian Parkinson Association.

      Participants: Twenty-two people living with Parkinson's disease in stages 2-3 of disease
      evolution according to Hoehn and Yahr Classification.

      Interventions: The participants will be randomly allocated in an experimental group and a
      control group. Both groups will perform 10 individual training sessions, two times per week,
      for five weeks. The training sessions consist of four blocks of mental practice intercalated
      with four blocks of physical practice of gait under different conditions. The only difference
      between the groups will be the content of mental practice blocks: the experimental group will
      perform mental practice of gait while the control group performs non-gait mental practice.

      Randomization: Participants will be randomized by ClinStat software into one of two groups:
      Experimental Group (EG), which will perform gait mental practice; and Control Group (CG),
      which will perform the non-gait mental practice.

      Statistical analysis: The training effects for each primary and secondary outcome measure
      will be analyzed for the two training conditions (i.e., control and experimental) at the four
      assessment time points (i.e., pre-intervention, 7 days post-completion and at 30 and 60-day
      follow-up) using a mixed-design ANOVA with training as the between-group factor and the
      assessment time point as the within-group factor. The effect sizes (ES) will be calculated
      for all comparisons at alpha = 0.05. A Tukey HSD post-hoc test will be used for multiple
      comparisons and p-values below 5 % will be considered as statistically significant.

    <measure>Postural Instability and Gait Difficulty Score</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Postural Instability and Gait Difficulty Score (PIGD): This recommended rating scale for evaluation of gait alterations in PD is based on 5 Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) items relevant to gait and postural instability (items 13-15, 29, and 30). The 13-15 items are based on gait performance according to PPD perspective, while 29 and 30 items are based on the motor test. It is a recent rating scale that has been used in PD, evaluated independently, which has adequate clinimetric characteristics.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Six-minute Walk Test</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The six-minute walk test (6-MWT) is a timed recommended clinically based test in which participants are asked to walk for 6 minutes, in their habitual speed, as much distance as possible. Interruptions for resting are permitted if necessary. The 6-MWT has demonstrated adequate test-retest and interrater reliability and minimal detectable change of 82 meters in PD. It may be a good predictor of the ability to independently walk outside safely.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Dynamic Gait Index</measure>
    <time_frame>up tp 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The balance during the eight gait related activities is scored in this test. These include quality of walking speed change, going around and over obstacles and stair walking, as well as the number of steps required for a pivot turn.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>30-second dual task gait</measure>
    <time_frame>up tp 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>It measures the maximal walking distance reached in 30 seconds under single task, i.e., without another concurrent task, and dual task, i.e., with a concurrent cognitive task. The cognitive task consists of speaking as many words as possible, starting with a specific character (F, S or A), presented at the beginning of test.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Trail Making Test</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>This test is constituted with two-timed parts: Part A, which involves a visual-scanning task where the participant is required to draw lines sequentially connecting consecutively numbered circles (1-25) randomly arranged on a page as fast as possible. Part B, which assesses cognitive flexibility, where the participant is asked to connect the same number of circles in an alternating sequence of numbers and letters (1, A, 2, B, etc.).</description>

    <measure>39-item Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>This scale assesses the health-related quality of life, i.e., the impact of an illness and/or treatment on patients' perception of their status of health and on subjective well-being or satisfaction with life. It evaluates 39 parameters in eight groups of issues (mobility, ADL, emotional well-being, stigma of the disease, back in the next, cognitive, communication and bodily discomfort).</description>
