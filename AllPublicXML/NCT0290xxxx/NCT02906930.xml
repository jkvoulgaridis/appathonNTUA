    <measure>Change in SF-36v2 (Acute Version) Health Survey: Scores From the 8 Domains, the Physical Component Summary (PCS) and the Mental Component Summary (MCS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0, week 26</time_frame>
    <description>SF-36 is a 36-item patient-reported survey of patient health that measures the participant's overall health-related quality of life (HRQoL). SF-36v2™ (acute version) questionnaire measured eight domains of functional health and well-being as well as two component summary scores (physical component summary (PCS) and mental component summary (MCS)). The 0-100 scale scores (where higher scores indicated a better HRQoL) from the SF-36 were converted to norm-based scores to enable a direct interpretation in relation to the distribution of the scores in the 2009 U.S. general population. In the metric of norm-based scores, 50 and 10 corresponds to the mean and standard deviation respectively of the 2009 U.S. general population. Change from baseline (week 0) in the sub-domain scores and component summary (PCS and MCS) scores were evaluated at week 26. A positive change score indicates an improvement since baseline. Results are based on the data from the in-trial observation period.</description>

    <measure>IWQOL-Lite Clinical Trial Version: Total Score of the 22 Items (Used for Validation of the Questionnaire)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0, week 26</time_frame>
    <description>The Impact of Weight on Quality of Life Clinical Trials Version (IWQOL-Lite-CT) is designed to assess the impact of changes in weight on patients' quality of life within the context of clinical trials. IWQOL-Lite-CT is a 22-item questionnaire-based instrument used to assess the impact of body weight changes on participant's overall health-related quality of life (HRQoL). All IWQOL-Lite-CT composite scores range from 0 to 100, with higher scores reflecting better levels of functioning. Results are based on the data from the in-trial observation period, which was the time period from when a participant was randomised until the final scheduled visit, including any period after initiation of rescue medication or premature discontinuation of trial product.</description>

        <title>Change in Mean 7-point SMPG Profile</title>
        <description>Change from baseline (week 0) to week 26 in mean 7-point self-measured plasma glucose (SMPG) profile. SMPG was recorded at the following 7 time points: before breakfast, 90 minutes after start of breakfast, before lunch, 90 minutes after start of lunch, before dinner, 90 minutes after dinner and at bedtime. Mean 7-point profile was defined as the area under the profile, calculated using the trapezoidal method, divided by the measurement time. The results are based on the data from the in-trial observation period. In trial observation period: the time period from when a participant was randomised until the final scheduled visit, including any period after initiation of rescue medication or premature discontinuation of trial product.</description>

          <description>Participants who achieved HbA1c less than 7.0 % without severe or blood glucose (BG) confirmed symptomatic hypoglycaemia and without weight gain (yes/no) at week 26 are presented. Severe hypoglycaemia was defined as an episode requiring assistance of another person to actively administer carbohydrate or glucagon, or take other corrective actions. BG-confirmed symptomatic hypoglycaemia was defined as an episode with plasma glucose value &lt;3.1 mmol/L with symptoms consistent with hypoglycaemia. Results are based on the data from the in-trial observation period, which was the time period from when a participant was randomised until the final scheduled visit, including any period after initiation of rescue medication or premature discontinuation of trial product</description>

        <description>Participants with physical examination findings, normal, abnormal NCS and abnormal CS at baseline (week -2) and week 26 are presented. Results are based on the data from the in-trial observation period, which was the time period from when a participant was randomised until the final scheduled visit, including any period after initiation of rescue medication or premature discontinuation of trial product. Results are presented for the following examinations: 1) Cardiovascular system; 2) Nervous system (central and peripheral); 3) Gastrointestinal system, incl. mouth; 4) General appearance; 5) Head (ears, eyes, nose), throat, neck; 6) Lymph node palpation; 7) Musculoskeletal system; 8) Respiratory system; 9) Skin; 10) Thyroid gland.</description>

        <description>Treatment emergent severe or BG confirmed symptomatic hypoglycaemic episodes were recorded during week 0 to week 31 (26-weeks treatment period + 5-weeks follow-up period). Hypoglycaemic episodes with onset during the on-treatment observation period were considered treatment-emergent. On-treatment observation period was defined as the time period when a subject was on treatment with trial product, including any period after initiation of rescue medication. Severe hypoglycaemia was defined as an episode requiring assistance of another person to actively administer carbohydrate or glucagon, or take other corrective actions. BG-confirmed symptomatic hypoglycaemia: Confirmed by a glucose value &lt;3.1 mmol/L (56 mg/dL) with symptoms consistent with hypoglycaemia.</description>

        <title>Change in SF-36v2 (Acute Version) Health Survey: Scores From the 8 Domains, the Physical Component Summary (PCS) and the Mental Component Summary (MCS)</title>
        <description>SF-36 is a 36-item patient-reported survey of patient health that measures the participant's overall health-related quality of life (HRQoL). SF-36v2™ (acute version) questionnaire measured eight domains of functional health and well-being as well as two component summary scores (physical component summary (PCS) and mental component summary (MCS)). The 0-100 scale scores (where higher scores indicated a better HRQoL) from the SF-36 were converted to norm-based scores to enable a direct interpretation in relation to the distribution of the scores in the 2009 U.S. general population. In the metric of norm-based scores, 50 and 10 corresponds to the mean and standard deviation respectively of the 2009 U.S. general population. Change from baseline (week 0) in the sub-domain scores and component summary (PCS and MCS) scores were evaluated at week 26. A positive change score indicates an improvement since baseline. Results are based on the data from the in-trial observation period.</description>

        <description>The Impact of Weight on Quality of Life Clinical Trials Version (IWQOL-Lite-CT) is designed to assess the impact of changes in weight on patients' quality of life within the context of clinical trials. IWQOL-Lite-CT is a 22-item questionnaire-based instrument used to assess the impact of body weight changes on participant's overall health-related quality of life (HRQoL). All IWQOL-Lite-CT composite scores range from 0 to 100, with higher scores reflecting better levels of functioning. Results are based on the data from the in-trial observation period, which was the time period from when a participant was randomised until the final scheduled visit, including any period after initiation of rescue medication or premature discontinuation of trial product.</description>

        <description>Patient global impression of status (PGI-S) is a 2-item questionnaire used to assess the participant's impression of physical functioning and mental health status during the clinical trial. The PGI-S contains two items evaluated on a 5-point graded response scale. Results are based on the data from the in-trial observation period, which was the time period from when a participant was randomised until the final scheduled visit, including any period after initiation of rescue medication or premature discontinuation of trial product.</description>

        <title>PGI-C Item: Scores of the Two Individual Items (Used for Validation of the IWQOL Questionnaire)</title>
        <description>Patient global impression of change (PGI-C) is a 2-item questionnaire used to assess the participant's impression of change from baseline in physical functioning and mental health status. The PGI-C contains two items evaluated on a 7-point graded response scale. Results are based on the data from the in-trial observation period, which was the time period from when a participant was randomised until the final scheduled visit, including any period after initiation of rescue medication or premature discontinuation of trial product.</description>
