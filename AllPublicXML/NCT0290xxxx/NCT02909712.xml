  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) is currently recommended by the World Health Organization for
      use as intermittent preventive treatment against malaria in pregnancy (IPTp) in areas of
      moderate to high malaria transmission. However, in some locales malaria parasites have lost
      sensitivity to SP, compromising its protective effect. Dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DP) is
      a candidate replacement for SP. This trial is designed to confirm the cardio-safety of DP
      compared to SP amongst pregnant women in Tanzania.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The trial hypothesis is that DP will increase the time between the start of the Q wave and
      the end of the T wave in the heart's electrical cycle, a phenomenon referred to as QT
      prolongation, in the study population. However, if QT prolongation is observed, it is
      expected to be time-limited and of no clinical consequence.

      The QT interval, measured in milliseconds (MS) will be corrected (QTc) to account for natural
      heart rate (HR) extremes. The Fridericia formula will also be used to correct (QTcF) for
      variation in cardio-contraction. As part of the electrocardiogram (ECG), the period from the
      beginning of the P wave to the beginning of the QRS complex (PR interval) will be measured,
      as well as the ST-segment which connects the QRS complex and the T wave.

      Prolongation of the QT interval will be estimated when peak drug-concentrations are most
      likely to be found in the peripheral blood as measured using pharmacokinetic (PK) techniques.
      Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods will be used for genetic sequencing of molecular
      markers (A581G) associated with malaria parasite drug resistance to SP. The rapid diagnostic
      test (RDT) CareStart™ will be used to screen pregnant women attending antenatal care.
