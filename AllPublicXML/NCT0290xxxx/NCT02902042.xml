    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the influence of maintenance therapy on progression-free survival
      (PFS) and overall survival (OS) after combination therapy with BRAF/MEK (MAP-ERK kinase)
      inhibitors and PD-1 antibody pembrolizumab.

      In the safety phase I part the optimal dose of pembrolizumab in combination with BRAF
      inhibitor and MEK inhibitor and the safety of this three-drugs-combination regime will be
      determined.

      In the randomized part 2 different maintenance therapies will be tested for toxicity and
      efficacy. Patients with disease control after 6 months of triple therapy will be randomized
      to receive 2 different maintenance therapies further on, either continuation of triple
      therapy or administration of pembrolizumab alone.

      There is growing interest to understand the best strategies to use targeted therapies and
      novel immunotherapy for the treatment of advanced melanoma. This study will explore the
      combination of encorafenib plus binimetinib with the PD-1 antibody pembrolizumab in patients
      with BRAF mutant melanoma. Combination of two clinically effective approaches, targeting the
      mutant BRAF pathway by BRAF/MEK inhibition and modulating immunological checkpoint control by
      administration of a PD-1 antibody, should prolong PFS and OS even further. This study will
      investigate the influence of maintenance therapy on PFS and OS after triple therapy. Patients
      with disease control after 6 months of triple therapy will be randomized to receive 2
      different maintenance therapies further on to investigate if administration of pembrolizumab
      only is sufficient for maintenance of disease control. For reasons of safety a phase I study
      is performed to determine the optimal dosing and schedule of the combination therapy
      (encorafenib, binimetinib, pembrolizumab).

      In the phase II-part, patient will receive triple therapy with the doses defined in phase I
      for a 6 months induction period. Patients with complete or partial response or stable disease
      after the 6 months period will be randomized for maintenance therapy:

      Arm A: Therapy as in induction period. Arm B: Therapy with pembrolizumab only with a dose of
      200 mg every 3 weeks.
