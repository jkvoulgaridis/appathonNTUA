    <textblock>
      Neck pain is a complex biopsychosocial disorder often precipitated or aggravated by neck
      movements or sustained neck postures. The onset and course of this pain is influenced by
      environmental and personal factors.Many studies report that participants preferred self-care
      measures for the management of neck pain and they sought professional help only when those
      measures fail.

    <textblock>
      Neck pain is the fourth leading cause of disability worldwide causing an enormous impact on
      individuals and their families, communities and healthcare systems.While neck pain can be
      severely disabling and costly, treatment options have shown moderate evidence of
      effectiveness. No previous study has used foam roller in patients with neck pain. In
      addition, it has been suggested that neurodynamic interventions provide a peripheral
      stimulus, reducing the pressure existing within the nerve, improving blood flow, axonal
      transport and nerve conduction. It was hypothesized that a self-administered intervention
      focused on myofascial release of main muscles related to neck pain and upper-limb active
      neurodynamics could reduce the presence of active trigger points and pain, improving
      functionality and active mobility.

    <measure>Disability</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline pain at 3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Disability will be explored using the Neck Disability Index. The patients rated their current pain and average pain over the past week on a 0-10 numerical rating scale</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain severity</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline pain at 3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Pain will be assessed using the Brief Pain Inventory. It measures the degree of interference of pain with various aspects of life, including mobility and social activities (reactive pain) and pain severity (sensory pain).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Health related quality of life</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline health related quality of life at 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Health related quality of life will be measured by euroQol-5D. It contains two sections, a descriptive section and a valuation section.</description>

    <measure>Fear avoidance beliefs</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline fear avoidance beliefs at 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Fear avoidance beliefs will be assessed by the the Fear Avoidance Beliefs Questionnaire (FABQ). It consists of 16 sentences related to physical activity (first 5 items) and work (last 11 items).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Anxiety and depression</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline anxiety and depression at 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Anxiety and depression was evaluated by the the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HAD).It contains 14 items describing symptoms of depression (7 items) and anxiety (7 items)</description>

    <description>The intervention consisted of 45-minute manual therapy sessions. Manual therapy included &quot;hands-on&quot; muscular mobilization techniques (aimed at improving soft tissue function), specific articular mobilization techniques (to improve overall joint function and decrease any restrictions in movement at single or multiple segmental levels in the cervical spine), and coordination or stabilization techniques (to improve postural control, coordination, and movement patterns by using the stabilizing cervical musculature)</description>

    <description>One session was a session supervised by a physical therapist in the Faculty of Health Sciences. The program contents were educative information about chronic neck pain and healthy lifestyle habits (application of local heat/cold, and sleeping face down, using correct sitting posture, alternating body position, and using correct lifting technique (â€¦), which were complemented by a problem-based session.</description>
