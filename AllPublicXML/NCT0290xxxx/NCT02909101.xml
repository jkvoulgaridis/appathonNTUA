  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of a cognitive training program in
      persons with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection who have used cocaine. This study
      tests the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of a computerized cognitive training program
      to improve working memory and decrease impulsivity (delay discounting) among HIV-infected
      individuals.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Of the 1.2 million Americans living with HIV, over half experience neurocognitive impairments
      (NCI) that adversely affect daily living and are predictive of increased morbidity and
      mortality. HIV-infected individuals who are addicted to stimulant drugs like cocaine are at
      even higher risk for NCI, which contributes to impulsive decision making, and engage in high
      rates of risky behaviors that are associated with both poor clinical outcomes and HIV
      transmission to others. Delay discounting, a key aspect of impulsivity, describes the
      tendency to devalue a reward as the delay to its receipt increases. Individuals addicted to
      drugs tend to prefer smaller, immediate rewards over larger, delayed rewards. Excessive
      discounting is associated with a wide range of other health risk behaviors, including risky
      sex. The Competing Neurobehavioral Decision Systems model posits that excessive discounting
      results from greater relative strength of the impulsive system over the executive control
      system. The investigators' own work suggests that HIV infection modulates the effect of
      cocaine on brain functioning in the executive control network during delay discounting. Prior
      research supports a robust association between excessive discounting and working memory
      impairment. As a core executive function that supports self-regulation, working memory is
      theoretically an intervention target for HIV risk reduction. Computerized working memory
      training has been shown to decrease delay discounting in stimulant users, but it has not yet
      been tested in HIV-infected drug users. The proposed R21 study will test the preliminary
      efficacy of a computerized cognitive training program to improve working memory and reduce
      delay discounting in HIV-infected cocaine users. Using a randomized trial design, the
      investigators will assign 50 participants to either the experimental cognitive training
      condition or an attention-matched control condition. Participants will complete 48 sessions
      in 8 weeks, with assessments at baseline, post-training, and 1-month follow-up to evaluate
      intervention effects. The investigators hypothesize that cognitive training will, relative to
      the control condition, lead to greater improvements in working memory and reductions in delay
      discounting. The investigators will also examine change in HIV risk behaviors (cocaine use,
      risky sex, and medication adherence). Results will support an R01 application for a larger
      scale trial to rigorously test the impact of cognitive training on HIV-related behavioral and
      clinical outcomes. This innovative line of research has important translational implications
      for HIV clinical practice, including dissemination in resource-limited settings with few
      neuropsychology specialists. This proposal directly advances a high priority topic for
      AIDS-designated funding by testing a novel treatment for HIV-associated NCI in drug users. By
      focusing on a high-risk population that continues to drive HIV transmission, this research
      has strong potential to improve neurobehavioral functioning in HIV-infected persons, and
      ultimately to reduce the incidence of new HIV infections.

    <measure>Working Memory Assessed by Domain Deficit Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; post-training, approximately 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Measured by domain deficit score, which is a continuous measure of overall impairment on the domain. 0 means no impairment and 5 means highest possible impairment.</description>

    <measure>Delay Discounting, Measured by the Monetary Choice Questionnaire (MCQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; post-training, approximately 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Monetary Choice Questionnaire (MCQ) is a standardized delay discounting task. Because scores are on a logarithmic scale, they were rank ordered for analysis. Ranks range from 1 to 13, with higher ranks meaning higher impulsivity.</description>

    <measure>Acceptability as Measured by Participant Ratings</measure>
    <time_frame>Post-training, approximately 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Participants rated how satisfied they found the intervention on a 5 point scale (with 1 being very dissatisfied and 5 being very satisfied). Acceptability was defined a priori of achieving a mean rating of &gt;3.5 on the 5 point scale.</description>

    <measure>Acceptability as Measured by Participant Perception of Benefits and Barriers to Completing Sessions</measure>
    <time_frame>Post-training, approximately 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Participants rated how helpful they found the intervention on a 5 point scale (with 1 being very unhelpful and 5 being very helpful). Acceptability was defined a priori of achieving a mean rating of &gt;3.5 on the 5 point scale for helpfulness.</description>

    <measure>Percent Medication Adherence Across All Antiretroviral Medications</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; post-training, approximately 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>0% indicates no doses of medications were taken, and 100% means all doses were taken.</description>

    <measure>Sexual Risk Behavior as Measured by the Risk Assessment Battery (RAB)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; post-training, approximately 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The RAB is a standardized survey. Scores range from 0 to 18, with higher scores meaning greater sexual risk.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline; post-training, approximately 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Timeline Followback Method involves asking subjects to retrospectively estimate their cocaine use 30 days prior to the interview date. Responses therefore range from 0 to 30 days.</description>

          <title>Wechsler Test of Adult Reading (WTAR)</title>
          <description>A word reading test that estimates premorbid verbal Intelligence Quotient (IQ). An intelligence quotient is a total score derived from several standardized tests designed to assess human intelligence. The WTAR comprises 50 words with irregular pronunciations that participants read aloud. The raw score on the WTAR ranges from 0 to 50. The raw score is transformed to an age-adjusted standard score (range 50-134), which is on the same scale as a full IQ test (M = 100; SD = 15). The age-adjusted standard WTAR score is used to provide an estimate for the full-scale IQ and is reported here.</description>
