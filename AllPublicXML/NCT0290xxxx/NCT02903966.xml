  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is the first experience with GSK2982772, a receptor-interacting protein-1 (RIP1)
      kinase inhibitor, in subjects with active ulcerative colitis (UC). The primary objective will
      be to investigate the safety and tolerability of repeat oral doses of GSK2982772 60 mg or
      placebo three times daily for 42 days (Part A) followed by open label with GSK298772 60 mg
      three times daily for 42 days (Part B). In addition to pharmacokinetics (PK), a number of
      experimental and clinical endpoints will be employed to obtain information on the
      pharmacodynamics (PD), and preliminary efficacy in subjects with active UC. Although no
      formal hypothesis will be tested, these endpoints will enable a broader understanding of the
      mechanism of action and potential for clinical efficacy of GSK2982772 in UC. Within 30 Days
      of screening visit, subjects will be randomized to receive either GSK2982772 60 mg or placebo
      orally three times daily for 42 Days (6 weeks) in a 2:1 ratio in Part A study. Subjects who
      complete the Part A study will move to open label Part B study to receive GSK2982772 60 mg
      three times daily for an additional 42 Days (6 weeks). After the open label (Part B)
      treatment period, subjects will enter the Follow-up period which lasts for 28 Days (+/- 3
      Days) post the last administration of study medication. The total duration of participation
      in the study will be approximately 20 Weeks from screening to the last study visit.

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>This study evaluated the safety and tolerability of repeat oral doses of GSK2982772 60 milligram (mg) or placebo three times daily (TID) in Part A (double blind [DB]) followed by GSK2982772 60 mg TID in Part B open label extension (OL) in active ulcerative colitis (UC) participants.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>A total of 77 participants were screened, of which 36 eligible participants were enrolled (41 were screening failure). All 36 participants were randomized to receive GSK2982772 60 mg or Placebo in Part A of the study.</pre_assignment_details>

There was no wash out period in between Part A and B. All participants were followed up until Day 112. 1 participant was randomized to receive BID regimen instead of TID regimen prior to protocol amendment; however, BID and TID are presented in the same arm because the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile is comparable for BID &amp; TID regimen.</description>

        <description>Clinical chemistry parameters with their PCI ranges were: AST, ALT, and ALP (high: &gt;=2 ULN [U/L]); calcium (low: &lt;2 mmol/L and high: &gt;2.75 mmol/L); glucose (low: &lt;3 and high: &gt;9 mmol/L); potassium (low: &lt;3 and high: &gt;5.5 mmol/L); sodium (low: &lt;130 and high: &gt;150 mmol/L); total bilirubin (high: &gt;=1.5 times ULN [µmol/L]); HDL 0.9 to 99.99 mmol/L; LDL 0.to 3.35 mmol/L; triglycerides 0 to 2.24 mmol/L, creatinine (high: change from BL &gt;44.2 µmol/L). Participants were counted in the worst case category that their value changed to (low, within range or no change, or high) unless there was no change in their category. Participants whose value category was unchanged (e.g., High to High), or whose value became within range, were recorded in the 'To within Range or No Change' category.</description>

        <description>Hematology parameters with their PCI ranges were: hematocrit (high: &gt;0.54 proportion of red blood cells in blood and low: change from BL&lt;0.075); hemoglobin (high: &gt;180 grams per liter [g/L] and low: change from BL&lt;25 g/L); lymphocytes (low: &lt;0.8 Giga cells/L); platelet count (low: &lt;100 Giga cells/L and high: &gt;550 Giga cells/L); neutrophil count (low: &lt;1.5 Giga cells/L); white blood cell (WBC) count (low: &lt;3 Giga cells/L and high: &gt;20 Giga cells/L). Participants were counted in the worst-case category that their value changed to (low, within range or no change, or high) unless there was no change in their category. Participants whose value category was unchanged (e.g., High to High), or whose value became within range, were recorded in the 'To within Range or No Change' category. Participants were counted twice if the participant had both values that changed 'To Low' and 'To High'.</description>

        <description>Hematology parameters with their PCI ranges were: hematocrit (high: &gt;0.54 proportion of red blood cells in blood and low: change from BL&lt;0.075); hemoglobin (high: &gt;180 g/L and low: change from BL&lt;25 g/L); lymphocytes (low: &lt;0.8 Giga cells/L); platelet count (low: &lt;100 Giga cells/L and high: &gt;550 Giga cells/L); neutrophil count (low: &lt;1.5 Giga cells/L); WBC count (low: &lt;3 Giga cells/L and high: &gt;20 Giga cells/L). Participants were counted in the worst-case category that their value changed to (low, within range or no change, or high) unless there was no change in their category. Participants whose value category was unchanged (e.g., High to High), or whose value became within range, were recorded in the 'To within Range or No Change' category. Participants were counted twice if the participant had both values that changed 'To Low' and 'To High'.</description>

        <title>Part A: Number of Participants With Worst Case Abnormal Urinalysis Results by Dipstick Method</title>
        <description>Urine samples were collected for the assessment of following urine parameters by dipstick method: glucose, protein, blood and ketones. The dipstick test gives results in a semi-quantitative manner, and results for urinalysis parameters of urine glucose, protein, blood and ketones can be read as negative (-), trace, 1+, 2+, 3+, 4+, 5+ indicating proportional concentrations in the urine sample. Number of participants with abnormal results were reported as 'increase to trace' or 'increase to 1+, 2+, 3+, 4+, 5+' relative to BL (Day 1) value. Participants whose value was unchanged (e.g., Trace to Trace), or whose value was decreased, were recorded in the 'No change or Decreased' category.</description>

        <title>Part B: Number of Participants With Worst Case Abnormal Urinalysis Results by Dipstick Method</title>
        <description>Urine samples were collected for the assessment of following urine parameters by dipstick method: glucose, protein, blood and ketones. The dipstick test gives results in a semi-quantitative manner, and results for urinalysis parameters of urine glucose, protein, blood and ketones can be read as negative (-), trace, 1+, 2+, 3+, 4+, 5+ indicating proportional concentrations in the urine sample. Number of participants with abnormal results were reported as 'increase to trace' or 'increase to 1+, 2+, 3+, 4+, 5+' relative to BL (Day 1) value. Participants whose value was unchanged (e.g., Trace to Trace), or whose value was decreased, were recorded in the 'No change or Decreased' category.</description>

        <title>Part A: Number of Participants With Worst Case Abnormal Blood Pressure Results by PCI Criteria</title>
        <description>Vital signs were measured in a semi-supine position after 5 minutes rest and included body temperature, systolic and diastolic blood pressure. The clinical concern range for vital signs were: systolic blood pressure (SBP) (low: &lt;85 and high: &gt;160 millimeters of mercury [mmHg]); diastolic blood pressure (DBP) (low: &lt;45 and high: &gt;100 mmHg). Participants were counted in the worst case category that their value changed to (low, within range or no change, or high) unless there was no change in their category. Participants whose value category was unchanged (e.g., High to High), or whose value became within range, were recorded in the 'To within Range or No Change' category.</description>

        <description>UCEIS was used as an additional tool to assess disease activity based on 3 sub-scales: 'endoscopic vascular pattern, bleeding, erosions and ulcerations'. UCEIS total score was calculated by sum of all 3 sub-scale scores. Total score ranges from 0 to 8, with higher scores indicating more severe disease. Individual sub-scales were vascular pattern (0=Normal, 1=Patchy loss, 2=Obliterated); bleeding (0=None, 1=Mucosal, 2=Luminal mild, 3=Luminal severe); erosions and ulcerations (0=None, 1=Erosions, 2=Superficial ulcer, 3=Deep ulcer).

        <description>The MRS is a 4-point scale (none, mild, moderate and severe) which scores histologic activity based on localization and quantification of neutrophils in the mucosa. MRS Score ranges from 0 to 7, with higher scores indicates more severity. 0= Normal biopsy, 1= Lamina propria neutrophils only (Scattered individual neutrophils), 2= Lamina propria neutrophils only (Patchy collections of neutrophils), 3= Lamina propria neutrophils only (Diffuse neutrophils infiltrate), 4= Cryptitis/crypt abscesses (&lt;25% crypts involved), 5= Cryptitis/crypt abscesses (25% to 74% crypts involved), 6= Cryptitis/crypt abscesses (&gt;=75% crypts involved), 7= Erosion or ulceration present. Score 0 indicates normal condition; 1 to 3 indicates mild condition; 4 to 6 indicates moderate condition and score 7 indicates severe condition. BL is defined as the latest pre-dose assessment.

        <description>Geboes score is a 7-items instrument which classifies histologic changes and generates a score from 0 to 5.4. The 7 items are: grade 0=structural-architectural changes (scored from 0.0 to 0.3); grade 1=chronic inflammatory infiltrate (scored from 1.0 to 1.3); grade 2A=lamina propria neutrophils (scored from 2.0 to 2.3), grade 2B= lamina propria eosinophils (scored from 2.0 to 2.3); 3=neutrophils in the epithelium (scored from 3.0 to 3.3); 4=crypt destruction (scored from 4.0 to 4.3); 5=erosions or ulceration (scored from 5.0 to 5.4). The most severe observation that the histopathologist sees on the slide is considered as the Geboes index total score, ranges from 0 to 5.4, with higher scores indicates severe disease. BL is defined as the latest pre-dose assessment before Day 1. Change from BL is the value at indicated time point minus BL value.</description>

The Mayo scoring system ranges from 0 to 12, calculated as sum of 4 sub-scores, higher scores indicating more severe disease. The 4 sub-scores are stool frequency (0=normal number of stools; 1=1 to 2 stools/day more than normal; 2=3 to 4 stools/day more than normal; 3= &gt;4 stools/day more than normal); rectal bleeding (0=no blood seen; 1=visible blood with stools less than half the time; 2= visible blood with stool half the time or more; 3=passing blood alone); findings at endoscopy (0=normal or inactive disease; 1=mild disease [erythema, decreased vascular pattern, mild friability]; 2=moderate disease [marked erythema, lack of vascular pattern, friability, erosions]; 3=severe disease [spontaneous bleeding, ulceration]); and PGA (0=normal; 1=mild; 2=moderate; 3=severe).</description>
