      This study is to define the safety profile and to determine the Maximal tolerated dose
      regimen and preliminary efficacy of AbGn-107 administered every 14 days (Q2W regimen) or 28
      days (Q4W regimen) in patients with chemo-refractory locally advanced, recurrent or
      metastatic gastric, colorectal, pancreatic or biliary cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      AbGn-107 is an antibody drug conjugate (ADC) which targets an antigen (AG7 antigen) present
      in gastric, colorectal, pancreatic cancer or biliary cancer. This study is a standard 3 + 3
      dose escalation design with cohort expansion. AbGn-107 will be administered every 14 days
      (Q2W regimen) or 28 days (Q4W regimen) in patients with chemo-refractory locally advanced,
      recurrent or metastatic gastric, colorectal, pancreatic adenocarcinoma or biliary cancer. The
      primary objectives of this study are to define the safety profile and to determine the
      maximum tolerated dose regimen of AbGn-107, and the secondary objectives are to evaluate the
      pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters, the immunogenicity, and preliminary efficacy of AbGn-107.

             cancer (including cholangiocarcinoma, gallbladder and ampullary carcinomas).

               1. Patient must not have curative options available (e.g. a single metastatic focus

                    -  Progression on or following, or intolerant of, at least one prior line of
                       standard systemic therapy for advanced or metastatic gastric or pancreatic
                       or biliary cancers.

                    -  Progression on or following, or intolerant of, at least two prior lines of
                       standard systemic therapy for advanced or metastatic colorectal cancers.

                    -  Patients who have progressed/recurred following neoadjuvant/adjuvant
                       chemotherapy for earlier stage disease, if completed within the previous 6
                       months, are eligible.

          3. Archived tissue must be available for all patients (both dose escalation and expansion
             cohorts). Dose Escalation Only-If tissue is not available, patients may still be
             considered eligible for enrollment, if all other eligibility criteria are confirmed
             and after discussion with and approval by the sponsor medical monitor. Cohort

               5. Total bilirubin &lt;1.5 x ULN, except for patients with Gilbert's disease who are
                  eligible if total bilirubin ≤ 3 mg/dL.

               6. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST)/serum glutamic-oxalacetic transaminase (SGOT)
                  and alanine aminotransferase (ALT)/serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (SGPT)

             effective method of birth control during the study and for 6 months following the last
             dose of study drug. A highly effective method of birth control is defined as one which
             results in a low failure rate (less than 1% per year).

          9. Ability to provide written informed consent

         10. Life expectancy of at least 3 months.

        Exclusion Criteria:

             Grade ≥2 drug-related toxicity (except alopecia, erectile impotence, tinnitus, hot
             flashes, and loss of libido) associated with previous treatment. Inclusion of patients
             with persistent neuropathy or hearing loss Grade ≥2 due to previous treatment requires

             may be eligible, provided they have been definitively treated and are clinically
             stable, after discussion with sponsor. Treated or untreated leptomeningeal disease is
             not permitted.

          7. Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection or a known HIV-related malignancy.

             receive or tolerate the planned treatment, or interfere with the study evaluations or
             optimal participation in the study.
