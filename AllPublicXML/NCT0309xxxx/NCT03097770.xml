      RATIONALE: Placing a tumor antigen chimeric receptor that has been created in the laboratory
      into patient autologous or donor-derived T cells may make the body build immune response to
      kill cancer cells.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying genetically engineered lymphocyte therapy in
      treating patients with B-cell leukemia or lymphoma that is relapsed (after stem cell
      transplantation or intensive chemotherapy) or refractory to chemotherapy.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      To assess the efficacy of TanCAR19/20 T cells in relapsed or refractory NHL, defined as
      overall response rate (ORR).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of TanCAR19/20 T cells. II. To evaluate time to
      response (TTR), duration of overall response (DOR), progression free survival (PFS) and
      overall survival (OS).

      III. To determine in vivo expansion and persistence of TanCAR19/20 T cells.

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 group according to order of enrollment. Patients receive
      anti-CD19/20-CAR (coupled with CD137 and CD3 zeta signalling domains)vector-transduced
      autologous T cells on day1 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed intensively for 6 months, every 3
      months for 2 years, and annually thereafter for 3 years.
