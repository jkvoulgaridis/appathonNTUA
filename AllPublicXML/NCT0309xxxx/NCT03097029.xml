  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with short bowel syndrome have a high mortality rate that is mainly attributed to
      complications from central lines and long-term intravenous (IV) nutrition. There are few
      medical therapies to date that improve gut absorption in patients with short bowel syndrome.
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate if absorption from the GI tract improves
      in subjects with short bowel syndrome following therapy with pancreatic enzymes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an interventional study of subjects with short bowel syndrome to determine if enteral
      absorption improves following therapy with pancreatic enzymes. The study will assess enteral
      absorption and nutritional status at baseline through a series of stool tests, blood tests,
      and anthropometric measurements. Following approximately ten days of therapy with pancreatic
      enzymes, the study will reassess enteral absorption.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Coefficient of Fat Absorption</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 10 days</time_frame>
    <description>Coefficient of fat absorption (CFA) measures the amount of fat excreted in the stool compared to how much fat was consumed over the course of 72 hours. This is a measure of fat absorption. CFA was measured at baseline off of pancreatic enzymes and then again while on ten days of pancreatic enzyme supplementation. The change between CFA values at each timepoint was the primary outcome.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the Coefficient of Nitrogen Absorption</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 10 days</time_frame>
    <description>Coefficient of nitrogen absorption (CNA) measures the amount of nitrogen excreted in the stool compared to how much nitrogen was consumed in a 72 hour period. This is a measure of protein absorption. CNA was measured at baseline off of pancreatic enzymes and then again while on ten days of pancreatic enzyme supplementation. The change between CNA values at each timepoint was a study outcome.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Malabsorption Blood Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 10 days</time_frame>
    <description>This test will only be performed on subjects 18 years or older. This an isotope test. Subjects consume a high fat shake with two labeled fats. They have blood tests measured at baseline and then every 1 hour for 8 hours to check for serum levels of labeled fats. This helps determine how well the labeled fats are being absorbed by the intestine.</description>

          <title>Change in the Coefficient of Nitrogen Absorption</title>
          <description>Coefficient of nitrogen absorption (CNA) measures the amount of nitrogen excreted in the stool compared to how much nitrogen was consumed in a 72 hour period. This is a measure of protein absorption. CNA was measured at baseline off of pancreatic enzymes and then again while on ten days of pancreatic enzyme supplementation. The change between CNA values at each timepoint was a study outcome.</description>
          <population>3 subjects were not included in the final analysis. Two subjects did not accurately complete a three day dietary record in order to assess nitrogen intake. 1 subject submitted such a low volume of stool that it was assessed as an inaccurate and incomplete stool collection.</population>

        <title>Change in Malabsorption Blood Test</title>
        <description>This test will only be performed on subjects 18 years or older. This an isotope test. Subjects consume a high fat shake with two labeled fats. They have blood tests measured at baseline and then every 1 hour for 8 hours to check for serum levels of labeled fats. This helps determine how well the labeled fats are being absorbed by the intestine.</description>

    <reported_events>
      <time_frame>Adverse event data is collected on a daily basis for four weeks, from the time of enrollment (Visit 0), to the final follow-up call (Visit 3). The final study visit was a follow-up telephone call after the subjects were off of the study intervention, pancreatic enzymes. The purpose of this phone call was to assess for adverse events and adherence to the recommended pancreatic enzyme study dose.</time_frame>

          <title>Pancreatic Enzymes</title>
          <description>All subjects in this study will have exposure to therapy with pancreatic enzymes for a period of about ten days.
Pancreatic Enzyme: All subjects will take pancreatic enzymes at a dose appropriate for their weight. Pancreatic enzymes are used to help digest fat and other nutrients.</description>
