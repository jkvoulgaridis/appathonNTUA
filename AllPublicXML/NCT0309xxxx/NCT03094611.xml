  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well inotuzumab ozogamicin works in treating patients with
      CD22 positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia that has come back or does not respond to
      treatment. Inotuzumab ozogamicin is a monoclonal antibody, called inotuzumab, linked to a
      toxic agent called ozogamicin. Inotuzumab attaches to CD22 positive cancer cells in a
      targeted way and delivers ozogamicin to kill them.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the objective response rate of low dose of inotuzumab ozogamicin as measured
      by the hematologic remission rate (complete remission [CR] + CR with incomplete platelet
      recovery [CRp] + CR with incomplete bone marrow recovery [CRi]) in patients in first, second
      or later salvage setting.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the overall safety profile and the efficacy; the efficacy is measured by the
      hematologic response rate (CR + CRi + PR), durations of response (DoR) and remission (DoR1),
      progression free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive inotuzumab ozogamicin intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on days 1, 8 and 15 of
      cycle 1 and on days 1 and 8 beginning cycle 2. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 6
      cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients whose disease
      gets worse after responding for 3 months, may be retreated for up to 6 additional cycles.
      Patients whose disease responds to treatment may receive up to 5 additional cycles.

                  their most recent prior anti-cancer therapy,
