  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this cross-over study is to compare the relative bioavailability and
      pharmacokinetic parameters of both 10 mg conventional tablets and 5 mg dispersible tablets of
      dolutegravir (DTG) with that of 25 mg or 50 mg conventional DTG tablets. The study will be
      carried out in 2 parts. Part 1 of the study will be open-label, 2 period designs with a wash
      out period of at least 7 days between the dosing periods. Subjects will be randomized to
      receive either single dose of five 10 mg DTG tablets or one 50 mg DTG tablet in a crossover
      manner in the fasting state. Part 2 of the study will be a 3 period crossover design with a
      wash out period of at least 7 days between the dosing periods. Subjects will be randomized to
      receive either single dose of five 5 mg DTG tablets (administered as dispersed with water or
      directly to mouth) or one 25 mg DTG tablet in a crossover manner in the fasting state.
      Subjects will have a follow-up visit 7-10 days post last dose of study treatment.
      Approximately 14 healthy subjects will participate in Part 1 and approximately 24 healthy
      subjects will participate in Part 2 of the study. The total duration of Part 1 will be
      approximately 7 to 8 weeks and that of part 2 will be approximately 8 to 9 weeks.

        <description>Blood samples were collected at the indicated time points after administration of study treatment to investigate the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of DTG tablets in fasted state. PK parameters were calculated by standard non-compartmental analysis using Phoenix WinNonlin Version 6.4 or higher based on actual sampling times. The PK Population was defined as participants in the All Subjects Population for whom a PK sample was obtained and that had evaluable PK assay results.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Adverse Events AEs and Serious Adverse Events SAEs for Part 2</title>
        <description>AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical investigation participant, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose results in death, is life-threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in disability/incapacity, or is a congenital anomaly/birth defect or is medically significant. Data has been presented for AEs and SAEs up-to follow-up (36 days) in Part 2.</description>

        <description>Blood samples for the assessment of chemistry parameters were collected at Baseline and up-to follow-up (Day 25) in Part 1. Baseline was defined as pre-dose assessments performed on Day -1. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the post-dose-visit value from the Baseline value. Data has been presented for serum glucose, serum calcium, serum potassium, serum sodium, serum urea results for Part 1. Only those participants with data available at the specified time were analyzed (represented by n=x in the category titles).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Clinical Chemistry Parameters Serum Alanine Amino Transferase (ALT), Serum Alkaline Phosphatase, Serum Aspartate Amino Transferase (AST), Serum Creatine Kinase for Part 1</title>
        <description>Blood samples for the assessment of chemistry parameters were collected at Baseline and up-to follow-up (Day 25) in Part 1. Baseline was defined as pre-dose assessments performed on Day -1. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the post-dose-visit value from the Baseline value. Data has been presented for serum ALT, serum alkaline phosphatase, serum AST, serum creatine kinase results for Part 1. Only those participants with data available at the specified time were analyzed (represented by n=x in the category titles).</description>

        <description>Blood samples for the assessment of chemistry parameters were collected at Baseline and up-to follow-up (Day 25) in Part 1. Baseline was defined as pre-dose assessments performed on Day -1. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the post-dose-visit value from the Baseline value. Data has been presented for serum bilirubin, serum creatinine and serum direct bilirubin results for Part 1.

        <description>Blood samples for the assessment of chemistry parameters were collected at Baseline and up-to follow-up (Day 36) in Part 2. Baseline was defined as pre-dose assessments performed on Day -1. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the post-dose-visit value from the Baseline value. Data has been presented for serum ALT, serum alkaline phosphatase, serum AST, serum creatine kinase results for Part 2. Only those participants with data available at the specified time were analyzed (represented by n=x in the category titles).</description>

        <description>Blood samples for the assessment of hematology parameters were collected at Baseline and up-to follow-up (Day 25) in Part 1. Baseline was defined as pre-dose assessments performed on Day -1. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the post-dose-visit value from the Baseline value. Data has been presented for blood erythrocyte MCH results for Part 1. Only those participants with data available at the specified time were analyzed (represented by n=x in the category titles).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Hematology Parameters Blood Basophils, Blood Eosinophils, Blood Leukocytes, Blood Lymphocytes, Blood Monocytes, Blood Neutrophils, Blood Platelets for Part 1</title>
        <description>Blood samples for the assessment of hematology parameters were collected at Baseline and up-to follow-up (Day 25) in Part 1. Baseline was defined as pre-dose assessments performed on Day -1. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the post-dose-visit value from the Baseline value. Data has been presented for blood basophils, blood eosinophils, blood leukocytes, blood lymphocytes, blood monocytes, blood neutrophils, blood platelets results for Part 1. Only those participants with data available at the specified time were analyzed (represented by n=x,x in the category titles)</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Hematology Parameter Blood Erythrocyte MCV for Part 2</title>
        <description>Blood samples for the assessment of hematology parameters were collected at Baseline and up-to follow-up (Day 36) in Part 2. Baseline was defined as pre-dose assessments performed on Day -1. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the post-dose-visit value from the Baseline value. Data has been presented for blood erythrocyte MCV results for Part 2. Only those participants with data available at the specified time were analyzed (represented by n=x,x,x in the category titles).</description>

        <description>Blood samples for the assessment of hematology parameters were collected at Baseline and up-to follow-up (Day 36) in Part 2. Baseline was defined as pre-dose assessments performed on Day -1. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the post-dose-visit value from the Baseline value. Data has been presented for blood hemoglobin results for Part 2. Only those participants with data available at the specified time were analyzed (represented by n=x,x,x in the category titles)</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Hematology Parameter Blood Hematocrit for Part 2</title>
        <description>Blood samples for the assessment of hematology parameters were collected at Baseline and up-to follow-up (Day 36) in Part 2. Baseline was defined as pre-dose assessments performed on Day -1. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the post-dose-visit value from the Baseline value. Data has been presented for blood hematocrit results for Part 2. Only those participants with data available at the specified time were analyzed (represented by n=x,x,x in the category titles)</description>

        <title>Urine Potential of Hydrogen (pH) Analysis by Dipstick Method for Part 1</title>
        <description>Urinary pH measurement is a routine part of urinalysis. Urine pH is an acid-base measurement. pH is measured on a numeric scale ranging from 0 to 14; values on the scale refer to the degree of alkalinity or acidity. A pH of 7 is neutral. A pH less than 7 is acidic, and a pH greater than 7 is basic. Normal urine has a slightly acid pH (5.0 - 6.0). Urine samples were collected for the measurement of urine pH by dipstick method up-to follow-up (Day 25) in Part 1. Only categories with significant values have been presented. Only those participants with data available at the specified time were analyzed (represented by n=x,x in the category titles).</description>

        <description>Urinary specific gravity measurement is a routine part of urinalysis. Urine specific gravity is a measure of the concentration of solutes in the urine and provides information on the kidney's ability to concentrate urine. The concentration of the excreted molecules determines the urine's specific gravity. Urine samples were collected for the measurement of urine specific gravity by dipstick method up-to follow-up (Day 25) in Part 1. Only categories with significant values have been presented.

        <title>Urine pH Analysis by Dipstick Method for Part 2</title>
        <description>Urinary pH measurement is a routine part of urinalysis. Urine pH is an acid-base measurement. pH is measured on a numeric scale ranging from 0 to 14; values on the scale refer to the degree of alkalinity or acidity. A pH of 7 is neutral. A pH less than 7 is acidic, and a pH greater than 7 is basic. Normal urine has a slightly acid pH (5.0 - 6.0). Urine samples were collected for the measurement of urine pH by dipstick method up-to follow-up (Day 36) in Part 2. Only categories with significant values have been presented. Only those participants with data available at the specified time were analyzed (represented by n=x,x,x in the category titles).</description>

          <title>Urine pH Analysis by Dipstick Method for Part 2</title>
          <description>Urinary pH measurement is a routine part of urinalysis. Urine pH is an acid-base measurement. pH is measured on a numeric scale ranging from 0 to 14; values on the scale refer to the degree of alkalinity or acidity. A pH of 7 is neutral. A pH less than 7 is acidic, and a pH greater than 7 is basic. Normal urine has a slightly acid pH (5.0 - 6.0). Urine samples were collected for the measurement of urine pH by dipstick method up-to follow-up (Day 36) in Part 2. Only categories with significant values have been presented. Only those participants with data available at the specified time were analyzed (represented by n=x,x,x in the category titles).</description>
