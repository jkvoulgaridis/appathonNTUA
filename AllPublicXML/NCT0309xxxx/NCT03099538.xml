  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recently, Interleukin (IL)-17 has been identified as a key driver of chronic inflammation in
      Bullous Pemphigoid (BP). Ixekizumab is a recombinant high-affinity fully human monoclonal
      antibody that targets IL-17A Immunoglobulin gamma-1 (IgG1)/kappa-class. The purpose of this
      study is to determine the effect of Ixekizumab on BP patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      BP is the most common auto-immune blistering disease of the skin and causes significant
      morbidity. BP disproportionally affects the elderly population and the current, non-specific
      immunosuppressive therapies, in addition to patient comorbidities, are associated with a high
      risk of infection related mortality. Neutrophils and their proteases have been shown to play
      a major role in the cleavage of Bullous Pemphigoid 180 Antigen (BP180) in BP. Mast cells and
      other cellular mediators also contribute to the pro-inflammatory environment within and
      surrounding blisters of BP. However, the prior targeting of mast cells and basophils has
      resulted in unpredictable disease control. Recently, IL-17 has been identified as a key
      driver of chronic inflammation in BP. With the increasing aged population in the United
      States, BP will increase in prevalence and the development of a more targeted approach will
      be necessary to decrease morbidity and mortality. IL-17 inhibition with Ixekizumab may have
      targeted, disease-modifying effects on BP. The primary objective is to test the effect of
      Ixekizumab in the treatment of the autoimmune blistering disease, BP.

A grading (severity) scale is provided for each AE Grade refers to the severity of the AE. The CTCAE displays Grades 1-5 with unique clinical descriptions of severity for each AE based on this general guideline: Grade 1 Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; intervention not indicated. Grade 2 Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; Grade 3 Severe or medically significant but not immediately life-threatening; hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; Grade 4 Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated.

BPDAI is predictive of the likelihood of a subsequent flare. The BPDAI consists of scoring various types of lesions and creates a score ranging from 0 to 120. A score of greater than 56 is considered severe disease.</description>

Adverse events (AE) will be reported per the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAEv4.0), a descriptive terminology which can be utilized for AE reporting. A grading (severity) scale is provided for each AE Grade refers to the severity of the AE. The CTCAE displays Grades 1-5 with unique clinical descriptions of severity for each AE based on this general guideline: Grade 1 Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; intervention not indicated. Grade 2 Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; Grade 3 Severe or medically significant but not immediately life-threatening; hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; Grade 4 Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated.
