    <textblock>
      This study aims to test the accuracy of the total thoracic fluid content (TFC) measured by
      cardiometry can predict weaning failure. Area under receiver operating characteristic curve
      (AUROC) will be determined, sensitivity, specificity, and best cutoff value will be
      calculated for TFC in prediction of weaning failure.

    <textblock>
      Weaning from mechanical ventilation is a serious and challenging process in critical care
      practice. Weaning failure is associated with poor patient outcomes. Increased mortality in
      patients with failed weaning was due to development of complications related to
      re-intubation. Detection and correction of the cause of failed spontaneous breathing trial
      (SBT) helps the intensives to improve the outcome of the next trials.

      Fluid overload and positive cumulative fluid balance is a risk factor of weaning failure in
      both cardiac and non-cardiac patients.

      Many tools for prediction of lung congestion as a risk factor for weaning failure have been
      reported. The gold standard for detection of cardiac cause of weaning failure was pulmonary
      artery catheter. More simple tools had been investigated for detection of cardiac cause of
      weaning failure in patients with or without previous cardiac dysfunction such as
      extravascular lung water and B-natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels.

      Although measurement of extravascular lung water is a reliable tool for prediction of cardiac
      cause of weaning failure, it has the disadvantage of the need of advanced monitor with
      invasive arterial line. Bioreactance is a new technology used for measurement of cardiac
      output and total thoracic fluid content (TFC). More recently, electrical velocimetry is a
      newer technology with good performance in cardiac output monitoring. The use of electrical
      velocimetry in measurement of TFC has the advantage of being non-invasive with no need for
      advanced skills. The aim of this work is to validate the use of TFC (measured by electrical
      velocimetry) in prediction of weaning outcome.
