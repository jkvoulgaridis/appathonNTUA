      Awareness of the necessity and importance of community-based multidomain psychosocial
      intervention for late-life depression has increased. However, few studies have attempted to
      integrate several therapeutic approaches in one intervention program.

      Main objective of this study is to assess the effectiveness of a 12-week multidomain
      intervention with contingency management for reducing depressive symptoms in older adults
      with major depressive disorder.

      We plan to conduct a randomized controlled parallel-design study. We plan to allocate study
      participants to multidomain intervention or supportive therapy group, in a 1:1 ratio. Block
      randomization using SAS (PLAN procedure) and sample size estimation were performed. We
      estimated that, with at least 40 participants per group and an attrition rate of 10%, we
      could achieve a power of at least 0.80 (beta = 0.2, two-tailed alpha = 0.05).

      Intervention was based on the financial and human resources of a community mental health
      service, and involved four home visits and 12 telephone calls over 12 weeks. Four
      evidence-based therapeutic approaches (physical activity, healthy diet, social activity, and
      emotional regulation) were incorporated into the multidomain intervention program. To
      maintain participant motivation, we plan to apply contingency management based on operant
      conditioning theory.

      The primary outcome is the change in depressive symptoms, as measured by the
      Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). Secondarily, we plan to investigate
      changes in resting-state functional connectivity in the default mode, salience, and central
      executive networks.

    <masking_description>Due to the nature of the intervention, we were unable to blind the nurses performing the intervention. However, to achieve double blinding as rigorously as possible, group allocation was not divulged to participants, and symptoms were rated by independent psychologists unaware of the randomization status.</masking_description>

    <description>The control group received supportive therapy for 12 weeks. In addition to a telephone call once a week and a home visit once a month, this program consisted of identification of physical problems, encouragement of general exercise, encouragement of pleasant activities, and so forth. The control program did not feature any specific goal setting by the participants, specific education about the benefits of achievement of such goals, or symbolic prizes.</description>

    <description>As a multidomain intervention, four evidence-based therapeutic approaches (physical activity, healthy diet, social activity, and emotional regulation) were incorporated into the program.
In terms of the healthy diet intervention, we encouraged participants to perform at least 30 min of above-moderate physical activity, three times per week. In terms of the healthy diet intervention, the intervention consisted of encouraging participants to consume high quantities of fish, olive oil, legumes, vegetables, and fruit, at a frequency of at least twice a week. In terms of the social activity intervention, we encouraged participants to participate in social organizations, such as the senior center, the hall of the elderly, a fraternity, a reunion, and a clan gathering, at least once a week. In terms of the emotional regulation intervention, we a performed brief cognitive restructuring task for 20 min per visit.</description>
