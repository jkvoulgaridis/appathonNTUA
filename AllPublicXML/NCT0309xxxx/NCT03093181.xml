    <measure>Change From Baseline in Corneometer Values at 8 Hours on Day 1</measure>
    <time_frame>At Baseline and Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>A blinded, trained and qualified evaluator conducted instrumental measurements of skin moisturization.Measurement of skin moisturization was performed by the electrical capacitance method with a Corneometer CM 865. The measuring principle was based on changes in the capacitance of the measuring head, functioning as a condensator. Between the conductors of the probe an electrical field was built which allows the dielectricity of the stratum corneum to be measured. Because the dielectricity of the skin varies as a function of its water content.The range of hydration level was 0 (as dry as possible)~120 AU (Arbitrary Unit)(most moist possible).Higher Corneometer values are indicative of improved skin moisturization.</description>

    <measure>Odds for Logistic Regression Analysis on Improvement Rating of Lay Person Assessment of Polarized and Non-polarized Images Week 8 Compared to Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>At Baseline and Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The baseline and week 8 photographs of all participants were displayed side by side on high resolution, color-calibrated display screen in room with neutral wall colors and standardized lighting and all practical efforts were made to minimize glare. The relative positioning (left and right) of baseline and week 8 photographs were blinded to evaluator and randomized. A technician used randomization schedule to display pair of images to lay evaluator. Lay evaluators judged magnitude of improvement in overall appearance of blemishes using the below criteria: Left=blemishes on left are more obvious than those on the right and Right=blemishes on right are more obvious than those on the left. Layperson ranked both left and right image as follows:1=Better;2=Worse. Odds was calculated from logistic regression including treatment and age stratum effects and exchangeable correlation. Odds=p/(1−p) where p was the probability of event that Week 8 was better than baseline.</description>

    <measure>ANOVA Analysis on Improvement Rating of Lay Person Assessment of Polarized and Non-polarized Images Week 8 Compared to Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>At Baseline and Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>Baseline and Week 8 photographs of all participants were displayed side by side on high resolution, color-calibrated display screen in room with neutral wall colors and standardized lighting with minimized glare. Relative positioning (left and right) of baseline and Week 8 photographs were blinded to evaluator and randomized. Lay evaluators ranked magnitude of improvement in overall appearance of blemishes using below criteria: Left=blemishes on left are more obvious than those on right; Right=blemishes on right are more obvious than those on left. Lay evaluator ranking for each image pair was converted into a numerical score based on whether Baseline or Week 8 image was ranked better:0=Baseline image was better than Week 8 image,1=Week 8 image was better than Baseline image. Minimum score 0 corresponded to all baseline images being better than Week 8 images. Maximum score 1 corresponded to all Week 8 images being better than baseline images. Higher scores indicated better results.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Sebumeter Values at Week 1, 4 and 8</measure>
    <time_frame>At Baseline, Week 1, 4 and 8</time_frame>
    <description>A treatment blinded, trained and qualified evaluator conducted instrumental measurements of skin sebum levels. Measurement of skin sebum levels was performed by with a Sebumeter SM 815. The measurement principle of the SM 815 is based on grease spot photometry. The translucent tape of the device is brought into contact with skin and becomes increasingly transparent in response to surface oil. The tape is inserted into the aperture of the device and its transparency measured by light transmission, with increased transmission signifying increased oiliness. The software outputs mass sebum levels as a function of area. Sebumeter measurements were taken in triplicate at the central forehead (above the eyebrows) with the participant lying horizontally, on their back.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Sebum Excretion Rate at Week 1, 4 and 8</measure>
    <time_frame>At Baseline, Week 1, 4 and 8</time_frame>
    <description>The forehead of each participant was thoroughly cleansed by the investigator or designee using cotton pads saturated with 70% Isopropyl Alcohol and, after 5 minutes, the central area of the forehead above the eyebrows was measured in triplicate with a Sebumeter. The same area was measured in triplicate 90 minutes after cleansing. The sebum excretion rate was calculated by the difference in 90th minutes and 5th minute Sebumeter values.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Corneometer Values at 8 Hours on Day 1</title>
        <description>A blinded, trained and qualified evaluator conducted instrumental measurements of skin moisturization.Measurement of skin moisturization was performed by the electrical capacitance method with a Corneometer CM 865. The measuring principle was based on changes in the capacitance of the measuring head, functioning as a condensator. Between the conductors of the probe an electrical field was built which allows the dielectricity of the stratum corneum to be measured. Because the dielectricity of the skin varies as a function of its water content.The range of hydration level was 0 (as dry as possible)~120 AU (Arbitrary Unit)(most moist possible).Higher Corneometer values are indicative of improved skin moisturization.</description>

        <title>Odds for Logistic Regression Analysis on Improvement Rating of Lay Person Assessment of Polarized and Non-polarized Images Week 8 Compared to Baseline</title>
        <description>The baseline and week 8 photographs of all participants were displayed side by side on high resolution, color-calibrated display screen in room with neutral wall colors and standardized lighting and all practical efforts were made to minimize glare. The relative positioning (left and right) of baseline and week 8 photographs were blinded to evaluator and randomized. A technician used randomization schedule to display pair of images to lay evaluator. Lay evaluators judged magnitude of improvement in overall appearance of blemishes using the below criteria: Left=blemishes on left are more obvious than those on the right and Right=blemishes on right are more obvious than those on the left. Layperson ranked both left and right image as follows:1=Better;2=Worse. Odds was calculated from logistic regression including treatment and age stratum effects and exchangeable correlation. Odds=p/(1−p) where p was the probability of event that Week 8 was better than baseline.</description>

Lay evaluators ranked magnitude of improvement in overall appearance of blemishes using below criteria: Left=blemishes on left are more obvious than those on right; Right=blemishes on right are more obvious than those on left. Lay evaluator ranking for each image pair was converted into a numerical score based on whether Baseline or Week 8 image was ranked better:0=Baseline image was better than Week 8 image,1=Week 8 image was better than Baseline image. Minimum score 0 corresponded to all baseline images being better than Week 8 images. Maximum score 1 corresponded to all Week 8 images being better than baseline images.

        <title>Change From Baseline in Sebumeter Values at Week 1, 4 and 8</title>
        <description>A treatment blinded, trained and qualified evaluator conducted instrumental measurements of skin sebum levels. Measurement of skin sebum levels was performed by with a Sebumeter SM 815. The measurement principle of the SM 815 is based on grease spot photometry. The translucent tape of the device is brought into contact with skin and becomes increasingly transparent in response to surface oil. The tape is inserted into the aperture of the device and its transparency measured by light transmission, with increased transmission signifying increased oiliness. The software outputs mass sebum levels as a function of area. Sebumeter measurements were taken in triplicate at the central forehead (above the eyebrows) with the participant lying horizontally, on their back.</description>

        <description>The forehead of each participant was thoroughly cleansed by the investigator or designee using cotton pads saturated with 70% Isopropyl Alcohol and, after 5 minutes, the central area of the forehead above the eyebrows was measured in triplicate with a Sebumeter. The same area was measured in triplicate 90 minutes after cleansing. The sebum excretion rate was calculated by the difference in 90th minutes and 5th minute Sebumeter values.</description>

      <desc>1 participant was misallocated to treatment (received “no treatment” instead of “positive control”). This means 45 participants were in safety population for “no treatment”.However, per convention, ITT population is defined based on intended treatment allocation.While 1 subject incorrectly received “no treatment”,they were initially allocated to “positive control”. Therefore, this participant was included in ITT population for “positive control” but safety population for “no treatment”.</desc>
