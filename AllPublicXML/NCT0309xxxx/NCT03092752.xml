  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Appropriate use of oral antidiabetic drugs (OADs) including dose-reduction is important for
      patient's safety in T2DM patients with renal impairment (RI). However, there are insufficient
      data on dose adjustment in accordance with the prescription pattern and the risk of RI of
      OADs, in particular Dipeptidyl-peptidase-4 inhibitors, in clinical practice in Japan.
      Therefore, we will investigate OADs usage conditions and dose selection in T2DM patients with
      RI in clinical practice in Japan

    <time_frame>Within 6 months from index date</time_frame>
    <description>Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was calculated based on the age at index date and the latest serum creatinine at index date (or during the observation period) using formula eGFR millilitre/minute/1.73 meter^2 (mL/min/1.73 m^2) = 194 × (Creatinine)^-1.094 × (age in year)^-0.287 (× 0.739 if female).
