         22. Donation of blood or significant blood loss within 56 days prior to dosing.

         23. Plasma donation within 7 days prior to dosing.

         24. Strenuous exercise/physical activity which could cause muscle aches or injury,
             including contact sports at any time from 72 hours before dosing until completion of
             the study.

         25. Participation in another clinical study within 30 days prior to dosing. The 30 day
             window will be derived from the date of the last blood collection or dosing, whichever
             is later, in the previous study to Day 1 of the current study.

         26. Presence of any scars, or tattoos which may obscure the injection site, as deemed by
             PI or designee.

         27. Any condition or circumstance, in the opinion of the PI or designee, which may make
             the subject unlikely to complete the study or comply with study procedures and
             requirements, or may pose a risk to the subject's safety.
