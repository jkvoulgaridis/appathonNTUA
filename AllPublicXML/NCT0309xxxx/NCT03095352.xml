  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II multicenter study including breast cancer patients with chest wall disease
      that is hormone resistant (estrogen receptor (ER) positive/progesterone receptor (PR)
      positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) negative breast cancer with
      progressive disease on 2 prior lines of hormonal therapy) or triple negative (ER negative/PR
      negative/HER2 negative, TNBC). Eighty-four patients will be enrolled at Translational Breast
      Cancer Research Consortium (TBCRC) sites and will be randomized 2:1 to receive treatment with
      pembrolizumab and carboplatin (n=56, Arm A) or carboplatin alone (n=28, Arm B) until
      documented disease progression. Patients randomized to Arm B may cross-over following
      progression to pembrolizumab with or without carboplatin at investigator's discretion (Arm
      Bx). Patients may have received any number of prior lines of chemotherapy. Patients in Arm A
      will be treated with pembrolizumab 200 mg IV and carboplatin area under curve (AUC) 5 IV
      every 3 weeks for at least 6 cycles followed by maintenance pembrolizumab 200 mg IV every 3
      weeks if stable or responding disease. Patients in Arm B will be treated with carboplatin AUC
      5 IV every 3 weeks until progression, whereupon they may cross-over to pembrolizumab 200 mg
      IV every 3 weeks with or without carboplatin at investigator's discretion (Arm Bx). An
      interim analysis for futility will be performed after 18 patients are enrolled into Arm B to
      allow early stopping of that trial arm for lack of efficacy. The primary endpoint is to
      compare disease control rates at 18 weeks of treatment. Secondary endpoints include
      progression free survival, toxicity, and overall response rate.

      There will be a companion translational study operating concurrently with the study described
      above. In this study, biomarker research to be performed on tumor biopsies and peripheral
      blood samples will be performed to explore the immunologic and genomic mechanism of action
      underlying treatment with pembrolizumab and carboplatin versus carboplatin alone. This
      protocol includes tissue and blood correlative exploratory endpoints including changes in
      tumor PD-L1 (programmed death ligand 1) gene expression, tumor and peripheral blood immune
      composition and cytokine expression, plasma tumor DNA, circulating tumor cells, and tumor
      myelocytomatosis (MYC) oncogene expression using tumor biopsy and peripheral blood testing
      before and after treatment; correlations with these markers and disease control rate will be
      assessed.
