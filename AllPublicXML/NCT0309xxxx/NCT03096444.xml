  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the antipruritic efficacy of topical ketamine,
      amitriptyline, lidocaine, and a tri-combination of ketamine, amitriptyline and lidocaine
      (hereafter referred to as &quot;KeAmLi&quot;) using non-histaminergic itch provocations in healthy
      volunteers. The primary outcome is itch reduction (AUC) between the vehicle and active
      treatment (KeAmLi-combo). Secondary outcomes include modality-specific analgesic properties
      of the topically applied ketamine, amitriptyline, lidocaine, and KeAmLi-combo to controlled
      quantitative thermal and mechanical stimuli, which can improve our understanding of the
      mechanism of action of these substances in the context of topical therapy.

    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind, vehicle-controlled study to evaluate the antipruritic efficacy of
      topical ketamine, amitriptyline, lidocaine, and a tri-combination of ketamine, amitriptyline
      and lidocaine (hereafter referred to as &quot;KeAmLi&quot;) using non-histaminergic itch provocations
      in healthy volunteers. Each participant will be pre-treated with the vehicle and 4 active
      topical creams, over two study visits (3 treatments on the 1st visit and 2 treatment on the
      2nd visit). Each treatment will be applied to the randomized forearm test area for 30 minute,
      and then sensory testing will be performed. Sensory testing includes thermal and mechanical
      stimuli, and itch induction using the plant cowhage. These tests will reveal mechanistic
      information and potential cellular and molecular targets for improved antipruritic and
      analgesic therapies.
