    <textblock>
      This is an open label, Phase 1/2 study of ARQ 092 (Miransertib) administered orally. The
      study consists of two parts: Part A and Part B. Part A is now closed to enrollment.

      The study objectives for Part A are:

        -  To assess the safety and tolerability of ARQ 092 in patients with PROS and PS

        -  To assess the clinical activity of ARQ 092

        -  To evaluate the dosing schedule of ARQ 092

        -  To determine the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of ARQ 092.

      The study objectives for Part B are:

      Primary objective:

        -  To determine the efficacy of ARQ 092 in subjects with PROS and PS

      Secondary objectives:

        -  To estimate the change from baseline in pain score

        -  To estimate change from baseline in physical functioning

        -  To describe the long-term tolerability and safety of ARQ 092

        -  To determine the duration of response

      All enrolled subjects (except for those in cohort 4 of Part B) will receive ARQ 092 at the 15
      mg/m2 QD dose level during the first three cycles. The dose may be increased to 25 mg/m2 at
      cycle 4 provided no clinically significant drug-related toxicity is observed and upon
      agreement between the Investigator and the Sponsor.

      For an individual subject, treatment will continue until disease progression, unacceptable
      toxicity, or another discontinuation criterion is met. It is expected that most subjects will
      receive between 3 to 48 cycles of treatment.
