  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bariatric surgery markedly improves glycemic control in persons with Type 2 Diabetes (T2D).
      Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), a procedure that bypasses the upper gastrointestinal (UGI)
      tract, results in greater rates of diabetes resolution compared to methods that leave the UGI
      tract intact. Studies suggest that mechanisms beyond weight-loss account for the superiority
      of RYGB compared to other surgical methods. These weight-loss independent metabolic effects
      may involve increased postprandial production and release of nutrition- responsive hormones.
      Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) is a nutrition-adaptive hormone with the potential to
      alleviate symptoms of diabetes and obesity. Preliminary data therefore suggest that RYGB
      surgery may alter postprandial FGF21 regulation which could be important for achieving
      post-meal nutrient homeostasis. Therefore, the goal of this study is to test how nutrient
      content of the meal affects FGF21 concentrations before and after weight loss induced by RYGB
      or very low calorie diet (VLCD) therapy. The importance of FGF21 for glucose, insulin,
      triglyceride, and adipose tissue and muscle metabolism in these two groups will also be
      tested.
