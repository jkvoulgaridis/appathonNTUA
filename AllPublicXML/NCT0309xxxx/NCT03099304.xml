  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of participants treated with ruxolitinib cream who achieve a ≥ 50% improvement in facial assessment of the Vitiligo Area and Severity Index score (F-VASI50) compared with participants treated with vehicle</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>F-VASI is the percentage of depigmented vitiligo skin expressed as a percentage of the total area of skin on the face (100%) and estimated by the investigator using the palmar method.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of participants who achieve a facial assessment of the Physician's Global Vitiligo Assessment (F-PhGVA) of clear or almost clear</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>F-PhGVA has a 5-point scale (clear, almost clear, mild disease, moderate disease, and severe disease) assessed by the physician to determine the severity of vitiligo and will be reported for face and overall. Complete facial repigmentation is defined as an F-PhGVA of clear (0).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of participants who achieve a ≥ 50% improvement from baseline in full body assessment of Vitiligo Area and Severity Index (T-VASI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>T-VASI is calculated using a formula that includes contributions from all body regions (possible range, 0-100). The body is divided into 6 separate and mutually exclusive sites (head/neck, hands, upper extremities [excluding hands], trunk, lower extremities [excluding feet], and feet), with percentage of vitiligo involvement estimated in hand units by the same investigator throughout the study.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Safety and tolerability assessed by monitoring the frequency, duration, and severity of adverse events (AEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Screening through at least 30 days after the last dose of study drug, up to 120 weeks per participant</time_frame>
    <description>AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or not considered drug-related, that occurs after a subject provides informed consent. Abnormal laboratory values or test results occurring after informed consent constitute AEs only if they induce clinical signs or symptoms, are considered clinically meaningful, require therapy, or require changes in the study drug.</description>

          -  Clinical diagnosis of vitiligo.

          -  Vitiligo with depigmented areas including:

               -  at least 0.5% of the total body surface area (BSA) on the face (0.5% BSA is
                  approximately equal to the area of the participant's palm [without digits]) AND

               -  at least 3% of the total BSA on nonfacial areas (3% BSA is approximately equal to
                  the area of 3 of the participant's handprints [palm plus 5 digits]).

          -  Participants who agree to discontinue all agents used to treat vitiligo from screening
             through the final follow-up visit. Over-the-counter preparations deemed acceptable by
             the investigator and camouflage makeups are permitted.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Conditions at baseline that would interfere with evaluation of vitiligo.

          -  Participants who are receiving any kind of phototherapy, including tanning beds.

          -  Participants with other dermatologic disease besides vitiligo whose presence or
             treatments could complicate the assessment of repigmentation.

          -  Participants who have used skin bleaching treatments for past treatment of vitiligo or
             other pigmented areas.

          -  Participants who have received any of the following treatments within the minimum
             specified timeframes.

               -  Use of any biologic, investigational, or experimental therapy or procedure for
                  vitiligo within 12 weeks or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) of screening.

               -  Use of laser or light-based vitiligo treatments, including tanning beds, within 8
                  weeks of screening.

               -  Use of immunomodulating oral or systemic medications (eg, corticosteroids,
                  methotrexate, cyclosporine) or topical treatments that may affect vitiligo (eg,
                  corticosteroids, tacrolimus/pimecrolimus, retinoids) within 4 weeks of screening.

          -  Use of any prior and concomitant therapy not listed above that may interfere with the
             objective of the study as per discretion of the investigator, including drugs that
             cause photosensitivity or skin pigmentation (eg, antibiotics such as tetracyclines,
             antifungals) within 8 weeks of screening.

          -  Participants with a clinically significant abnormal thyroid-stimulating hormone or
             free T4 at screening.

          -  Participants with protocol-defined cytopenias at screening

          -  Participants with severely impaired liver function.

          -  Participants with impaired renal function.

          -  Participants taking potent systemic cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors or fluconazole
             within 2 weeks or 5 half-lives, whichever is longer, before the baseline visit.

          -  Participants who have previously received JAK inhibitor therapy, systemic or topical.
