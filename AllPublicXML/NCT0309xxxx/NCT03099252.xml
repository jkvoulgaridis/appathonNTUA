  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Newborn infants have blood work procedures for newborn screening and bilirubin testing in
      their first days of life that cause pain, distress and physiological changes. Breastfeeding
      (BF), skin to skin care (SSC), or giving small amounts of sweet solutions (sucrose or
      glucose) with or without a pacifier, effectively and safely reduce pain and distress in
      newborn infants during painful procedures. However, studies of neonatal pain management
      practices in Ontario and throughout Canada demonstrate inconsistent use of these strategies.
      There is a clear need for developing and testing acceptable parent-targeted interventions,
      alongside health care provider (HCP)-targeted knowledge translation (KT) interventions, to
      support parents' involvement in comforting their infants during painful procedures. To
      address this knowledge to action (KTA) gap, Denise Harrison's Be Sweet to Babies team
      developed the BSweet2Babies video, which demonstrates the effectiveness of BF, SSC, and
      sucrose during infant bloodwork and how parents can use and advocate for these pain
      management strategies.

      This project addresses a knowledge to practice gap that is highly relevant to all babies and
      their families. Thus, this study has the potential to advance health care of all babies and
      contribute to the science of KT by evaluating the implementation of a parent-targeted and
      mediated KT strategy in diverse hospital settings.

      Hospitals were eligible for inclusion if they (1) provide Level 1 or Level 2 maternal/newborn
      care contributing data to the Better Outcomes Registry &amp; Network Ontario (BORN) Information
      Systems (BIS); (2) have a birth volume of at least 50 per year; (3) have &lt;85% use of pain
      management (BF,SSC, sucrose) during newborn screening or bilirubin sampling, as per BIS data;
      and (4) have &lt; 50% missing data for the pain management data element in the BIS.
      Participating hospitals will receive a tablet and will offer all parents the 5 minute
      BSweet2Babies video before newborn bloodwork. BORN Information System (BIS) data will
      subsequently be analyzed to evaluate the use of BF, SSC and sweet solutions.

      Background: Newborn infants have blood work procedures for newborn screening and bilirubin
      testing in their first days of life that cause pain, distress and physiological changes.
      Breastfeeding (BF), skin to skin care (SSC), or giving small amounts of sweet solutions
      (sucrose or glucose) with or without a pacifier, effectively and safely reduce pain and
      distress in newborn infants during painful procedures. However, studies of neonatal pain
      management practices in Ontario and throughout Canada demonstrate inconsistent use of these
      strategies. There is a clear need for developing and testing acceptable parent-targeted
      interventions, alongside health care provider-targeted knowledge translation (KT)
      interventions, to support parents' involvement in comforting their infants during painful
      procedures. To address this knowledge to action (KTA) gap, Denise Harrison's Be Sweet to
      Babies team developed the BSweet2Babies video, which demonstrates the effectiveness of BF,
      SSC, and sucrose during infant bloodwork and how parents can use and advocate for these pain
      management strategies.

      Objectives: To conduct a process evaluation to understand during the 6-month intervention
      period; (1) to what extent did HCPs implement the BSweet2Babies video in their setting; (2)
      What were the barriers and facilitators encountered in implementing the BSweet2Babies video;
      (3) What were the barriers and facilitators encountered in implementing the evidence shown in
      the BSweet2babies video (i.e. breastfeeding, skin-to-skin care, sucrose).

      Study design and methods: Sequential exploratory mixed methods study. The mixed methods
      implementation study includes process evaluation, exploration of facilitators and barriers to
      implementation of the video and uptake of the demonstrated recommended pain management of BF,
      SSC or sucrose during initial blood sampling by heel prick.

      Data Analysis: Directed content analysis will be used to analyse the qualitative data (i.e.
      monthly phone calls and bi-monthly community of practice teleconferences). Interview data
      will be transcribed verbatim with consent. A deductive and inductive approach will be used to
      code the qualitative data with codes developed apriori based on the Theoretical Domains
      Framework. Any concepts that do not fit within the framework will be assigned a new code.

      Process evaluation will be described and summarized according to the process evaluation of
      complex intervention guide.

      BORN Ontario data analysts in consultation with CoI Taljaard will conduct analysis using
      descriptive statistics to compare characteristics of participating sites and births including
      unit type (Level 1 compared to Level 2), birth volume, infant sex, and parity. In addition,
      BIS pain data will be reported as baseline and following the 6- month implementation period.

    <description>Participating hospitals will offer the video to all parents on their MBU during the 6 month intervention period (using the preferred delivery methods of the hospital and the parents). The video will be available via multiple means to facilitate optimal parental exposure in diverse settings. This will ensure flexibility of the delivery of the intervention, based on preferences of the nominated nurse leaders and their HCP team, families and available resources.
All participating maternal/newborn centres will receive the following tools via the designated nurse unit leader of enrolled sites:
Parent-targeted BSweet2Babies video
Parent cards- Reminder for parents of video, with Quick Response (QR) code of the video
BSweet2Babies Poster-visual reminder for parents and HCP's on the enrolled units
Monthly support calls for the nursing leaders of the Mother Baby Units (MBU)
Bi-monthly community of practice teleconferences for the nursing leaders of the MBU</description>

    <description>The video portrays three babies having blood tests while being i) BF, ii) held SSC with the mother, and iii) receiving sucrose. The calming effects of these strategies are powerfully portrayed. Voice-over in user-friendly language explains how parents can help their babies by partnering with clinicians to use these strategies. As per the definition of patient-targeted and mediated interventions, this video is: i) patient (parent)-targeted, as it actively engages parents to improve their knowledge, positively affect their experience (during newborn screening), change their behavior and their baby's outcomes; ii) patient-mediated, as the video enables parents to change health professional behavior.</description>
