  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to assess analgesic efficacy of ASP8062 relative to placebo as
      well as the safety and tolerability. This study also assessed the treatment differences in
      physical function as well the improvements in overall subject status (e.g., fibromyalgia
      symptoms, global functioning) of ASP8062 relative to placebo.

    <measure>Change From Baseline to Week 8 in Mean Daily Average Pain Score as Assessed by Numerical Rating Scale (NRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The mean daily average pain score was assessed thorugh the Daily Average Pain NRS, which is a generic instrument for the assessment of pain that consists of a single question that asks participants to record their daily average pain on an 11-point scale, where 0 anchors &quot;no pain&quot; and 10 &quot;pain as bad as you can imagine.&quot; The mean daily average pain score was calculated from data recorded by participants daily in the electronic diary, and the recall period was the last 24 hours. A negative change indicated a reduction/improvement from baseline (i.e., a favorable outcome).</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>From first dose of study drug up to 30 days after last dose of study drug (up to 87 days)</time_frame>
    <description>Safety was assessed by adverse events (AEs), which included abnormalities identified during a medical test (e.g. laboratory tests, vital signs, electrocardiogram, etc.) if the abnormality induced clinical signs or symptoms, needed active intervention, interruption or discontinuation of study drug or was clinically significant. A TEAE was defined as any AE that started or worsened after the first dose of study drug up to 30 days after the last dose of study drug. AEs were considered serious (SAEs) if the AE resulted in death, was life-threatening, resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, resulted in congenital anomaly, or birth defect or required inpatient hospitalization or led to prolongation of hospitalization. TEAEs in drug abuse, dependence and withdrawal standardized MedDRA query (SMQ) are special AEs of interest grouped together using the SMQ tool (MedDRA v20.0).</description>

Affirmative or negative responses were provided to 5 items to suicidal ideation (1. Wish to be dead, 2. Non-specific active suicidal thoughts, 3. Active suicidal ideation with any methods (not plan) without intent to act, 4. Active suicidal ideation with some intent to act, without specific plan, 5.

    <measure>Change From Baseline to Weeks 2, 4, 8 and EOT in the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire Revised (FIQR) Function Subscale Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and weeks 2, 4, 8</time_frame>
    <description>The FIQR was developed to capture total spectrum of problems related to fibromyalgia and the responses to therapy. The 21-item FIQR contains 3 subscales: function (9 questions), overall impact (2 questions), and symptoms (10 questions). Participants answer each question on an 11-point NRS, with anchors appropriate to each question on a tablet device during a visit. The recall period was the last 7 days or the last time the activity was performed if not within the 7-day recall period. The Function subscale has a range of scores of 0 to 90, with a lower score indicating better (higher) function. A negative change indicated a reduction/improvement from baseline (i.e., a favorable outcome).</description>

        <description>Safety was assessed by adverse events (AEs), which included abnormalities identified during a medical test (e.g. laboratory tests, vital signs, electrocardiogram, etc.) if the abnormality induced clinical signs or symptoms, needed active intervention, interruption or discontinuation of study drug or was clinically significant. A TEAE was defined as any AE that started or worsened after the first dose of study drug up to 30 days after the last dose of study drug. AEs were considered serious (SAEs) if the AE resulted in death, was life-threatening, resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, resulted in congenital anomaly, or birth defect or required inpatient hospitalization or led to prolongation of hospitalization. TEAEs in drug abuse, dependence and withdrawal standardized MedDRA query (SMQ) are special AEs of interest grouped together using the SMQ tool (MedDRA v20.0).</description>

        <description>The mean daily average pain score was assessed through the Daily Average Pain NRS, which is a generic instrument for the assessment of pain that consists of a single question that asks participants to record their daily average pain on an 11-point scale, where 0 anchors &quot;no pain&quot; and 10 &quot;pain as bad as you can imagine.&quot; The mean daily average pain score was calculated from data recorded by participants daily in the electronic diary, and the recall period was the last 24 hours. For the week 8 analysis, participants with missing baseline or week 8 data were classified as nonresponders. For EOT analysis, participants with missing baseline or EOT data were classified as nonresponders.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With ≥ 50% Reduction From Baseline to Week 8 and EOT in Mean Daily Average Pain Score as Assessed by NRS</title>
        <description>The mean daily average pain score was assessed thorugh the Daily Average Pain NRS, which is a generic instrument for the assessment of pain that consists of a single question that asks participants to record their daily average pain on an 11-point scale, where 0 anchors &quot;no pain&quot; and 10 &quot;pain as bad as you can imagine.&quot; The mean daily average pain score was calculated from data recorded by participants daily in the electronic diary, and the recall period was the last 24 hours. For the week 8 analysis, participants with missing baseline or week 8 data were classified as nonresponders. For EOT analysis, participants with missing baseline or EOT data were classified as nonresponders.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Weeks 2, 4, 8 and EOT in the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire Revised (FIQR) Function Subscale Score</title>
        <description>The FIQR was developed to capture total spectrum of problems related to fibromyalgia and the responses to therapy. The 21-item FIQR contains 3 subscales: function (9 questions), overall impact (2 questions), and symptoms (10 questions). Participants answer each question on an 11-point NRS, with anchors appropriate to each question on a tablet device during a visit. The recall period was the last 7 days or the last time the activity was performed if not within the 7-day recall period. The Function subscale has a range of scores of 0 to 90, with a lower score indicating better (higher) function. A negative change indicated a reduction/improvement from baseline (i.e., a favorable outcome).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Weeks 2, 4, 8, and EOT in the FIQR Symptoms Subscale Score</title>
        <description>The FIQR was developed to capture the total spectrum of problems related to fibromyalgia and the responses to therapy. The 21-item FIQR contains 3 subscales: function (9 questions), overall impact (2 questions), and symptoms (10 questions). Participants answer each question on an 11-point NRS, with anchors appropriate to each question on a tablet device during a visit. The recall period was the last 7 days. The Symptoms subscale range of scores is 0 to 100, with a lower score indicating a better (lower) level of symptoms. A negative change indicates a reduction/improvement from baseline (i.e., a favorable outcome).</description>

        <description>The PGIC is a self-administered 7-point Likert scale that asks participants to evaluate their fibromyalgia relative to baseline. This is a single question and the grade ranges from 1 (&quot;Very Much Improved&quot;) to 7 (&quot;Very Much Worse&quot;).</description>

Modified LOCF (mLOCF) was used for weeks 2, 4, and 8, where &quot;No Change&quot; was imputed for participants who discontinued due to lack of efficacy or AEs, and LOCF was used for participants who discontinued due to other reasons. LOCF was used for EOT.</population>
