  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of pirfenidone in
      participants with fibrosing interstitial lung disease (ILD) who cannot be classified with
      moderate or high confidence into any other category of fibrosing ILD by multidisciplinary
      team (MDT) review (&quot;unclassifiable&quot; ILD).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Study participants will be randomised to receive 801 mg pirfenidone or placebo three times
      daily for 24 weeks. The efficacy of pirfenidone versus placebo will be assessed by daily
      measurement of forced vital capacity using a handheld spirometer over the treatment period.
      Additionally, the study will assess the efficacy and safety of pirfenidone with and without
      concomitant mycophenolate mofetil treatment and in study participants with or without
      interstitial pneumonia with autoimmune features (IPAF). All study participants who attend the
      follow-up visit at Week 28 will be offered the opportunity to receive open-label pirfenidone
      within the trial protocol. In order to maintain blinding of the controlled period of the
      study, all study participants will discontinue treatment by Week 24 and return for a
      follow-up visit 4 weeks later. Study participants eligible to participate in the single-arm
      12-month extension will be initiated on open‑label pirfenidone during this visit (re-starting
      the dose titration from one capsule three times daily [TID]). During the long-term extension
      period, study participants will be monitored for safety, initially at monthly visits during
      the first 6 months and thereafter approximately every 3 months. A final follow-up visit will
      take place 4 weeks after the last dose of pirfenidone is taken.

    <description>The Leicester Cough Questionnaire is a patient-reported questionnaire evaluating the impact of cough on quality of life. The questionnaire comprises 19 items. Each item assesses symptoms, or the impact of symptoms, over the last 2 weeks on a seven-point Likert scale. Scores in three domains (physical, psychological and social) were calculated as a mean for each domain (range 1 to 7). A total score (range 3 to 21) was also calculated by adding the domain scores together. Higher scores indicate better quality of life.</description>

    <measure>Change in Total and Sub-scores of the Saint George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1) to Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The SGRQ is a 50-item questionnaire developed to measure health status (quality of life) in participants with diseases of airways obstruction. Three component scores are: Symptoms (respiratory symptoms and severity); Activity (activities that cause or are limited by breathlessness); Impacts (social functioning and psychological disturbances due to airway disease). Each component sub-scores are calculated from the summed weights for the positive responses to questions. Total score summaries the impact of disease on overall health status. Scores are expressed as a percentage of overall impairment where 100 represents worst possible health status and 0 indicates best possible health status. It is calculated by summing all positive responses in the questionnaire and expressing the result as a percentage of the total weight for the questionnaire.</description>

    <description>An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with the treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a pharmaceutical product, whether or not considered related to the pharmaceutical product. Preexisting conditions which worsen during a study are also considered as adverse events.</description>

        <title>Change in Score in Leicester Cough Questionnaire Score</title>
        <description>The Leicester Cough Questionnaire is a patient-reported questionnaire evaluating the impact of cough on quality of life. The questionnaire comprises 19 items. Each item assesses symptoms, or the impact of symptoms, over the last 2 weeks on a seven-point Likert scale. Scores in three domains (physical, psychological and social) were calculated as a mean for each domain (range 1 to 7). A total score (range 3 to 21) was also calculated by adding the domain scores together. Higher scores indicate better quality of life.</description>

        <title>Change in Total and Sub-scores of the Saint George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ)</title>
        <description>The SGRQ is a 50-item questionnaire developed to measure health status (quality of life) in participants with diseases of airways obstruction. Three component scores are: Symptoms (respiratory symptoms and severity); Activity (activities that cause or are limited by breathlessness); Impacts (social functioning and psychological disturbances due to airway disease). Each component sub-scores are calculated from the summed weights for the positive responses to questions. Total score summaries the impact of disease on overall health status. Scores are expressed as a percentage of overall impairment where 100 represents worst possible health status and 0 indicates best possible health status. It is calculated by summing all positive responses in the questionnaire and expressing the result as a percentage of the total weight for the questionnaire.</description>
