      The study consists of Screening Phase(4 weeks before administration of study drug),Active
      Treatment Phase(Week 0-Week 44),Follow Up Phase(Week 44-Week 56).During various study
      periods,safety assessments(example[e.g] recording of adverse events,Vital signs,Tuberculosis
      evaluation,Chest radiograph,Urine pregnancy Test);Efficacy assessments(e.g IGA,PASI);Clinical
      Laboratory Assessments(e.g haematology,chemistry);Biomarkers/Genetic evaluations,will be
      performed per the study procedures.The primary hypotheses are that guselkumab treatment is
      non-inferior to secukinumab as assessed by proportion of participants achieving PASI 90
      response at Week 48 with noninferiority margin of 10% and,once non-inferiority is
      established,that guselkumab is superior to secukinumab as assessed by proportion of
      participants achieving PASI 90 response at Week 48.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Who Achieved a Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI)-90 Response at Week 48</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 48</time_frame>
    <description>The PASI is a system used for assessing and grading the severity of psoriatic lesions. In the PASI system, the body is divided into 4 regions: the head, trunk, upper extremities, and lower extremities. Each of these areas were assessed separately for the percentage of the area involved, which translates to a numeric score that ranges from 0 to 6, and for erythema, induration, and scaling, which are each rated on a scale of 0 to 4. The PASI produces a numeric score that can range from 0 to 72. A higher score indicates more severe disease. A PASI 90 response represents participants who achieved at least a 90 percent improvement from baseline in the PASI score.</description>

    <description>Percentage of participants who achieved PASI-75 response at both Week 12 and 48 was reported. The PASI is a system used for assessing and grading the severity of psoriatic lesions and their response to therapy. In the PASI system, the body is divided into 4 regions: the head, trunk, upper extremities, and lower extremities. Each of these areas is assessed separately for the percentage of the area involved, which translates to a numeric score that ranges from 0 (indicates no involvement) to 6 (90%-100% involvement), and for erythema, induration, and scaling, which are each rated on a scale of 0 to 4. The PASI produces a numeric score that could range from 0 (no psoriasis) to 72. A higher score indicates more severe disease. PASI 75 response was defined as at least a 75% reduction in PASI relative to baseline.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Who Achieved a Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI)-90 Response at Week 48</title>
        <description>The PASI is a system used for assessing and grading the severity of psoriatic lesions. In the PASI system, the body is divided into 4 regions: the head, trunk, upper extremities, and lower extremities. Each of these areas were assessed separately for the percentage of the area involved, which translates to a numeric score that ranges from 0 to 6, and for erythema, induration, and scaling, which are each rated on a scale of 0 to 4. The PASI produces a numeric score that can range from 0 to 72. A higher score indicates more severe disease. A PASI 90 response represents participants who achieved at least a 90 percent improvement from baseline in the PASI score.</description>

Participants who met treatment failure criteria (who discontinued study agent due to lack of efficacy or adverse event of psoriasis and/or who initiated protocol-prohibited psoriasis medications/therapies) prior to Week 48 or who had a missing PASI score at Week 48 were considered PASI 90 non-responders at Week 48.</population>

        <description>Percentage of participants who achieved PASI-75 response at both Week 12 and 48 was reported. The PASI is a system used for assessing and grading the severity of psoriatic lesions and their response to therapy. In the PASI system, the body is divided into 4 regions: the head, trunk, upper extremities, and lower extremities. Each of these areas is assessed separately for the percentage of the area involved, which translates to a numeric score that ranges from 0 (indicates no involvement) to 6 (90%-100% involvement), and for erythema, induration, and scaling, which are each rated on a scale of 0 to 4. The PASI produces a numeric score that could range from 0 (no psoriasis) to 72. A higher score indicates more severe disease. PASI 75 response was defined as at least a 75% reduction in PASI relative to baseline.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Who Achieved a PASI-90 Response at Week 12</title>
        <description>The PASI is a system used for assessing and grading the severity of psoriatic lesions and their response to therapy. In the PASI system, the body is divided into 4 regions: the head, trunk, upper extremities, and lower extremities. Each of these areas is assessed separately for the percentage of the area involved, which translates to a numeric score that ranges from 0 (indicates no involvement) to 6 (90%-100% involvement), and for erythema, induration, and scaling, which are each rated on a scale of 0 to 4. The PASI produces a numeric score that could range from 0 (no psoriasis) to 72. A higher score indicates more severe disease. PASI 90 response was defined as at least a 90% reduction in PASI relative to baseline. Due to failing to achieve superiority of prior secondary endpoint, no formal statistical testing was performed for endpoints from this point onwards.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Who Achieved a PASI-90 Response at Both Week 16 and 48</title>
        <description>Percentage of participants who achieved PASI-90 response at both Week 16 and 48 was reported. The PASI is a system used for assessing and grading the severity of psoriatic lesions and their response to therapy. In the PASI system, the body is divided into 4 regions: the head, trunk, upper extremities, and lower extremities. Each of these areas is assessed separately for the percentage of the area involved, which translates to a numeric score that ranges from 0 (indicates no involvement) to 6 (90%-100% involvement), and for erythema, induration, and scaling, which are each rated on a scale of 0 to 4. The PASI produces a numeric score that could range from 0 (no psoriasis) to 72. A higher score indicates more severe disease. PASI 90 response was defined as at least a 90% reduction in PASI relative to baseline.</description>

          <title>Percentage of Participants Who Achieved a PASI-90 Response at All 7 Visits From Week 24 Through Week 48</title>
          <description>The PASI is a system used for assessing and grading the severity of psoriatic lesions and their response to therapy. In the PASI system, the body is divided into 4 regions: the head, trunk, upper extremities, and lower extremities. Each of these areas is assessed separately for the percentage of the area involved, which translates to a numeric score that ranges from 0 (indicates no involvement) to 6 (90%-100% involvement), and for erythema, induration, and scaling, which are each rated on a scale of 0 to 4. The PASI produces a numeric score that could range from 0 (no psoriasis) to 72. A higher score indicates more severe disease. PASI 90 response was defined as at least a 90% reduction in PASI relative to baseline. Percentage of participants who achieved a PASI-90 response at all 7 visits from Week 24 to 48 (Week 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44 and 48) was reported.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Who Achieved PASI Response (PASI 100, PASI-90, PASI-75 and PASI-50) Over Time From Week 1 to Week 56</title>
        <description>PASI is a system used for assessing and grading the severity of psoriatic lesions and their response to therapy. In PASI system, body is divided into 4 regions: head, trunk, upper extremities, and lower extremities. Each of these areas is assessed separately for the percentage of the area involved, which translates to a numeric score that ranges from 0 (indicates no involvement) to 6 (90% to 100% involvement), and for erythema, induration, and scaling, which are each rated on a scale of 0 to 4. PASI produces a numeric score that can range from 0 (no psoriasis) to 72.Participants with &gt;=50%, &gt;= 75%, &gt;=90% and 100% improvement in PASI from baseline were considered PASI 50, 75, 90 and PASI 100 responders, respectively.</description>

        <population>Full analysis set included all the participants randomized at Week 0. Participants who met treatment failure criteria or who had missing PASI score were considered as non-responders for the specific visit.</population>

        <title>Percent Improvement From Baseline in PASI Through Week 56</title>
        <description>The PASI is a system used for assessing and grading the severity of psoriatic lesions and their response to therapy. In the PASI system, the body is divided into 4 regions: the head, trunk, upper extremities, and lower extremities. Each of these areas is assessed separately for the percentage of the area involved, which translates to a numeric score that ranges from 0 (indicates no involvement) to 6 (90%-100% involvement), and for erythema, induration, and scaling, which are each rated on a scale of 0 to 4. The PASI produces a numeric score that could range from 0 (no psoriasis) to 72. A higher score indicates more severe disease.</description>
        <time_frame>Week 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, 48 and Week 56</time_frame>
        <population>Full analysis set included all the participants randomized at Week 0. Here 'n' signifies the number of participants analyzed at specified point. Zero percent improvement was assigned from the point when participants met treatment failure criteria and no other data imputation was applied.</population>
