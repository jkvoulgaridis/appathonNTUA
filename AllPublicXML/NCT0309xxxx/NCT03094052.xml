  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study to evaluate the toxicity profile of neratinib in combination with trastuzumab
      in patients with early stage breast cancer with the use of anti-diarrheal prophylaxis. The
      anti-diarrheal medications being tested in this trial are loperamide and crofelemer.
      Crofelemer is an anti-diarrheal, enteric-coated drug product for oral administration. It is
      the only botanical drug currently approved by the FDA for oral administration and is approved
      for the treatment of diarrhea associated with HAART. Crofelemer has a novel mechanism of
      action, acting directly and simultaneously on 2 distinct intestinal luminal chloride
      channels. It is an inhibitor of both the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-stimulated
      cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) chloride ion (Cl-) channel found
      on the apical membranes, and the calcium-activated Cl- channels (CaCC) at the luminal
      membrane of enterocytes. The CFTR Cl-channel and CaCC regulate Cl and fluid secretion by
      intestinal epithelial cells. Crofelemer acts by blocking Cl- secretion and accompanying high
      volume water loss in diarrhea, normalizing the flow of Cl- and water in the GI tract.

      This is an open-label adjuvant/post neoadjuvant single arm phase 2 trial.

      Patients will receive:

      Neratinib 240 mg orally once a day for up to 52 weeks while receiving concurrent trastuzumab.
      After the completion of trastuzumab maintenance therapy (determined by treating physician),
      neratinib will continue as monotherapy for 12 months. Neratinib is to be taken continuously
      in 21-day cycles with no rest between cycles unless related to toxicity.

      Intensive daily loperamide prophylaxis for the first 2 cycles and then as needed.

      Crofelemer 125 mg bid for the first two cycles then as needed.

      Each cycle is 21 days. Clinic visits and laboratory studies are planned on day 1 of every
      cycle for the first 4 cycles, then q4 cycles thereafter. An end of treatment visit will occur
      28 days after the last dose of neratinib. Patients who permanently discontinue treatment due
      to unacceptable toxicity will be followed-up for 28 days after the last dose of neratinib.

         14. Trastuzumab can cause embryo-fetal harm when administered during pregnancy and the
             effects of neratinib on the developing human fetus are unknown. Women of child-bearing
             potential must agree and commit to use of a highly effective double-barrier method of
             contraception (e.g., a combination of male condom with an intravaginal device such as
             the cervical cap, diaphragm, or vaginal sponge with spermicide) or a non-hormonal
             method, from the signing of informed consent until 28 days after the last dose of
             neratinib and 7 months after the last dose of trastuzumab, or consent to total sexual
             abstinence (abstinence must occur from randomization and continue for 28 days after
             the last dose of neratinib and 7 months after the last dose of trastuzumab). Men
             without confirmed vasectomy must agree and commit to use a barrier method of
             contraception while on treatment and for 3 months after the last dose of
             investigational products, or consent to total sexual abstinence (abstinence must occur

         15. Recovery (i.e., to Grade 1 or baseline) from all clinically significant AEs related to
             prior therapies (excluding alopecia, neuropathy, and nail changes).

         16. Provide written, informed consent to participate in the study and follow the study
             procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        A patient will be excluded from this study if she/he meets any of the following criteria.

          1. Clinical or radiologic evidence of metastatic disease prior to or at the time of study
             entry.

          2. Currently receiving chemotherapy, radiation therapy, investigational immunotherapy, or
             investigational biotherapy for breast cancer.

          3. Major surgery (including breast surgery) within &lt;30 days of starting treatment or
             received chemotherapy, investigational agents, or other cancer therapy &lt;14 days prior
             to the initiation of investigational products (except adjuvant endocrine therapy).

          4. Active uncontrolled cardiac disease, including cardiomyopathy, congestive heart
             failure (New York Heart Association functional classification of ≥2; including
             individuals who currently use digitalis, beta-blockers, or calcium channel blockers
             specifically for congestive heart failure), unstable angina, myocardial infarction
             within 12 months of enrollment, or ventricular arrhythmia.

          5. Corrected QT interval (QTc) interval &gt;0.450 seconds (males) or &gt;0.470 seconds
             (females), or known history of QTc prolongation or Torsade de Pointes (TdP).

          6. Screening laboratory assessments outside the following limits:

             Absolute neutrophil count (ANC): ≤1,000 /μL Platelets: ≤100,000 /μL Hemoglobin: ≤9
             g/dL Serum creatinine or calculated creatinine clearance†: ≥1.5 x upper limit of
             normal (ULN) OR ≤30 mL/min for patients with creatinine levels &gt;1.5 x institutional
             ULN Serum total bilirubin: ≥1.5 x ULN OR direct bilirubin ≥ ULN for patients with
             total bilirubin levels &gt;1.5 x ULN aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (SGOT) and alanine
             aminotransferase (ALT) (SGPT): ≥2.5 x ULN

             † Creatinine clearance should be calculated per institutional standard.

             cancers, in situ melanoma or in situ cervical cancer. Patients with other non-mammary
             malignancies must have been disease-free for at least 5 years.

          8. Currently pregnant or breast-feeding.

          9. Significant chronic gastrointestinal disorder with diarrhea as a major symptom (e.g.,
             Crohn's disease, malabsorption, or Grade ≥2 National Cancer Institute [NCI] Common
             Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 4.0 [CTCAE v.4.0] diarrhea of any
             etiology at baseline).

         10. Clinically active infection with hepatitis B or hepatitis C virus.

         11. Evidence of significant medical illness, abnormal laboratory finding, or psychiatric
             illness/social situations that could, in the Investigator's judgment, make the patient
             inappropriate for this study.

         12. Known hypersensitivity to any component of the investigational products.

         13. Unable or unwilling to swallow tablets.
