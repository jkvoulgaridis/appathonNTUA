  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      After discharge from hospital, the current healthcare system in Germany allows considerable
      flexibility (therefore complexity) of patient access and mobility between multiple care
      providers in the community setting. The investigators believe this aftercare could be better
      coordinated by a specialized coordinated stroke aftercare service. Comprehensive coordinated
      multidisciplinary care is a proven concept with proven benefits in both acute and
      rehabilitation care provided in stroke units and neurorehabilitation centres. In this study,
      the investigators postulate that a similar coordinated approach to care can be extended to
      the phase after in-patient rehabilitation has ended (i.e. &quot;long-term management&quot; as opposed
      to &quot;early supported discharge&quot;) for disabled patients with stroke living in the community.

    <description>Patients will be treated in the pathological domain. Some of this treatment will be applied by the outpatient clinic itself (i.e. changes in medical secondary prevention or additional prescriptions, social work interventions), whereas most of it will be referred to other providers, if possible in vicinity to the patients' home. In order to ease treatment prescriptions and allow to measure treatment uptake, patients will also enrol in the case management system &quot;Ambulanzpartner&quot;. This allows the outpatient center to streamline prescription processes and measure uptake of therapies.</description>
