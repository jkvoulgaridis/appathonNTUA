  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is aimed to assess the correct real-world use of an autoinjector for the repeat
      self-administration of mepolizumab SC, so to improve subject / physician convenience and to
      enable repeat dose self injection themselves or via caregivers. This Phase III study will be
      an open-label, single-arm, repeat-dose, multi-centre study of mepolizumab liquid drug product
      in autoinjector (100 milligrams [mg]) administered subcutaneously (SC) every 4 weeks (3
      doses) in subjects with severe eosinophilic asthma. Subjects will receive 100 mg mepolizumab
      SC as a single injection that is self-administered in the thigh, abdomen or administered in
      the upper arm (caregiver only). Each subject will participate in the study for up to 18 weeks
      including pre-screening visit, a screening visit and a 12-week treatment period which
      concludes with end of study assessments (Visit 5) 4 weeks after the last dose of mepolizumab.
      Approximately 158 subjects will be enrolled in the study.

    <time_frame>Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>Due to differences in the labelling requirements among regulatory authorities around the world, two different labelling approaches were included in this global study: labelling that includes a pictogram plus standard labelling elements, or a standard labelling without the pictogram. Participants (and/or their caregiver) attended three on treatment visits at Week 0, 4, 8, and End of Study Visit. Training on the study treatment, device handling and administration technique was provided by the investigator or qualified site staff at Week 0 and then first dose was self-administered under observation of investigator/site staff in clinic. Second dose self-administered unobserved, at home (Week 4) and third dose was self-administered under the observation of investigator/site staff in clinic (Week 8). All Subjects (Safety) Population included all enrolled participants attempting at least one self-administration of mepolizumab. Only participants with data available at Week 8 were analyzed.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Successful Self-administration of Their Observed Third Dose at Week 8 - Autoinjector With Standard Label + Pictogram</title>
        <description>Due to differences in the labelling requirements among regulatory authorities around the world, two different labelling approaches were included in this global study: labelling that includes a pictogram plus standard labelling elements, or a standard labelling without the pictogram. Participants (and/or their caregiver) attended three on treatment visits at Week 0, 4, 8, and End of Study Visit. Training on the study treatment, device handling and administration technique was provided by the investigator or qualified site staff at Week 0 and then first dose was self-administered under observation of investigator/site staff in clinic. Second dose self-administered unobserved, at home (Week 4) and third dose was self-administered under the observation of investigator/site staff in clinic (Week 8). All Subjects (Safety) Population included all enrolled participants attempting at least one self-administration of mepolizumab. Only participants with data available at Week 8 were analyzed.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Successful Self-administration of Their Observed Third Dose at Week 8 - Autoinjector With Standard Label Only</title>
        <description>Due to differences in the labeling requirements among regulatory authorities around the world, two different labeling approaches were included in this global study: labeling that includes a pictogram plus standard labeling elements, or a standard labeling without the pictogram. Participants (and/or their caregiver) attended three on treatment visits at Week 0, Week 4, Week 8, and the End of Study Visit. Training on the study treatment, device handling and administration techniques was provided by the investigator or qualified site staff at Week 0 and then first dose was self-administered under observation of investigator/site staff in clinic. Second dose self-administered unobserved, at home (Week 4) and third dose was self-administered under the observation of investigator/site staff in clinic (Week 8). Only participants with data available at Week 8 were analyzed.</description>
