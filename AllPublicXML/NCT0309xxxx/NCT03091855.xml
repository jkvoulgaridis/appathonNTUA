    <textblock>
      PLUG Dementia Trial:

      Patients will be screened at Intermountain Medical Center and at Intermountain affiliated
      anticoagulation clinics in the Salt Lake City region. Patients with atrial fibrillation that
      undergo a standard of care, clinically approved, left atrial appendage closure will be
      considered for study. All patients will be followed for 24 months, and will be assessed at
      the 3-, 6-, 12-, 18- and 24-months post-left atrial appendage closure as well as other visits
      deemed necessary for clinical care. All subjects will undergo protocol-specified laboratory
      tests and will complete 6 standard, validated questionnaires at each follow-up visit, except
      at the 3-month visit when only one questionnaire will be administered. A subset of patients
      (n=20), will receive a cranial MRI at baseline and 24-month visit.

      MRI PLUG Dementia Sub-Study:

      In addition to the above, 20 of the 60 subjects who are selected for participation in this
      sub-study will receive a cranial MRI at baseline and at the 2-year (24 months) follow-up
      visit.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female &gt;65 years of age

          2. Atrial fibrillation documented by electrocardiogram, ambulatory event monitor, or
             telemetry within 6 months of enrollment

             placement)

          3. Has conditional cardiac MRI cardiac implantable device, joint replacements, coronary
             stents, ASD/PFO closure devices, sternal wires or most prosthetic heart valves
