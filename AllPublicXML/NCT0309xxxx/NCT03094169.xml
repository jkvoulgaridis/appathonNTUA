  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 90 male and female patients with documented solid tumor malignancies of
      epithelial origin that are locally advanced or metastatic, and either refractory to standard
      therapy or for whom no standard therapy is available, will be entered into this Phase 1a/2a,
      multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation, cohort study of AVID100. Phase 2a will include
      evaluation of patient with EGFR-overexpressing squamous histology non-small cell lung cancer,
      squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, and triple negative breast cancer
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      On Day 1 of study, patients will receive study drug administered by 2-hour IV infusion.
      AVID100 will be administered once every 3 weeks (Q3W) with administration on Day 1 of the
      first week, followed by a 3-week recovery period. In Phase 2a AVID100 will be administered at
      a dose of 220 mg/m2.

      Evidence of progressive disease at any point in the study will necessitate withdrawal of the
      patient from further participation so that alternative management of their malignancy may be
      considered. All patients will be followed to further evaluate safety as well as evidence of
      the anti-tumor effects of AVID100 in these selected patient populations. If anti-tumor
      activity is observed additional patients may be added to the planned Phase 2a patient
      populations to further characterize these effects.
