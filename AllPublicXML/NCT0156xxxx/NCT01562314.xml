      This study was conducted to determine the efficacy and safety of GWP42003 compared with
      placebo by the percentage of participants achieving remission quantified as a Mayo score of 2
      or less (with no sub-score &gt;1) after 10 weeks of treatment.

      This study was conducted by GW Research Ltd as a pilot study to determine the efficacy and
      safety of GWP42003 (50 milligram [mg] up to 250 mg twice daily [BID]), compared with placebo,
      as assessed by the percentage of participants achieving remission quantified as a Mayo score
      of 2 or less (with no sub-score &gt;1) after 10 weeks of treatment. This was the first study to
      determine whether the study drug has a positive benefit for participants on their ulcerative
      colitis symptom control, as well as effects on inflammatory marker cytokines (C reactive
      protein [CRP]), a fecal inflammatory marker (calprotectin), stool frequency, and rectal
      bleeding. In addition, various inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) questionnaires were
      implemented in the study to observe further benefits on the study drug, compared with
      placebo.

      This study was multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, and
      parallel-group. The study consisted of a 7-day baseline period, a 10-week treatment period,
      and a 1-week follow-up period. Each participant had a Mayo assessment (including endoscopy)
      conducted to confirm eligibility. Eligible participants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio into
      the GWP42003 and placebo groups. At the start of the treatment period, participants entered a
      2-week dose escalation period to achieve their maximum tolerated dose, up to 250 mg BID in
      the GWP42003 group. Participants remained at the maximum tolerated dose for the rest of the
      treatment period.

    <description>The Mayo score is an assessment of ulcerative colitis activity. The Mayo total score ranges from 0 to 12 points with higher scores indicating more severe disease. The total score is made up of 4 sub-scores, each of which is assessed using a 0 to 3 scale. Sub-scores are graded as follows: Stool Frequency: 0 = Normal number of stools, 1 = 1 to 2 stools more than normal, 2 = 3 to 4 stools more than normal, 3 = 5 or more stools more than normal; Rectal Bleeding: 0 = No blood seen, 1 = Streaks of blood with stool less than half the time, 2 = Obvious blood with stool most of the time or more, 3 = Blood alone passes; Findings on Endoscopy: 0 = Normal or inactive disease, 1 = Mild disease (erythema, decreased vascular pattern, mild friability), 2 = Moderate disease (marked erythema, lack of vascular pattern, friability, erosions), 3 = Severe disease (spontaneous bleeding, ulceration); Physician's Global Assessment of Illness Severity (PGAS): 0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, and 3 = severe.</description>

Each response is assigned a score ranging from 1 to 7, indicating the severity (1 being least favorable and 7 being the most favorable). Individual question scores were summed to give the IBDQ total score (range: 32 to 224 points). A positive change from Baseline indicates that symptoms improved.</description>

        <title>Number Of Participants With A Mayo Score Of 2 Or Less (With No Sub-score &gt;1) At EOT</title>
        <description>The Mayo score is an assessment of ulcerative colitis activity. The Mayo total score ranges from 0 to 12 points with higher scores indicating more severe disease. The total score is made up of 4 sub-scores, each of which is assessed using a 0 to 3 scale. Sub-scores are graded as follows: Stool Frequency: 0 = Normal number of stools, 1 = 1 to 2 stools more than normal, 2 = 3 to 4 stools more than normal, 3 = 5 or more stools more than normal; Rectal Bleeding: 0 = No blood seen, 1 = Streaks of blood with stool less than half the time, 2 = Obvious blood with stool most of the time or more, 3 = Blood alone passes; Findings on Endoscopy: 0 = Normal or inactive disease, 1 = Mild disease (erythema, decreased vascular pattern, mild friability), 2 = Moderate disease (marked erythema, lack of vascular pattern, friability, erosions), 3 = Severe disease (spontaneous bleeding, ulceration); Physician's Global Assessment of Illness Severity (PGAS): 0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, and 3 = severe.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline To EOT In The Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ) Total Score</title>
        <description>The IBDQ is a validated and reliable tool to measure health-related quality of life in adult participants with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Each of the 32 questions falls into 1 of 4 domains (bowel symptoms, systemic symptoms, emotional status and social function). The 32 questions each have 7 possible responses. Each response is assigned a score ranging from 1 to 7, indicating the severity (1 being least favorable and 7 being the most favorable). Individual question scores were summed to give the IBDQ total score (range: 32 to 224 points). A positive change from Baseline indicates that symptoms improved.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline To The Last Week Of Treatment In Ulcerative Colitis Symptoms, As Measured By Scores On The Stool Frequency Numerical Rating Scale (NRS)</title>
        <description>Participants were required to record their stool frequency during the baseline and treatment periods in a daily diary. Participants graded stool frequency with a 4-point NRS as follows: 0 = Normal number of stools; 1 = 1 to 2 stools more than normal; 2 = 3 to 4 stools more than normal; 3 = 5 or more stools more than normal. For analysis, the baseline value was defined as the mean stool frequency score of the last 7 available days of the baseline period; the EOT value was defined as the mean stool frequency score of last 7 days of the treatment period, or last 7 days for which study drug was taken, where earlier. A negative change from Baseline indicates that symptoms improved.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline To The Last Week Of Treatment In Ulcerative Colitis Symptoms, As Measured By Scores On The Rectal Bleeding NRS - PP Analysis</title>
        <description>Participants were required to record their rectal bleeding during the baseline and treatment periods in a daily diary. Participants graded rectal bleeding with a 4-point NRS as follows: 0 = No blood seen, 1 = Streaks of blood with stool less than half the time, 2 = Obvious blood with stool most of the time or more, 3 = Blood alone passes. For analysis, the baseline value was defined as the mean rectal bleeding score of the last 7 available days of the baseline period; the EOT value was defined as the mean rectal bleeding score of last 7 days of the treatment period, or last 7 days for which study drug was taken, where earlier. A negative change from Baseline indicates that symptoms improved.</description>

The total score is made up of 4 sub-scores (assessed using a 0 to 3 scale). The sub-scores are graded as follows: Stool Frequency: 0 = Normal number of stools, 1 = 1 to 2 stools more than normal, 2 = 3 to 4 stools more than normal, 3 = 5 or more stools more than normal; Rectal Bleeding: 0 = No blood seen, 1 = Streaks of blood with stool less than half the time, 2 = Obvious blood with stool most of the time or more, 3 = Blood alone passes; Findings on Endoscopy: 0 = Normal or inactive disease, 1 = Mild disease (erythema, decreased vascular pattern, mild friability), 2 = Moderate disease (marked erythema, lack of vascular pattern, friability, erosions), 3 = Severe disease (spontaneous bleeding, ulceration); PGAS: 0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, and 3 = severe.
