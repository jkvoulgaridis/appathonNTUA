  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate the immunogenicity response in adults up to 10 years
      after one booster dose. Data collected from this study will allow for greater information to
      prescribers who administer TBE vaccine, so that they can appropriately time the
      administration of booster vaccinations to individuals who received different vaccination
      schedules and who live in tick borne encephalitis endemic regions.

Post booster vaccination titer: GMT at Day 21 of V48P7E1 (for subjects who received booster in V48P7E1); Day 0 for subjects who received booster before V48P7E1 study start.</description>

          <title>Evaluation of GMTs</title>
          <description>GMTs by visit were tabulated for each vaccine schedule. Baselines pre booster and post booster vaccination titers were used as denominators to calculate GMRs. Pre booster vaccination titer: GMT at Day 0 of V48P7E1 prior to booster vaccine administration (excluding subjects who received the booster before V48P7E1 study start). Post booster vaccination titer: GMT at Day 21 of V48P7E1 (for subjects who received booster in V48P7E1); Day 0 for subjects who received booster before V48P7E1 study start.</description>
          <population>This analysis was performed on All Screened Set which included all subjects who were screened for participation of this study, including screening failures and withdrawals due to insufficient antibody levels or confirmed exposure to a TBE vaccine.</population>

        <description>GMTs by visit were tabulated for each vaccine schedule. Baselines pre booster and post booster vaccination titers were used as denominators to calculate GMRs. Pre booster vaccination titer: GMT at Day 0 of V48P7E1 prior to booster vaccine administration (excluding subjects who received the booster before V48P7E1 study start). Post booster vaccination titer: GMT at Day 21 of V48P7E1 (for subjects who received booster in V48P7E1); Day 0 for subjects who received booster before V48P7E1 study start.</description>

        <description>GMTs by visit were tabulated for each vaccine schedule. Baselines pre booster and post booster vaccination titers were used as denominators to calculate GMRs. Pre booster vaccination titer: GMT at Day 0 of V48P7E1 prior to booster vaccine administration (excluding subjects who received the booster before V48P7E1 study start). Post booster vaccination titer: GMT at Day 21 of V48P7E1 (for subjects who received booster in V48P7E1); Day 0 for subjects who received booster before V48P7E1 study start.</description>

        <population>This analysis was performed on All Screened Set which included all subjects who were screened for participation of this study, including screening failures and withdrawals due to insufficient antibody levels or confirmed exposure to a TBE vaccine.</population>

        <description>GMTs by visit were tabulated for each vaccine schedule. Baselines pre booster and post booster vaccination titers were used as denominators to calculate GMRs. Pre booster vaccination titer: GMT at Day 0 of V48P7E1 prior to booster vaccine administration (excluding subjects who received the booster before V48P7E1 study start). Post booster vaccination titer: GMT at Day 21 of V48P7E1 (for subjects who received booster in V48P7E1); Day 0 for subjects who received booster before V48P7E1 study start.</description>

        <description>GMTs by visit were tabulated for each vaccine schedule. Baselines pre booster and post booster vaccination titers were used as denominators to calculate GMRs. Pre booster vaccination titer: GMT at Day 0 of V48P7E1 prior to booster vaccine administration (excluding subjects who received the booster before V48P7E1 study start). Post booster vaccination titer: GMT at Day 21 of V48P7E1 (for subjects who received booster in V48P7E1); Day 0 for subjects who received booster before V48P7E1 study start.</description>

        <description>GMTs by visit were tabulated for each vaccine schedule. Baselines pre booster and post booster vaccination titers were used as denominators to calculate GMRs. Pre booster vaccination titer: GMT at Day 0 of V48P7E1 prior to booster vaccine administration (excluding subjects who received the booster before V48P7E1 study start). Post booster vaccination titer: GMT at Day 21 of V48P7E1 (for subjects who received booster in V48P7E1); Day 0 for subjects who received booster before V48P7E1 study start.</description>

          <description>GMTs by visit were tabulated for each vaccine schedule. Baselines pre booster and post booster vaccination titers were used as denominators to calculate GMRs. Pre booster vaccination titer: GMT at Day 0 of V48P7E1 prior to booster vaccine administration (excluding subjects who received the booster before V48P7E1 study start). Post booster vaccination titer: GMT at Day 21 of V48P7E1 (for subjects who received booster in V48P7E1); Day 0 for subjects who received booster before V48P7E1 study start.</description>
