    <description>A clinically meaningful improvement or deterioration was defined by domain specific thresholds of change from baseline. The FACT-An questionnaire is a 47-item, cancer specific questionnaire consisting of a core 27 items measuring 4 general domains physical well being, social/family, emotional well being and Functional Well-Being and an additional 20-item anemia questionnaire that measures fatigue and 7 non-fatigue items. The scales are formatted on 4 pages for self-administration using a 5-point Likert rating scale (0 = Not at all; 1 = A little bit; 2 = Somewhat; 3 = Quite a Bit and 4 = Very much). Also, general HRQoL measures the impact of fatigue and other anemia-related symptoms on patient functioning and is used to assess the effect of treatments in various areas, including MDS. The instrument and the fatigue and non-fatigue subscales are scored by summing points from all questions, then converting this sum to a 100 point scale; 0 = the poorest QOL and 100 = the highest QOL.</description>

          <title>International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS)</title>
          <description>The international prognostic scoring system (IPSS) is a standard for risk assessment in primary myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) that categorizes prognoses taking into account cytogenetics, cytopenias, blasts and blood counts. The IPSS prognostic subgroups consist of low-, intermediate-1-, intermediate-2-, and high-risk groups. The scale is 0-3.5 at 0.5 increments. Scores of 0=Low; 0.5-1.0=Int-1; 1.5-2.0=Int-2; 2.5-3.5=High risk which corresponds to poorer prognosis.</description>

        <description>Duration of RBC transfusion independence was analyzed only for participants who achieved RBC transfusion independence of ≥ 56 days on treatment. Duration of RBC transfusion independence was defined as the time from the date transfusion independence is first observed (day 1 of a ≥ 56 days period without a transfusion) until the date the participants had a subsequently documented RBC transfusion. In the event a participant had more than one ≥56 days rolling periods which met the RBC independence criteria, the duration with the longest rolling period was used in the analysis. Participants who maintained RBC TI through the end of the treatment period were censored at the date of treatment discontinuation, death, or 1 day before the start of the subsequent MDS treatment (if any), whichever occurred first, or the particiapnts latest available assessment date in the database if the treatment was still on-going.</description>

        <description>Duration of RBC transfusion independence was analyzed only for participants who achieved RBC transfusion independence of ≥ 84 days on treatment. Duration of RBC transfusion independence was defined as the time from the date transfusion independence is first observed (day 1 of a ≥ 84 days period without a transfusion) until the date the participants had a subsequently documented RBC transfusion. In case a participant had more than one ≥84 days rolling periods which met the RBC independence criteria, the duration with the longest rolling period was used in the analysis.</description>

        <title>Kaplan-Meier Estimate of Overall Survival (OS)</title>
        <description>Overall survial was defined as the time from randomization to death from any cause, and was calculated using randomization date and date of death, or date of last follow-up for censored participants. All subjects were followed until drop out (withdrawal of consent from further data collection or lost to follow-up), death, or study closure. Participants who dropped out or were alive at study closure (or at the time of the interim analysis) had their OS times censored at the time of last contact, as appropriate. Overall survival was assessed as an interim analysis at the time of the primary analysis.</description>
        <time_frame>From randomization to death from any cause; up to the data cut-off of date of 25 January 2019; maximum follow-up time for all participants was 67.9 months for the oral azacitidine arm and 64.8 months for placebo arm</time_frame>

        <description>Hematologic response was defined as:
A complete response (CR): &lt;5% myeloblasts, and normal maturation of all cell lines; Peripheral blood (PB) shows: hemoglobin &gt;10 g/dL, neutrophils ≥1.0x10^9/L, platelets ≥100x10^9/dL, blasts (0%)
Partial Response (PR): same as CR bone marrow (BM) shows blasts decreased by ≥ 50% over pre-treatment but still &gt; 5%; Cellularity and morphology not relevant
Marrow CR: BM: ≤ 5% myeloblasts and decrease by ≥ 50% over pre-treatment PB
Stable disease (SD): failure to achieve at least PR, but no evidence of progression for &gt; 8 wks
Failure: death during treatment or disease progression
Disease Progression for those with:
Less than 5% blasts: ≥ 50% increase in blasts to &gt; 5% blasts

        <description>A TEAE was defined as an adverse event that begins or worsens in intensity of frequency on or after the first dose of study drug through 28 days after last dose of study drug.
A serious adverse event (SAE) is any:
Death;
Life-threatening event;
Any inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization;
Persistent or significant disability or incapacity;
Congenital anomaly or birth defect;
Any other important medical event The investigator determined the relationship of an AE to study drug based on the timing of the AE relative to drug administration and whether or not other drugs, therapeutic interventions, or underlying conditions could provide a sufficient explanation for the event. The severity of an AE was evaluated by the investigator according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) (Version 4.0) where Grade 1 = Mild, Grade 2 = Moderate, Grade 3 = Severe, Grade 4 = Life-threatening and Grade 5 = Death.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in the Physical Well-Being Component of the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Anemia (FACT-An) Endpoints at Cycle 6</title>
        <description>The FACT-An questionnaire is a 47-item, cancer specific questionnaire consisting of a core 27 items measuring 4 general domains physical well being (PWG), social/family (SWB), emotional well being (EWB) and Functional Well-Being (FWB) and an additional 20-item anemia questionnaire that measures fatigue associated items and 7 non-fatigue items. The scales are formatted on 1 to 4 pages for self-administration using a 5-point Likert rating scale (0 = Not at all; 1 = A little bit; 2 = Somewhat; 3 = Quite a Bit and 4 = Very much). Also, general health related quality of life (HRQoL), the FACT-An measures the impact of fatigue and other anemia-related symptoms on patient functioning and is used to assess the effect of treatments in various therapeutic areas, including MDS. The instrument and the fatigue and non-fatigue subscales are scored by summing points from all questions, then converting this sum to a 100 point scale; 0 indicates the poorest QOL and 100 denotes the highest QOL.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline to Cycle 6 Day 1</time_frame>
        <population>The Health Related Quality of Life (HR-QoL) evaluable population was defined as participants with a non-missing FACT-An Trial Outcome Index (TOI) score at C1D1 and at least one post-baseline assessment visit.</population>

          <title>Mean Change From Baseline in the Physical Well-Being Component of the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Anemia (FACT-An) Endpoints at Cycle 6</title>
          <description>The FACT-An questionnaire is a 47-item, cancer specific questionnaire consisting of a core 27 items measuring 4 general domains physical well being (PWG), social/family (SWB), emotional well being (EWB) and Functional Well-Being (FWB) and an additional 20-item anemia questionnaire that measures fatigue associated items and 7 non-fatigue items. The scales are formatted on 1 to 4 pages for self-administration using a 5-point Likert rating scale (0 = Not at all; 1 = A little bit; 2 = Somewhat; 3 = Quite a Bit and 4 = Very much). Also, general health related quality of life (HRQoL), the FACT-An measures the impact of fatigue and other anemia-related symptoms on patient functioning and is used to assess the effect of treatments in various therapeutic areas, including MDS. The instrument and the fatigue and non-fatigue subscales are scored by summing points from all questions, then converting this sum to a 100 point scale; 0 indicates the poorest QOL and 100 denotes the highest QOL.</description>
          <population>The Health Related Quality of Life (HR-QoL) evaluable population was defined as participants with a non-missing FACT-An Trial Outcome Index (TOI) score at C1D1 and at least one post-baseline assessment visit.</population>

          <description>The FACT-An questionnaire is a 47-item, cancer specific questionnaire consisting of a core 27 items measuring 4 general domains physical well being (PWG), social/family (SWB), emotional well being (EWB) and Functional Well-Being (FWB) and an additional 20-item anemia questionnaire that measures fatigue associated items and 7 non-fatigue items. The scales are formatted on 1 to 4 pages for self-administration using a 5-point Likert rating scale (0 = Not at all; 1 = A little bit; 2 = Somewhat; 3 = Quite a Bit and 4 = Very much). Also, general health related quality of life (HRQoL), the FACT-An measures the impact of fatigue and other anemia-related symptoms on patient functioning and is used to assess the effect of treatments in various therapeutic areas, including MDS. The instrument and the fatigue and non-fatigue subscales are scored by summing points from all questions, then converting this sum to a 100 point scale; 0 indicates the poorest QOL and 100 denotes the highest QOL.</description>

        <description>The FACT-G and FACT-An score are summed to form the FACT-An total score. The FACT-An Trial Outcome Index (TOI) consists of the summation of a &quot;summary scale&quot; and includes the Physical Well-being, (PWB; 7 items; score range, 0-28), the Functional Well-being (7 items; score range, 0-28) and the Anemia subscale consisting of 20 items on the same five-point scale, with 13 of them measuring fatigue related symptoms (FS) and seven measuring non-FS. The FACT-An TOI has been demonstrated to be a sensitive indicator of clinical outcomes in a number of diseases including MDS. The Fact-TOI score ranges from 0 to 136. Higher scores on all scales of the Fact-An and subscales on the FACT-TOI reflect better quality of life or fewer symptoms.</description>

          <title>Mean Change From Baseline in the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Anemia-Total Score at Cycle 6</title>
          <description>The FACT-G and the anemia subscale (AnS) are summed to form the FACT-An total score and the total score ranges from 0 to 188. The FACT-G measures the 4 domains on a 5-point scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 4 (very much). The 4 domains are:
Physical Well-being (PWB; 7 items; score range, 0-28),
Social/Family Well-being (SWB; 7 items; score range, 0-28),
Emotional Well-being (EWB; 6 items; score range, 0-24), and
Functional Well-being (7 items; score range, 0-28). The AnS consists of 20 items on the same 5-point scale, with 13 of them measuring fatigue-related symptoms (FS) and 7 measuring non-FS. The AnS and FS scores can range from 0-80 and 0-52, respectively. For all domains and summary subscales, a higher score indicates better HRQoL or lower level of symptoms.</description>

        <description>A clinically meaningful improvement or deterioration was defined by domain specific thresholds of change from baseline. The FACT-An questionnaire is a 47-item, cancer specific questionnaire consisting of a core 27 items measuring 4 general domains physical well being, social/family, emotional well being and Functional Well-Being and an additional 20-item anemia questionnaire that measures fatigue and 7 non-fatigue items. The scales are formatted on 4 pages for self-administration using a 5-point Likert rating scale (0 = Not at all; 1 = A little bit; 2 = Somewhat; 3 = Quite a Bit and 4 = Very much). Also, general HRQoL measures the impact of fatigue and other anemia-related symptoms on patient functioning and is used to assess the effect of treatments in various areas, including MDS. The instrument and the fatigue and non-fatigue subscales are scored by summing points from all questions, then converting this sum to a 100 point scale; 0 = the poorest QOL and 100 = the highest QOL.</description>

        <description>A clinically meaningful improvement or deterioration was defined by domain specific thresholds of change from baseline. The FACT-An questionnaire is a 47-item, cancer specific questionnaire consisting of a core 27 items measuring 4 general domains physical well being, social/family, emotional well being and Functional Well-Being and an additional 20-item anemia questionnaire that measures fatigue and 7 non-fatigue items. The scales are formatted on 4 pages for self-administration using a 5-point Likert rating scale (0 = Not at all; 1 = A little bit; 2 = Somewhat; 3 = Quite a Bit and 4 = Very much). Also, general HRQoL measures the impact of fatigue and other anemia-related symptoms on patient functioning and is used to assess the effect of treatments in various areas, including MDS. The instrument and the fatigue and non-fatigue subscales are scored by summing points from all questions, then converting this sum to a 100 point scale; 0 = the poorest QOL and 100 = the highest QOL.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With a Clinically Meaningful Improvment (CMI) From Baseline in the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Anemia-General Subscale Domain Within the FACT-An Instrument at Cycle 6</title>
        <description>A clinically meaningful improvement or deterioration was defined by domain specific thresholds of change from baseline. The FACT-An questionnaire is a 47-item, cancer specific questionnaire consisting of a core 27 items measuring 4 general domains physical well being, social/family, emotional well being and Functional Well-Being and an additional 20-item anemia questionnaire that measures fatigue and 7 non-fatigue items. The scales are formatted on 4 pages for self-administration using a 5-point Likert rating scale (0 = Not at all; 1 = A little bit; 2 = Somewhat; 3 = Quite a Bit and 4 = Very much). Also, general HRQoL measures the impact of fatigue and other anemia-related symptoms on patient functioning and is used to assess the effect of treatments in various areas, including MDS. The instrument and the fatigue and non-fatigue subscales are scored by summing points from all questions, then converting this sum to a 100 point scale; 0 = the poorest QOL and 100 = the highest QOL.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Change From Baseline in Responses to the Fact-Anemia Item GP-5</title>
        <description>The distribution (frequency and percentage) of the observed responses (i.e., &quot;Not at all (0),&quot; &quot;A little bit (1),&quot; &quot;Somewhat (2),&quot; &quot;Quite a bit (3),&quot; &quot;Very much (4),&quot; and missing) to Item GP-5 (&quot;I am bothered by side effects of treatment&quot; in the past seven days) of the FACT-An at each scheduled visit were summarized for each treatment group. The denominator for the percentage calculation per treatment group was based on the number of the FACT-An evaluable population at baseline. The distribution of change in responses (improved [i.e., change score from 1 to 4], no change [0], worsened by one level [-1], worsened by ≥2 levels [-2 to -4], and missing) from baseline at each post-baseline scheduled visit were summarized by treatment group.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Change From Baseline in Responses to the Fact-Anemia Item GP-5</title>
        <description>The distribution (frequency and percentage) of the observed responses (i.e., &quot;Not at all (0),&quot; &quot;A little bit (1),&quot; &quot;Somewhat (2),&quot; &quot;Quite a bit (3),&quot; &quot;Very much (4),&quot; and missing) to Item GP-5 (&quot;I am bothered by side effects of treatment&quot; in the past seven days) of the FACT-An at each scheduled visit were summarized for each treatment group. The denominator for the percentage calculation per treatment group was based on the number of the FACT-An evaluable population at baseline. The distribution of change in responses (improved [i.e., change score from 1 to 4], no change [0], worsened by one level [-1], worsened by ≥2 levels [-2 to -4], and missing) from baseline at each post-baseline scheduled visit were summarized by treatment group.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Improved, Worsened, or No Change in the European Quality of Life-Five Dimension-Three Level (EQ-5D-3L) Mobility Dimension Responses at Cycle 6</title>
        <description>The EQ-5D-3L is a generic, self-administered questionnaire that consists of 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, pain, usual activities, and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 3 levels of severity corresponding to no problems, some problems, and extreme problems. It also includes a Visual Analog Scale that recorded the respondent's self-rated health on a vertical, 0-100 scale, where 100 = Best imaginable health state and 0 = Worst imaginable health state. Distribution of the observed responses (i.e., no problems, moderate problems, severe problems, and missing) of the 5 dimensions at each visit was summarized per arm. The denominator for the percentage calculation per group was based on the number of the EQ-5D-3L evaluable population at baseline. The distribution of change in responses (i.e., improved [by ≥1 level], no change, worsened [by ≥1 level], and missing) from baseline are reported.</description>

        <population>The HRQoL evaluable population was defined as participants with a EQ-5D-3L health utility at baseline and at least one post-baseline assessment visit.</population>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Improved, Worsened, or No Change in the European Quality of Life-Five Dimension-Three Level in the Pain/Discomfort Dimension Responses at Cycle 6</title>
        <description>The EQ-5D-3L is a generic, self-administered questionnaire that consists of 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, pain, usual activities, and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 3 levels of severity corresponding to no problems, some problems, and extreme problems. It also includes a Visual Analog Scale that recorded the respondent's self-rated health on a vertical, 0-100 scale, where 100 = Best imaginable health state and 0 = Worst imaginable health state. Distribution of the observed responses (i.e., no problems, moderate problems, severe problems, and missing) of the 5 dimensions at each visit was summarized per arm. The denominator for the percentage calculation per group was based on the number of the EQ-5D-3L evaluable population at baseline. The distribution of change in responses (i.e., improved [by ≥1 level], no change, worsened [by ≥1 level], and missing) from baseline are reported.</description>

        <population>The HRQoL evaluable population was defined as participants with a EQ-5D-3L health utility at baseline and at least one post-baseline assessment visit.</population>
