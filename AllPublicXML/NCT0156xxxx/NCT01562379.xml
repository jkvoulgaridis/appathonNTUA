  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the impact on child growth of three specially formulated
      complementary food supplements vs. Plumpy'Doz, a previously tested, commercially available
      complementary food, and vs. a control group that receives no food. All groups will receive
      nutrition education related to infant and young child feeding. This will be a
      cluster-randomised trial in children 6-18 months old in rural Rangpur and Gaibandha in
      Bangladesh.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Childhood stunting and growth faltering is highly prevalent in South Asia. Among other
      strategies, adequate complementary feeding practices and provision of complementary foods
      that are appropriate and fill the nutrient gap by providing macro and micronutrients
      essential for growth are important means to reduce the global burden of undernutrition and
      related morbidity and mortality.

      We propose to evaluate the impact of three complementary food supplement products that are
      fortified with micronutrients in a rural, remote setting in Bangladesh, where high rates of
      childhood undernutrition persist on child growth, health, and development. The three foods
      being tested are an enhanced wheat-soy blend (WSB++) developed by WFP, and locally developed
      chickpea-based and a rice-based complementary food supplements.

      We will assess the impact of feeding these daily against the non-fed controls, hypothesizing
      that the children fed these foods show increased length for age Z scores (LAZ) and weight for
      length age Z scores (WLZ) of &gt;0.21 and decreased prevalence of stunting and wasting by &gt;10%.
      We expect that the impact of the three foods will be equivalent/ non-inferior to that of
      Plumpy'Doz.
