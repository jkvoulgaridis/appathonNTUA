  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ganetespib is a drug that may stop cancer cells from growing. This drug has been used in
      other research studies and laboratory experiments. It has also been studied in phase I
      trials, where the appropriate dosing has been determined. Ganetespib is considered an &quot;HSP90
      inhibitor&quot;. By blocking HSP90, ganetespib is thought to reduce the ability of cancer cells to
      become resistant to treatment.

      Fulvestrant is a hormonal therapy that works by attaching to estrogen receptors. In doing so,
      it can block the effect of estrogen on cancer cells. In addition, fulvestrant causes a
      decrease in the number of estrogen receptors. Fulvestrant is a drug that is approved by the
      FDA for treatment of metastatic, hormone receptor positive breast cancer, based upon the
      results of phase III clinical trials.

      In the laboratory, adding ganetespib to fulvestrant appears to improve its effectiveness. It
      is not known whether this is true in humans. In this research study, we are evaluating the
      effect of the addition of ganetespib to fulvestrant in participants with hormone
      receptor-positive, metastatic breast cancer.

      Because no one knows which of the study options is best, you will be &quot;randomized&quot; into one of
      the study groups: Arm A: Fulvestrant or Arm B: Fulvestrant plus Ganetespib. You will have a
      one-third chance of being placed in Arm A and a two-thirds chance of being placed in Arm B.

      If you are initially placed in Arm A but your disease progresses, you will have the option of
      receiving the combination of fulvestrant plus ganetespib as part of Arm C.

      You will undergo the following procedures during the research study: study drug(s), blood
      tests, clinical exams and scans/imaging tests.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression-Free Survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Disease was assessed radiographically every 2 cycles for year 1 and every 2-4 cycles longer-term. Participants in this study cohort were followed for survival up to 4 years from treatment end.</time_frame>
    <description>PFS based on Kaplan-Meier is defined as the time from study entry to the earliest documentation of disease progression (PD) or death. Participants alive without evidence of PD are censored at the date of last disease assessment. Participants who receive non-protocol anti-cancer therapy before disease progression are censored at time of last disease assessment.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Grade 3-4 Toxicity Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>AEs were assessed every cycle on treatment (weeks 2-3 on cycle 1). Median treatment duration was 4 cycles/~4 months on each arm. Maximum treatment duration was 41 cycles (Arm A) and 42 cycles (Arm B) which approximates 38 months.</time_frame>
    <description>All grade 3-4 adverse events (AE) with treatment attribution of possibly, probably or definite based on NCI Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events version 4 (CTCAEv4) as reported on case report forms were counted to calculate the percentage of participants experiencing at least one treatment-related grade 3 or 4 AE of any type on treatment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Objective Response Rate (ORR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Disease was assessed radiographically every 2 cycles for year 1 and every 2-4 cycles thereafter on treatment. Maximum treatment duration was 41 cycles (Arm A) and 42 cycles (Arm B) which approximates 38 months.</time_frame>
    <description>ORR was defined as the percentage of participants with measurable disease at baseline achieving complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) based on RECIST 1.1 criteria on treatment. Per RECIST 1.1 for target lesions: CR is complete disappearance of all target lesions and PR is at least a 30% decrease in the sum of longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference baseline sum LD. PR or better overall response assumes at a minimum incomplete response/stable disease (SD) for the evaluation of non-target lesions and absence of new lesions.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Disease was assessed radiographically every 2 cycles for year 1 and every 2-4 cycles thereafter on treatment. Maximum treatment duration was 41 cycles (Arm A) and 42 cycles (Arm B) which approximates 38 months.</time_frame>
    <description>CBR was defined as the percentage of participants with measurable disease at baseline achieving complete response (CR), partial response (PR), or stable disease (SD) for 24 weeks or longer based on RECIST 1.1 criteria on treatment. Per RECIST 1.1 for target lesions: CR is complete disappearance of all target lesions and PR is at least a 30% decrease in the sum of longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference baseline sum LD. PD is at least a 20% increase in sum LD of target lesions (smallest sum LD reference), new lesions, and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions. Stable disease (SD) is defined as any condition not meeting the above criteria. SD needed to be a minimum 24 weeks in duration.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Survival (OS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Participants were followed long-term for survival every 3 months from the end of treatment until death, lost to follow-up or up to 4 years from treatment end. Median survival follow-up was 28 months for the study cohort.</time_frame>
    <description>OS based on Kaplan-Meier is defined as the time from study entry to death or date last known alive or censored at date last known alive.</description>

        <description>ORR was defined as the percentage of participants with measurable disease at baseline achieving complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) based on RECIST 1.1 criteria on treatment. Per RECIST 1.1 for target lesions: CR is complete disappearance of all target lesions and PR is at least a 30% decrease in the sum of longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference baseline sum LD. PR or better overall response assumes at a minimum incomplete response/stable disease (SD) for the evaluation of non-target lesions and absence of new lesions.</description>

          <title>Objective Response Rate (ORR)</title>
          <description>ORR was defined as the percentage of participants with measurable disease at baseline achieving complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) based on RECIST 1.1 criteria on treatment. Per RECIST 1.1 for target lesions: CR is complete disappearance of all target lesions and PR is at least a 30% decrease in the sum of longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference baseline sum LD. PR or better overall response assumes at a minimum incomplete response/stable disease (SD) for the evaluation of non-target lesions and absence of new lesions.</description>

        <title>Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR)</title>
        <description>CBR was defined as the percentage of participants with measurable disease at baseline achieving complete response (CR), partial response (PR), or stable disease (SD) for 24 weeks or longer based on RECIST 1.1 criteria on treatment. Per RECIST 1.1 for target lesions: CR is complete disappearance of all target lesions and PR is at least a 30% decrease in the sum of longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference baseline sum LD. PD is at least a 20% increase in sum LD of target lesions (smallest sum LD reference), new lesions, and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions. Stable disease (SD) is defined as any condition not meeting the above criteria. SD needed to be a minimum 24 weeks in duration.</description>
        <time_frame>Disease was assessed radiographically every 2 cycles for year 1 and every 2-4 cycles thereafter on treatment. Maximum treatment duration was 41 cycles (Arm A) and 42 cycles (Arm B) which approximates 38 months.</time_frame>
