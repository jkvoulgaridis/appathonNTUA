  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if the combination of enzastaurin and pemetrexed
      can extend survival time without progression of disease for participants who have advanced or
      metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression-Free Survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to measured progressive disease up to 9.92 months</time_frame>
    <description>PFS was defined as the time from date of randomization to the first documented observation of disease progression or death from any cause. Response was defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST, version 1.0) criteria. Progressive disease (PD) was defined as having at least a 20% increase in sum of the longest diameter of target lesions or the appearance of new lesions. PFS was censored at the date of the last objective progression-free disease assessment for participants who did not experience PD or death at the data inclusion cut-off date.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Survival (OS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to date of death from any cause up to 12.32 months</time_frame>
    <description>OS was defined as the duration from the date of randomization to the date of death from any cause. For participants who were alive at the time of the data inclusion cutoff, OS was censored at the date the participant was last known to be alive.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time-to-Worsening (TW) in Lung Cancer Symptom Scale (LCSS) - Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) Subscale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to disease worsening up to 10.58 months</time_frame>
    <description>LCSS is a participant rated lung cancer instrument which consisted of 6 disease related symptoms (appetite, cough, fatigue, dyspnea, hemoptysis, and pain) and 3 quality of life (QoL) items (activity status, symptomatic distress, and overall QoL). TW in LCSS-HRQoL was measured from the date of enrollment to the first date of a 15 millimeters (mm) worsening in the 9th LCSS item on QoL. LCSS-HRQoL was measured on the 100-mm visual analogue scale (VAS) with the scores ranging from 0 (best response and very high HRQoL) to 100-mm (worse response and very low HRQoL). TW-HRQoL was censored at the date of the participant's last LCSS assessment for participant without a 15-mm increase on the 100-mm VAS.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of Disease Control (DDC)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to measured progressive disease up to 9.92 months</time_frame>
    <description>DDC was defined as the time from randomization to the first documented observation of disease progression or death from any cause and was limited to the participants with a best tumor response of complete response (CR), partial response (PR), or stable disease (SD). Response was defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST, version 1.0) criteria. Progressive disease (PD) was defined as having at least a 20% increase in sum of the longest diameter of target lesions or the appearance of new lesions. CR was defined as the disappearance of all target lesions. PR was defined as having at least a 30% decrease in sum of longest diameter of target lesions. SD was defined as small changes that did not meet the above criteria. DDC was censored at the date of the last objective progression-free disease assessment for participants who did not experience PD or death.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Complete Response or Partial Response (Tumor Response Rate)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to measured progressive disease up to 9.92 months</time_frame>
    <description>Response was defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST, version 1.0) criteria. Participants with a best response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) were considered to have had a tumor response. CR was defined as the disappearance of all target lesions. PR was defined as having at least a 30% decrease in sum of longest diameter of target lesions. Percentage of participants was calculated as the total number of participants affected divided by the number of participants analyzed then multiplied by 100.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Tumor Biomarkers</measure>
    <time_frame>Tumor samples collected at baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Protein expression was measured using an Immunohistochemistry (IHC) assay from the tumor tissue samples. IHC histo-scores (H-scores) were determined separately for each of the 3 biomarkers: folate receptor alpha (FR alpha) in cytoplasm and apical membrane, thymidylate synthase (TS) in cytoplasm and nucleus, and thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF1) in the nucleus. Tumor tissue samples were to be scored using a 0 (negative, no staining) to 3+ (brightest staining) scoring system for cytoplasmic and nuclear staining. IHC H-score was calculated using the formula: 1 * (percentage of cells stained 1+) + 2 * (percentage of cells stained 2+) + 3 * (percentage of cells stained 3+), giving a minimum score of 0 to a maximum score of 300. The maximum score indicates the strongest expression.</description>

          <title>Disease Stage at Study Entry</title>
          <description>Disease stage describes how big the tumor is and how far it has spread from the site of origin. Stages ranged from Stage I to Stage IV. Stage III is further separated into Stage IIIA (cancer is locally advanced and spread to nearby lymph node) and Stage IIIB (cancer has spread to distant lymph nodes and invaded other organs like heart or esophagus). Stage IV has cancer spread throughout the body.</description>

        <description>LCSS is a participant rated lung cancer instrument which consisted of 6 disease related symptoms (appetite, cough, fatigue, dyspnea, hemoptysis, and pain) and 3 quality of life (QoL) items (activity status, symptomatic distress, and overall QoL). TW in LCSS-HRQoL was measured from the date of enrollment to the first date of a 15 millimeters (mm) worsening in the 9th LCSS item on QoL. LCSS-HRQoL was measured on the 100-mm visual analogue scale (VAS) with the scores ranging from 0 (best response and very high HRQoL) to 100-mm (worse response and very low HRQoL). TW-HRQoL was censored at the date of the participant's last LCSS assessment for participant without a 15-mm increase on the 100-mm VAS.</description>

Progressive disease (PD) was defined as having at least a 20% increase in sum of the longest diameter of target lesions or the appearance of new lesions. CR was defined as the disappearance of all target lesions. PR was defined as having at least a 30% decrease in sum of longest diameter of target lesions. SD was defined as small changes that did not meet the above criteria. DDC was censored at the date of the last objective progression-free disease assessment for participants who did not experience PD or death.</description>

          <title>Duration of Disease Control (DDC)</title>
          <description>DDC was defined as the time from randomization to the first documented observation of disease progression or death from any cause and was limited to the participants with a best tumor response of complete response (CR), partial response (PR), or stable disease (SD). Response was defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST, version 1.0) criteria. Progressive disease (PD) was defined as having at least a 20% increase in sum of the longest diameter of target lesions or the appearance of new lesions. CR was defined as the disappearance of all target lesions. PR was defined as having at least a 30% decrease in sum of longest diameter of target lesions. SD was defined as small changes that did not meet the above criteria. DDC was censored at the date of the last objective progression-free disease assessment for participants who did not experience PD or death.</description>
          <population>Randomized participants who received at least 1 dose of study drug and had a best tumor response of CR, PR, or SD. Fourteen (14) participants in Pemetrexed + Enzastaurin group and seventeen (17) participants in Pemetrexed + Placebo group were censored for analysis.</population>

        <title>Tumor Biomarkers</title>
        <description>Protein expression was measured using an Immunohistochemistry (IHC) assay from the tumor tissue samples. IHC histo-scores (H-scores) were determined separately for each of the 3 biomarkers: folate receptor alpha (FR alpha) in cytoplasm and apical membrane, thymidylate synthase (TS) in cytoplasm and nucleus, and thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF1) in the nucleus. Tumor tissue samples were to be scored using a 0 (negative, no staining) to 3+ (brightest staining) scoring system for cytoplasmic and nuclear staining. IHC H-score was calculated using the formula: 1 * (percentage of cells stained 1+) + 2 * (percentage of cells stained 2+) + 3 * (percentage of cells stained 3+), giving a minimum score of 0 to a maximum score of 300. The maximum score indicates the strongest expression.</description>
