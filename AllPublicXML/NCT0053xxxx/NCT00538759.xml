      The objective of the RADAR trial is to determine the impact of External Beam Radiation
      Therapy (EBRT) on aortic valve restenosis following successful percutaneous balloon aortic
      valvuloplasty (BAV) in elderly patients with severe calcific aortic stenosis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The RADAR trial is a prospective, randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled, two-stage,
      adaptive clinical trial. Following successful Balloon Aortic Valvuloplasty, patients with
      severe aortic stenosis will be randomized in a 2:1 fashion to External Beam Radiation Therapy
      (EBRT) plus standard medical therapy or standard medical therapy along with sham EBRT
      (placebo). During Stage One, approximately 110 patients will be enrolled in order to have 80
      patients randomized and 66 patients with valid 6 month data. The sample size for Stage Two
      will be calculated at the end of Stage One. At the time of study commencement, the
      expectation is that the total sample size will be approximately 155 patients with valid
      6-month data, and thus 195 will be randomized and up to 250 enrolled.

      Patients will be followed for a period of two (2) years. Echocardiographic and clinical
      endpoint data will be collected and analyzed.

    <description>Improvement from pre-procedural NYHA class. Patients' heart failure were graded according to the severity of their symptoms. The New York Heart Association (NYHA) Functional Classification was used. It places patients in one of four categories based on how much they are limited during physical activity.
I No limitation of physical activity. Ordinary physical activity does not cause undue fatigue, palpitation, dyspnea (shortness of breath).
II Slight limitation of physical activity. Comfortable at rest. Ordinary physical activity results in fatigue, palpitation, dyspnea (shortness of breath).
III Marked limitation of physical activity. Comfortable at rest. Less than ordinary activity causes fatigue, palpitation, or dyspnea.
IV Unable to carry on any physical activity without discomfort. Symptoms of heart failure at rest. If any physical activity is undertaken, discomfort increases.</description>

             than 0.45 cm2/m2.

          -  Any symptoms of severe AS, including near syncope/syncope, angina, excessive fatigue
             and/or shortness of breath with NYHA functional class II-IV limitation.

          -  Age greater than 75 and risk of aortic valve replacement surgery greater than or equal
             to 15 percent. This may be assessed by using the STS Risk Predictor (see appendix C),
             confirmed by consultation with a cardiac surgeon experienced in high risk aortic valve
             surgery

          -  OR by having a cardiac surgeon experienced in high risk aortic valve surgery document
             comorbid conditions (such as porcelain aorta, malnutrition or other comorbidities not

             percent by the estimation of the surgeon.

          -  If age greater than or equal to 90 a cardiac surgeon experienced in high risk aortic

        <description>Improvement from pre-procedural NYHA class. Patients' heart failure were graded according to the severity of their symptoms. The New York Heart Association (NYHA) Functional Classification was used. It places patients in one of four categories based on how much they are limited during physical activity.
I No limitation of physical activity. Ordinary physical activity does not cause undue fatigue, palpitation, dyspnea (shortness of breath).
II Slight limitation of physical activity. Comfortable at rest. Ordinary physical activity results in fatigue, palpitation, dyspnea (shortness of breath).
III Marked limitation of physical activity. Comfortable at rest. Less than ordinary activity causes fatigue, palpitation, or dyspnea.
IV Unable to carry on any physical activity without discomfort. Symptoms of heart failure at rest. If any physical activity is undertaken, discomfort increases.</description>
