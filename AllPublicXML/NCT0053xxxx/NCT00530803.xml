  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study compares the efficacy of the Synera patch with Eutectic Mixture of Local
      Anesthetics (EMLA) as a topical anesthetic for venipuncture in pediatric patients.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Venipunctures are common and necessary components of pediatric health care. Unfortunately,
      many children have &quot;needle phobia&quot; and even a simple procedure, such as a venipuncture, can
      cause significant stress and anxiety to the patient and the parents involved. Studies have
      shown that needles are the worst part of hospital/healthcare related visits for children.

      The Synera patch uses a controlled heating system to transcutaneously deliver a
      lidocaine/tetracaine mixture for analgesic effect. No published studies compare the efficacy
      of the Synera patch with other topical anesthetics in children. The objective of this study
      is to compare the efficacy of the Synera patch applied for 20 minutes with the efficacy of
      EMLA Cream applied for 60 minutes in reducing pain associated with venipunctures in children.

      Patients, 4-12 years old children requiring venipunctures in clinics, were randomized to
      receive Synera for 20 minutes or EMLA for 60 minutes. A blinded observer recorded pain scores
      using a numerical rating scale (NRS). Child and parent assessed pain with the Wong-Baker
      FACES Scale and the NRS, respectively. The primary outcome was the number of subjects
      reporting &quot;no pain&quot;. Secondary outcomes were parent and observer measures of the child's pain
      and the presence of skin reactions.

    <time_frame>immediately after completion of venipuncture</time_frame>
    <description>Participants were asked to report their level of pain using a 6-point Wong-Baker FACES Pain Rating Scale ranging from 0, &quot;no pain,&quot; to 5, &quot;the most pain you can have.&quot; The Wong-Baker FACES Pain Rating Scale is a validated tool for measuring pain in patients as young as 3 years old. A FACES pain score less than or equal to 2 is considered no pain to mild pain, and is clinically acceptable. Studies have shown average FACES pain scores for children receiving vascular access with placebo to be 2.2 to 3.5.</description>

    <description>The Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) is a 6-point rating scale where 0= no pain and 5 = worst pain. Parents reported their own subjective evaluation of participants pain level. Each participant had only one parental assessment. Total number of parental assessment for each pain level on the 6-point NRS is reported as total number of participants experiencing that pain level.</description>

        <description>Participants were asked to report their level of pain using a 6-point Wong-Baker FACES Pain Rating Scale ranging from 0, &quot;no pain,&quot; to 5, &quot;the most pain you can have.&quot; The Wong-Baker FACES Pain Rating Scale is a validated tool for measuring pain in patients as young as 3 years old. A FACES pain score less than or equal to 2 is considered no pain to mild pain, and is clinically acceptable. Studies have shown average FACES pain scores for children receiving vascular access with placebo to be 2.2 to 3.5.</description>
