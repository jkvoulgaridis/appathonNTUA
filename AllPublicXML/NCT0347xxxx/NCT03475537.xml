      Neurostimulation techniques such as deep brain stimulation (DBS) and spinal cord stimulation
      (SCS) have been used to treat DOC. Although these techniques have been shown to increase
      patient response, there are still some limitations. For example, DBS requires craniotomy and
      may increase the risk of intracranial hemorrhage and infection. In addition, the complexity
      and cost of these technologies also limit their potential applications.

    <description>Direct current was applied by a battery-driven constant current stimulator using saline-soaked surface sponge electrodes (7Ã—5 cm) with the anode positioned over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (F3 according to the 10-20 international system for EEG placement) and the cathode placed over the right supraorbital region. During real tDCS, the current was increased to 2 mA from the onset of stimulation and applied for 20 minutes.</description>
