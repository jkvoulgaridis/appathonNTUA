  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate pain evoked responses and facilitation of
      NGF-induced mechanical muscle hyperalgesia over time following an acute exercised-induced
      ischemic condition in a NGF-sensitized muscle.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Assessing evoked pain responses and muscle hyperalgesia following contractions during acute
      ischemia in a NGF-sensitized muscle may clarify whether an interaction between NGF
      sensitization and acidic stimulation exist.

      It is hypothesized that acute ischemic exercise with the NGF-sensitized TA muscle, in
      contrast to ischemic exercise in a non-sensitized would: 1) potentiate pain-evoked responses,
      and 2) facilitate NGF-induced muscle hyperalgesia.
