  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be conducted to determine whether lemborexant as compared to placebo
      decreases the peripheral oxygen saturation during total sleep time in healthy adult and
      elderly participants after a single dose of treatment and to determine whether it increases
      the apnea-hypopnea index after single and multiple doses of treatment in adult and elderly
      participants with mild obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).

      Healthy Volunteer (HV) Cohort:

      The HV Cohort comprises a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 3-period crossover
      study. Eligible healthy adult and elderly participants will be randomized to treatment
      sequence A, B, or C, each consisting of 3 Treatment Periods, each of one night's duration, in
      which participants will receive a single dose of lemborexant 10 milligrams (mg), or
      lemborexant 25 mg, or placebo. Treatment Periods will be separated by a washout interval of
      at least 14 days. A sufficient number of participants will be randomized to ensure that 8
      evaluable adult participants (&lt;65 years) and 4 evaluable elderly participants (≥65 years)
      complete the study.

      OSA Cohort:

      The OSA Cohort comprises a multiple-dose, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
      2-period crossover study. Adult and elderly participants with mild OSA will be randomized to
      treatment sequence D or E, each consisting of 2 Treatment Periods, each of 8 nights'
      duration, in which participants will receive lemborexant 10 mg or placebo. The Treatment
      Periods will be separated by a washout interval of at least 14 days. A sufficient number of
      participants will be randomized to ensure that 20 evaluable adult participants (&lt;65 years)
      and 10 evaluable elderly participants (≥65 years) complete the study.

    <description>SpO2 is an estimate of the amount of oxygen in the blood. It is the percentage of hemoglobin containing oxygen compared to the total amount of hemoglobin in the blood (that is, oxygenated hemoglobin versus oxygenated and non-oxygenated hemoglobin). SpO2 was monitored by noninvasive method known as transmissive pulse oximetry. TST was defined as the total time asleep in minutes using polysomnography (PSG).</description>

             with the study assessments. Participants for whom a sedating drug would be
             contraindicated for safety reasons because of the participant's occupation or
             activities are also excluded. Participants with insomnia disorder, who complain of
             difficulties with sleep onset and/or sleep maintenance, are eligible provided that
             they meet this criterion. Note that medications to treat insomnia are prohibited.

        <description>TST was defined as the total time asleep in minutes using PSG. SpO2 is an estimate of the amount of oxygen in the blood. It is the percentage of hemoglobin containing oxygen compared to the total amount of hemoglobin in the blood (that is, oxygenated hemoglobin versus oxygenated and non-oxygenated hemoglobin). SpO2 was monitored by noninvasive method known as transmissive pulse oximetry.</description>
        <time_frame>Day 1 and Day 8</time_frame>
        <population>PD analysis set included group of participants who received at least 1 dose of study drug in each treatment periods and who had sufficient PD data to derive at least 1 primary PD parameter. Here, 'number analyzed' signifies participants who were evaluable for analysis at the specified timepoints.</population>

        <title>OSA Cohort: Percentage of Participants With at Least One Incident of SpO2 &lt;90% for at Least 30 Seconds During TST on Day 1 and Day 8 of Treatment</title>
        <description>SpO2 is an estimate of the amount of oxygen in the blood. It is the percentage of hemoglobin containing oxygen compared to the total amount of hemoglobin in the blood (that is, oxygenated hemoglobin versus oxygenated and non-oxygenated hemoglobin). SpO2 was monitored by noninvasive method known as transmissive pulse oximetry. TST was defined as the total time asleep in minutes using PSG.</description>
