      Aqueduct's Smart External Drain (SED) will be compared to the current gold standard for
      temporary CSF management in a hospital setting.

        -  Evaluate the number of subjects requiring to be switched to a standard of care EVD

        -  Evaluate subject transport while on the SED

        -  Evaluate SED system control from initiation of SED through discharge of external drain
           system

      This clinical trial will evaluate Aqueduct's Smart External Drain (SED) upon implementation
      of ventriculostomy or lumbar drain placement for temporary CSF external management in a
      hospital setting. Subjects will remain on study from the time of SED application through
      discharge of the external drain or switch to standard of care extraventricular drain.
