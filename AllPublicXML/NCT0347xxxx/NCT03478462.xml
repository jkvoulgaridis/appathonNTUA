  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study evaluates CLR 131 in children and adolescents with relapsed or refractory malignant
      solid tumors and lymphoma and recurrent or refractory malignant brain tumors for which there
      are no standard treatment options with curative potential.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Even with standard, highly toxic multimodality therapies and salvage regimen, most pediatric
      patients with primary metastatic or relapsed solid tumors are confronted with a poor
      prognosis. For these patients there is currently no accepted successful treatment regimen.
      There is a need for new drugs, including targeted radiopharmaceuticals, preferably with
      cancer-specific uptake and broad applicability for these rare pediatric malignancies.

      CLR 131 is a radioiodinated therapeutic that exploits the selective uptake and retention of
      phospholipid ethers (PLEs) by malignant cells. Cellectar Biosciences' novel cancer-targeted
      small-molecule compound (CLR1404) is radiolabeled with the isotope iodine-131 (I-131). CLR
      131 has demonstrated tumor selective uptake across numerous adult and pediatric cancer cell
      types. Therapeutic efficacy has been demonstrated in various pediatric and adult-type cancer
      xenograft models, confirming the ability of CLR 131 to target tumors.

      Based on the critical unmet medical need for effective agents with novel mechanisms of action
      in relapsed pediatric cancers and initial preclinical and clinical experience with
      radioiodinated CLR1404, Cellectar Biosciences has chosen to assess CLR 131 in a phase 1
      pediatric trial.
