      This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a Cloak Shape sham Pediatric Tuina device
      which can be applied in randomized controlled trials for Pediatric Tuina research.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chinese pediatric Tuina has been practiced as an option for health promotion, including
      disease prevention and treatment, more than one thousand years ago (652 AD). Many of the
      acupoints adopted in Chinese pediatric Tuina are located on children's fingers, hands and
      arms, which are unique if it is compared with those for adult tuina. The manipulation is
      found to be easily accepted by children, as the strength of tuina is gentle and soft. No
      severe adverse reaction in regards of Chinese pediatric Tuina was reported, the mild adverse
      reaction such as skin abrasion can be completely avoided with correct operating instructions.
      However, it is still lack of high quality RCTs (Randomized Controlled Trials) to evaluate its
      efficacy. The main obstacle is the difficulty to conduct a valid sham Tuina comparison group.
      In order to solve this problem, the investigators designed a device for sham Tuina, with a
      Cloak Shaped cover which is opaque and big enough to cover the whole body and arms of a child
      who is under 6 years old. Two narrow holes are required on the cover, so that the therapist's
      hands can touch the child through these holes. The whole manipulation process will be
      invisible under the cover.The investigators aim to detect whether it is effective as a sham
      device for pediatric Tuina researches.

As it is a study to assess the validation of blinding, the outcome assessment will mainly conduct among parents and observers . Questionaire will also be used for children who are over 3 yrs as they can understand. Therefore the units are child-parent-observer</population>

            <description>Participants will receive real tuina manipulated on their skin in addition to the conventional therapy given by the doctors. The whole process of the Tuina, which may last for 15 minutes, should be completed under the Cloak Shape device. After that the parents and the observers may be required to fill out corresponding questionnaires. The outcomes assessors will ask the child the sense perception of the manipulation via a questionnaire if he is equal or older than 3 years old.
Cloak Shape Device for Real Tuina: The Cloak Shape Device for Real Tuina is opaque and big enough to cover the whole body and arms of a child who is under 6 years old. Two narrow holes are required on the cover, so that the therapist’s hands can touch the child through these holes and a real Tuina will be manipulated.</description>

A cloak shape device will be adopted, while inside the cover the therapist will use one hand to hold the childrens' hand or just put one hand on childrens' body and the other hand will do the manipulations on the therapist's own hand instead of childrens' hand or childrens' body. The acupoints and the manipulation time are the same as real Tuina group. Same questionnaires as those adopted in real Tuina group are also required to be completed.

The whole process of the Tuina, which may last for 15 minutes, should be completed under the Cloak Shape device.

The outcomes assessors will ask the child the sense perception of the manipulation via a questionnaire if he is equal or older than 3 years old.
Cloak Shape Device for Real Tuina: The Cloak Shape Device for Real Tuina is opaque and big enough to cover the whole body and arms of a child who is under 6 years old. Two narrow holes are required on the cover, so that the therapist’s hands can touch the child through these holes and a real Tuina will be manipulated.</description>

      <time_frame>The adverse event data were collected during the Tuina therapy and 1 month after the therapy.</time_frame>

          <title>Real Tuina</title>
          <description>Children will receive real tuina manipulated on their skin in addition to the conventional therapy given by the doctors. The whole process of the Tuina, which may last for 15 minutes, should be completed under the Cloak Shape device. After that the parents and the observers may be required to fill out corresponding questionnaires. The outcomes assessors will ask the child the sense perception of the manipulation via a questionnaire if he is equal or older than 3 years old.
Cloak Shape Device for Real Tuina: The Cloak Shape Device for Real Tuina is opaque and big enough to cover the whole body and arms of a child who is under 6 years old. Two narrow holes are required on the cover, so that the therapist’s hands can touch the child through these holes and a real Tuina will be manipulated.</description>

        <group group_id="E2">
          <title>Sham Tuina</title>
          <description>Except for the conventional therapy given by doctors, children in this group will receive sham Tuina. A cloak shape device will be adopted, while inside the cover the therapist will use one hand to hold the childrens' hand or just put one hand on childrens' body and the other hand will do the manipulations on the therapist's own hand instead of childrens' hand or childrens' body. The acupoints and the manipulation time are the same as real Tuina group. Same questionnaires as those adopted in real Tuina group are also required to be completed.
Cloak Shape Device for Sham Tuina: The Cloak Shape Device for Sham Tuina is exactly the same as the real one, which is opaque and big enough to cover the whole body and arms of a child who is under 6 years old. Two narrow holes are required on the cover, so that the therapist’s hands can touch the child through these holes and a sham Tuina will be manipulated</description>
