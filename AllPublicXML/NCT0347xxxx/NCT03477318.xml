  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study purpose is to assess the accuracy of experienced endoscopists at a community
      hospital in predicting histological types of polyps resected at colonoscopy using white
      light. Patients 50 years or older undergoing first-time screening colonoscopy will be
      included in this observational study.

      The study purpose is to assess the accuracy of experienced endoscopists at a community
      hospital in predicting histological types of polyps resected at colonoscopy using white
      light. The study will be conducted at Good Samaritan Hospital and TriHealth Surgery Center
      West. Study participants include patients 50 years or older undergoing first-time screening
      colonoscopy. This is an observational study and does not involve any patient interventions.
      After completing the colonoscopy, the endoscopist will document their prediction of the polyp
      type. The polyp type predicted by the endoscopist will be compared to the polyp type
      documented in the pathology report to determine accuracy. It is estimated that study
      enrollment will take 6 months.
