  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The ID-Cap System is classified as an ingestion event marker (IEM), a Class II medical
      device. The system is intended to record time-stamped ingestions with the ingestible sensor,
      ID-Tag which transmits a signal to a wearable device, the ID-Cap Reader. In this study, 36
      subjects will ingest capsules containing ingestible sensors while wearing the Reader and
      being observed in a clinic setting.

    <intervention_model_description>This study is a prospective, blinded, clinical study evaluating the safety and effectiveness of the ID-Cap System under direct observation in the clinical setting. Subjects will ingest a series of active ID capsules containing ingestible sensors and a series of empty placebo capsules that will be randomly administered. The ID-Capsule System's feasibility/ability to properly record actual ingestions (Positive Detection Accuracy) and to not record blank ingestions (Negative Detection Accuracy) will be evaluated.</intervention_model_description>
