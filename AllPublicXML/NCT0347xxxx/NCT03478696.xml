  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate lung function and health related quality of
      life (HRQoL) after 84 days of treatment with a single inhaler triple therapy combination of
      FF/UMEC /VI [100/62.5/25 microgram (mcg)] once daily via ELLIPTAÂ® compared with a multiple
      inhaler combination therapy of Symbicort Metered Dose Inhaler (MDI) (budesonide/formoterol
      320/9 mcg) twice daily plus Spiriva HandiHaler (tiotropium 18 mcg) once daily. The study will
      inform healthcare providers that subjects can be effectively and safely switched to FF/UMEC
      /VI single inhaler therapy from a multiple inhaler triple therapy regimen of Symbicort MDI
      and Spiriva Handihaler. Eligible subjects will enter a 4-week run-in period during which they
      will be administered budesonide/formoterol (320/9 mcg) twice daily plus tiotropium (18 mcg)
      once daily plus placebo via ELLIPTA. Following the run-in period, subjects will be randomized
      to receive one of the following study treatments for 84 days: 1) FF/UMEC /VI 100/62.5/25 mcg
      via ELLIPTA once daily in the morning plus two inhalations of placebo to match
      budesonide/formoterol via MDI, twice daily plus placebo to match tiotropium via HandiHaler
      once daily in the morning or 2) Budesonide/formoterol 320/9 mcg via MDI, twice daily plus
      tiotropium 18 mcg via HandiHaler once daily in the morning plus placebo via ELLIPTA once
      daily in the morning. Subjects will then enter a one week follow-up period. The total
      duration for a subject in the study will be approximately 17 weeks. ELLIPTA is a registered
      trademark of the GlaxoSmithKline group of companies.

    <measure>Weighted Mean Change From Baseline in Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 Second (FEV1) Over 0-24 Hours at Week 12 for Modified Per Protocol (mPP) Population</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>FEV1 is an important measure of pulmonary function and is the maximum amount of air that can be forced out in one second after taking a deep breath. FEV1 was measured using spirometry. Serial FEV1 assessments were performed at multiple time points (-30 and -5 minutes pre-dose, and 5 minutes, 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 1 hour, 3 hours, 6 hours, 12 hours, 15 hours, 21 hours, 23 hours and 24 hours post-dose) over 24-hour period at Week 12. Weighted mean change from Baseline at week 12 was calculated by subtracting weighted mean FEV1 at week 12 from Baseline FEV1, where Baseline FEV1 is the average of the two FEV1 measurements made at 30 minutes and 5 minutes pre-dose on Day 1. The weighted mean was derived by calculating the area under the FEV1 time curve (AUC) over the actual time of assessment relative to the time of dosing (over 24-hour period) using the trapezoidal rule, and then dividing the value by the time interval (24-hour) over which the AUC was calculated.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, Days 2, 28, 84 and 85</time_frame>
    <description>FEV1 is an important measure of pulmonary function and is the maximum amount of air that can be forced out in one second after taking a deep breath. FEV1 was measured using spirometry. For Day 2 and Day 85, trough FEV1 was defined as the mean of the 23-hour and 24-hour serial spirometry FEV1 measurements. For Day 28 and Day 84, trough FEV1 was defined as the average of the pre-dose FEV1 measurements recorded before the morning dose of randomized study treatment. Change from Baseline in trough FEV1 was calculated by subtracting post-dose trough FEV1 value from Baseline FEV1, where Baseline FEV1 is the average of the two FEV1 measurements made at 30 minutes and 5 minutes pre-dose on Day 1. The treatment effect to be estimated for trough FEV1 was hypothetical effect if all participants stayed on their randomized study treatment. Only on treatment data was included in analysis.</description>

        <title>Weighted Mean Change From Baseline in Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 Second (FEV1) Over 0-24 Hours at Week 12 for Modified Per Protocol (mPP) Population</title>
        <description>FEV1 is an important measure of pulmonary function and is the maximum amount of air that can be forced out in one second after taking a deep breath. FEV1 was measured using spirometry. Serial FEV1 assessments were performed at multiple time points (-30 and -5 minutes pre-dose, and 5 minutes, 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 1 hour, 3 hours, 6 hours, 12 hours, 15 hours, 21 hours, 23 hours and 24 hours post-dose) over 24-hour period at Week 12. Weighted mean change from Baseline at week 12 was calculated by subtracting weighted mean FEV1 at week 12 from Baseline FEV1, where Baseline FEV1 is the average of the two FEV1 measurements made at 30 minutes and 5 minutes pre-dose on Day 1. The weighted mean was derived by calculating the area under the FEV1 time curve (AUC) over the actual time of assessment relative to the time of dosing (over 24-hour period) using the trapezoidal rule, and then dividing the value by the time interval (24-hour) over which the AUC was calculated.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Trough FEV1 on Day 2, Day 28, Day 84 and Day 85</title>
        <description>FEV1 is an important measure of pulmonary function and is the maximum amount of air that can be forced out in one second after taking a deep breath. FEV1 was measured using spirometry. For Day 2 and Day 85, trough FEV1 was defined as the mean of the 23-hour and 24-hour serial spirometry FEV1 measurements. For Day 28 and Day 84, trough FEV1 was defined as the average of the pre-dose FEV1 measurements recorded before the morning dose of randomized study treatment. Change from Baseline in trough FEV1 was calculated by subtracting post-dose trough FEV1 value from Baseline FEV1, where Baseline FEV1 is the average of the two FEV1 measurements made at 30 minutes and 5 minutes pre-dose on Day 1. The treatment effect to be estimated for trough FEV1 was hypothetical effect if all participants stayed on their randomized study treatment. Only on treatment data was included in analysis.</description>

        <title>Weighted Mean Change From Baseline in FEV1 Over 0-24 Hours on Day 1</title>
        <description>FEV1 is an important measure of pulmonary function and is the maximum amount of air that can be forced out in one second after taking a deep breath. FEV1 was measured using spirometry. Serial FEV1 assessments were performed at multiple time points (-30 and -5 minutes pre-dose, and 5 minutes, 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 1 hour, 3 hours, 6 hours, 12 hours, 15 hours, 21 hours, 23 hours and 24 hours post-dose) over 24-hour period on Day 1. Weighted mean change from Baseline on Day 1 was calculated by subtracting weighted mean FEV1 on Day 1 from Baseline FEV1, where Baseline FEV1 is the average of the two FEV1 measurements made at 30 minutes and 5 minutes pre-dose on Day 1. The weighted mean was derived by calculating the area under the FEV1 time curve (AUC) over the actual time of assessment relative to the time of dosing (over 24-hour period) using the trapezoidal rule, and then dividing the value by the time interval (24-hour) over which the AUC was calculated.</description>

        <title>Weighted Mean Change From Baseline in FEV1 Over 0-24 Hours at Week 12 for ITT Population</title>
        <description>FEV1 is an important measure of pulmonary function and is the maximum amount of air that can be forced out in one second after taking a deep breath. FEV1 was measured using spirometry. Serial FEV1 assessments were performed at multiple time points (-30 and -5 minutes pre-dose, and 5 minutes, 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 1 hour, 3 hours, 6 hours, 12 hours, 15 hours, 21 hours, 23 hours and 24 hours post-dose) over 24-hour period at Week 12. Weighted mean change from Baseline at week 12 was calculated by subtracting weighted mean FEV1 at week 12 from Baseline FEV1, where Baseline FEV1 is the average of the two FEV1 measurements made at 30 minutes and 5 minutes pre-dose on Day 1. The weighted mean was derived by calculating the area under the FEV1 time curve (AUC) over the actual time of assessment relative to the time of dosing (over 24-hour period) using the trapezoidal rule, and then dividing the value by the time interval (24-hour) over which the AUC was calculated.</description>
