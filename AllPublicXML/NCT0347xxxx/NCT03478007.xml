  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to develop, design and implement an easy-to-use, cloud-enabled
      software for patients with low back pain and evaluate the effect of the system on compliance
      and quality of life. The investigators hypothesize that a device which measures compliance to
      physical therapy regimens in patients with low back pain will increase patient participation.

      Innovative Design Labs (IDL) proposes to develop and deploy a low-cost measurement system
      which tracks exercise compliance and enables remote health coaching for patients with low
      back pain. The system will consist of a series of small motion sensors built into a custom
      designed harness which connect wirelessly to the user's tablet or smartphone. A software
      application will guide the patient through the exercise routine while the sensor system
      monitors their motion, classifies exercise completion, and tracks their progress through the
      protocol. The results of the routine will be securely uploaded to caregivers where they can
      monitor progress, modify the patient's exercise prescription, and offer encouragement and
      coaching to continue the therapy. This research program aims to enable the long term
      treatment-tracking of patients with chronic low back pain.

    <time_frame>Baseline and 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will fill out the Modified Oswestry Disability Index, a 10 section questionnaire with 6 possible answers within each section. Statement 1 is graded as 0 points; statement 6 is graded as 5 points. A total score of 50 is possible and would indicate 100% disability. A score of 0-20% indicates minimal disability.</description>

    <measure>Change in Overall Pain</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will fill out the pain Numerical Rating Scale survey, a 4 question survey used to rate intensity of pain from a scale of 0 (&quot;no pain&quot;) to 10 (&quot;worst possible pain&quot;). Pain is categorized as mile (1-3), moderate (4-6) or severe (7-10).</description>

    <measure>Degree of Compliance</measure>
    <time_frame>4 and 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Compliance collected through written diaries (control group) or electronically recorded compliance monitoring. Compliance will be defined on whether or not the subject completed the assigned exercises each day.</description>
