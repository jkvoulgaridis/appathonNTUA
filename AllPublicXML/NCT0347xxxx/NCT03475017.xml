  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many studies have been conducted to identify therapeutic strategies to modulate inflammation
      and oxidative stress, complications that contribute to the increased morbidity and
      cardiovascular mortality in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Among several
      non-pharmacological strategies, the use of bioactive compounds has emerged as a potential
      approach to reduce these complications in CKD patients. In this context, turmeric/curcumin
      may have positive consequences in terms of cardiovascular and nephroprotection because of its
      antibacterial, antiviral, anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative effects. The aim of this study
      is the role of curcumin as a nutritional strategy to reduce cardiovascular risk factors as
      inflammation and oxidative stress in CKD patients.

      This is a longitudinal study of the type randomized crossover, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled, washout period. We selected 30 patients with CKD in hemodialysis at
      Clínica Renalcor / RJ (second sample calculation, considering p = 0.05 and test power of
      80%). Eligible patients of both genders, previously evaluated and authorized by the medical
      staff of the clinic, were invited to participate in the research.

      The research was carried out after signing the free and informed consent form, according to
      the standards of the local Research Ethics Committees and required by Resolution 466 of
      December 12, 2012 (Conselho Nacional de Saúde), based on the guidelines of the Declaration of
      Helsinki and of the World Medical Association on human research. This project was approved by
      the Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Medicine / UFF, number: 2.346.933. It is registered
      with ClinicalTrials.gov under the number NCT 03475017.

      Inclusion and exclusion criteria:

      Patients with stage 5 CKD (GFR &lt;15 mL / min) on hemodialysis for more than 6 months, aged at
      least 18 years, and who had arteriovenous fistula (AVF) as vascular access were included in
      the study. Patients who were pregnant, smokers, antibiotics in the last 3 months, antioxidant
      supplements and habitual turmeric and / or turmeric intake, besides those with autoimmune and
      infectious diseases, cancer, hepatic diseases and AIDS were not included in the study.

      Experimental Design

      Patients who accepted to participate in the study and who were included in the inclusion and
      exclusion criteria were randomized into two groups:

        1. Turmeric Group: patients will receive juice containing 100 ml of orange juice, 12 grams
           of carrot and 2.5 grams of turmeric 95% curcumin 3 times a week for 12 weeks.

        2. Placebo group: patients will receive the same juice, however, without the addition of
           curcumin turmeric 95%, for the same period of time as the turmeric group.

      The juices were prepared by the team responsible for the research project, and delivered to
      the patients after the end of the dialysis procedure. After the supplementation period, the
      12-weeks washout was performed for subsequent crossover of the patients.
