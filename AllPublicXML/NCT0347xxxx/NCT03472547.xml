      Single center, randomized, controlled, evaluator blinded, within-subject study to evaluate
      the sensitization potential of diacerein 1% ointment under occlusive conditions on normal
      skin of healthy volunteer subjects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study was designed to assess the sensitization potential of diacerein 1% ointment in
      comparison to vehicle ointment and 0.9% saline (negative irritant control) under occlusive
      patch conditions, at 3 randomly assigned, adjacent skin sites, 3 times weekly for 3 weeks (9
      applications) during the Induction Phase, and one time during the Challenge Phase (10 times
      in total) for determining sensitization potential.

    <description>The determination of dermal sensitization potential was based on the recurrence of a cutaneous response at re-challenge that was equivalent or more severe than the cumulative irritation score observed during the challenge period.
Cumulative irritation score is a visual score rating the degree of erythema, edema, and other signs of cutaneous irritation: Minimum = 0; Maximum = 6; higher score is worse outcome.</description>
