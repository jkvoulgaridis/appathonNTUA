  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the Phase 2 CSEG101B2201 study is to confirm and to establish appropriate
      dosing and to evaluate the safety in pediatric patients ages 6 months to &lt;18 years with a
      history of VOC with or without HU/HC, receiving crizanlizumab for 2 years. The efficacy and
      safety of crizanlizumab was already demonstrated in adults with sickle cell disease. The
      approach is to extrapolate from the PK/pharmacodynamics (PD) already established in the adult
      population. The study is designed as a Phase II, multicenter, open-label study.

             diagnosis by two accepted methods is recomended.

          -  Experienced at least 1 VOC within the preceding 12 months prior to screening, as

             not been receiving such drugs must have been off for at least 6 months prior to
             screening. Dose alterations of HU/HC during Part A are not allowed, and if this
