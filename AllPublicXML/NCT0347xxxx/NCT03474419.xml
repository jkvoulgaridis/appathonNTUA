  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Every year more than 70 000 interventions for prostatic adenoma are realized. Several type of
      surgery are realized going of the ambulatory to longer hospital lengths of stay. There are
      also several techniques.However it appears that ambulatory surgery is less costly. The
      arguments of surgeons are patients reluctance or the difficulty to manage in case of
      complication.

      The aim of the study is to show that there is a good acceptance from patient with a good
      level of satisfaction at day 30.
