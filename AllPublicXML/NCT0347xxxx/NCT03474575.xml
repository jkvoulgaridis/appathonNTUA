  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is between 8 and 15% of the
      adult population in 2010. This prevalence is expected to increase over the coming decades as
      the population ages and exposure to the risk factors for the disease continues. The evolution
      of COPD is marked by the occurrence of exacerbations of varying severity responsible for 1%
      of emergency department admission. Thus,95% of COPD patients admitted to emergency department
      for exacerbation are hospitalized.

      Several recent studies seem to show that an early discharge from hospital with home care can
      reduce the rate of rehospitalisation and mortality of COPD patients. These preliminary data
      on low numbers need to be confirmed. In addition, it seems necessary to identify the
      phenotypes of patients who benefit most from these early exits.

      Exadom project (supported by Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne Regional Health Authorities (ARS),
      AstraZeneca and Grenoble Alpes University Hospital) aims to establish a safe and effective
      way of discharging patients by providing enhanced home-based care for AECOPD.

      Exadom project (supported by Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne Regional Health Authorities (ARS) ,
      Grenoble Alpes University Hospital) aims to establish a safe and effective way of discharging
      COPD patients from emergency department by providing enhanced home care.

      This program implements ambulatory care immediately after leaving the emergency department
      with a main goal of reducing hospital readmission during the first month. The home-based
      support includes daily visits at home conducted by the home care provider's nurses from day 1
      to day 7, telephone calls at days 14 and 21 and a final home visit one month after discharge
      from the emergency department. Blood samples will be collected at inclusion, day 7 and one
      month during home visit and urine samples at inclusion, day 2, day 4 and one month during
      home visit .Telephone follow-up at 3, 6 months and one year.
