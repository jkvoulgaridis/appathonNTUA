    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the treatment effect of intravenous TAK-954 in
      improving the average daily protein adequacy received through enteral nutrition in
      critically-ill participants developing EFI.

    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-954. The study will assess the treatment
      effect of intravenous TAK-954 in improving average daily protein adequacy received through
      enteral nutrition in critically ill participants with EFI.

      The study will enroll approximately 200 participants. Participants will be randomly assigned
      (by chance, like flipping a coin) to one of the 4 treatment groups -which will remain
      undisclosed to the participant and study doctor during the study (unless there is an urgent
      medical need):

        -  Group A: TAK-954 0.1 mg

        -  Group B: TAK-954 0.3 mg

        -  Group C: TAK-954 1 mg

        -  Group D: Metoclopramide 10 mg

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in the United States, United Kingdom, Australia and
      Canada. The overall duration of treatment in this study is maximum of 14 days while in
      hospital. Participants will be contacted by telephone 30 and 90 days after receiving their
      last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.

    <ipd_description>Takeda makes patient-level, de-identified data sets and associated documents available after applicable marketing approvals and commercial availability have been received, an opportunity for the primary publication of the research has been allowed, and other criteria have been met as set forth in Takeda's Data Sharing Policy (see www.TakedaClinicalTrials.com/Approach for details). To obtain access, researchers must submit a legitimate academic research proposal for adjudication by an independent review panel, who will review the scientific merit of the research and the requestor's qualifications and conflict of interest that can result in potential bias. Once approved, qualified researchers who sign a data sharing agreement are provided access to these data in a secure research environment.</ipd_description>
