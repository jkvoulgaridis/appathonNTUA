  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study is a single-arm, multi-center, open-label phase II study of the
      combination of palbociclib and ibrutinib in patients with previously treated mantle cell
      lymphoma to evaluate the efficacy of this combination, with the primary objective of the
      study being to assess median PFS and the secondary objectives to include ORR, CR, DOR, OS and
      toxicity. Subjects will be enrolled and treated with palbociclib and ibrutinib with each
      cycle of therapy being 28 days. Treatment will be based on the recommended phase II dose
      (RP2D) from the phase I combination trial.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Treatment will consist of:

        -  Palbociclib administered at 100 mg oral once daily for 21 days on followed by 7 days off

        -  Ibrutinib administered at 560 mg oral continuously

      Patients will continue to receive study drugs until disease progression, unacceptable
      toxicity, or withdrawal of consent. If at any time one of the agents is held due to toxicity,
      the other agent may be continued in those patients who are receiving clinical benefit.

      Response will be assessed by PET/CT and/or CT every 3 cycles while on therapy for the first
      year and then every 6 cycles thereafter until disease progression or at the investigator's
      discretion if otherwise medically indicated. A PET will be required to confirm CR. A bone
      marrow biopsy will be performed in patients with bone marrow involvement at the start of
      therapy to confirm complete response once patients have otherwise met criteria for CR.

          5. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, diabetes, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit
             compliance with study requirements.

          6. Subjects with myocardial infarction within 6 months prior to enrollment or has New
             York Heart Association (NYHA) Class III or IV heart failure, uncontrolled angina,

             (serum or urine) within 7 days prior to registration, irrespective of the method of
             contraception used, are excluded from this study because the effect of palbociclib on
             a developing fetus is unknown. Breastfeeding should be discontinued prior to study
             entry.

          8. Subjects must agree to use barrier contraceptive methods throughout the study period
             up until at least 90 days post last palbociclib dose.

          9. Subjects with clinically significant history of liver disease, including viral or
             other known hepatitis, current alcohol abuse, or cirrhosis, etc.

         11. Subjects with a bleeding diathesis are not eligible.
