      The objective of this study is to determine the relative gentleness of a new medical tape. A
      three-prong multidimensional evaluation consisting of expert grader, subject discomfort
      assessment, and laboratory assessments was used. One pre-study visit took place up to 7 days
      prior to the start of the study. The study was conducted over two days with one tape sample
      applied and removed. Assessments were taken on the final day. This was to mimic a normal tape
      application in health care practice.

    <description>The Face, Legs, Activity, Cry, Consolability (FLACC) scale is a measurement used to assess pain for children Participants between the ages of 2 months and 7 years or individuals that are unable to communicate their pain. The scale is scored in a range of 0-10 with 0 representing no pain. Lower values represent lessening pain on the scale. At the 24 hour visit , a baseline FLACC score was recorded with the tape still in place. The tape was then removed and a FLACC score was recorded after removal. The reported value is the difference between FLACC after removal and FLACC at baseline.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria: Subjects will be infants or children of either gender who meet the
        following criteria:

          1. Who are healthy and who have intact skin at the test site with a baseline score of 0
             for erythema

          2. Who are between the ages of 6 months - 4 years of age (48 months)

          3. Who have a Fitzpatrick Skin Type of I, II or III

          4. Whose parent or legal representative agrees to not use any products (i.e. topical
             medications, creams, powders or ointments) on the test sites for 24 hours prior to the
             study start date

          5. Whose parent or legal representative agrees to sponge bathe their child during the
             study but agrees to not bathe their child 1 hour before each visit.

          6. Whose parent or legal representative agrees to not soak the tape during a sponge bath.
             If the site gets wet, parent or legal representative agrees to pat their child's back
             dry (no rubbing).

          7. Whose parent or legal representative is willing to sign the Informed Consent Form
             (with photo release) and HIPAA Authorization.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          2. Who have any known allergy or sensitivity to tapes

          3. Who have sunburn, skin infection or scars, moles, or other blemishes on the back that
             would obscure grading of the test site

          4. Who have had any exposure to other topical medications, creams, powders, or ointments
             on the test sites 24 hours prior to the start of the study

          5. Who have had a strep infection within the 2 weeks prior to the start of the study

          6. Who have a history of uncontrolled diabetes, psoriasis, any active dermatitis, or
             recent history of dermatitis or skin reactions

          7. Has participated in any study in the last 2 weeks, or are currently participating in
             another study, or are scheduled to participate in another study during this study
             period.

          8. Has any other skin disorders that, in the opinion of the investigator, will interfere
             with the study results or will increase undue risk for the child.
