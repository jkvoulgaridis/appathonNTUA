  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      COPD is a progressive disease characterized by increasing obstruction to airflow and the
      progressive development of respiratory symptoms including chronic cough, increased sputum
      production, dyspnea and wheezing. Once-daily triple therapy of an Inhaled Corticosteroid/
      Long-acting Muscarinic Receptor Antagonists/ Long Acting Beta-Agonist (ICS/LAMA/LABA) that is
      combination of FF/UMEC/VI in a single device is being developed with the aim of providing a
      new treatment option for the management of advanced COPD. The primary purpose of this study
      is to evaluate lung function and health related quality of life (HRQoL) after 84 days of
      treatment with a single inhaler triple therapy combination of FF/ UMEC/VI once daily via the
      ELLIPTA® dry powder inhaler (DPI) compared with tiotropium once daily via HANDIHALER®, in
      subjects with COPD. Subjects will be randomized 1:1 to receive FF/UMEC/VI or tiotropium in
      the morning for 84 days. Subjects will also receive albuterol/salbutamol as a rescue therapy
      throughout the study. Approximately 848 subjects with advanced COPD will be enrolled in the
      study. The total study duration will be approximately 17 weeks including, 4-week run-in
      period, 12-week treatment period and a 1-week follow-up period. ELLIPTA is a registered
      trademark of GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) group of companies. HANDIHALER and RESPIMAT are registered

             Gilbert's syndrome or asymptomatic gallstones or otherwise stable chronic liver
             disease per investigator assessment). Chronic stable hepatitis B and C (e.g., presence
             of hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg] or positive hepatitis C antibody test result at
             screening or within 3 months prior to first dose of study treatment) are acceptable if

             finding in relation to the Subject's medical history and exclude subjects who would be
             at undue risk by participating in the trial. An abnormal and clinically significant
             finding that would preclude a subject from entering the trial is defined as a 12-lead
             ECG tracing that is interpreted at, but not limited to, any of the following: atrial
             fibrillation (AF) with rapid ventricular rate &gt;120 beats per minute (BPM); sustained

        <title>Change From Baseline in Trough Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 Second (FEV1) on Day 85</title>
        <description>FEV1 is a measure of lung function and is defined as the maximal amount of air that can be forcefully exhaled in one second. Trough FEV1 on Day 85 was defined as the mean of the two planned spirometry FEV1 measurements. Change from Baseline in trough FEV1 on Day 85 was calculated by subtracting Baseline FEV1 value from the trough FEV1 value on Day 85. Baseline FEV1 was defined as the mean of the two assessments made at 30 and 5 minutes pre-dose on Day 1.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Trough Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 Second (FEV1) on Day 85</title>
          <description>FEV1 is a measure of lung function and is defined as the maximal amount of air that can be forcefully exhaled in one second. Trough FEV1 on Day 85 was defined as the mean of the two planned spirometry FEV1 measurements. Change from Baseline in trough FEV1 on Day 85 was calculated by subtracting Baseline FEV1 value from the trough FEV1 value on Day 85. Baseline FEV1 was defined as the mean of the two assessments made at 30 and 5 minutes pre-dose on Day 1.</description>
