      -Background: Cancer is one of the most common cause of death. Cancer pain is often cited as
      one of the most feared in cancer patients. Although, WHO guidelines have been provided to
      improve pain outcome, the results are still unsatisfied. In order to improve cancer pain
      management we consider to contribute a new guideline which includes interdisciplinary
      approach, early doing the pain interventions, breakthrough pain, education, high quality of
      pain assessment and contribute the effectiveness follow-up system

      -  Objectives:Primary outcome is study the effectiveness of new approach and closed follow
           up system by relief pain intensity 30% at 3 month up to 80% of all new cancer pain
           patients in OPD setting Secondary outcomes are quality of life (BPI,ESAS), side effect
           of treatments and the contributing factors that impact on the outcomes

        -  Study design:A prospective observational study

        -  Sample size : 150

        -  Data collection: General information: age, gender, body weight, height, religion,
           residence, care giver, occupation, income, education, medical problem Clinical pain
           information: primary diagnosis, staging, cancer site, current medications Clinical
           assessment: at three study time points: baseline (initial assessment) and the three
           subsequent follow-ups (FU1, FU2 and FU3)
