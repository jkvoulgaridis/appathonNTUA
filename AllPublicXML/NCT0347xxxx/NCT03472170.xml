  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the efficacy of enteral administration of bovine lactoferrin (bLf) in the
      reduction of probable late sepsis or microbiologically proven in preterm infants with birth
      weight ≤ 1500 gr and / or gestational age ≤ 32 weeks.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To date there are no published clinical data that jointly assess the impact of direct Lf
      supplementation on oxidative status, on biomarkers of systemic inflammation and on the
      microbiota of premature infants with or without sepsis. Clarification of these additional
      questions is essential for a better understanding of the benefits and implications of enteral
      administration of Lf in preterm infants. The enteral administration of lactoferrin reduces
      the incidence of late sepsis in preterm infants of very low birth weight (BMPN). Enteral
      supplementation with lactoferrin in NBWNS can have a beneficial effect on the systemic
      oxidative and inflammatory state, and may contribute to the creation of a healthy faecal
      microbiota.

    <description>The nutritional supplement used will be bovine lactoferrin, a product marketed according to the regulations of the European Union, and approved by the European Food Safety Agency (EFSA) in 2012, and by the American Agency for Food and Drug Administration ( FDA) in 2013. It will be acquired after purchase from Dicofarm® (Rome, Italy).
The Hospital Pharmacy Service will provide the established dose of lactoferrin, according to the administration schedule of 150 mg / kg / day (maximum 300 mg / day).
The treatments will be administered in liquid form, in the least amount possible. The administration of lactoferrin will be carried out enterally, orally or by nasogastric tube.
The intervention will be done in the first 72 hours of life, once a day, and for 4 weeks, extending to 6 weeks in the NB with EG ≤ 28 weeks and / or birth weight ≤ 1000 gr, or until discharge if this happens before.</description>
