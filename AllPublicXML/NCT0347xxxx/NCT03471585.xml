  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study was to examine the effects of THC on the retrieval of
      emotional and neutral memories in healthy young adults. Secondary experiments included the
      effects of THC on the encoding of object and scene stimuli and a novel working memory task.

      Here, the investigators aimed to investigate the effects of THC (15 mg) on the retrieval of
      negative, neutral, and positive memories. The study used a placebo-controlled,
      within-subjects, crossover design with 24 participants. In each experimental arm,
      participants attend a session to encode stimuli, a second session 48 hours later in which
      their memories are tested for the stimuli from the first session followed by the encoding of
      object-scene stimuli and a working memory test, and a third session 48 hours later in which
      memory for the object-scene stimuli is tested. In the second session, two hours prior to
      memory testing, THC or placebo is administered. On the first and second sessions subjects
      complete mood questionnaires.

    <description>Participants came in for the first session that involved encoding emotional pictures and lists of semantically related words (Deese-Roediger-McDermott or DRM task; a false memory task). Forty-eight hours later, participants received a placebo capsule (dextrose) and waited 2 hours Participants were monitored for the next 2 hours including physiological and subjective measures every 30 minutes. After 2 hours, participants' memory for the emotional stimuli and DRM stimuli was tested. Participants then encoded object stimuli overlaid onto scenes followed by a working memory test with simple color squares. After the memory tests and 3.5 hours post-capsule, if participants' physiological and subjective measures had returned to baseline, they were allowed to leave. Forty-eight hours later, memory for the object-scene stimuli was tested. Other than the capsule, this arm was identical to the THC arm.</description>
