  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this clinical trial is to investigate whether the therapeutic response of
      chemotherapy can be improved by focused ultrasound and microbubbles. Patients with liver
      metastases from breast cancer and colorectal cancer will be included. Computer Tomography
      (CT) will be performed as a baseline scan before treatment start. Two metastases in each
      patients liver will be preselected and randomized to either &quot;target lesion&quot; to be treated or
      &quot;control lesion&quot; to serve as internal control. The patients will receive conventional
      treatment with chemotherapy according to national guidelines. After intravenous chemotherapy
      infusion the patients will receive the experimental treatment. The target lesion will get
      focused ultrasound (FUS). Simultaneously repeated bolus-doses of microbubbles will be
      administered intravenously. The investigators will measure the difference in response between
      FUS- treated and -untreated lesions on the post-treatment CT scan.

    <intervention_model_description>Two liver metastases in every patient are preselected on baseline computer tomography. These will be randomized to either 1) target lesion to be treated or 2) control lesion. Difference in response (pre- and post-treatment measure) between treated lesions and control lesions will be the primary outcome of the trial.</intervention_model_description>
