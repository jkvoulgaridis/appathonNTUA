  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Randomized controlled trial with two parallel branches (experimental product and placebo),
      double blind and unicentric with which it is intended to evaluate the efficacy of the product
      under investigation against placebo on blood pressure of normotensive subjects or with
      hypertension grade I without Pharmacotherapy. The subjects that meet the selection criteria
      will make a total of five visits to the research laboratory and perform the tests that were
      pre-established in the protocol. Later, a statistical analysis will be carried out with the
      variables measured in the study to obtain results.
