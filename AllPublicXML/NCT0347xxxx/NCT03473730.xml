      Detailed Description:

      Bladder Cancer Cohort:

      Study Drug Administration:

      If you are eligible and agree to take part in this study, you will receive daratumumab by
      vein 1 time each week for 4 weeks before your cystectomy. During Week 1, your dose of
      daratumumab will be given over 8 hours. After that, each dose will be given over about 4
      hours.

      In this study, the following will be done to lower the chance of a daratumumab infusion
      related reaction:

      You will get drugs, including steroids, acetaminophen, and/or antihistamine before the
      infusion. If you are considered high risk, you may also get drugs, including inhaled
      steroids, after the infusion.

      The infusion may be slowed down or stopped if you have a reaction. You may stay overnight in
      the hospital after the infusion so the study staff can check your health.

      You may ask the study staff for more information about the types of medications you will
      receive to lower your chance of an infusion-related reaction, including how they are
      administered and their risks.

      Length of Study:

      You may receive up to 4 doses of daratumumab before your surgery. You will no longer be able
      to take the study drug if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if
      you are unable to follow study directions.

      Your participation on the study will be over after the follow-up visit (described below).

      Study Visits:

      During Weeks 1-4:

      You will have a physical exam. Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine and
      blood type testing. Daratumumab will interfere with blood type testing which is needed before
      blood transfusions can be given. For this reason, a test to find out your blood type will be
      performed before you receive daratumumab. You should carry the blood type card with you while
      you are on this study.

      During Weeks 6-8 (the week of your surgery):

      You will have a physical exam. Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests
      and part of this sample will also be used for blood type testing.

      You will have surgery to remove your bladder. You will sign a separate consent form
      explaining the procedure and its risks in more detail.

      End-of-Study Visit:

      During Weeks 12-14, blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

      Follow-Up Visit:

      During Week 18, blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests and you will be
      asked about any side effects you are having.

      Renal Cancer Cohort:

      Study Drug Administration:

      If you are eligible and agree to take part in this study, you will receive daratumumab by
      vein 1 time each week for 8 weeks before your nephrectomy, metastasectomy, or biopsy. During
      Week 1, your dose of daratumumab will be given over 8 hours. After that, each dose will be
      given over about 4 hours.

      In this study, the following will be done to lower the chance of a daratumumab infusion
      related reaction:

      You will get drugs, including steroids, acetaminophen, and/or antihistamine before the
      infusion. If you are considered high risk, you may also get drugs, including inhaled
      steroids, after the infusion.

      The infusion may be slowed down or stopped if you have a reaction. You may stay overnight in
      the hospital after the infusion so the study staff can check your health.

      You may ask the study staff for more information about the types of medications you will
      receive to lower your chance of an infusion-related reaction, including how they are
      administered and their risks.

      Length of Study:

      You may receive up to 8 doses of daratumumab prior to your surgery or biopsy. You may receive
      additional doses of daratumumab after the surgery/biopsy for up to one year after your first
      dose. You will no longer be able to take the study drug if the disease gets worse, if
      intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions.

      Your participation on the study will be over after the follow-up visit (described below).

      Study Visits:

      During Weeks 1-8:

      You will have a physical exam each week before you receive daratumumab. Blood (about 2
      tablespoons) will be drawn for routine and blood type testing. Daratumumab treatment will
      interfere with blood type testing which is needed before blood transfusions can be given. For
      this reason, a test to find out your blood type will be performed before you receive
      daratumumab. You should carry the blood type card with you while you are on this study.

      During Weeks 10-12 (the week of your surgery/tissue collection):

      You will have a physical exam. Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests,
      part of this sample will also be used for blood type testing.

      You will have surgery to remove your kidney, a kidney cancer lesion, or repeat biopsy. You
      will sign a separate consent form explaining the procedure and its risks in more detail.

      During Weeks 14-30:

      You will have a physical exam and return every 2 weeks to receive daratumumab. Blood (about 2
      tablespoons) will be drawn for routine and blood type testing.

      During Weeks 30-52:

      You will have a physical exam and return every month to receive daratumumab. Blood (about 2
      tablespoons) will be drawn for routine and blood type testing.

      End-of-Study Visit:

      During Week 52, blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

      Follow-Up Visit:

      During Week 65, blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests and you will be
      asked about any side effects you are having.

               -  Congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association class III-IV)

               -  Pericarditis/clinically significant pericardial effusion

               -  Myocarditis

               -  Endocarditis

          -  RENAL &amp; BLADDER: Other prior malignancy (exceptions: adequately treated basal cell or
             squamous cell skin cancer, superficial bladder cancer, or any other cancer in situ
             currently in complete remission) =&lt; 2 years prior to enrollment

          -  RENAL &amp; BLADDER: Any condition that in the opinion of the investigator, would preclude
             participation in this study

          -  RENAL &amp; BLADDER: Seropositive for hepatitis B (defined by a positive test for
             hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg]); subjects with resolved infection (ie, subjects
             who are HBsAg negative but positive for antibodies to hepatitis B core antigen
             [antiHBc] and/or antibodies to hepatitis B surface antigen [antiHBs]) must be screened
             using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) measurement of hepatitis B virus (HBV)
             deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) levels; those who are PCR positive will be excluded;
             EXCEPTION: Subjects with serologic findings suggestive of HBV vaccination (antiHBs
             positivity as the only serologic marker) AND a known history of prior HBV vaccination,
             do not need to be tested for HBV DNA by PCR; seropositive for hepatitis C (except in
             the setting of a sustained virologic response [SVR], defined as aviremia at least 12
             weeks after completion of antiviral therapy)
