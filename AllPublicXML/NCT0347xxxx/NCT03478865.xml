      Background:

      Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is an eye disease. It is the leading cause of vision
      loss in people over 55 in the U.S. Changes in the eye can make it difficult for the eye to
      adjust to low light. This is known as dark adaptation. Identifying and watching the early to
      middle stages of AMD and changes in dark adaptation might help researchers develop new
      treatments to stop the disease before it becomes severe. Taking vitamin A might help improve
      vision in people with AMD.

      Objectives:

      To see if taking 16,000 IU of vitamin A per day improves vision in people with AMD. Also to
      improve understanding of AMD and associated dark adaptation.

      Eligibility:

      Adults ages 50 and older with AMD and normal liver function

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with:

      Medical and eye disease history

      Eye exam: The pupil will be dilated with eye drops. Pictures will be taken of the retina and
      the inside of the eye.

      Including the screening visit, participants will have at least 5 visits. They will be about
      once a month over 6 months. Visits include:

      Questions about eye problems in certain light

      Eye exam

      Blood and urine tests

      Dark adaptation protocol: Participants will sit at a machine in a dark room. They will look
      into the machine and push a button when they see a light. This lasts 20-30 minutes.

      Participants will take a vitamin A supplement by mouth once a day for 2 months. They will
      record when they take the pills in a diary.

      Objective: The objective of this study is to investigate the potential efficacy of vitamin A
      palmitate in improving dark adaptation in participants with age-related macular degeneration
      (AMD) and abnormal dark adaptation.

      Study Population: Ten participants will be initially accrued, however, up to twenty
      participants with AMD who meet the eligibility criteria may be enrolled. In the event that a
      participant withdraws from the study prior to receiving two months of study supplementation
      for a reason unrelated to an adverse reaction, an additional participant will be accrued. A
      maximum of ten additional participants may be accrued in order to obtain ten participants for
      the primary outcome analysis.

      Design: This is a pilot, uncontrolled, prospective, single center study to investigate the
      potential efficacy of vitamin A palmitate in improving dark adaptation in participants with
      AMD and abnormal dark adaptation.

      Outcome Measures: The primary outcome is the measurement of dark adaptation parameters
      (thresholds and kinetics) by the following: dark adaptation times as measured by the AdaptDx
      comparing before and after vitamin A palmitate supplementation and dark adaptation parameters
      as measured by the Medmont comparing before and after vitamin A palmitate supplementation.
      The secondary outcomes are changes in low luminance visual acuity (LLVA) and changes in
      patient reported outcomes as measured by the low luminance questionnaire (LLQ).

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        To be eligible, the following inclusion criteria must be met, where applicable.

          -  Participant must be 50 years of age or older.

          -  Participant must understand and sign the protocol s informed consent document.

          -  Any participant of childbearing potential must be willing to undergo urine pregnancy
             tests throughout the study.

          -  Any participant of childbearing potential and any participant able to father children
             must have (or have a partner who has) had a hysterectomy or vasectomy, be completely
             abstinent from intercourse, or must agree to practice two acceptable methods of

             supplement discontinuation. Acceptable methods of contraception include:

               -  Hormonal contraception (i.e. birth control pills, injected hormones, dermal patch
                  or vaginal ring),

               -  Intrauterine device,

               -  Barrier methods (diaphragm, condom) with spermicide, or

               -  Surgical sterilization (tubal ligation).

          -  Participants must agree to notify the study investigator or coordinator if any of
             their doctors initiate a new prescription medication during the course of this study.

          -  Participant must agree to not take greater than or equal to 8000 IU vitamin A
             palmitate outside the study supplementation.

          -  For supplementation eligibility, participant must have normal liver function as
             demonstrated by the Chemistry 20 panel, or have mild abnormalities not above grade 1
             as defined by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v4.0 (CTCAE).

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        A participant is not eligible if any of the following exclusion criteria are present:

          -  Participant is in another investigational study and actively receiving study therapy.

          -  Participant is unable to comply with study procedures or follow-up visits.

             8,000 IU.

          -  Participant has a history of vitamin A deficiency.

          -  Participant has a condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would preclude
             participation in the study (e.g., unstable medical status including blood pressure and
             glycemic control).

          -  Participant has a history of hepatitis or liver failure.

          -  Participant has chronic gastrointestinal disease.

          -  Participant will be excluded if the participant has serologic evidence of an active
             hepatitis infection.

        STUDY EYE ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:

        The participant must have at least one eye meeting all inclusion criteria and none of the
        exclusion criteria listed below.

        STUDY EYE INCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  The eye must have a best-corrected ETDRS visual acuity score better than or equal to
             20/80 (i.e., equal to or better than 54 letters).

          -  Participant must have at least one large druse.

          -  Abnormal dark adaptation, which is defined as having an Adapt Dx test with a RIT of 16
             minutes or more at the screening visit. This is at least one standard deviation
             greater than the average normal RIT and includes room to account for variability in
             testing. If at any point during current testing or under a previous NEI protocol, a
             participant has exceeded the 40 minute test ceiling, they will have satisfied the
             inclusion criteria.

        STUDY EYE EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  Presence of advanced macular degeneration with central geographic atrophy or choroidal
             neovascularization.

          -  Presence of definite reticular pseudodrusen.

          -  An ocular condition is present (other than retinal vein occlusion) that, in the
             opinion of the investigator, might alter visual acuity during the course of the study
             (e.g., vein occlusion, uveitis or other ocular inflammatory disease, neovascular
             glaucoma, Irvine-Gass Syndrome, etc.).

          -  Substantial cataract that, in the opinion of the investigator, is likely to be
             decreasing visual acuity by three lines or more (i.e., cataract would be reducing
             acuity to 20/40 or worse if eye was otherwise normal).

          -  History of major ocular surgery (e.g. cataract extraction, scleral buckle, any
             intraocular surgery, etc.) within three months prior to study entry.

          -  History of YAG (Yttrium-Aluminum Garnet) capsulotomy performed within two months prior
             to study entry.
