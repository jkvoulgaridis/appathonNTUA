    <description>The change in calculated mass doubling time using Quantitative Transmission Ultrasound (QT Ultrasound) from a minimum of two study timepoints will be measured and compared to mass histology.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>(2) QT Ultrasound scans prior to breast biopsy</arm_group_label>
    <description>Subjects will undergo a baseline QT scan, and a follow-up QT scan performed between 90 days and 180 days from their baseline QT Scan accompanied by a HHUS and ultrasound-guided breast biopsy following the first follow-up QT scan. BI-RADS will be confirmed by the radiologist at the time of the first HHUS. Subjects will receive a telephone follow-up contact approximately 2-3 business days after their ultrasound-guided breast biopsy to assess if any adverse events have occurred. Subjects will be asked to come back for an additional follow-up QT Scan 12 months from the time of their baseline QT Scan.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>(0-1) QT Ultrasound scans prior to breast biopsy</arm_group_label>
    <description>Subjects that have not had (2) two QT Scans before their breast biopsy and who haven't yet had a breast biopsy will undergo an optional baseline QT scan accompanied by a HHUS and ultrasound-guided breast biopsy. BI-RADS will be confirmed by the radiologist. Subjects will receive a telephone follow-up contact approximately 2-3 business days after their ultrasound-guided breast biopsy to assess if any adverse events have occurred. Subjects will be asked to come back for a follow-up QT Scan between 90 and 180 days from the time of their study biopsy.
Subjects that have had a breast biopsy on their identified breast mass(es) prior to study enrollment and have not already had two (2) QT Scans will undergo an optional baseline QT scan if between 0 and 30 days from their breast biopsy.
Subjects will be asked to come back for a follow-up QT Scan 12 months from the time of their study biopsy.</description>

          3. Willing to receive QT Ultrasound Breast Scans

          4. Willing to undergo an ultrasound-guided needle breast biopsy if performed after
             enrollment in the study

          5. Willing and able to provide Informed Consent prior to any research-related
             procedure(s)

          6. Have an identified solid non-suspicious breast mass

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Pregnancy

          2. Currently breastfeeding

          3. Magnetic material in the chest which in the judgement of the Principal Investigator
             would interfere or be impacted by the magnets utilized with the study device.

          4. Not willing to provide information for primary care physician

          5. History of breast cancer

          6. History of treated or untreated cancer of a non-breast origin which in the judgment of
             the Principal Investigator would be a concern for metastatic disease to the breast

          7. Physical inability to tolerate the QT scan, i.e. inability to lie prone and still for
             up to 30 minutes at a time

          8. Open wounds, sores or skin rash present on the breast(s) or nipple discharge from the
             scanned breast(s)

          9. Breasts too large for scanner, i.e. bra size larger than DDD or inability to
             successfully &quot;fit&quot; breast after the subject is placed on scanner

         10. Body weight greater than 400 lbs. (180 kg)

         11. Concurrent disease or condition which in the judgment of the Principal Investigator
             disqualifies the subject from participating in the study
