  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to assess safety, tolerance, pharmacokinetic, and
      pharmacodynamics of single doses of ACE-2494 in healthy postmenopausal women.

    <textblock>
      Subjects will be evaluated for study inclusion/exclusion criteria during the screening period
      (within 4 weeks prior to Day -1) and eligible subjects who have signed the informed consent
      form (ICF) will be enrolled and treated with study drug (ACE-2494 or placebo) on Day 1.
      Subjects will be randomized (3:1, ACE-2494: placebo) to receive one dose of either ACE-2494
      or placebo, respectively, on Day 1.

      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of single
      ascending doses of ACE-2494 in healthy postmenopausal women. The secondary objectives are to
      characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile and pharmacodynamic (PD) effects, including
      serum biomarkers, fat, lean, and bone mass (DXA), muscle volume and intramuscular fat
      fraction (MRI).
