      Evaluation of Safety, Tolerability, and Efficacy of XT-150, a plasmid DNA with a variant of
      human IL-10 transgene. XT-150 will be a single injection into the knee synovial capsule for
      the Treatment of Osteoarthritic Pain.

      Phase 1 dose escalation study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of a plasmid
      DNA encoding a variant of human IL-10. This 6-month study will follow subjects with severe
      osteoarthritis of the knee. Safety labs, physical exams, and blood levels of the IL-10
      variant will be assessed for tolerability and any adverse events associated with the
      treatment.

          1. Male or female, between 18 and 90 years of age, inclusive

          2. Sufficiently severe OA of the knee to meet accepted criteria for knee arthroplasty

          3. Free of intra-articular infection, or infection at the injection site.

          4. Symptomatic disease because of osteoarthritis, defined as one or more of the following
             Visual Analog Scale of Pain Intensity (VASPI) scores:

               1. a worst pain of at least 70 at any time during the preceding week (based on scale
                  of 0 to 100, with 100 representing &quot;pain as bad as you can imagine&quot;).

               2. a worst stiffness of at least 70 at any time during the preceding week (based on
                  a scale of 0 to 100, with 100 representing &quot;stiffness as bad as you can
                  imagine&quot;).

          5. Stable analgesic regimen during the 4 weeks prior to enrollment.

          6. Inadequate pain relief (minimum ≥5 mean on the Brief Pain Inventory-Severity Scale)
             lasting ≥3 months.

          7. In the judgment of the Investigator, acceptable general medical condition

          8. Life expectancy &gt;6 months

          9. Female subjects of child-bearing potential, and those &lt;1 year post-menopausal, must be
             practicing effective methods of birth control such as hormonal methods (e.g., combined
             oral, implantable, injectable, or transdermal contraceptives), double barrier methods
             (e.g., condoms, sponge, diaphragm) or total abstinence from heterosexual intercourse
             for a minimum of 1 month before study drug administration and agree to continue
             prevention methods for 3 months after participation in the study is completed.

         10. Male subjects who are heterosexually active and not surgically sterile must agree to
             use effective contraception, including abstinence, for the duration of the study and
             for 3 months after the study is completed.

         11. Have suitable knee joint anatomy for intra-articular injection

             knee injection procedure (e.g., poorly controlled diabetes, cardiac inadequacy such as
             NYHA class &gt; II, G4 glomerular filtration rate [eGFR &lt; 30 mL/min by Cockcroft-Gault])

          4. Current treatment with immunosuppressives (steroid therapy equivalent to &gt;10mg/day
             prednisone); or other strong immunosuppressant

          5. History of systemic immunosuppressive therapy; steroids (equivalent to &gt;10mg/day
