  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of airways and lungs that results in
      hyper-reactivity and clinically relevant episodes of wheezing. This study has been designed
      to assess the correct use and ease of use of the ELLIPTAÂ® DPI in pediatric subjects with
      asthma. ELLIPTA DPI is easy to use, requires few steps, is consistent in dosing and
      eliminates the hand-breath co-ordination required for metered dose inhalers (MDIs). Subjects
      will be stratified by age into two strata: Stratum 1: subjects in the age group of 5 to 7
      years and Stratum 2: Subjects in the age group of 8 to 11 years. All subjects will be trained
      by Health care professionals (HCP) for the correct use of ELLIPTA DPI. Subjects will be given
      three chances to attempt correct use of ELLIPTA DPI; subsequently, if the subject is not
      successful, the parent/guardian will be able to help instruct the subject on the correct use
      of the ELLIPTA DPI, for two more attempts. The subjects who will be enrolled in the study
      will take placebo ELLIPTA DPI once daily. After 28 days subjects will be randomized in 1:1 to
      receive a questionnaire (Version A and B). After completion of the questionnaire on ELLIPTA
      DPI ease of use, subject's ability to use ELLIPTA DPI correctly will be re-assessed.
      Approximately 219 subjects will be screened to participate in the study. The study will be
      conducted for 28 days. ELLIPTA is a registered trademark of GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) group of
      companies.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants From Each Stratum Who Demonstrated Correct Use of the ELLIPTA DPI at Visit 2, Attempt 1 (Day 28)</measure>
    <time_frame>At Day 28</time_frame>
    <description>Participants were trained in the correct use of ELLIPTA DPI by a healthcare professional (HCP) on Day 1 (Visit 1) following which eligible participants were required to take one inhalation of placebo from the ELLIPTA DPI once daily for 28 days. At Day 28 (Visit 2), participants were administered a questionnaire on ease of use of ELLIPTA DPI. Participants and their parents/guardian were required to complete the questionnaire, following which participants were assessed for their ability to demonstrate correct use of ELLIPTA DPI (1 attempt with no training or instruction and then 1 attempt after instruction from parent/guardian). Percentage of participants who demonstrated correct use of ELLIPTA was calculated as &quot;number of participants who demonstrated correct use at Visit 2&quot; divided by &quot;number of participants whose use of the ELLIPTA DPI was evaluated at Visit 2&quot; multiplied by 100. The 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated using the exact binomial distribution.</description>

    <description>Participants were trained in the correct use of ELLIPTA DPI at Visit 1 by the HCP and eligible participants were required to take one inhalation of placebo from the ELLIPTA DPI once daily for 28 days. At Day 28 (Visit 2), participants were administered a questionnaire on the ease of use of ELLIPTA DPI. For participants in Stratum 1, questionnaire was provided to the interviewer and responses were recorded. For Stratum 2, the questionnaire was self-administered (or interviewer administered, if participant was unable to self-administer). Percentage of participants who rated the ELLIPTA DPI as easy to use was calculated as &quot;number of participants who rate the ELLIPTA as easy&quot; divided by &quot;number of participants who demonstrated correct use at Visit 2 (Attempt #1)&quot; multiplied by 100. The 95% CI for the percentages are calculated using the exact binomial distribution.</description>

    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>Participants were trained by HCP in correct use of ELLIPTA DPI at Visit 1 following which participants were assessed on their ability to use the ELLIPTA DPI without guidance from the HCP or parent/guardian. The participants were given a maximum of five attempts. Participants who were unable to use the ELLIPTA DPI correctly were trained by the HCP for the first three attempts. For the fourth and fifth attempts, the participants' parent/guardian assisted in the training of the ELLIPTA DPI. Percentage number of participants who demonstrated correct use of the ELLIPTA DPI along with 95% CI at Visit 1 (attempts 1 to 5) has been presented. The 95% CI for the percentages are calculated using the exact binomial distribution.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants From Each Stratum Who Demonstrated Correct Use of the ELLIPTA DPI at Visit 2, Attempt 1 (Day 28)</title>
        <description>Participants were trained in the correct use of ELLIPTA DPI by a healthcare professional (HCP) on Day 1 (Visit 1) following which eligible participants were required to take one inhalation of placebo from the ELLIPTA DPI once daily for 28 days. At Day 28 (Visit 2), participants were administered a questionnaire on ease of use of ELLIPTA DPI. Participants and their parents/guardian were required to complete the questionnaire, following which participants were assessed for their ability to demonstrate correct use of ELLIPTA DPI (1 attempt with no training or instruction and then 1 attempt after instruction from parent/guardian). Percentage of participants who demonstrated correct use of ELLIPTA was calculated as &quot;number of participants who demonstrated correct use at Visit 2&quot; divided by &quot;number of participants whose use of the ELLIPTA DPI was evaluated at Visit 2&quot; multiplied by 100. The 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated using the exact binomial distribution.</description>

        <description>Participants were trained in the correct use of ELLIPTA DPI at Visit 1 by the HCP and eligible participants were required to take one inhalation of placebo from the ELLIPTA DPI once daily for 28 days. At Day 28 (Visit 2), participants were administered a questionnaire on the ease of use of ELLIPTA DPI. For participants in Stratum 1, questionnaire was provided to the interviewer and responses were recorded. For Stratum 2, the questionnaire was self-administered (or interviewer administered, if participant was unable to self-administer). Percentage of participants who rated the ELLIPTA DPI as easy to use was calculated as &quot;number of participants who rate the ELLIPTA as easy&quot; divided by &quot;number of participants who demonstrated correct use at Visit 2 (Attempt #1)&quot; multiplied by 100.

          <title>Percentage of Participants Who Rated the ELLIPTA DPI as Easy to Use Among Those Who Could Demonstrate Correct Use at Visit 2, Attempt 1 (Day 28)</title>
          <description>Participants were trained in the correct use of ELLIPTA DPI at Visit 1 by the HCP and eligible participants were required to take one inhalation of placebo from the ELLIPTA DPI once daily for 28 days. At Day 28 (Visit 2), participants were administered a questionnaire on the ease of use of ELLIPTA DPI. For participants in Stratum 1, questionnaire was provided to the interviewer and responses were recorded. For Stratum 2, the questionnaire was self-administered (or interviewer administered, if participant was unable to self-administer). Percentage of participants who rated the ELLIPTA DPI as easy to use was calculated as &quot;number of participants who rate the ELLIPTA as easy&quot; divided by &quot;number of participants who demonstrated correct use at Visit 2 (Attempt #1)&quot; multiplied by 100. The 95% CI for the percentages are calculated using the exact binomial distribution.</description>
