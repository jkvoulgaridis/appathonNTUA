      Functional dyspepsia is one of the most common gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) encountered
      in clinical practice. Functional dyspepsia is a clinical syndrome characterized by chronic
      and recurrent gastroduodenal symptoms in the absence of any organic or metabolic disease that
      is likely to explain the symptoms.Functional dyspepsia has a high incidence in the
      population.Clinical diagnosis is notoriously unreliable in diagnosing the underlying cause of
      dyspepsia,but a number of alarm features have been suggested as indicating patients at higher
      risk for serious disease.However, previous studies noted that the sensitivity of alarm
      features for predicting cases with upper GI malignancies is unsatisfactory. The predictive
      value of alarm symptoms still require more researches. Rome IV was introduced in 2016. Rome
      IV introduced more precisely define the minimal thresholds for frequency and severity of each
      individual symptom, primarily for scientific purposes,but data still need to be collected to
      define thresholds based on the frequency and/or severity of symptoms that impair quality of
      life.A cross-sectional study was conducted to assess the predictive value of alarm symptoms
      in patients with dyspepsia based on Roman IV.All patients who were satisfied with the
      inclusion criteria and exclusion criteria in the department of the second affiliated hospital
      of Xi'an jiaotong university, Xijing Hospital, Tangdu Hospital, Xi'an No.3 Hospital, and
      received investigation.Inclusion criteria included:Symptoms of upper digestive tract for more
      than 6 months or 3 monthes（postprandial fullness, early satiation,epigastric pain, and
      epigastric burning）;Older than 18;From March 2018 to January 2011，received gastroscope and
      upper abdominal B ultrasound examination;agreeing the informed consent.Data collection:Basic
      information：name, age, height, weight, gender, marriage;Dyspepsia: symptoms of indigestion,
      duration of indigestion, and weekly incidence of indigestion;Abnormal symptoms: weight loss,
      anemia, anorexia, vomiting, blackstool, dysphagia;Lifestyle habits: spicy food, smoking,
      drinking, sleep quality, daily exercise time;Family history, helicobacter pylori infection,
      abdominal color ultrasound results,Cost.Through endoscopy results to determine whether
      dyspepsia is organic or functional, benign or malignant, through contacts with the basic
      data, to determine the alarm symptoms.Further more, this study was proved by the ethical
      committee of second hospital of Xi'an jiaotong university.
