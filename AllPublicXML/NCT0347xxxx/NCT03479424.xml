    <textblock>
      The HOME PREDICT HF study looks at new ways to predict hospitalizations for heart failure. We
      will use a set of devices at home and surveys to collect information about patient's health.
      This study uses the Eureka app, a new study app developed by the University of California,
      San Francisco. The study is designed to happen remotely, using this application on a
      patient's smartphone, so that is as convenient as possible to participate.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      HOME PREDICT HF is single center, prospective, unblinded, randomly assigned training and
      validation observational cohorts to develop machine learning algorithms from an in-home suite
      of sensors in order to predict 3-month heart failure hospitalization and/or emergency
      department visits. Study population includes adults presenting with a diagnosis of reduced
      ejection fraction (LVEF &lt;= 40%), NYHA class II-IV) who have had a hospitalization for HF in
      the previous 6 months. The study objectives include (1) To collect observational data from
      multiple sensors, patient-reported outcomes, and medical record data to develop (train)
      machine-learning algorithms (2) To validate trained algorithms in a separate validation
      cohort (3) To collect data to inform the design of a future intervention study. The primary
      outcome is Ninety-day heart failure hospitalization/emergency department visit for heart
      failure.
