          <description>Post-menstruation assessment of tampon wear comfort. This assessment uses a 5-point scale which was summarized using the mean as the summary statistic. This questionnaire measured overall satisfaction using a +2 to -2 scale that was converted to a 0 to 100 scale: 100 = excellent rating and 0 = poor rating</description>
          <population>ITT population was the primary population of analysis. The ITT population was defined as those participants who were randomized, received at least one test product and had at least one post-product use measurement.</population>
