  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if the use of ustekinumab, followed by abatacept,
      will prevent relapse in people with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Psoriasis is a chronic immune disease of the skin and joints that affects about 2% of the
      population. The most common form of psoriasis is plaque psoriasis, also called psoriasis
      vulgaris. A variety of drugs, including biologics, are available for treatment of moderate to
      severe psoriasis. When biologic agents are stopped, psoriasis can return (relapse) and often
      requires the biologic to be restarted and continued. No treatment program has been identified
      to prevent relapse of psoriasis.

      The study design has a lead-in period of weight-based ustekinumab treatment, with all
      participants receiving either 45 mg ustekinumab (&lt;= 100 kg) or 90 mg ustekinumab (&gt; 100 kg)
      administered subcutaneously at weeks 0 and 4. At week 12, participants will be assessed for a
      Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) 75 response to ustekinumab. Participants who do not
      achieve a PASI 75 score will be discontinued from the investigation and permitted to seek
      standard therapy.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Who Experienced Psoriasis Relapse (Treating Drop-Outs as Relapse)</measure>
    <time_frame>Post-randomization (Week 12 to 88)</time_frame>
    <description>The percentage of participants who experienced psoriasis relapse in the interval from Week 12 to 88. Psoriasis relapse is defined as loss of ≥ 50% of the initial Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) improvement measured at Week 12. This occurs if the participant obtains a PASI score at any evaluation during the specified time interval that is ≥ Week 12 PASI + [(Baseline PASI -Week 12 PASI)/2]). Participants who terminated early from the study (drop-outs) were considered to have experienced relapse at time of drop-out. PASI is an assessment for psoriasis severity based on 4 body areas: Head and Neck, Upper Extremities, Trunk, and Lower Extremities. Psoriasis severity within each body area is assessed for Redness (score 0-4), Thickness (score 0-4) and Scaling (score 0-4). Scores for each body area are summed and weighted by the affected Body Surface Area (score 0-6) to produce the total score. The score ranges from 0 (no psoriasis present) to 72 (very severe psoriasis).</description>

    <description>The percentage of participants who experienced psoriasis relapse in the interval from Week 12 to 88. Psoriasis relapse is defined as loss of ≥ 50% of the initial Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) improvement measured at Week 12 (Baseline PASI -Week 12 PASI). Participants who terminated early from the study due to reasons other than psoriasis relapse or worsening psoriasis (drop-outs) were considered to have not experienced relapse at time of drop-out. PASI is an assessment for psoriasis severity based on 4 body areas: Head and Neck, Upper Extremities, Trunk, and Lower Extremities. Psoriasis severity within each body area is assessed for Redness (score 0-4), Thickness (score 0-4) and Scaling (score 0-4).

    <time_frame>Week 40, Week 88</time_frame>
    <description>Change in the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) score from Week 12 to the specified post-randomization time point. DLQI is a 10-question, participant-reported questionnaire that assesses quality of life with respect to skin conditions in the areas of symptoms and feelings, daily activities, leisure, work and school, personal relationships and treatment. Each question measures the level of effect that the skin condition has on quality of life, and responses range from 'Not at all' (score = 0) to 'Very much' (score = 3). The overall score is the sum of the scores for all 10 questions and ranges from 0-30, with higher scores indicating worse quality of life.</description>

          <description>Baseline Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI) score was the score assessed at Week 0. PASI is an assessment for psoriasis severity based on 4 body areas: Head and Neck, Upper Extremities, Trunk, and Lower Extremities. Psoriasis severity within each body area is assessed for Redness (score 0-4), Thickness (score 0-4) and Scaling (score 0-4). Scores for each body area are summed and weighted by the affected Body Surface Area (score 0-6) to produce the total score. The score ranges from 0 (no psoriasis present) to 72 (very severe psoriasis).</description>

          <description>Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) is a 10-question, participant-reported questionnaire assessing quality of life with respect to skin conditions in the areas of Symptoms and Feelings; Daily Activities; Leisure; Work and School; Personal Relationships; and Treatment. Each question measures the effect the skin condition has on a participant’s quality of life. Responses range from “Not at all” (score = 0) to “Very much” (score = 3). The overall score is the sum for all 10 questions and ranges from 0-30, with higher scores indicating a poor quality of life.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Who Experienced Psoriasis Relapse (Treating Drop-Outs as Relapse)</title>
        <description>The percentage of participants who experienced psoriasis relapse in the interval from Week 12 to 88. Psoriasis relapse is defined as loss of ≥ 50% of the initial Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) improvement measured at Week 12. This occurs if the participant obtains a PASI score at any evaluation during the specified time interval that is ≥ Week 12 PASI + [(Baseline PASI -Week 12 PASI)/2]). Participants who terminated early from the study (drop-outs) were considered to have experienced relapse at time of drop-out. PASI is an assessment for psoriasis severity based on 4 body areas: Head and Neck, Upper Extremities, Trunk, and Lower Extremities. Psoriasis severity within each body area is assessed for Redness (score 0-4), Thickness (score 0-4) and Scaling (score 0-4). Scores for each body area are summed and weighted by the affected Body Surface Area (score 0-6) to produce the total score. The score ranges from 0 (no psoriasis present) to 72 (very severe psoriasis).</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Who Experienced Psoriasis Relapse (Treating Drop-Outs as No Relapse)</title>
        <description>The percentage of participants who experienced psoriasis relapse in the interval from Week 12 to 88. Psoriasis relapse is defined as loss of ≥ 50% of the initial Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) improvement measured at Week 12 (Baseline PASI -Week 12 PASI). Participants who terminated early from the study due to reasons other than psoriasis relapse or worsening psoriasis (drop-outs) were considered to have not experienced relapse at time of drop-out. PASI is an assessment for psoriasis severity based on 4 body areas: Head and Neck, Upper Extremities, Trunk, and Lower Extremities. Psoriasis severity within each body area is assessed for Redness (score 0-4), Thickness (score 0-4) and Scaling (score 0-4). Scores for each body area are summed and weighted by the affected Body Surface Area (score 0-6) to produce the total score. The score ranges from 0 (no psoriasis present) to 72 (very severe psoriasis).</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Who Experienced Psoriasis Relapse (Treating Drop-Outs as Missing Relapse Status)</title>
        <description>The percentage of participants who experienced psoriasis relapse in the interval from Week 12 to 88. Psoriasis relapse is defined as loss of ≥ 50% of the initial Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) improvement measured at Week 12 (Baseline PASI -Week 12 PASI). Participants who terminated early due to reasons other than psoriasis relapse or worsening psoriasis were considered to have a missing relapse status at time of drop-out and were excluded from the analyses. PASI is an assessment for psoriasis severity based on 4 body areas: Head and Neck, Upper Extremities, Trunk, and Lower Extremities. Psoriasis severity within each body area is assessed for Redness (score 0-4), Thickness (score 0-4) and Scaling (score 0-4). Scores for each body area are summed and weighted by the affected Body Surface Area (score 0-6) to produce the total score. The score ranges from 0 (no psoriasis present) to 72 (very severe psoriasis).</description>

        <description>Time in weeks from Week 12 to psoriasis relapse. Psoriasis relapse is defined as loss of ≥ 50% of the initial Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) improvement measured at Week 12. This occurs if the participant obtains a PASI score at any evaluation during the specified time interval that is ≥ Week 12 PASI + [(Baseline PASI -Week 12 PASI)/2]). Participants who terminated early from the study (drop-outs) were considered to have experienced relapse at time of drop-out. PASI is an assessment for psoriasis severity based on 4 body areas: Head and Neck, Upper Extremities, Trunk, and Lower Extremities. Psoriasis severity within each body area is assessed for Redness (score 0-4), Thickness (score 0-4) and Scaling (score 0-4). Scores for each body area are summed and weighted by the affected Body Surface Area (score 0-6) to produce the total score. The score ranges from 0 (no psoriasis present) to 72 (very severe psoriasis).</description>

Psoriasis severity within each body area is assessed for Redness (score 0-4), Thickness (score 0-4) and Scaling (score 0-4). Scores for each body area are summed and weighted by the affected Body Surface Area (score 0-6) to produce the total score. The score ranges from 0 (no psoriasis present) to 72 (very severe psoriasis).</description>

        <description>Time in weeks from Week 12 to psoriasis relapse. Psoriasis relapse is defined as loss of ≥ 50% of the initial Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) improvement measured at Week 12. This occurs if the participant obtains a PASI score at any evaluation during the specified time interval that is ≥ Week 12 PASI + [(Baseline PASI -Week 12 PASI)/2]). Participants who terminated early from the study due to reasons other than psoriasis relapse or worsening psoriasis (drop-outs) were censored at the time of drop-out. PASI is an assessment for psoriasis severity based on 4 body areas: Head and Neck, Upper Extremities, Trunk, and Lower Extremities. Psoriasis severity within each body area is assessed for Redness (score 0-4), Thickness (score 0-4) and Scaling (score 0-4).

DLQI is a 10-question, participant-reported questionnaire that assesses quality of life with respect to skin conditions in the areas of symptoms and feelings, daily activities, leisure, work and school, personal relationships and treatment. Each question measures the level of effect that the skin condition has on quality of life, and responses range from 'Not at all' (score = 0) to 'Very much' (score = 3). The overall score is the sum of the scores for all 10 questions and ranges from 0-30, with higher scores indicating worse quality of life.</description>

        <description>Number of participants who experienced adverse events (AEs) during the post-randomization phase (Week 12 to 100), classified by severity and type. AEs were classified by grade according to the National Cancer Institute's (NCI's) Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.03, and all Grade 2 or greater AEs were collected in the database. In addition, new onset or worsening psoriatic arthritis was separately collected and graded from 1 to 3 along a study-specific functional scale. AEs were also classified based on relatedness to study drug, whether they led to study drug discontinuation, and whether they were AEs of special interest as specified in the protocol. AEs that started prior to randomization but became serious after randomization were included in the counts for the post-randomization time period.</description>
