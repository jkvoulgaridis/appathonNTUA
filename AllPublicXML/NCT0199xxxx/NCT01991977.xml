  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well fluorine F 18 fluorodopa (18F-DOPA)-positron emission
      tomography (PET) works in finding tumors in patients with newly diagnosed gliomas undergoing
      radiation therapy. Comparing results of diagnostic procedures done before and during
      radiation therapy may help doctors predict a patient's response to treatment and help plan
      the best treatment.

      Clinic Rochester patients, including those treated on North Central Cancer Treatment Group
      (NCCTG) clinical trials.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Compare progression free survival at 12 months for grade III patients after radiation
      therapy targeting volumes designed with both 18F-DOPA PET and conventional MR image

      Clinic Rochester patients, including those on NCCTG clinical trials.

      III. Evaluate quality of life after radiotherapy treatment targeting dose escalated volumes
      defined to include high 18F-DOPA PET uptake.

      IV. Determine acute and late effect toxicity after radiotherapy treatment targeting dose
      escalated volumes defined to include high 18F-DOPA PET uptake.

      V. Compare confirmed-progression free survival at 12 months for grade IV MGMT methylated
      patients after radiation therapy targeting volumes designed with both 18F-DOPA PET and

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Compare radiation therapy (RT) treatment volumes defined by MR only with RT treatment
      volumes defined with both PET and MR information for grade IV glioma patients.

      II. Compare timing of accurate identification of progression defined by 18F-DOPA PET,
      perfusion magnetic resonance imaging (pMRI) and conventional MRI for grade IV glioma
      patients.

      III. Compare patterns of failure after radiation therapy targeting volumes defined with

      PET uptake for radiotherapy target volume delineation.

      VI. Compare timing of accurate identification of progression defined by 18F-DOPA PET, pMRI
      and conventional MRI for grade III glioma patients.

      VII. Compare predictive capabilities of 18F-DOPA PET, pMRI and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)
      for localization of recurrences for patients treated with 18F-DOPA PET-guided RT dose
      escalation.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo 18F DOPA-PET, pMRI, and DTI within 14 days before radiation therapy, 3-6
      weeks after radiation therapy, and during follow-up. Patients also undergo
      intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) over 30 fractions and receive temozolomide.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically for up to 5 years.

    <description>The proportion of Grade IV MGMT un-methylated patients that experience confirmed-progression-free survival at 6 months (CPFS6). Progression is defined by any of the following:
≥25% increase in the sum of products of perpendicular diameters of enhancing lesions compared to the smallest tumor measurement obtained either at baseline or best response, on stable or increasing doses of corticosteroids
Significant increase in T2/FLAIR non-enhancing lesion on stable or increasing doses of corticosteroids compared to baseline scan or best response following initiation of therapy, not due to co-morbid events
Any new lesion
Clear clinical deterioration not attributable to other causes apart from the tumor or changes in corticosteroid dose.

    <description>The progression identification timing will be compared by calculating the percentage of time each modality was earlier than conventional magnetic resonance imaging. With a sample size of 72, if the observed percentage earlier than conventional magnetic resonance imaging is 30% for either modality, a two-sided 95% confidence interval for a single proportion using the large sample normal approximation will be +/- 10.6%. Progression identification timing will also be compared using Kaplan-Meier methods and paired t-tests to determine if differences exist between the modalities.</description>

Pathological diagnosis is based on appearance of cells (nuclear atypia) &amp; growth rate (mitotic activity).
Glioblastoma (Grade-IV glioma) is the highest grade glioma tumor &amp; is the most malignant form of astrocytoma. The histologic features include: presence of necrosis (dead cells), increase of abnormal growth of blood vessels around the tumor, tumors are always rapidly growing.</description>

        <description>The progression identification timing will be compared by calculating the percentage of time each modality was earlier than conventional magnetic resonance imaging. With a sample size of 72, if the observed percentage earlier than conventional magnetic resonance imaging is 30% for either modality, a two-sided 95% confidence interval for a single proportion using the large sample normal approximation will be +/- 10.6%. Progression identification timing will also be compared using Kaplan-Meier methods and paired t-tests to determine if differences exist between the modalities.</description>

        <title>Timing of Accurate Identification of Progression Defined by 18F- DOPA Positron Emission Tomography, Perfusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Conventional Magnetic Resonance Imaging for Grade III Glioma Patients</title>
        <description>Progression identification timing will be compared using Kaplan-Meier methods and paired t-tests to determine if differences exist between the modalities. An exploratory analysis of diffusion tensor imaging for detecting invasive non-enhancing tumor recurrence will also be performed.</description>
