    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine, in a randomized controlled trial, the benefits and
      costs of the American Heart Association's (AHA) advisory for depression screen and treatment
      of post-acute coronary syndrome patients.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and comorbid depression have a 2-fold higher
      risk for recurrent ACS and mortality, worse quality of life, and higher costs of care than
      nondepressed ACS patients. The strength of these observational findings prompted the American
      Heart Association (AHA) to advise that routine depression screening for ACS patients and
      referral for depression diagnosis and treatment as indicated occur. Unfortunately, there are
      no randomized controlled trials (RCT) to inform this potentially expensive screening
      recommendation. Additionally, screening guidelines/advisories in the absence of RCT evidence
      have recently been extensively criticized (and withdrawn). This poses a serious dilemma for
      clinicians, health care systems, and for health care policy leaders. A RCT is urgently needed
      to provide evidence for these different constituents about the costs and benefits of the AHA
      depression screen and treat algorithm.

      Two critical gaps in knowledge must be filled to determine if public health would be improved
      by the AHA strategy for depression screening in post-ACS patients: 1) Does this strategy
      improve quality-adjusted life years for patients with a recent ACS 2) Is the cost of
      providing depression screening and any type of depression treatment within the acceptable and
      typical amounts reimbursed for health care services? Our specific aim is to determine the
      quality-adjusted life year benefits and health care costs of following the AHA's advisory for
      depression screening and then referral for further diagnosis and treatment in post-ACS
      patients, if depression is found. To accomplish this aim, we will randomize patients from
      four different, geographically diverse health care systems to three different groups: 1) to
      the AHA depression screen and treat if depression is found algorithm (screen and treat
      intervention group) or: 2) to be screened and a primary care provider notified (screen and
      notify intervention group) or: 3) to receive no depression screening (control group).
      Health-related quality of life, depressive symptoms, and costs will be obtained from all
      patients, so that the benefits and the costs of these three different depression screening
      strategies can be compared.

    <description>Change in QALYs from baseline through 18 months. QALYs are a generic measure of disease burden, including both the quality and the quantity of life lived. One QALY equates to one year in perfect health. To measure change in QALYs, utility scores [an overall assessment of well-being on a scale from 0 (death) to 1 (perfect health)], were estimated using the Short Form-6 dimension, with scores derived from responses to the 12-Item Short-Form Health Survey, version 2, at baseline and 6, 12, and 18 months. QALYs for the period from baseline to 18 months were then calculated as the area under the curve by linearly interpolating the utility scores at the 4 assessments. Change in QALYs was then obtained by subtracting the baseline QALY from the observed QALY for an 18-month period, where baseline QALY was calculated under the assumption that the baseline utility score remained constant during the 18-month period.</description>

Those with clinically significant score (&gt;=10) will be offered treatment. Treatment will be delivered according to participant preference, and will be managed according to &quot;stepped care&quot;. Stepped care includes, a) participant preference for either brief, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), delivered centrally by telephone, or antidepressant medication managed at the local site, or both, or neither, and b) review of progress at approximately 2-month intervals, with &quot;stepping up&quot; of care if sufficient progress is not being realized.</description>

CBT will be centrally telephone-administered by a trained CBT treatment specialist.

          <description>Participants randomized to this arm will complete the Depressive symptom screener (8-item Patient Health Questionnaire, PHQ-8) after randomization. Those with clinically significant score (&gt;=10) will be offered treatment. Treatment will be delivered according to participant preference, and will be managed according to &quot;stepped care&quot;. Stepped care includes, a) participant preference for either a type of brief, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) called problem solving therapy (PST), delivered centrally by telephone, or antidepressant medication managed at the local site, or both, or neither, and b) review of progress at approximately 2-month intervals, with &quot;stepping up&quot; of care if sufficient progress is not being realized.</description>

          <title>Depression Screen &amp; Notify</title>
          <description>Participants randomized to this arm will complete the depressive symptom screener (8-item Patient Health Questionnaire, PHQ-8) after randomization. Those with clinically significant score (&gt;=10) will have a letter sent to their primary care provider about their positive screen for depressive symptoms, with subsequent actions at the provider's discretion.
Standard Care: Participants will receive standard care from either their primary care provider (PCP), or PCP-referred mental health provider in one of the arms, IF depressive symptoms are detected.

        <title>Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs)</title>
        <description>Change in QALYs from baseline through 18 months. QALYs are a generic measure of disease burden, including both the quality and the quantity of life lived. One QALY equates to one year in perfect health. To measure change in QALYs, utility scores [an overall assessment of well-being on a scale from 0 (death) to 1 (perfect health)], were estimated using the Short Form-6 dimension, with scores derived from responses to the 12-Item Short-Form Health Survey, version 2, at baseline and 6, 12, and 18 months. QALYs for the period from baseline to 18 months were then calculated as the area under the curve by linearly interpolating the utility scores at the 4 assessments. Change in QALYs was then obtained by subtracting the baseline QALY from the observed QALY for an 18-month period, where baseline QALY was calculated under the assumption that the baseline utility score remained constant during the 18-month period.</description>

Other Adverse Events were assessed using a self-report instrument at 6-mo, 12-mo, and 18-mo. As not all participants were reached to complete this questionnaire, fewer participants were assessed for Other Adverse Events than for Serious Adverse Events and mortality. Also, the number of participants who were assessed for Other Adverse Events varies according to the time period of assessment.</desc>
