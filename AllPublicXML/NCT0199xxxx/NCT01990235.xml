  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this proposal is to test whether a multi-media website
      (www.prepareforyourcare.org) that is focused on preparing older adults for communication and
      medical decision making can help people engage in advance care planning.

    <textblock>
      PREPARE is a website (www.prepareforyourcare.org) that teaches patients how to identify what
      is most important in life, how to communicate their preferences to clinicians and loved ones,
      and how to make informed decisions. It is written at a 5th grade level and includes
      voice-overs of text and closed captioning of videos that model advance care planning
      behaviors. The goal of this proposal is to test the efficacy of PREPARE plus an easy-to-read
      advance directive, versus an advance directive alone, to improve patient engagement in
      multiple advance care planning behaviors including discussions with surrogate decision makers
      and clinicians in addition to advance directive completion. The investigators will also
      determine whether PREPARE can empower and activate patients within clinical encounters with
      their clinicians and help to decrease health disparities in advance care planning.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>New advance care planning documentation in the medical record</measure>
    <time_frame>15 months after study enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome is documentation of ACP wishes in the medical record. ACP documentation for the purposes of this study includes legal advance directive forms or other documentation of patients wishes for medical care in clinical notes.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Self-reported engagement in advance care planning behaviors</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months from baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Secondary outcomes were chosen to measure the full process of ACP. Using validated questionnaires, we will measure ACP behavior change processes, such as knowledge, contemplation, self-efficacy, and readiness, as well as several ACP actions, such as identifying a surrogate decision maker, identifying values and goals for medical care, choosing the level of leeway in surrogate decision making, discussing one's wishes with clinicians and surrogates, and documenting one's wishes in an advance directive.</description>

    <description>The PREPARE arm will review the PREPARE website plus the easy-to-read advance directive (AD). Participants will review PREPARE on their own for ≥ 20 minutes with staff present to answer questions. During PREPARE, participants answer preference questions and make an action plan (i.e., commitment to engage in advance care planning). To ensure home access to PREPARE content, participants will be given a website login and PREPARE content in digital video disc (DVD), booklet, and pamphlet format as well as the action plan and AD. One to three days before a primary care visit, the PREPARE arm will receive a reminder to come to their appointment and to bring their action plan.</description>

    <description>The Control arm will review an easy-to-read AD. Controls will review the AD for ≥ 15 minutes with study staff present to answer questions and will take the AD home to complete if desired. One to three days before a primary care visit, controls will receive a reminder to come to their appointment.</description>

    <description>At week 1, 3, 6, and 12 months, interviews (telephone or in person based on preference) by blinded staff will assess engagement in advance care planning(ACP), self-efficacy with ACP, and activation in and satisfaction with decision making. Blinded telephone interviews will also assess surrogate reports of patient engagement in ACP.</description>
