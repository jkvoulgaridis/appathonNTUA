  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that Recorded Home Oximetry (RHO) utilization will not increase
      rates of respiratory-related re-hospitalizations and ED visits, and will not impair growth
      compared to standard oxygen management protocols.

      Evidence-based specific consensus guidelines for home regulated oxygen management do not
      currently exist. Current strategies for infants requiring outpatient supplemental home oxygen
      include brief checks of oxygen status during monthly clinic visits. Although the infants stay
      on monitors, no data in between visits is obtained to ensure that infants can maintain oxygen
      levels after weans are made. Before finally allowing oxygen to be removed, many centers also
      require an overnight sleep study in the hospital, to make sure that the infant's oxygen
      levels stay safe when the infant is in deep sleep. Because these methods rely solely on
      assumptions rather than individually recorded data, an infant's time on supplemental oxygen
      may be prolonged or insufficient. This study will evaluate both the currently used accepted
      therapy and a method of weaning that involves recording and sending oxygen data for analysis
      in between clinic visits.

      Premature infants who require home oxygen therapy at time of discharge who meet eligibility
      criteria will be randomized into two arms:

      Arm A (&quot;Standard therapy&quot;): Infants' oxygen will be increased, decreased, or maintained based
      on brief structured assessments during monthly clinic visits.

      Arm B (Recorded Home Oximetry (RHO)): Infants will have the same monthly clinic assessments
      as in Arm A, but also will utilize Recorded Home Oximetry (RHO) to potentially increase,
      decrease or maintain oxygen between monthly visits.

      Parents of all infants will be interviewed using structured quality-of-life questionnaires at
      the beginning and ending of the oxygen management process. Health care utilization (emergency
      department visits and rehospitalizations) and growth will be assessed 6 months after
      discontinuation of oxygen.

      The investigators overall objective is to determine whether Recorded Home Oximetry (RHO) can
      improve caregiver quality of life, and can shorten Home Oxygen Therapy (HOT) duration and
      eliminate need for polysomnogram, without compromising safety. The investigators will
      determine respiratory-related re-hospitalizations, emergency department (ED) visits, and
      growth parameters to confirm safety of the proposed weaning strategies.

    <description>We will compare the difference between survey-derived quality-of-life scores, comparing parent response averages while on home oxygen therapy (HOT) versus 3 months post oxygen discontinuation scores in both arms. The infant scale is composed of 36 items comprising 5 dimensions. The item scaling is a 5-point Likert scale from 0 (never) to 4 (almost always). Scores range from 0 to 100, with a higher score indicating a higher parent satisfaction and quality of life.</description>

    <description>Growth measurements were taken at each monthly clinic visit while on oxygen. The average for weight z-score change was calculated for each subject while on oxygen therapy. After oxygen discontinuation, growth measurements were taken at the 1 month and 6 month post wean visits. These two measurements were again averaged for each patient. The weight z-score change was found in both arms for pre and post weaning from home oxygen therapy. The weight z-score indicates the number of standard deviations away from the mean a participants weight is. A z-score of 0 is equal to the mean. Negative numbers indicate values lower than the mean and positive numbers indicate values higher than the mean.</description>

Parents will transmit a minimum of 4 days of stored RHO data (min 8 hrs per day) every 4-7 days. Changes in oxygen needs will be made based on standardized objective criteria. To determine discontinuation of oxygen, RHO will be utilized instead of polysomnography.
RHO: Recorded oximetry data will be downloaded from home oximeters, analyzed, and used to assist in supplemental oxygen weaning decisions.</description>

          <title>Growth Parameters, Weight-for-length Z-score Change</title>
          <description>Growth measurements were taken at each monthly clinic visit while on oxygen. The average for weight for length z-score change was calculated for each subject while on oxygen therapy. After oxygen discontinuation, growth measurements were taken at the 1 month and 6 month post wean visits. These two measurements were again averaged for each patient. The weight for length z-score change was found in both arms for pre and post weaning from home oxygen therapy.The weight-for-length z-score indicates the number of standard deviations away from the mean a participants weight is. A z-score of 0 is equal to the mean. Negative numbers indicate values lower than the mean and positive numbers indicate values higher than the mean.</description>

          <description>Infants' oxygen will be increased, decreased, or maintained based on brief structured assessments during monthly clinic visits. Polysomnograms will be utilized prior to final discontinuation of oxygen. RHO will only be utilized on the night prior to and during the polysomnogram to compare these two modalities.</description>

        <group group_id="E2">
          <title>Arm B:RHO</title>
          <description>Infants will have the same monthly clinic assessments as in Arm A, but also will utilize RHO to potentially increase, decrease or maintain oxygen between monthly visits.
Parents will transmit a minimum of 4 days of stored RHO data (min 8 hrs per day) every 4-7 days. Changes in oxygen needs will be made based on standardized objective criteria. To determine discontinuation of oxygen, RHO will be utilized instead of polysomnography.
RHO: Recorded oximetry data will be downloaded from home oximeters, analyzed, and used to assist in supplemental oxygen weaning decisions.</description>
