  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic rhinosinusitis, a common diagnosis in children, remains a poorly understood disease.
      Adenoidectomy (surgery to take out the adenoid pads- infection fighting glands in the back of
      the throat) is performed since the adenoid pad may trap germs that enter a child's body and
      can get so swollen with bacteria that they become infected themselves. Functional endoscopic
      sinus surgery (FESS) and adenoidectomy are currently the most common surgeries performed on
      children with this disease. Another treatment is adenoidectomy and irrigation of the
      maxillary sinus without FESS. New technology has emerged using a balloon catheter to dilate
      (open) the sinus passage in addition to the adenoidectomy and irrigation. This study seeks to
      answer if children with chronic rhinosinusitis who undergo adenoidectomy with balloon
      dilation of the maxillary sinus passage and irrigation experience improved quality of life
      outcomes compared to children with chronic rhinosinusitis who undergo an adenoidectomy with
      maxillary sinus irrigation without dilation of the sinus passage.

    <time_frame>6 and 12 months postoperatively</time_frame>
    <description>The care giver for each subject will be asked to complete SN-5 Pediatric sinonasal symptom survey (SN-5) at baseline (prior to surgery) and 6 and 12 months post surgery.
The SN-5 is a health-related qualify of life (QOL) questionnaire which consists of 5 questions about sinus problems (sinus infection, nasal obstruction, allergy symptoms, emotional distress, activity limitations) each of which is scored by the caregiver on a 7 point response scale. The 5 responses are then averaged into an SN-5 overall score (1-7). 1 is the minimum value for the overall SN-5 (best QoL) and 7 is the maximum value (worst QoL) The questionnaire also asks the caregiver to grade overall health related quality of life using a visual analog scale from 0 (worse possible quality of life) to 10 (best possible quality of life). The visual analog scale is scored separately from the SN-5 average score.</description>

    <description>A rigid nasal endoscopy will be performed. After decongesting with oxymetazoline hydrochloride, the balloon catheter device will be inserted and the wire/balloon will be threaded through the maxillary sinus ostia. Confirmation of location will be per manufacturer's recommendation with either fluoroscopy or illumination. Following confirmation, the balloon will be dilated under visualization per manufacture's recommendation. After the visualization of the dilated ostia, cultures for aerobic/anerobic examination will be taken and irrigation with 10ml of isotonic sodium chloride will be performed.
Adenoidectomy will be performed using either the microdebrider or suction electrocautery in the usual manner.</description>

    <description>A rigid nasal endoscopy will be performed. After decongesting with oxymetazoline hydrochloride, the maxillary sinuses will be entered via middle meati punctures using either a sterile spinal needle or a curved suction. Sinus contents will be aspirated and sent for aerobic/anaerobic cultures. Irrigation with 10ml of isotonic sodium chloride will be performed. If no material is aspirated initially, the sinus contents will be re-aspirated after irrigation and sent for aerobic/anaerobic cultures.
Adenoidectomy will be performed using either the microdebrider or suction electrocautery in the usual manner.
After adequate hemostasis, the patient will be awakened and brought to the recovery room. Depending on the recovery, the child will either be admitted or discharged home.</description>

          <description>The care giver for each subject will be asked to complete SN-5 Pediatric sinonasal symptom survey (SN-5) at baseline (prior to surgery) and 6 and 12 months post surgery.
The SN-5 is a health-related qualify of life (QOL) questionnaire which consists of 5 questions about sinus problems (sinus infection, nasal obstruction, allergy symptoms, emotional distress, activity limitations) each of which is scored by the caregiver on a 7 point response scale. The 5 responses are then averaged into an SN-5 overall score (1-7). 1 is the minimum value for the overall SN-5 (best QoL) and 7 is the maximum value (worst QoL) The questionnaire also asks the caregiver to grade overall health related quality of life using a visual analog scale from 0 (worse possible quality of life) to 10 (best possible quality of life). The visual analog scale is scored separately from the SN-5 average score.</description>
