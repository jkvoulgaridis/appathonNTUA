  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine how physical activity and lifestyle factors influence
      postoperative recovery and postoperative complications after bariatric surgery.

      The hypothesis is that physically active people, with a healthy alcohol consumption and non
      smokers have shorter lengths of hospital stay, shorter sick-leave, fewer re-hospitalizations
      and fewer re-operations, fewer complications as well as a faster recovery after a surgical
      procedure.

      The investigators also hypothesize that possible risk factors for non-surgical postoperative
      complications e g abdominal discomfort are also life-style related factors such as smoking,
      high alcohol consumption, low level of physical activity, as well as other risk factors such
      as prior frequent abdominal pains (e g irritable bowel syndrome symptoms), high levels of
      anxiety and/or depression, difficulties with coping with the changed food intake regimen
      after obesity surgery, and generally high sensitivity for painful-sensations and nausea.

      First aim of this study is to investigate how life style factors prior to obesity surgery are
      related to hospital stay, sick-leave, immediate postoperative complication rates and the rate
      of resumption of QoL and normal physical function.

      The second aim of the study is to identify risk factors for the development of chronic
      abdominal discomfort and dumping symptoms after obesity surgery.
