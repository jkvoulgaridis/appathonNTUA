  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients undergoing allogeneic blood and marrow transplantation (HSCT) experience a prolonged
      period of dysfunctional immunity. Systematic reimmunization is necessary at appropriate time
      intervals following transplantation to re-establish immunity. Vaccination practices after
      HSCT remain varied and data sparse. Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) is one of the most severe
      infections of the central nervous system caused by a tick-borne flavivirus. There is no
      specific treatment, and prevention with the vaccine is the only intervention available. To
      assess the efficacy of TBE vaccination in adult allogeneic HSCT recipients compared to an
      age-matched and sex-matched control group of healthy volunteers without previous TBE
      vaccination, a prospective open-label phase II pilot study on humoral and cellular immune
      responses after use of TBE vaccine (FSME Immun) will be performed. As primary end point the
      outcome of the neutralization test (NT) against TBE will be assessed in a total of 26 HSCT
      patients one year after HSCT and in 26 healthy volunteers, namely four weeks after the second
      vaccination. Therefore, the number of subjects with NT titres against TBE virus &gt;10, assumed
      to be the threshold for antibody-mediated protection will be evaluated. As secondary
      endpoints, antibody concentrations of TBE enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay before and four
      weeks after the second and third vaccination and antibody concentrations of NT against TBE
      four weeks after primary immunization. To evaluate cellular immune responses, lymphocyte
      proliferations assays and cytokine detection assays will be performed. In a subgroup
      analysis, these secondary endpoints will be compared between healthy volunteers, HSCT
      patients without immunosuppressive treatment and HSCT patients receiving immunosuppressive
      agents. Additionally, immune reconstitution by analysis of peripheral blood lymphocyte
      subsets and serum immunoglobulin levels will be evaluated prior to vaccination, after twelve
      weeks and prior to the third vaccination in HSCT patients only.

    <limitations_and_caveats>A limitation of this study might be the definition of response to vaccination. As the majority of HSCT patients had pre-existing antibodies, the concept of seroconversion was not applicable. Instead, a 2-fold rise in NT titer was used as outcome.</limitations_and_caveats>
