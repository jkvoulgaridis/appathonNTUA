    <time_frame>Weeks 0 to 8</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event (AE) was defined as any untoward medical occurrence, whether or not considered drug related. A serious AE was defined as an AE or suspected adverse reaction that at any dose resulted in any of the following outcomes: death, a life-threatening AE, inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or an important medical event that may have jeopardized the subject and may have required medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in the definition. An AE was considered a TEAE if it occurred or worsened in severity on or after the date of the first dose of study drug. An AE was considered a UX007 emergent adverse event if it occurred or worsened in severity on or after the first date of first dose of UX007 during the study.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs), Serious TEAEs and Discontinuations Due to TEAEs During the Placebo-Controlled Period</title>
        <description>An adverse event (AE) was defined as any untoward medical occurrence, whether or not considered drug related. A serious AE was defined as an AE or suspected adverse reaction that at any dose resulted in any of the following outcomes: death, a life-threatening AE, inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or an important medical event that may have jeopardized the subject and may have required medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in the definition. An AE was considered a TEAE if it occurred or worsened in severity on or after the date of the first dose of study drug. An AE was considered a UX007 emergent adverse event if it occurred or worsened in severity on or after the first date of first dose of UX007 during the study.</description>

        <description>An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence, whether or not considered drug related. A serious AE was defined as an AE or suspected adverse reaction that at any dose resulted in any of the following outcomes: death, a life-threatening AE, inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or an important medical event that may have jeopardized the subject and may have required medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in the definition. An AE was considered a TEAE if it occurred or worsened in severity on or after the date of the first dose of study drug. An AE was considered a UX007 emergent adverse event if it occurred or worsened in severity on or after the first date of first dose of UX007 during the study.</description>

RTI Simple choice reaction time standard deviation (RTISRTSD) assesses the cognitive domain of attention, with scores on a continuous range from 0 to 5000; lower scores indicate better function. RTI median simple choice reaction time (RTIMDSRT) assesses the cognitive domain of reaction time, with scores on a continuous range from 100 to 5100; lower scores indicate better function. RTI median 5-choice reaction time (RTIMDFRT) assesses the cognitive domain of reaction time, with scores on a continuous range from 100 to 5100; lower scores indicate better function.

        <description>CANTAB measures neuropsychological function using a standardized, computerized battery of tests designed to assess visual memory, working memory, new learning and reaction time. PAL total errors adjusted (PALTEA) assesses the cognitive domain of episodic memory/new learning, with scores on a discrete, ordinal scale from 0 to 137; lower scores indicate better function. PAL first trial memory score (PALFTMS) assesses the cognitive domain of episodic memory, with scores on a discrete, ordinal scale from 0 to 27; higher scores indicate better function.

        <description>Reduction from baseline over time in frequency of seizures (normalized to a 4-week rate): observable seizures measured for 6 weeks after 2-week titration by diary and absence seizures measured overnight by EEG. Observable seizures from the diary include generalized tonic-clonic, generalized tonic, generalized clonic, generalized atonic, partial/focal with secondary generalization, myoclonic, myoclonic (astatic) atonic, myoclonic tonic, complex partial/focal, simple partial/focal motor, simple partial/focal sensory, and simple partial/focal psychological. Absence seizures from EEG include absence awake (&gt;=10 sec), absence sleep (&gt;=10 sec), indeterminate absence awake (3-10 sec), and indeterminate absence sleep (3-10 sec). A negative value indicates an increase in frequency.</description>

          <description>Reduction from baseline over time in frequency of seizures (normalized to a 4-week rate): observable seizures measured for 6 weeks after 2-week titration by diary and absence seizures measured overnight by EEG. Observable seizures from the diary include generalized tonic-clonic, generalized tonic, generalized clonic, generalized atonic, partial/focal with secondary generalization, myoclonic, myoclonic (astatic) atonic, myoclonic tonic, complex partial/focal, simple partial/focal motor, simple partial/focal sensory, and simple partial/focal psychological. Absence seizures from EEG include absence awake (&gt;=10 sec), absence sleep (&gt;=10 sec), indeterminate absence awake (3-10 sec), and indeterminate absence sleep (3-10 sec). A negative value indicates an increase in frequency.</description>
