  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neonatal Brachial Plexus Palsy (NBPP), characterized by weakness and sensory loss in the
      affected arm, results from damage in the prenatal period to the nerves extending from the
      spine to the arm. Proper stretching and exercise of the joints and affected arm from the time
      of diagnosis can greatly assist in the development of healthy movement of the limb.
      Additionally, neuromuscular electrical stimulation has been shown to be an effective
      treatment in other neural disorders and therefore its effectiveness in NBPP is worth
      studying.

      In the case of NBPP patients, the loss in normal arm function can be observed very early.
      Young patients will often neglect using the affected arm or modify motions to avoid the use
      of the biceps muscle, specifically in hand to mouth actions such as gripping a bottle or
      placing toys or other objects in the mouth. A goal of this study is to test the effectiveness
      of NMES on improving the biceps muscle Medical Research Council (MRC) strength and active
      range of motion (AROM).

      The subjects of this study are newborns between the ages of 3-9 months who are already a part
      of the University of Michigan Brachial Plexus program. Parents of the children will be
      trained to perform the neuromuscular electrical stimulation therapy at home using the EMPI
      Continuum unit for 30 minutes each day and monthly follow up appointments will be performed
      be the research occupational therapists throughout three month study period.

      Parents of the participants will complete a questionnaire before and during the study period
      to help analyze for confounders and gather data regarding parent compliance and NMES
      effectiveness. To detect the effectiveness of NMES, two cohort groups using standard units
      and sham units will be recruited and compare with data analysis.

      The investigators predict that the NMES will effectively improve the ability of the neonate
      to increase use of the affected arm, specifically in muscle strength biceps MRC score and
      AROM.

      The purpose of this study is to investigate whether the use of Neuromuscular Electrical
      Stimulation (NMES), via the EmpiÂ® Continuum unit, will improve the ability with which
      children with Neonatal Brachial Plexus Palsy (NBPP) are able to use their biceps muscle in
      activities of daily living. We will examine the British Medical Research Council (MRC) muscle
      strength and participants' ability to perform active range of motion (AROM) movements.
      Patients will be divided into two groups with one group receiving NMES and the other
      receiving sham NMES. We plan to analyze the effects of this one treatment intervention of
      NMES to determine if the device improves the function of the biceps muscle strength and
      motion.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Upper Extremity Muscle Strength</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 3-month.</time_frame>
    <description>One of the two-blinded occupational therapists will conduct the evaluation at enrollment and 3-month follow-up clinic visit. In this study, we will evaluate the biceps strength using the British Medical Research Council (MRC) grading system. The British Medical Research Council (MRC) grading system for muscle strength is based on a scale from 0 (minimum score, not testable), 1, 2, 3, 4, to 5 (maximum score, normal strength); higher score means better outcome. British Medical Research Council (MRC) grade 2 or higher is functional in terms of muscle power. In current study, we will examine the change of biceps British Medical Research Council (MRC) grade from baseline to 3-month.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Upper Extremity Range of Motion</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 3-month.</time_frame>
    <description>One of the two-blinded occupational therapists will assess the active range of motion (AROM) of elbow flexion using goniometer at enrollment and 3-month follow-up clinic visit. The minimum degree is 0 and the maximum degree is 150; the higher degree means better outcome. We will then examine the change of elbow flexion active range of motion (AROM) from baseline to 3-month.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Spontaneous Hand-to-Mouth Movement</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 3-month.</time_frame>
    <description>Study coordinators will conduct one-minute video recording with patient in supported sitting position in a chair or seated on parents lap at initial and monthly clinic visits. A toy, pacifier, or bottle will be provided to trigger patient's spontaneous hand-to-mouth movement. The frequency of hand to mouth motion will be recorded and separated out as to the positioning of the elbow. We are evaluating the motion to determine if the motion of the elbow flexion is against gravity, (the arm held at the side of the body or in an adducted position) or in gravity-eliminated position, (the arm held away from the body or in an abducted position). We are looking at the strength of the biceps in its ability to lift the arm against gravity during functional hand to mouth activities. The NMES unit will not be in use during the videotaping process; we are looking at the spontaneous movement of the extremity.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Participant's Current Therapy</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 3-month.</time_frame>
    <description>Parents will complete a survey asking participant's current therapy program, including therapy type, setting, frequency, duration, other treatment activities, splint usage, home range of motion exercise program and its frequency and duration at initial and monthly follow-up visits. The purpose of this survey is to help us understand whether there are potential confounders that could affect the study result.</description>

          <description>Narakas grade is determined by a single surgeon via either: 1) physical examination and neurological assessment at approximately 1 week of age or at initial clinical appointment, or 2) motherâs or obstetricianâs report of childâs arm/hand movements at birth. The Narakas grade is grouped into Grade I-II versus III-IV in the current study.
Narakas Groups I and II are considered to be less extensive NBPP injury and Groups III and IV are more extensive NBPP injury.</description>

        <description>One of the two-blinded occupational therapists will conduct the evaluation at enrollment and 3-month follow-up clinic visit. In this study, we will evaluate the biceps strength using the British Medical Research Council (MRC) grading system. The British Medical Research Council (MRC) grading system for muscle strength is based on a scale from 0 (minimum score, not testable), 1, 2, 3, 4, to 5 (maximum score, normal strength); higher score means better outcome. British Medical Research Council (MRC) grade 2 or higher is functional in terms of muscle power. In current study, we will examine the change of biceps British Medical Research Council (MRC) grade from baseline to 3-month.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Spontaneous Hand-to-Mouth Movement</title>
        <description>Study coordinators will conduct one-minute video recording with patient in supported sitting position in a chair or seated on parents lap at initial and monthly clinic visits. A toy, pacifier, or bottle will be provided to trigger patient's spontaneous hand-to-mouth movement. The frequency of hand to mouth motion will be recorded and separated out as to the positioning of the elbow. We are evaluating the motion to determine if the motion of the elbow flexion is against gravity, (the arm held at the side of the body or in an adducted position) or in gravity-eliminated position, (the arm held away from the body or in an abducted position). We are looking at the strength of the biceps in its ability to lift the arm against gravity during functional hand to mouth activities. The NMES unit will not be in use during the videotaping process; we are looking at the spontaneous movement of the extremity.</description>
