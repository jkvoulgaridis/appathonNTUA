    <textblock>
      This study aims to investigate genetic causes of early childhood obesity.

      The investigators will enroll children and young adults with severe early onset obesity (BMI
      &gt; 99th percentile) diagnosed prior to 6 years of age. The investigators will ask questions
      about the health and eating behavior of the participants, and perform a brief physical
      examination. The investigators will collect saliva or blood to perform genetic testing from
      the participants and invite family members to enroll in the study.

      This is a clinical and genomic study designed to investigate monogenic causes of severe early
      childhood obesity.

      Participatns with severe early onset obesity will be identified by screening of the clinical
      database or referred for the study. These subjects will be invited to participate in the
      study. After obtaining informed consent, the investigators will obtain history on the proband
      and the family, and perform a brief examination in addition to collecting genetic material.

      Targeted sequencing of genes associated with monogenic and syndromic forms of obesity will be
      performed using next-generation sequencing. In selected individuals with favorable family
      history, exome or whole genome sequencing will be performed. Functional analysis of newly
      identified variants will be performed where possible.
