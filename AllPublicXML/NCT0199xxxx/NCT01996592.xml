  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many factors influence the development of persistent pain after CS (chronic pain) as well as
      post-partum depression. We are attempting to use trajectory pain methods in an attempt to
      identify those at risk for the development of persistent pain post delivery using a daily
      method of contact for the determination of pain scores. Assessments are also done evaluating
      satisfaction of pain management and maternal/infant bonding opportunities. Physical activity
      is monitored by subject's wearing a Fitbit with correlation being done with pain scores
      obtained over 60 days postop with eligible subjects..

      Subjects are contacted on a daily basis after having a cesarean delivery to determine current
      pain, current pain unpleasantness, worst pain, worst pain unpleasantness, average pain, and
      average pain unpleaseantness. Preoperatively subjects complete a psycho-social/depressive
      screening questionnaire. Pain treatments/satisfaction assessments are captured for the first
      24 hours. Mother/baby outcomes are also captured. Physical activity and pain scores are also
      correlated with the subject's wearing of a Fitbit physical activity bracelet with eligible
      subjects for 60 days post-delivery.

    <time_frame>60 days</time_frame>
    <description>By identifying preoperative risk factors for chronic pain and mapping out the trajectory of pain after cesarean delivery, we may be able to use novel pharmacologic or psychological interventions to alter postoperative pain trajectories. Two predominant risk factors have been determined thus far to put those at risk. They are emotional distress/depression and perceived stress. The 530 participants recovery pain scores were broken down into 3 subgroups--group 1 is those who had the fastest recovery, group 2 which is the &quot;average&quot; recovery, and group 3 which is the group with the slowest recovery.</description>

        <title>Persistent Pain-EMOTIONAL DISTRESS</title>
        <description>By identifying preoperative risk factors for chronic pain and mapping out the trajectory of pain after cesarean delivery, we may be able to use novel pharmacologic or psychological interventions to alter postoperative pain trajectories. Two predominant risk factors have been determined thus far to put those at risk. They are emotional distress/depression and perceived stress. The 530 participants recovery pain scores were broken down into 3 subgroups--group 1 is those who had the fastest recovery, group 2 which is the &quot;average&quot; recovery, and group 3 which is the group with the slowest recovery.
PROMIS Emotional Distress-Depression Short form utilized for this outcome. scoring for this ranges from 8-40, with the higher the score the worse the distress</description>
