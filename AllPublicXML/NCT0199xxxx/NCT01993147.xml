  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to learn more about the brain circuits involved with effortful
      control in healthy adult participants. It was planned that the study would enroll 80
      participants to a dual task paradigm pilot while undergoing a fMRI scan to assess brain
      mechanisms that cause the &quot;depletion effect&quot;. This effect refers to the observation that
      people perform more poorly on effortful control tasks after they have already performed task
      requiring effortful control. Then subsequent study participants would be given either
      methylphenidate (also known as 'Ritalin') which is FDA approved and the most widely-used
      medication for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) or a placebo, which is a sugar
      pill. Each participant would also perform some computer tasks that have been shown in
      previous studies to require effortful control while undergoing an fMRI (functional Magnetic
      Resonance Imaging) which takes a special kind of picture of the brain. The study's goal was
      to learn more about the brain mechanisms by which methylphenidate improves effortful control.
      After enrolling the first 50 participants, the study assessed whether a depletion effect was
      observed in the dual task paradigm. It was found that there was not: there was no
      statistically significant difference in effortful control performance comparing subjects who
      did and did not perform a prior effortful control task. Because the behavioral manipulation
      failed, it was determined that the drug manipulation portion of the study was no longer
      justified. Thus, after enrolling 50 participants to the pilot part of the study, the decision
      was made to terminate the study without beginning the trial of methylphenidate.
