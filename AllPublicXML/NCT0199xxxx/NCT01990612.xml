      A randomized clinical trial to assess whether elective induction of labor at 39 weeks of
      gestation compared with expectant management will improve outcomes.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Given the reported increased risks of adverse events in pregnancies extending beyond 39 weeks
      it has been hypothesized that a policy of planned elective induction at 39 weeks could
      improve outcomes for the infant and the mother. For multiparous patients, especially those
      with a favorable cervix, it is perhaps easy to justify an elective induction at 39 weeks
      given the low risk of cesarean section. However, for nulliparous patients the current
      evidence, derived mainly from retrospective observational studies, does not allow a clear
      recommendation. Nevertheless, a trend towards an increased rate of elective labor induction
      in pregnancies at 39 weeks has been reported, indicating that practitioners are more commonly
      using elective induction at this gestational age,even as others caution against routine
      elective induction prior to 41 weeks given the reported increased risk of cesarean delivery.
      Ultimately, a randomized controlled trial is necessary to satisfactorily understand whether
      elective induction of labor of nulliparas at 39 weeks improves neonatal and maternal
      outcomes.

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>50,581 low-risk nulliparous women at 34 weeks 0 days gestation to 38 weeks 6 days gestation were screened for eligibility between March 2014 and August 2017 at 41 hospitals participating in the MFMU network. Women who consented were assessed again between 38 weeks 0 days gestation and 38 weeks 6 days gestation for new indications of ineligibility.</recruitment_details>

Elective Induction of Labor: Women randomized to induction of labor will undergo induction via oxytocin at 39 weeks 0 days to 39 weeks 4 days. Those with an unfavorable cervix (modified Bishop score &lt; 5) will first undergo cervical ripening (method left to the discretion of the patient’s physician) in conjunction with or followed by oxytocin stimulation unless a contraindication arises.</description>

Those with an unfavorable cervix (modified Bishop score &lt; 5) will first undergo cervical ripening (method left to the discretion of the patient’s physician) in conjunction with or followed by oxytocin stimulation unless a contraindication arises.</description>

          <description>The Apgar score is based on a total score of 1 to 10. The higher the score, the better the baby is doing after birth. A score of 7, 8, or 9 is normal and is a sign that the newborn is in good health.</description>
