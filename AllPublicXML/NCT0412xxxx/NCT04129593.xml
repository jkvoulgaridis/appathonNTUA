  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One third of American adults and teens are sleep deprived, and less than 8% of highschool
      students achieve recommended amounts of sleep. 85% of Americans consume caffeine daily, and a
      pilot study we conducted suggests over half of working professionals snooze. Sleep
      deprivation results in sleep inertia (grogginess) upon waking, and many behaviors are
      employed to reduce the negative effects of sleep inertia, including self-awakening (SA -
      going to bed intending to wake at a specific time) and snoozing (setting multiple alarms or
      using a snooze function). SA reduces sleep inertia and may increase stress system activity
      before waking, but snoozing is virtually unstudied, though alarms can also increase stress
      system activity. The cortisol awakening response (CAR) is a boost in the stress hormone,
      cortisol, that occurs naturally upon waking. The CAR is thought to reduce sleep inertia and
      to prepare for the anticipated stressors of the day, and this physiological process can be
      blunted in those who are sleep deprived and/or have medical or psychiatric conditions. This
      proposal seeks to increase the CAR in healthy individuals through SA and snooze
      interventions. Participants receive a commercial wearable at the beginning of the week that
      tracks sleep and heart rate, as well as a study phone that monitors the sleep environment,
      tracks alarms, and administers cognitive tests after waking to determine sleep inertia. These
      devices allow a development of baseline waking behavior. On Saturday and Sunday mornings
      undergo additional including a higher quality heart rate monitor and body temperature sensor.
      Participants also undergo 2 of 3 conditions; SA, snoozing, and natural waking. In the SA
      condition, participants intend to wake up 7 hours after they go to bed. In the snooze
      condition, participants set multiple alarms to terminate 7 hours after bedtime. In the
      natural waking condition, participants wake up normally. Upon waking, participants provide
      multiple saliva samples and undergo cognitive performance assessments and answer questions
      about mood for 1 hour. By comparing the cortisol samples between conditions, we can determine
      if SA and/or snoozing increases the CAR relative to natural waking. The cognitive performance
      tests will also be tested between conditions to determine if the interventions reduce sleep
      inertia and/or increase stress system activity. Interventions that specifically increase the
      CAR and reduce sleep inertia in healthy individuals could then be tested for those who have
      blunted CAR, e.g. chronic pain sufferers, to improve quality of life.

    <measure>Sleep inertia - cognitive throughput</measure>
    <time_frame>During weekdays, sleep inertia will be assessed immediately upon waking, duration is 5 minutes. On Saturday and Sunday, they will be assessed at wake + 10 minutes, wake +25 minutes, wake + 40 minutes, and wake + 55minutes.</time_frame>
    <description>sleep inertia is a marked decrease in cognitive abilities upon waking. We wish to see if cognitive performance upon waking is better when snoozing or self awakening.</description>
