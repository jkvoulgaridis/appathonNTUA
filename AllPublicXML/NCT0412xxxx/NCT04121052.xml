  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of 5 different food conditions on the
      single dose pharmacokinetics (PK) of the JNJ-64417184 tablet formulation administered orally,
      using the PK after a high-fat meal as a reference, in healthy adult participants.

    <description>AUC (0-infinity) is the area under the plasma analyte concentration-time curve (AUC) from time zero to infinite time, calculated as the sum of AUC (0-last) and C(last)/lambda(z); wherein AUC (0-last) is area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to last measurable concentration, C(last) is the last observed measurable (non-BQL) plasma analyte concentration; extrapolations of more than 20% of the total AUC are reported as approximations, and lambda(z) is apparent terminal elimination rate constant.</description>

    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant administered a medicinal (investigational or non-investigational) product does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment. Therefore, it can be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not related to that medicinal product.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Must have a body mass index (BMI); weight per height square between 18.0 and 30.0
             kilogram per meter square (kg/m^2), (extremes included), and body weight not less than
             50.0 kg at screening

          -  Healthy on the basis of physical examination, medical and surgical history, and vital
             signs performed at screening. If there are abnormalities, the participant may be
             included only if the investigator judges the abnormalities to be not clinically
             significant or to be appropriate and reasonable for the population under study. This
             determination must be recorded in the participant's source documents and initialed by
             the investigator

          -  Must have a normal 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) (triplicate) at screening,
             including: normal sinus rhythm (heart rate between 45 and 100 beats per minute [bpm],
             extremes included); QT interval corrected for heart rate (QTc); QRS interval less than
             (&lt;) 120 milliseconds (ms); PR interval less than or equals to &lt;= 200 ms. If the
             results of the ECG are outside the normal ranges, the subject may be included only if
             the investigator judges the deviations from normal ECG to be not clinically
             significant or to be appropriate and reasonable for the population under study. This
             determination must be recorded in the subject's source documents and initialed by the
             investigator

          -  Female participant must have a negative highly sensitive serum beta human chorionic
             gonadotropin (Beta-hCG) pregnancy test at screening and on Days -1 for each treatment
             period (except for postmenopausal female participants)

          -  Must not use nicotine-containing substances including tobacco products (example,
             cigarettes, e-cigarettes, cigars, chewing tobacco, gum, or patch) for at least 3
             months prior to screening

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any evidence of heart block or bundle branch block at screening

          -  Current human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-type 1 (HIV-1) or HIV-2 infection
             (confirmed by antibodies) at screening

          -  History of hepatitis A, B, or C infection, or current hepatitis A infection (confirmed
             by hepatitis A antibody immunoglobulin M [IgM]), or HBV infection (confirmed by
             hepatitis B surface antigen), or HCV infection (confirmed by HCV antibody) at
             screening

          -  A history of clinically significant drug allergy such as, but not limited to,
             sulfonamides and penicillins, or drug allergy witnessed in previous studies with
             experimental drugs

          -  Has previously been dosed with JNJ-64417184
