    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to study the effect of giving nivolumab with
      CCR2/5-inhibitor or anti-IL-8 before surgery, and after surgery, with the goal of determining
      if this medicine results in:

        1. A significant immune response against their tumor (which the study team will see in the
           tumor that is taken out at the time of surgery)

        2. Improvement in long term survival rates

      Objectives:

      Cohorts A,B (NSCLC):

      Primary Objective: Major Pathologic Response (MPR) Secondary Objectives: Time to surgery,
      tolerability and safety, radiographic response

      Cohorts C,D,E (HCC):

      Primary Objective: Significant tumor necrosis (STN) Secondary Objectives: Time to surgery,
      tolerability and safety, radiographic response

      Diagnosis and Main Inclusion Criteria:

      Patients must have disease deemed resectable before enrollment.

      Study Product:

      Nivolumab 480mg (q4w, dosed twice before surgery and three times following recovery from
      surgery) BMS-813160 (CCR2/5-inhibitor) 300mg oral twice a day for 28 days BMS-986253
      (anti-IL-8) 2400mg once
