  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the absence of sufficient monetary resources, individuals must attend to immediate,
      minimum needs (e.g., food, shelter). This constricts one's temporal window and engenders
      neglect of the future. In observational studies, scarcity is associated with higher rates of
      delay discounting. Additionally, socioeconomic status is inversely associated with alcohol
      use disorder and related problems. Experimentally, scarcity shortens attention, impedes
      cognitive function, and increases delay discounting in multiple populations. Moreover,
      scarcity increases demand for fast foods in the obese and increases craving for alcohol in
      problem drinkers. These data suggest that economic scarcity worsens both components of
      reinforcer pathology (delay discounting and alcohol overvaluation), thus increasing
      vulnerability to alcohol use disorder. However, the effects of scarcity on alcohol
      self-administration and on neural networks related to discounting rate have yet to be
      examined. The purpose of Aim 1b is to examine effects of decreasing the temporal window and
      its concomitant effects on alcohol valuation (self-administration, demand, and craving).

      Economic scarcity is hypothesized to increase both alcohol valuation and neural activation of
      areas associated with the impulsive decision system (e.g., the ventral striatum).

      Participants will be randomly assigned to experimental or control groups, stratified by AUDIT
      scores, SES, age, and sex. Based on 8 years of experience recruiting alcohol users into
      studies of comparable length and complexity, 82% of consented participants are anticipated to
      be eligible (i.e., randomized) and 89% of those individuals will complete Aim 1b. Thus, to
      achieve a final sample size of 64, 88 participants will be consented. Participants will
      complete: a baseline assessment (S1), an alcohol self-administration session (S2/S3), and an
      fMRI session (S2/S3). The alcohol self-administration session and the fMRI session will be
      completed in a counterbalanced order and in the presence of assigned narratives (i.e.,
      scarcity or neutral). Participants will be assigned to the scarcity or neutral narrative
      groups. Participants in both groups will be instructed to read the assigned narrative,
      consider it for 15 seconds and vividly imagine that this narrative applies to them.

      Next, participants will complete the primary and secondary outcome measures (e.g., in the
      presence of these narratives complete assessments of delay discounting and alcohol valuation
      and then proceed to the alcohol self-administration or fMRI session, as counterbalanced).
      Participants will also complete assessments of their stress and mood response to the
      narrative intervention, using the Stress Appraisal Measure (SAM) and PANAS for two purposes.
      That is, 1) to monitor participant safety, 2) to measure the mediating ability of affect on
      changes in the temporal window. During all assessments of S2 and S3, text and/or audio
      prompts of the narratives will be presented.

    <description>Delay-discounting tasks provide a measure of the temporal window and examine the devaluation of awards as a function of the delay to the receipt. These computerized assessments provide participants with hypothetical choices between smaller amounts of a reward available immediately and a larger amount of a reward after a range of delays (1 day-25 years). Discounting rates will be measured using adjusting amount delay discounting and minute delay discounting tasks. Change in discounting rates will be compared within-subjects between Session 1 and Session 2 AND Session 1 and Session 3. Change scores will be compared between groups (arms).</description>

    <description>Intensity and elasticity of alcohol demand will be determined from an alcohol demand curve via an Alcohol Purchase Task (APT).

    <description>A brief questionnaire (the Alcohol Urges Questionnaire) will be used assess alcohol craving. The Alcohol Urges Questionnaire is an 8-item survey which produces scores between 8-56, where higher scores indicate greater craving.

    <description>The Stress Appraisal Measure will be used to measure acute stress induced by the intervention. This measure is a 28-item survey which produces scores between 28-140, where higher scores indicate greater stress.

    <description>The Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) will be used to measure mood induced by the intervention. This 20-item survey measures 10 positive and 10 negative affective states. The positive affect score ranges from 10-50, with higher scores representing greater positive affect. The negative affect score ranges from 10-50, with higher scores representing greater negative affect. Change in PANAS will be compared within-subjects between Session 1 and Session 2 AND Session 1 and Session 3. Change scores will be compared between groups (arms).</description>
