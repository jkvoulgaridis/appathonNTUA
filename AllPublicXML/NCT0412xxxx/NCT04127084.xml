  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetic kidney disease has become the leading cause for ESRD worldwide.Albuminuria is a
      major risk factor for progression of diabetic nephropathy. SGLT2 inhibitors are the first
      antiglycaemic drugs with direct renoprotection, which are thought to protect the kidneys by
      lowering albuminuria, stimulating urinary glucose excretion ,reducing systemic blood
      pressure, while simultaneously improving multiple other risk factors in a glucose-independent
      manner. However, the precise mechanisms behind the renal beneficial effect of SGLT2
      inhibitors are not entirely elucidated, although ongoing outcome trials will confirm these
      findings. This study is to assess the impact of three months of treatment with SGLT2
      Inhibitions on different levels of albuminuria in patients with type 2 diabetes and to
      evaluate the effects of SGLT2 inhibition treatment on markers for podocyte damage , renal
      fibrosis, inflammation，oxidative stress and renin-angiotensin- aldosterone system.

      Objective: The primary objective is to assess the impact of three months of treatment with
      SGLT2 Inhibition on Different levels of Albuminuria in Patients With type 2 diabetes and to
      seek the relationship of this influences to relevant risk markers in the pathology of
      diabetic renal disease.

      Design: prospective ，intervention， case-controlled , single center study. Treatment period:
      12 weeks. Patient population: 60 patients with type 2 diabetes recruited from Zhongshan
      Hospital Xiamen University in accordance with the study in- and exclusion criteria.

      Intervention: Dapagliflozine 10 mg once daily tablet treatment or Empagliflozin10 mg once
      daily tablet treatment or Canagliflozin 100 mg once daily tablet treatment. Endpoints:
      Primary outcome: evaluate the effects of SGLT2 inhibition treatment on on urinary
      albuminuria, kidney function and eGFR .

      Secondary endpoints To assess the effect of SGLT2 inhibition on markers for podocyte damage ,
      renal fibrosis, inflammation，oxidative stress and renin-angiotensin- aldosterone system。
      Timeframe: Recruiting planned from October 2019, inclusion over the following 12 months. Last
      patient is expected to be completed October 2020. Data analysis completed December 2020,
      publication autumn 2021.
