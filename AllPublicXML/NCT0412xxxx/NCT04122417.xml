    <description>Study was determined that therapeutic touch methods applied to babies by the mothers increase mother-baby attachment; contributed to the sleep-calmness states, vital signs and weight gain of the baby; and reduced the stays in hospital.</description>

    <description>The touch method was taught to the mothers in the Yakson group by the researcher in the first three days after the birth with the training brochure, video and applications on the model that are prepared in accordance with expert opinion.
In yakson method, mother's fingers are closed, and she should touch in a way that does not apply excessive pressure. The method is applied for a total of 15 minutes in three cycles. First 5 minutes is resting the hand, 5 minutes is gentle caressing, and another 5 minutes of resting the hand.</description>

    <description>The touch method was taught to the mothers in the Gentle Human Touch group by the researcher in the first three days after the birth with the training brochure, video and applications on the model that are prepared in accordance with expert opinion.
Mother slowly places one hand on the baby's hand and the other over pelvic cavity, covering the waist and hips of the baby.
The touch is preserved for 15 minutes. In order to ensure equal touch for the duration of gentle human touch, the mother sits on a stool and her elbows have to be at the same level with baby's bed</description>

        The sample of the study consists of babies and their mothers who were matching the criteria
        of the research between these dates and who volunteered. As a result of the power analysis,
        sample size was calculated as 90 for experimental and control groups with Power: 0.80. As a
        result of the sample calculation a total of 90 mothers and babies; 30 for Yakson group, 30
        for gentle human touch group, 30 for control group were included in the study. The
        assignment of mothers and babies to the experiment and control groups was carried out by
        randomization with drawing lots method.
