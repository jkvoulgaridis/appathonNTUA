  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the feasibility pedaling using an under-the desk
      bike during immunotherapy infusions. Also, the study hopes to evaluate how pedaling impacts
      quality of life and treatment response biomarkers. Lastly, the study will evaluate the
      relationships between treatment response and muscle mass which is evaluated with computerized
      tomography (CT) scans.

    <measure>Treatment response biomarkers</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Treatment response biomarkers (check point inhibitors, functional T and B cell subsets, pro and anti-inflammatory monocyte subsets, and soluble inflammatory mediators) will be drawn before and immediately following first and fourth immunotherapy treatments. All biomarkers are available as either part of the MILLIPLEXÂ® MAP Human High-sensitivity T-cell Assay or the ProcartaPlex Human Immuno-Oncology Checkpoint Panel. All assays will be run according to the manufacturer's recommended protocols on a Luminex FlexMAP 3D system with concentrations calculated based on 7-point standard curves.</description>

    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>CT images will be gathered at the time of diagnosis and following completion of immunotherapy treatments. Patient's CT scans will be uploaded to a medical image analysis software (SliceOmatic), which allows for the evaluation of body composition, focusing on sarcopenia or muscle depletion.</description>

    <description>During their 30 minute immunotherapy infusions, participants will pedal using a stationary cycle ergometer. Participants will be allowed to determine their pedaling intensity and cadence, however, will be encouraged to reach the established goal intensity level. A research personnel will monitor the patient's heart rate, blood pressure, and RPE at baseline and every 10 minutes throughout the pedaling session. Participants will also have treatment response biomarkers gathered at baseline and before and within 10 minutes of completing their first and fourth immunotherapy infusions. Lastly, participants will complete both a physical activity questionnaire and a quality of life questionnaire at baseline and following their fourth treatment.</description>
