  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This culture system utilizes the special affinity difference of biomedical material coating
      for different cells to achieve the effect of isolating tumor cells from the blood sample. The
      coating of the system has the characteristic that to make the WBCs adhesion, but the cancer
      cells in the blood sample suspend in the culture medium, which achieves the effect of
      separating cancer cells from the blood. The supernatant with the cancer cells can further be
      isolated from the cultural system for related analysis and detection to achieve early
      diagnosis and screening.

    <measure>The Number of Circulating Cancer Cells from The Blood Sample</measure>
    <time_frame>about 1 week</time_frame>
    <description>The number of circulating cancer cells from the blood sample will be investigated. To distinguish cancer cells from blood cells for the system, the lung cancer cells were immunofluorescence stained for Cytokeratin, white blood cells were stained for CD45 and nuclei were counterstained with DAPI.</description>
