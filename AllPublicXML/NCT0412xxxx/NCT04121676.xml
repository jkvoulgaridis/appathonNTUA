    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I open-label, dose escalation study of AGEN2373, an Anti-CD137 Monoclonal
      Antibody being assessed as monotherapy in subjects with solid tumors. The study is a 3+3 dose
      escalation design and the maximum recommended starting dose (RSD) was derived from the
      minimally anticipated biological effect level (MABEL). AGEN2373 will be administered via
      continuous IV infusion on Day 1 of each 4-week cycle for up to 2 years or until disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary objectives are to assess the safety,
      tolerability, and DLT of AGEN2373 as monotherapy in subjects with advanced solid tumors and
      to determine the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D).

             screening (within 72 hours of first dose of study medication). Non-childbearing
             potential is defined as 1 of the following: a ≥45 years of age and has not had menses
             for &gt;1 year. b. Amenorrheic for &gt;2 years without a hysterectomy and oophorectomy and

             ligation.

         10. Female subjects of childbearing potential must be willing to use highly effective

        the subject. 11. Male subjects with a female partner(s) of childbearing potential must
        agree to use highly effective contraceptive measures throughout the trial starting with the
        screening visit through 90 days after the last dose of study treatment is received. Males
        with pregnant partners must agree to use a condom; no additional method of contraception is
        required for the pregnant partner.

        Note: Abstinence is acceptable if this is the established and preferred contraception
        method for the subject. 12. Willing and able to comply with the requirements of the
        protocol.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Currently participating and receiving study therapy or has participated in a study of
             an investigational agent and received study therapy or used an investigation device
             within 3 weeks of first dose of current trial treatment.

          2. Received prior systemic cytotoxic chemotherapy, biological therapy, or major surgery
             within 3 weeks prior to first dose of trial treatment. A 1-week washout is permitted
             for palliative radiation to non-central nervous system (CNS) disease, with sponsor
             approval.

          3. Received prior therapy with any anti-CD137 monoclonal antibody or agent.

          4. Persistent toxicity of National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for
             Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE) Grade &gt;1 severity that is related to prior therapy. Note:
             Sensory neuropathy or alopecia of Grade ≤2 is acceptable.

          5. Expected to require any other form of systemic or localized antineoplastic therapy
             while on trial (including maintenance therapy with another agent, radiation therapy,
             and/or surgical resection).

          6. Known severe (Grade ≥3) hypersensitivity reactions to monoclonal antibodies, antibody,
             or severe reaction to immuno-oncology agents, such as colitis or pneumonitis requiring

          7. Receiving systemic corticosteroid therapy 1 week prior to the first dose of trial
             treatment or receiving any other form of systemic immunosuppressive medication.
             Corticosteroid use as a premedication for IV contrast allergies/reactions is allowed.
             Subjects who are receiving daily corticosteroid replacement therapy are also an
             exception to this rule. Daily prednisone at doses of

             ≤7.5 mg or equivalent hydrocortisone dose are examples of permitted replacement
             therapy. Use of inhaled or topical corticosteroids is permitted.

          8. CNS tumor, metastasis(es), and/or carcinomatous meningitis identified either on the
             baseline brain imaging obtained during the screening period or identified prior to

             provided they show evidence of stable supra-tentorial lesions at screening (defined as
             2 brain images, both of which are obtained after treatment to the brain metastases and
             obtained ≥4 weeks apart). In addition, any neurologic symptoms that developed either
             as a result of the brain metastases or their treatment must have returned to baseline
             or resolved. Any steroids administered as part of this therapy must be completed ≥3
             days prior to first dose of trial medication.

          9. Active or history of autoimmune disease that requires systemic treatment within 2
             years of the start of trial treatment (i.e., with use of disease-modifying agents,
             corticosteroids, or immunosuppressive drugs). Note: Subjects with diabetes type 1,
             vitiligo, psoriasis, or hypo- or hyperthyroid disease not requiring immunosuppressive
             treatment are eligible.

             • Positive test for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) indicating active or chronic
             infection.

             Note: Patients with previous history of hepatitis B (who have cleared the infection
             and have natural immunity, i.e. hepatitis B core antibody positive cases) are excluded
             if prophylaxis against hepatitis B reactivation with antiviral agents is recommended.

             • Positive test for hepatitis C virus ribonucleic acid (HCV RNA) indicating active or
             chronic infection. Note: Subjects with positive hepatitis C antibody and negative
             hepatitis C by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) are eligible.

         14. Clinically significant (i.e., active) cardiovascular disease: cerebral vascular
             accident/stroke or myocardial infarction within 6 months of enrollment, unstable
             angina, congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association class ≥II), or serious
             uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia requiring medication.

         15. History or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality that
             might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the subject's participation
             for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of the subject to
             participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.

         16. Known psychiatric or substance abuse disorder that would interfere with cooperation
             with the requirements of the trial.

         17. Legally incapacitated or has limited legal capacity.
