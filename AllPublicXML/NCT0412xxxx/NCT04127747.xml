  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Several clinical studies have shown that rituximab is safe and effective for the induction of
      remission in moderate to severe systemic lupus erythematosus, and has been recommended by
      several guidelines for the induction of remission in refractory lupus with important organ
      involvement. However, there are few studies on the use of rituximab in the long-term
      maintenance and remission of the disease. There is no recognized scheme for the dose,
      interval and course of treatment of the drug. In this study, patients with moderate and
      severe systemic lupus erythematosus who achieved remission after standardized treatment were
      randomly divided into two groups at 1:1 and followed up every 3 months for 24 months. The
      basic situation and disease activity score of each subject were recorded. The recurrence rate
      of each observation group was calculated, the influencing factors of disease recurrence were
      analyzed, and a more reasonable drug use scheme was explored.
