      This study aimed to discover the composition on the microbiome in several sites of the human
      body; and to find out the difference in microbiome composition on ocular fluid, blood, and
      feces before and after therapy in uveitis patient with history of autoimmune disease (Behcet
      and Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada) and idiopathic uveitis

    <textblock>
      Gut microbiome has been widely studied around the globe, and it is convinced that the gut
      microbiome plays an essential role in many human diseases. In a published review showed the
      presence of microbes in blood from a patient who suffered from non-communicable disease. The
      microbes present in dormant or not-immediately-culturable states as if blood is a 'sterile'
      environment. It was argued that the difficulty of culturing microbes from the blood was
      coming from the limited understanding of suitable growth/isolation media for the microbes to
      be cultured. This limitation can be overcome by the sequenced-based methods for detecting
      non-proliferating microbes. The presence of microbes in blood also can be observed by
      ultrastructural (microscopic) methods. Through the microscopic observations, it was
      witnessing the presence of coccus and bacillus shaped bacteria that present proximity to (Red
      Blood Cell) RBCs in sample blood patients with Alzheimer's or Parkinson's Disease. The
      presence of microbes in the places other than their normal location state by term
      'atopobiosis'. The presence of microbes in blood suspected as a result of translocation
      between the gut to the blood.

      Therefore, according to the current knowledge of microbiome association and the human
      diseases, we are eager to conduct a pilot project that gives a comprehensive picture of the
      association between the microbiome and uveitis disease partially non-infectious and
      idiopathic uveitis. We will investigate microbiome profiling in the intestinal and
      extra-intestinal of uveitis patients before and after treatment to see whether any alteration
      of microbial abundance at two distinct clinical conditions partially in uveitis patients with
      history of autoimmune disease (Behcet and Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada) and idiopathic uveitis.
      Another objective of this study is to explore any pathogenic microorganism that present in
      uveitis patients samples conducted by a sequenced-based method.

    <description>The primer used in this amplicon study is targeted to 16S rRNA gene region V3-V4 to detect bacterial diversity in the samples. The sequencing will be generated by Illumina according to standard protocol. Prior filter is conducted using Prinseq-lite, then chimeric sequences remove using Usearch61 and left over the high quality reads. The (operational taxonomic unit) OTU is picked using bioinformatic tool (Quantitative Insights Into Microbial Ecology - QIIME). Taxonomic classification for de novo OTUs clustering will be generated using open source software package for bioinformatics data processing. Shanon diversity, Simpson index will be examined for calculating alpha diversity. And then we will do identification of differential abundant taxonomic groups. And do analysis correlation network between bacterial genera among two clinical condition (before and after received oral steroid) relatively to health control.</description>

    <description>In this study we are going to use IDseq Portal, a novel bioinformatics platform that designed for detection of microbes from metagenomic data. This analysis will be applied in all types samples (stool, blood, and aqueous humor). We expect to find any specific microbiome (bacterial/fungal/virus) signature in samples patient uveitis.</description>
