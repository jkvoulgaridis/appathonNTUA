  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out in the real-world setting, if darolutamide is safe
      and effective for patients diagnosed with prostate cancer that has not spread to other parts
      of the body. When a patient is enrolled to the study, his/her physician would have already
      made the decision to treat patient with darolutamide per local standard practice.
