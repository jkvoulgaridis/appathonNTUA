  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Incision and drainage (I&amp;D) is the standard guideline treatment of uncomplicated skin
      abscesses (a boil or bumo beneath the skin). Ultrasound-guided needle aspiration (USGNA) is a
      minimally invasive and less painful alternative treatment, but has not been validated as
      non-inferior to I&amp;D. Multiple studies have shown successful treatment with USGNA of breast,
      face, neck, and/or trunk abscesses in combination with oral antibiotics with success rates as
      high as 97%.

      In 2011 Gaspari et al. published a landmark article on the use of USGNA for skin abscesses.
      In this randomized controlled trial, USGNA and I&amp;D had failure rates of 74% and 20%
      respectively, which makes USGNA an unappealing treatment option. However, the study had
      several methodological issues that likely biased the results in favor of I&amp;D, including the
      following: 1) aspiration was performed with an 18-gauge needle which is often too small to
      aspirate thick purulence (or pus); 2) failure to fully aspirate all abscess contents was a
      priori defined as treatment failure rather than strictly clinical outcomes; 3) the abscess
      aspiration procedure was not standardized; and 4) post-intervention oral antibiotic therapy
      was not used on all patients.

      The main hypothesis is that a modified protocol of the Gaspari et al. USGNA study to address
      these flaws will demonstrate a failure of USGNA comparable to I&amp;D for the treatment of
      uncomplicated skin abscesses. First, the study will standardize the use of larger 14-gauge
      needle on all USGNAs. Second, USGNA intervention failure need not be defined as the inability
      to completely aspirate all abscess cavity contents under ultrasound guidance. Previous
      studies have demonstrated clinical success with USGNA of skin abscesses without applying the
      rigid failure criteria chosen by Gaspari et al. There is only one study in the literature to
      suggest that there is no correlation between a small quantity of residual abscess contents
      post-USGNA and ultimate clinical failure, however, there are no studies which specifically
      address this clinical question. In this study, initial treatment failure of USGNA will be
      defined as the inability to aspirate any purulent material. Third, treatment outcomes in this
      study will be determined by clinical resolution of abscess at the study endpoint of 7-10
      days, which is a well-established timeline for anticipated abscess healing and endpoint
      clinical follow-up. Fourth, ultrasound fellowship-trained emergency physicians will perform
      USGNA in standardized fashion on all enrolled patients. Lastly, post-intervention oral
      antibiotic with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) coverage will be provided
      and compliance closely monitored throughout the study.

Treatment failure will be defined by: fever (attributable to the infection), persistent or increased size &gt;25% of the original abscess, requiring conversion to I&amp;D (USGNA intervention group) or repeat I&amp;D (I&amp;D intervention group), requiring additional antibiotics, or requiring hospital admission within 7-10 days after treatment. Participants who either withdraw from the trial or are lost to follow-up before a determination of final outcome will be classified as treatment failure.</description>

    <description>The abscess cavity will be evaluated thoroughly with ultrasonography. The site will be prepared and draped. The skin surface will be infiltrated with local anesthetic with a 25-gauge needle. The treating clinician may provide ultrasound-guided regional anesthesia for procedural analgesia at their discretion. Incision of the skin surface with a number 11-blade scalpel will be performed over the largest area of infection; the incision will be extended into the abscess cavity. A blunt instrument will then be used to break up internal loculations if present. Repeated instrumentation through the initial incision or extension of the original incision will be performed if needed. Lastly, iodoform packing will be inserted through the incision into the cavity. The decision to send the abscess contents for microbiological culture and susceptibility analysis will be at the discretion of the treating clinician.</description>

    <description>The abscess cavity will be evaluated thoroughly with US. The site will be prepared and draped. The skin surface and anticipated needle track will be infiltrated with local anesthetic with a 25g needle. The treating clinician may provide ultrasound-guided regional anesthesia for procedural analgesia at their discretion. Under direct US-guided visualization, a 14g 2in steel needle attached to a 40mL syringe will be advanced into the abscess cavity with manual negative pressure. The needle tract will be extended obliquely 2-3 cm between the skin and abscess to prevent fistulization. Purulent material will be aspirated until no further purulence can be aspirated. Multiple aspiration attempts on the initial visit will be permitted to maximally drain the abscess cavity. Additionally, irrigation of the abscess cavity with sterile saline will be permitted to break up internal loculations if present, as has reported previously for trunk and breast abscesses.</description>
