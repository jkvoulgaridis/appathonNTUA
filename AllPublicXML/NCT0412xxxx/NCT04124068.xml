  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 30 day randomized, parallel comparative trial where participants with tooth shade
      of C2 or darker will be assigned to one of five groups. The participants will be evaluated
      for the difference in tooth shade, as determined by the digital VITA Easyshade V (provided by
      GLO) before the respective whitening regimen (baseline), immediately following the treatment
      period, and at 30 days (~4 weeks) from end of the treatment intervention.

          -  Agree not to participate in any other oral/dental product studies during the trial.

          -  Agree to delay any elective dentistry (including dental prophylaxis) until the study
             has been completed.

          -  Agree to refrain from the use of any other teeth whitening products once assigned to a
             treatment group.

          -  Agree to refrain from the use of any oral care products that may cause staining
             (chlorhexidine rinses, stannous fluoride toothpaste, etc.).

          -  Agree to return for all scheduled visits and follow study procedures.

          -  Be in good general health, as determined by the investigator/designee based on a
             review of the health history/update for participation in the study.

          -  Have at least 4 gradable maxillary anterior teeth ( canine to canine) with a Vita
             Shade average score of C2 or darker.

          -  Be willing to refrain from consuming stain-causing food and beverages (i.e., coffee,
             tea, red wine, berries, etc.) during the initial treatment duration (treatment period
             excluding the 4 week follow up).

          -  Be a current or recent non-smoker (no smoking for at least 3 months).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Are undergoing treatment for gingivitis, periodontitis, or caries.

          -  Presence of self-reported tooth sensitivity.

          -  Present with fixed orthodontic appliances on the facial surfaces of the maxillary
             arch.

          -  Have dental crowns, veneers or composite restorations on gradable maxillary anterior
             teeth ( canine to canine) or mandibular anterior teeth.

          -  Have any oral pathologies or gross neglect of home care requiring prompt treatment,
             including periodontal disease, as evidenced by purulent exudate, exposed root surfaces
             (generalized recession), tooth mobility, and/or other signs indicating that the
             integrity of the data collected for that subject might be compromised.

          -  Present with any pre-existing oral or medical condition that the Investigator/designee
             determines may place the subject at increased health risk from study participation.

          -  Have meaningful malocclusion that would impact treatment or ease of viewing/scoring
             maxillary anterior teeth.

          -  Have teeth with severe or atypical intrinsic staining, such as that caused by
             tetracycline, fluorosis or hypocalcification.

          -  Have any known allergies to over-the-counter oral hygiene/whitening products.

          -  Have any known allergies to the trial product ingredients.
