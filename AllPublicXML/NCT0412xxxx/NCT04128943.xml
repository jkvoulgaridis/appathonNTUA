  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aplastic anemia (AA) and paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) are interrelated and very
      rare diseases. Therefore, little data about clinical characteristics, especially the variety
      of symptoms in the course of the respective disease are available. As a consequence, patients
      may be left on their own between infrequent follow-ups at a specialist center. A web-based
      symptom-monitoring application can support selfmanagement and patient empowerment and
      promotes a patient- centered interdisciplinary team approach in the context of a &quot;disease
      management program&quot;. This pilot study is to investigate usability and feasibility of the
      electronic Patient-Reported Outcome (ePRO) application in AA/PNH by assessing recruitment,
      app utilization, data collection, functionality, acceptability after using and working with
      the ePRO application.

    <description>Change in quality of life assessed by the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire. The EORTC QLQ-C30 incorporates nine multi-item scales: five functional scales (Physical, Role, Cognitive, Emotional and Social Functioning); three symptom scales (Fatigue, Pain and Nausea/Vomiting); and a Global Health Status/QoL scale. Six single item scales are also included (Dyspnoea, Insomnia, Appetite Loss, Constipation, Diarrhoea and Financial Difficulties). All of the scales range in score from 0 to 100. A high score for a functional scale represents a high/healthy level of functioning whereas a high score for a symptom scale or item represents a high level of symptomatology or problems.</description>
