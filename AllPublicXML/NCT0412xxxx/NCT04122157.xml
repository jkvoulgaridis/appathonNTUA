      Summary from initial protocol

      Goal: Validation of the uncoated SL-PLUS® MIA stem within an observation study

      Study design: prospective, single-center, observational, non-comparative study

      Study population: 135 consecutive cases (uncoated SL-PLUS® MIA implants)

      Intervention (if applicable): Implantation of a total hip endoprosthesis

      Main goals/endpoints: Radiological: radiolucent lines, osteolysis, hypo- and hypertrophy of
      the cortex, loosening of the implant or migration; clinical: Harris Hip Score,
      implant-related complications, revisions; patient questionnaire (WOMAC)

      Type and extent of the risks associated with the study participation as well as benefits for
      the patient: All patients will benefit from the hip prostheses without exception. There are
      no increased risks for the patients participating in the study compared to patients who do
      not participate. Normal, necessary follow-up exams will be performed over the course of 10
      years. These follow-up exams will then be quantitatively evaluated within the scope of the
      study in accordance with a standardized protocol. Accordingly, the benefit for the patients
      from the participation in the study is currently not yet foreseeable.

    <measure>Harris Hip Score</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 10 years after implantation</time_frame>
    <description>The Harris Hip Score (HHS) is a clinician-based outcome measure frequently used for the evaluation of patients following a total hip arthroplasty.The score considers information on pain, function and range of motion. The scale ranges from 0 - 100 whereas, a higher score indicates a favorable outcome.</description>

    <measure>WOMAC Osteoarthritis Index</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 10 years after implantation</time_frame>
    <description>The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) is widely used in the evaluation of Hip and Knee Osteoarthritis. It is a self-administered questionnaire consisting of 24 items divided into 3 subscales:
Pain (5 items): during walking, using stairs, in bed, sitting or lying, and standing upright Stiffness (2 items): after first waking and later in the day Physical Function (17 items): using stairs, rising from sitting, standing, bending, walking, getting in / out of a car, shopping, putting on / taking off socks, rising from bed, lying in bed, getting in / out of bath, sitting, getting on I off toilet, heavy domestic duties, light domestic duties. The scale ranges from 0 - 100 whereas, a higher score indicates a favorable outcome.</description>
