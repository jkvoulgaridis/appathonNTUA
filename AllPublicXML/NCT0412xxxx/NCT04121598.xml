  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Specific aims are to:

        1. Assess variability in performance on state-level measures of working memory (WM)
           delivered via Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA). The investigators expect WM
           performance to vary over the course of a day across participants, and to be poorer and
           more variable among youth with overweight/obesity and loss of control (LOC) eating
           relative to overweight/obese and non-overweight controls.

        2. Investigate the relationship between state WM and eating behavior. The investigators
           expect that poorer momentary WM will predict an increased likelihood of LOC eating as
           assessed via EMA, and greater energy intake and poorer dietary quality as assessed via
           dietary recall, across participants. The investigators expect these effects to be
           strongest among youth with concomitant overweight/obesity and LOC eating.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pediatric overweight and obesity continue to represent major threats to public health. One
      cause is loss of control (LOC) eating, which involves a sense that one cannot control what or
      how much one is eating, affects up to 30% of youth with overweight/obesity, and may undermine
      weight control attempts via increased psychiatric distress, including onset of full-syndrome
      eating disorders. One methodology to explore factors underlying LOC eating is ecological
      momentary assessment (EMA), which enable examination of &quot;in the moment&quot; processes related to
      eating behavior. A neurocognitive factor implicated in LOC eating is executive functioning
      (EF; i.e., the ability to adaptively engage in ongoing, goal-oriented behavior). It is
      critical to understand the role of EF in the development of LOC eating because EF informs
      one's ability to understand and respond to emotions, and to engage in healthy weight
      regulation behaviors. In particular, working memory (WM), conceptualized as the ability to
      retain goal-relevant information when faced with distracting or irrelevant information, may
      impact regulation of eating behavior including vulnerability to LOC eating. Although WM is
      typically conceptualized as a trait-level factor, it is known to vary at the state-level as
      well, which may increase susceptibility for engaging in goal-incompatible behaviors. The
      proposed study uses EMA to characterize state-level WM and eating behavior in youth with
      overweight/obesity and LOC eating to understand how WM variations between- and
      within-subjects influence acute maladaptive eating. Participants will be 50 children, ages
      10-17, 20 of whom are overweight/obese and report LOC eating (i.e., at least 3 objectively or
      subjectively large LOC episodes in the past 3 months), 20 of whom who will serve as
      overweight/obese controls with no LOC eating, and 10 of whom are normal-weight controls with
      no LOC eating.
