  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim is to study the psychometric properties of the Spanish translation of the Clinical
      Outcomes in Routine Evaluation-Outcome Measure (CORE-OM), an instrument that measures
      psychological distress, in the Chilean population.

      To test internal consistency, test-retest stability, and discrimination, the CORE-OM is
      applied in three samples: a clinical sample (n=200) and two non-clinical samples (1.
      university students (n=400); and 2. general community (n=300)).

      Specific modalities of data collection are used for each sample. In the clinical sample, data
      is only collected at one time point. In the student and community samples, data is collected
      at two time points (i.e. baseline and retest).

      At baseline, participants are presented with the CORE-OM, the Outcome Questionnaire (OQ-45)
      and a set of sociodemographic and mental health service use items. After two weeks (i.e.
      retest) participants are presented with the CORE-OM plus an item about mental health service
      use in the last 30 days.

      Participants in the clinical sample complete the paper version of the questionnaire in the
      waiting room of the University Outpatient Clinic. The application modality in the
      non-clinical samples is mixed: students and general community participants complete paper or
      digital versions of the questionnaire in the classroom or community, respectively. The
      digital version of the questionnaire is in surveygizmo™ and can be accessed by clicking a
      Uniform Resource Locator (URL) embedded in an email/message, or by scanning a Quick Response
      (QR) code with a smartphone.

      Student and community participants are contacted via email after 2 weeks to respond the
      online retest questionnaire.

      The clinical sample is recruited at a University Outpatient Clinic in the Metropolitan Area
      of Santiago, which provides services to patients of low to medium income. Patients are
      approached by research assistants in the waiting area, before or after their
      psychotherapy/psychiatry session. Patients meeting inclusion criteria, and willing to
      participate, fill out an informed consent before responding the questionnaire. Questionnaire
      completion and responses to risk items are reviewed within 24 hours. Treating
      psychiatrists/psychologists are contacted via email when their patients respond &quot;often&quot; or
      &quot;most of the time&quot; to items signaling self-harm and thoughts of suicide (i.e. items 9, 16, 24
      and 34 of the CORE-OM or item 8 of the OQ-45).

      The student sample is recruited in the classrooms of Pontificia Universidad Católica de
      Chile. A member of the research team presents the study and invites students to participate.
      Students agreeing to participate fill out an informed consent form before completing
      paper/digital versions of the questionnaire. Any student responding &quot;often&quot; or &quot;most of the
      time&quot; to items signaling self-harm and thoughts of suicide in the CORE-OM/OQ-45 receives an
      email from the Responsible Investigator with information about the University´s counseling
      services within 24 hours.

      The general community sample is recruited using a convenience sampling method (e.g. contacts
      of research team). As in the other samples, participants sign an informed consent before
      answering the questionnaire.

      Since the non-clinical samples serve to test stability, students/general community are asked
      to provide a valid email address in order to send them an email invitation after two weeks to
      complete the CORE-OM.

    <description>A self-report questionnaire which measures general psychological distress
It consists of 34 items that assess four domains:
Well-being (W)
Problems/Symptoms (P)
Functioning (F)
Risk (R)
Each of the 34 items is scored on a 5-point scale ranging from 0 to 4. A total psychological distress score, ranging from 0 to136, can be calculated by adding all items, with higher scores indicating higher levels of psychological distress. A Well-Being dimension score, ranging from 0 to 16, can be calculated with higher scores indicating lower levels of subjective wellbeing. A Problems/Symptoms dimension score, ranging from 0 to 48, can be calculated with higher scores indicating higher levels of reported problems/distress. A Functioning dimension score, ranging from 0 to 48, can be calculated with higher scores indicating lower levels of functioning. A Risk dimension score, ranging from 0 to 24, can be calculated with higher scores indicating a greater level of risk.</description>

    <measure>Outcome Questionnaire (OQ45/OQ45.2)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>A self-report questionnaire which measures general psychological distress and is designed to monitor treatment outcomes in mental health settings.
It consists of 45 items and contains three subscales:
Symptom Distress (SD)
Interpersonal Relations (IR)
Social Role (SR)
The OQ-45 provides a total score, ranging from 0 to 180, and three subscores per subscale. Symptom Distress (SD) scores range from 0 to 100, Interpersonal Relations (IR) scores range from 0 to 44 and Social Role (SR) scores range from 0 to 36.
Higher scores reflect increased psychological distress associateed to experiencing a high number of symptoms (SD), interpersonal difficulties (IR), and/or decreased satisfaction and quality of life (SR). The clinical cut-off scores in the Chilean population are: SD=43; IR=16; SR=14 and Total Score=73.</description>
