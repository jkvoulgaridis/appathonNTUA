  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to investigate the effect of Strong and Steady (S&amp;S) group exercise
      on fall risk and physical function among community-dwelling older adults over 12 months. A
      cluster randomized stepped wedge design will be used.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The S&amp;S group exercise program builds on the Otago and FaME exercise programs which have
      shown to be effective in preventing falls. Strong and steady has been adapted to more
      functionally fit older people.

      The study period will be one year. New participants to Norwegian S&amp;S groups (within
      participating municipalities) will be randomized to sequentially receive the intervention.
      Group 1 will start in an S&amp;S group immediately after baseline testing. Group 2 will be
      followed with assessments over 3 months before they start the S&amp;S training. Assessments will
      be performed at baseline, and at 3, 6 and 12 months follow-up. All participants will continue
      to exercise till one year after baseline assessments.This means that by the end of the study
      all participants will have received the intervention. All testing will be done by trained
      physiotherapists. Participants will be sent questionnaires before the before they meet at a
      test station for testing of physical function.

    <description>The community-based group exercise program S&amp;S, with strengthening and balance exercise as the main components. The participants will attend a once-weekly, one hour supervised session. The exercises that will be used can be found in the S&amp;S handbook which includes different difficulty levels. All instructors are volunteers and have completed the S&amp;S education. Each exercise session will consist of a warm-up (5-8 min.), endurance exercises (10-15 min.), strength exercises (15 min.), balance exercises (20 min.) and a cool down/stretching (5 min.). In addition to attending the group exercises, the participants will be taught and encouraged to do home exercises twice a week from hand out leaflets that can be found at www.sterkogstodig.no.</description>
