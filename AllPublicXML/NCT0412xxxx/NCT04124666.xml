      Background &amp; Rationale:

      For years, most tumor immunotherapy researches have focused on T cell and natural killer (NK)
      cell therapies, most of which involve amplification and modification of the patient's immune
      cells for reinfusion therapy. However, for the treatment of solid tumors, there is currently
      little breakthrough. Recently, researchers have reported a colony of cancer-resistant mice
      developed from a single mouse that was immune to multiple lethal cancer cell injections.
      Further research revealed that such anti-cancer immunity can cause rapid shrinkage or
      disappearance of the tumors in other cancer-bearing mice. Interestingly, this therapeutic
      effect is due to the donor granulocytes, instead of T cells or NK cells. Infusion of
      granulocytes is a classic therapy in treating infection associated with granulocytopenia.
      Currently, clinical collection of blood components, including isolation of granulocytes, is a
      mature technique. The infusion of granulocytes is a viable anticancer therapy combining the
      classic technique and novel anticancer approach. This proposed trial will test whether
      granulocyte infusions from healthy unrelated donors can be used to treat advanced cancer. In
      the proposed trial, up to 100 Subjects with advanced cancer can be entered. Each patient will
      be given a dose of (2.0-5.0)x10^10 granulocytes from a different healthy donor every week
      over a course of 5 doses. The trial will evaluate the subject's cancer 7, 30, 90 and 180 days
      after the last infusion.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Granulocyte anti-cancer therapy refers to a method in which healthy donor granulocytes with
      high cancer-killing activity are collected and infused into a specific cancer patient by
      matching, to achieve the therapeutic anticancer effect. In this proposed trial, up to 100
      Subjects with advanced cancer can be entered. Potentially hundreds of healthy
      Donor-participants will be recruited. First, granulocyte donors will be identified via
      in-vitro assay of Cancer Killing Activity (CKA), which screens healthy Donor-participants for
      those with anticancer activity of more than 80%. Secondly, after donor-recipient blood
      matching, (2.0-5.0)x10^10 granulocytes will be collected from each donor, accounting for
      about 1/10 of the human body. Each patient will be given a dose of (2.0-5.0)x10^10
      granulocytes from a different donor per week over a course of 5 doses (with an ideal total
      infusion of 2X10^11 granulocytes). After each infusion, the patients will be monitored
      carefully for possible adverse events. If adverse events occur, the infusion can be slowed
      down or stopped until the adverse events can be managed. The trial will observe the subject's
      cancer 7, 30, 90 and 180 days after the last infusion. Target lesions, non-target lesions,
      and new lesions will be evaluated via medical imaging and tumor markers. The responses will
      be compared against the measurements at baseline.
