    <textblock>
      Hip fractures are an increasing public health concern as the population continues to age. The
      increased morbidity and mortality in the 12-month period after hip fracture is largely
      related to decreased mobility. However, very few studies have analyzed the radiographic
      factors associated with gait impairment after intertrochanteric hip fractures. This study
      evaluates gait and mobility after surgical fixation of IT fractures in elderly population
      with Gait Analysis in combination with clinical and radiographic information.

      Hip fractures are an increasing public health concern as the population continues to age. The
      increased morbidity and mortality in the 12-month period after hip fracture is largely
      related to decreased mobility. However, very few studies have analyzed the radiographic
      factors associated with gait impairment after InterTrochanteric (IT) hip fractures. Improving
      gait and mobility after surgical fixation of IT fractures is one important target of research
      efforts.

      All the patients with IT hip fractures (AO/OTA 31) treated between October 2017 and April
      2018 were enrolled. Inclusion criteria consisted of age older than 65 years, previous walking
      ability, no neurological disease and no other musculoskeletal disorders. The study was
      approved by the institutional review board of the Local Ethical Committee (reference number
      5559). All patients provided written informed consent for participation in the study.

      All patients were treated with intramedullary nailing (IMN) or hemiarthroplasty (HA)
      according to the current international guidelines and to their clinical history.

      Radiographs were analyzed at the time of surgery and at each follow-up visit. Clinical
      outcomes were assessed according to the Harris Hip Score (HHS) and Western Ontario and Mc
      Master University (WOMAC).

      At 6- and 12-months follow-up appointments, gait parameters were measured and recorded in our
      Gait Analysis Laboratory (BTS Bioengineering SpA, Italy) located in AOUC Policlinico di Bari
      (Rehabilitation Unit). All participants performed several walking trials at their natural
      speed. All patients were fitted with full-body external reflective markers placed according
      to Davis' procedures. A static video trial was recorded with subjects positioned in a neutral
      standing posture to create a reference for defining neutral joint angles.

      In addition, at 12-months follow-up, dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) has been acquired
      in order to collect T-score data.

      Statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS version 23. A p value of &lt;0.05 was
      considered to be statistically significant.

    <description>Harris Hip Score gives a maximum of 100 points. Pain receives 44 points, function 47 points, range of motion 5 points, and deformity 4 points. Function is subdivided into activities of daily living (14 points) and gait (33 points). The higher the HHS, the less dysfunction.</description>

    <description>Western Ontario and Mc Master University Scale evaluates the condition of patients with osteoarthritis of the knee and hip, including pain, stiffness, and physical functioning of the joints. The scores for each subscale are summed up, with a possible score range of 0-20 for Pain, 0-8 for Stiffness, and 0-68 for Physical Function. The higher the score, the poorer the function. Therefore, an improvement was achieved by reducing the overall score.</description>

    <time_frame>12- months</time_frame>
    <description>T-score is the relevant measure when screening for osteoporosis extracted from Dual energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA). It is the bone mineral density (BMD) at the site when compared to the young normal reference mean. A T-score between +1 and −1 is considered normal or healthy. A T-score between −1 and −2.5 indicates that you have low bone mass, although not low enough to be diagnosed with osteoporosis. A T-score of −2.5 or lower indicates that you have osteoporosis. The greater the negative number, the more severe the osteoporosis.</description>

    <description>Most intertrochanteric fractures are managed with an intramedullary nail, which allows for impaction at the fracture site. The intramedullary nail is placed directly into the marrow canal of the bone through an opening made at the top of the greater trochanter. A lag screw is then placed through the nail and up into the neck and head of the hip. As with the compression hip screw, sliding of the lag screw and impaction of the fracture take place.</description>

    <description>In the older patient, the chance that the head of the femur is damaged in this way is higher. It is generally felt that for these displaced fractures, patients will do better if some of the components of the hip are replaced. In some cases, this can mean a replacement of the ball, or head of the femur (hemiarthroplasty).</description>
