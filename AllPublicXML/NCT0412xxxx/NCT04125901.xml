  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Musculoskeletal pain can affect up to 40% of children and adolescents. Neck pain (NP) is one
      of the most prevalent painful conditions and evidence suggests that its prevalence has
      increased in recent decades in adolescents aged 16 to 18 years, from 22.9% in 1991 to 29.5%
      in 2011. Interventions based on pain neuroscience education have emerged as promising
      strategies in chronic pain conditions.In adults this intervention has been explored in many
      pain conditions, including musculoskeletal pain, but there is only one pilot study in
      adolescents with chronic NP and one case study in adolescents with fibromyalgia.

      Thus, the main objective of the present study is:

      (i) To compare the effectiveness of an education program based on pain neuroscience education
      and exercise versus exercise alone, in decreasing pain intensity in secondary school students
      with chronic and idiopathic NP immediately after the intervention and at 6 months.

      The secondary objectives are to:

      i) Compare the effectiveness of these programs immediately after the intervention and at 6
      months in i) disability, ii) sleep, iii) pain catastrophizing, iv) fear of movement, v)
      self-efficacy, vi) central sensitization vii) the strength of the deep neck flexors and
      extensors muscles and stabilizers of the scapula; and viii) the pressure pain threshold
      between the two intervention groups;

      ii) Explore possible predictors of response to treatment.

      It is anticipated that the sample will consist of 140 participants from four secondary
      schools that will be divided into two groups. Both groups will receive an exercise-based
      intervention. The experimental group will receive, besides exercise, an intervention based on
      pain neuroscience education. The intervention will consist of 1 session per week during 8
      weeks and will be applied in small groups.

      In the experimental group 4 the exercise sessions will be performed at school, incorporated
      into physical education classes and 4 will be performed at home, supported by videos. In the
      control group, which will only performed exercise, each participant will participate in 5
      presential group sessions at school and the remaining 3 sessions will be performed at home.

      Participants will be assessed, by online questionnaires, for sociodemographic aspects, pain
      characterization and physical activity level, disability, sleep, catastrophizing, fear of
      movement, self-efficacy, central sensitization and knowledge on pain neurophysiology.

    <description>Participants will received an 8 week intervention consisting of pain neuroscience education and exercise. Pain neuroscience education will be conducted in line with international guidelines and will address the following topics: pain neurophysiology, nociception and nociceptive pathways, inhibition and spinal cord stimulation, peripheral and central sensitization, nervous system plasticity and the impact of variables such as stress, anxiety, sleep and exercise on pain behavior. Exercise will be performed in accordance with international guidelines for chronic NP. Motor control, resistance and strengthening exercises will be performed for the neck and scapulo-thoracic region.</description>
