        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Males and/or females over age 18.

          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed advanced or metastatic solid tumor for which
             no established standard therapy is available.

          -  At least one measurable lesion by CT or MRI according to RECIST1.1, which is not in
             irradiated area (only for expansion phase).

          -  Recovered from toxicities of prior anti-cancer treatment to Grade 1 or less (in case
             of alopecia, Grade 2 is acceptable).

          -  Life expectancy of at least 3 months.

          -  Female participants of child bearing potential agree not to be pregnant or lactating
             during the study and for three months following the last dose of study drug. Both men
             and women of reproductive potential must agree to use a highly effective method of
             birth control during the study and for three months following the last dose of study
             drug. A highly effective method of contraception is defined as one that results in a
             low failure rate, i.e., less than 1% per year, when used consistently and correctly.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Laboratory values not within the Protocol-defined range.

          -  Cardiac disease with New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class III or IV, including
             congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction within 6 months prior to the trial
             entry, unstable arrhythmia, or symptomatic peripheral arterial vascular disease.

          -  Previously treated malignancies other than the current disease, except for adequately
             treated non-melanoma skin cancer, in situ cancer, or other cancer from which the
             subject has been disease-free for at least 5 years at the trial entry.

          -  Active, uncontrolled bacterial, viral, or fungal infections, requiring systemic
             therapy.

          -  Major surgery, other than diagnostic surgery, within 4 weeks prior to the trial entry,
             without complete recovery.

          -  Medical history of difficulty swallowing, malabsorption or other chronic
             gastrointestinal disease, or conditions that may hamper compliance and/or absorption
             of the tested product.

          -  Anti-cancer treatment with radiation therapy, surgery, chemotherapy, targeted
             therapies (erlotinib, lapatinib, etc.), hormone therapy, or immunotherapy within 4
             weeks (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or Mitomycin C) prior to trial entry.

          -  Known infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B, or hepatitis C.

          -  History of upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage, peptic ulcer disease, or bleeding
             diathesis.

          -  History of organ allograft, autologous stem cell transplantation, or allogeneic stem
             cell transplantation.

          -  Concomitant disease or condition that could interfere with the conduct of the trial,
             or that would, in the opinion of the Investigator, pose an unacceptable risk to the
             subject in this trial.
