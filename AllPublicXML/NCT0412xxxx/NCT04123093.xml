      This study is a prospective, interventional, non-randomized study designed to assess the
      safety and efficacy of the Noxsano Bandage (study device) in healthy subjects and wound care
      subjects with a diabetic lower extremity ulceration and/or arterial insufficiency lower
      extremity ulceration.

    <description>Wound care subjects will have weekly study device (Noxsano Bandage) applications to a specific ulceration. For subjects that exhibit any reduction in wound surface area, this application will occur until the wound is healed, or for up to 3 months (whichever occurs first). For subjects that do not exhibit any reduction in wound size at 2 months, application will stop and standard treatment protocols will be pursued. At the conclusion of the treatment window (up to 3 months), subjects will be followed every 3 months for 12 consecutive months for observation of late side effects or adverse reactions (3 months of active treatment, 12 months of follow-up observation, 15 months total).</description>
