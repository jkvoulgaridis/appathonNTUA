    <masking_description>Data will be collected in an observer-blind manner. In an observer-blind study, the subject and the site and sponsor personnel involved in the clinical evaluation of the subjects are blinded while other study personnel may be aware of the intervention assignment. The laboratory in charge of the sample testing will be blinded to the intervention assignment, codes will be used to link the subject and study (without any link to the intervention attributed to the subject) to each sample. Investigators will remain blinded to each subject's assigned study intervention throughout the course of the study.</masking_description>

             has been explained according to local regulatory requirements, and before any study

             (consistent with local regulations / guidelines) either:

               -  include consent for both the maternal subject's participation and participation
                  of the infant after the infant's birth, or

               -  include consent for the maternal subject's participation and expressed
                  willingness to consider permitting the infant to take part after the infant's
