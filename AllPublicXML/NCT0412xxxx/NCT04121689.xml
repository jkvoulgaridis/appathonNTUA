  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The anabolic action of 'fast' whey protein on the regulation of postprandial muscle protein
      synthesis has been established to be short-lived in healthy young adults. Our aim was assess
      the time course of anabolic signaling events and stimulation of muscle protein synthesis
      rates (MPS) after ingestion of a food source that represents a more typical meal-induced
      pattern of aminoacidemia, namely milk protein concentrate, in healthy young males.

    <description>Myofibrillar protein synthesis rates will be assessed during the postabsorptive period for 3 hours, and every 1-2 hours during the 5 hours after protein ingestion. This will allow us assess the timecourse of muscle protein synthesis after eating.</description>

    <time_frame>8 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Phosphorylation of anabolic signaling pathways (mTORC1, AKT, and P70S6K) involved in the stimulation of myofibrillar protein synthesis rates will be assessed during the postabsorptive period for 3 hours, and every 1-2 hours during the 5 hours after protein ingestion.</description>

    <description>Dietary derived phenylalanine availability will be measured during the 5 h postprandial phase to determine its relationship with the fractional synthesis rates of myofibrillar protein and phosphorylation of muscle anabolic signaling</description>

    <description>Seven young men (age: 22Â±1 y) will undergo repeated blood and biopsy sampling during primed continuous L-[ring-2H5]phenylalanine and L-[1-13C]leucine tracer infusions, and ingested 38 g of L-[1-13C]phenylalanine- and L-[1-13C]leucine-labeled milk protein concentrate</description>

    <description>The macronutrient composition and energy of the milk protein beverage provided to participants is 38 g protein (3.46 g leucine), 4.17 g carbohydrate, and 1.4 g fat. The milk protein met all chemical and bacteriologic specifications for human consumption. The L-[1-13C]phenylalanine and L-[1-13C]leucine enrichments in the milk protein concentrate averaged 38.3 and 10.8 mole percent excess (MPE), respectively.</description>
