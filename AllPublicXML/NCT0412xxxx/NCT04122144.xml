  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The ENHANCED -SPS study is a before and after cluster randomized trial that will be conducted
      in 14 public health facilities providing HIV care in Southwestern Uganda. The study will
      evaluate the effectiveness of a multi-component intervention package that targets barriers to
      achieving optimal viral suppression among pregnant and postpartum women infected with HIV.
      This will be in two phases; In Phase 1 (&quot;Before&quot;), all 14 clinics will have a baseline
      assessment of standard of care VL procedures and assess the barriers and facilitators to
      viral suppression for a period of 3 months. In Phase 2 (&quot;After&quot;), 7 clinics randomized to
      control arm will continue to experience standard of care counseling procedures, and 7 clinics
      randomized to intervention will initiate the ENHANCE-PS intervention. The Phase 2 (&quot;After&quot;)
      phase I will last at least 12 months.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Investigators will test the hypothesis that the Enhanced viral load (VL) counseling and
      standardized peer mother support (ENHANCED-SPS) intervention will increase viral load
      suppression among HIV-infected pregnant and post-partum women and increase retention of
      mothers in care hence resulting in reduced risk of vertical transmission in south western
      Uganda.

      Specific objectives are as follows:

      1) To evaluate the effectiveness of an enhanced VL counseling and standardized peer mother
      support intervention on viral suppression among HIV infected pregnant women at 12 months of
      follow up; 2) To evaluate the effect of the enhanced counseling and peer support intervention
      on retention in care at 18 months postpartum follow up; The investigators will randomize 14
      HIV clinics to the ENHANCED-SPS multi-component intervention vs. standard of care procedures
      (intervention=7 clinics and control=7 clinics,n=70 mothers/health facility) ;3) To assess the
      facilitators and barriers of VL and enhanced VL counseling and peer mother support
      intervention at 9 &amp; 18 months of follow up.This will consider both patient and providers
      perspectives of the intervention implementation
