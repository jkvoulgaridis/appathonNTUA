  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if a sustainable non-elemental diet can be used as
      a probiotic tool to alter the dysbiotic microbiome found in individuals with ulcerative
      colitis and thereby decrease disease activity.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The etiology of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including ulcerative colitis (UC), is
      complex and poorly understood, but the current hypothesis is that IBD arises from an aberrant
      immune response to commensal bacteria in a genetically susceptible host, and is triggered by
      environmental factors. Environmental factors such as the microbiome and diet, play a
      significant role in the risk of IBD. Diet has been identified as one of the main drivers of
      the microbiome composition and the microbiome and diet can work in tandem to affect host
      physiology.

      In spite of patient interest in diet and numerous diet studies, currently there is no diet
      that is clinically validated or universally agreed upon for adult IBD patients. We also lack
      rigorous studies to show how the microbiome is influenced by diet and affects patient
      outcomes.

      We propose to use a sustainable non-elemental diet aimed at altering the microbiome in
      patients with mild to moderately active UC to alter their disease activity.
