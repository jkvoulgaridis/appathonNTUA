    <textblock>
      This study is intended to include 20 patients with esophageal varices caused by liver
      cirrhosis who were admitted to the first affiliated hospital of nanjing medical university
      from May 2019, and randomly select 8 patients with gastric polyps as the control
      group.General clinical data, imaging data, endoscopic data and laboratory indicators were
      collected.Electrogastrogram (EGG) and Heart Rate Variability (HRV) were performed before and
      24 hours after operation in patients with cirrhotic esophageal varices, and the dyspepsia
      scale was filled out.Electrogastrogram (EGG) and cardiac variability (HRV) were performed in
      patients with gastric polyps 24 hours before and after surgery, and the dyspepsia scale was
      filled.EGG uses the surface electrode to record gastric myoelectric activity, and evaluates
      the patient's gastric rhythm by normal slow wave ratio, overspeed ratio, overslow ratio, and
      rhythm disorder ratio.The HRV evaluates the balance state of the patient's autonomic nervous
      system with High Frequency (HF)/Low Frequency (LF).SPSS software was used for paired sample
      analysis of experimental results.
