  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a common disease with an incidence of 1-2/1000 persons per
      year. VTE is a chronic disease with a considerable risk of recurrence. Patients with
      unprovoked VTE, i.e. VTE in the absence of a temporary risk factor including surgery, cancer
      or immobilisation, have a high recurrence risk and indefinite anticoagulation is generally
      recommended. The recurrence risk of patients with VTE provoked by a transient risk factor is
      regarded as low. Discontinuation of anticoagulation after three months is recommended because
      the benefit of reducing the recurrence risk further by prolonged anticoagulation is
      outweighed by the bleeding risk. However, the newer direct oral anticoagulants are
      potentially associated with a lower bleeding risk than vitamin K antagonists. Because they
      are also meanwhile widely available and are convenient there is a trend towards prolonging
      anticoagulation also in patients with a VTE after a transient provoking factor. However, the
      definition of transient provoking factors is imprecise and a distinct categorization
      according to the risk of recurrence is lacking. Preliminary evidence suggests that the
      recurrence risk varies considerably between the different transient provoking factors. In a
      prospective cohort study, the investigators will include patients with a deep vein thrombosis
      or pulmonary embolism provoked by a transient risk factor defined according to Guidance of
      the Scientific and Standardization Committee of the International Society on Thrombosis and
      Haemostasis (Kearon et al., J Thromb Haemost 2016; 14: 1480-3) after discontinuation of
      anticoagulation. The study endpoint is recurrent symptomatic VTE.
