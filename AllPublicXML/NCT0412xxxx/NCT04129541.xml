  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and acceptability of same-day discharge
      after surgery for pelvic floor disorders. The study hypotheses are that same-day discharge
      after reconstructive pelvic surgery is safe and improves patient satisfaction when compared
      to overnight hospitalization.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized clinical trial comparing same day discharge and overnight
      hospitalization after reconstructive pelvic surgery. Patients who are scheduled to undergo
      surgery for pelvic organ prolapse (POP) and/or stress urinary incontinence (SUI) will be
      recruited at their preoperative visit. Patients will be counseled regarding the existing
      evidence demonstrating the safety of same day discharge after hysterectomy and pelvic floor
      reconstructive surgery. Eligible patients who provide consent will be randomized to same day
      discharge or overnight hospitalization following surgery.

      Patients will receive routine care during their admission for surgery. A standard voiding
      trial will be performed in the Post-Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU) for all patients. Patients in
      the planned same day discharge (SDD) cohort will be discharged from the PACU once they meet
      standard discharge criteria. If the patients require unplanned hospitalization (UH), the
      reason for hospitalization will be noted. Patients in the planned overnight hospitalization
      (OH) group will be discharged on post-operative day 1 once they meet standard discharge
      criteria.

      At their postoperative office visit, all patients will complete surveys evaluating patient
      satisfaction. Demographic, surgical, and hospital admission data will be collected from the
      medical record. Information will also be collected regarding any complications, emergency
      department (ED) visits, unplanned office visits, readmissions, and reoperations within 8
      weeks after surgery.

    <measure>Change in Quality of Recovery Score</measure>
    <time_frame>6 to 8 weeks after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of recovery will be assessed using the Quality of Recovery-15 (QoR-15) at baseline, 48 hours postop, and 6-8 weeks postop. The QoR-15 consists of 15 questions scored on a 0 to 10 scale, maximum score 150. Higher scores indicate good recovery after surgery while lower scores indicate poor recovery.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>6 to 8 weeks after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Patient satisfaction will be assessed using the Patient Global Impression of Improvement (PGI-I) at 6-8 weeks postop. The PGI-I consists of 1 question scored 1-7, with lower number indicating better global improvement.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Safety Measures: frequency of post operative complications</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 8 weeks after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Safety will be measured by the frequency of post operative complications, this will include counts of emergency department visits, readmissions, and reoperations; as well as frequency of any unplanned office visits and phone calls within 8 weeks after surgery.</description>

    <measure>Pelvic Floor Distress (baseline)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Pelvic floor distress will be assessed using the Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory (PFDI-20) summary score at baseline and 6-8 weeks postop. The PFDI-20 consists of 20 questions scored on a 0 to 4 scale, divided into three scales consisting of 6, 8, and 6 questions each. For scoring, the mean value is obtained for each scale (0-4) and multiplied by 25 to obtain the scale score (0-100). The summary PFDI score is the sum of the three scale scores (0-300). Higher score indicates higher distress from pelvic floor disorder symptoms.</description>

    <description>Pelvic floor impact will be assessed using the Pelvic Floor Impact Questionnaire (PFIQ-7) at baseline and 6-8 weeks postop. The PFIQ-7 consists of 21 questions scored on a 0 to 3 scale, divided into three scales consisting of 7 questions each. For scoring, the mean value is obtained for each scale (0-3) and multiplied by 100/3 to obtain the scale score (0-100). The summary PFIQ score is the sum of the three scale scores (0-300). Higher score indicates higher impact of pelvic floor disorders on activities, relationships, and feelings.</description>
