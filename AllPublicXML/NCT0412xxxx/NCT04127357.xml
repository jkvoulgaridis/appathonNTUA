      Objective: To verify the progression of active microcavitated carious lesions on occlusal
      surfaces of primary molars after the orientation of the brushing technique associated with
      fluoride dentifrice compared to resin sealant, through a 12-month randomized clinical trial.
      Methodology: We selected 22 children from 4 to 9 years old from the public school system of
      the city of Juazeiro do Norte-Cear√°, with at least one primary molar presenting an active
      caries lesion score 3 of the International Caries Detection and Assessment System (ICDAS).
      Randomization was performed en bloc and stratified by two conditions (age and caries
      experience). The selected teeth were divided into two groups: the first (G1) was submitted to
      brushing with fluoridated toothpaste; and the other group (G2) to the resin sealing
      technique, whose application of the material was performed under absolute or relative
      isolation, selected through a second randomization. The molars undergoing treatment were
      evaluated at 6- and 12-month returns. Caries progression was evaluated according to the type
      of treatment, dental group and sealant retention by the Chi-square test. For cost analysis,
      the variance test (ANOVA) was used.

    <measure>Direct cost estimate</measure>

    <description>To estimate costs, the sessions were timed (initial and reevaluations) and for each consultation a table was filled in, which should contain the quantities of materials used per session. Prices of materials were considered by inferring the market value obtained by an average of 3 (three) different places that market the products in question, thus obtaining different costs for the proposed treatments.</description>

    <description>After randomization of the children, the selected molars were allocated through a randomized sequence list in 2 groups: A. Brushing with 1450 ppm fluoride toothpaste, donated by the researcher; B. Resin Sealing (FluroShield, Dentsply, Brazil).
The teeth included in the second group (group B) underwent a second randomization: B1. With absolute isolation; B2. With relative isolation. For the group with absolute isolation, topical anesthesia and local papillary infiltration were performed for subsequent staple placement. Relative isolation was performed with cotton rollers and moisture control suction. The sealant selected was the opaque fluroshield to facilitate visualization upon visual examination during reevaluations and was applied following the manufacturer's standards. The teeth were clinically and radiographically followed at 6 and 12 months and two sessions of motivation reinforcement were performed through video and brush change at 3 and 9 months.</description>
