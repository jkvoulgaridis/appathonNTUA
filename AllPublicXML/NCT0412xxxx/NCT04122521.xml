  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate whether MRI can be used to predict genomics and prognosis in
      glioma. Given the profound prognostic significance of genetic mutations seen in glioma, there
      have been increasing attempts to correlate imaging characteristics with genetic, mutational
      and expression patterns. To be able to predict genomics and prognosis based on imaging alone
      will prove useful in patients with involvement of glioma in delicate areas of the brain and
      better reflect tumor and molecular heterogeneity.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Previous studies have proposed certain imaging characteristics correlating with genetic,
      molecular and expression patterns. Advanced imaging provides additional clues but no studies
      have examined its added value particularly in a prospective setting. The investigator's aim
      to evaluate preoperative MRI for patients suspected of glioma to predict IDH mutation, 1p19q
      codeletion, MGMT methylation and EGFR mutation status using imaging characteristics such as
      margin, patterns of contrast enhancement and edema as well as diffusion and perfusion
      characteristics. This will be confirmed pathologically and further correlated with patients'
      long term outcome.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients suspected of glioma undergoing MRI examination prior to surgery

          -  MRI including advanced imaging such as cerebral blood volume, apparent diffusion
             coefficient and amide proton transfer imaging

          -  Signed informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pathologic confirmation as tumors other than glioma

          -  Patients who have any type of bioimplant activated by mechanical, electronic, or
             magnetic means (e.g., cochlear implants, pacemakers, neurostimulators, biostimulates,
             electronic infusion pumps, etc), because such devices may be displaced or malfunction
