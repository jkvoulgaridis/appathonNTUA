  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is prospective Cohort study which was performed in multicenter (General Hospital)
      in Korea. Inclusion criteria is patients with atrial fibrillation taking Elxaban (generic
      drug of apixaban) who visit hospital. The purpose is to analyze bleeding (major bleeding,
      minor bleeding), stroke, systemic embolism, death, other clinical events (acute myocardial
      infarction, pulmonary embolism, transient ischemic attack, hospitalization), drug adherence,
      questionnaire of life quality (AFEQT), cognitive function (KDSQ) according to the use of
      Elxaban.

    <description>AFEQT is a validated questionnaire that was patient derived with expert clinical input, and is easy to use format with 20 questions on a seven point Likert scale. AFEQT evaluates Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) across three domains
Symptoms - Four questions specifically targeted to assess AF related symptoms
Daily Activities - Eight questions that evaluate daily function in AF patients
Treatment Concerns - Six questions that assess AF treatment concerns in patients
Scoring key provides information on how to score the questionnaire and explains how to interpret results. The scoring key provides the following scores:•Overall AFEQT Score (18 questions) •Treatment Satisfaction Score (2 questions)</description>
