  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the effects of eight-weeks home-based Pilates on symptoms of
      anxiety, depression, and fatigue among people with Multiple Sclerosis. Half of participants
      will perform two weekly home-based Pilates sessions guided by a DVD, while the other half
      will maintain their regular daily activities.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a home-based, single blind, randomised, controlled trial comparing
      immediate-start home-based Pilates with a delayed-start control group. The study protocol was
      approved by the University Research Ethics Committee. Participants will provide written
      informed consent prior to testing. The home-based setting promotes national recruitment of
      participants through the MS Society of Ireland, via distribution of posters and participation
      information leaflets on social media and text alerts to members. Interested participants will
      be invited to contact the lead researcher via phone or email, who will answer any
      study-related questions. Potential participants will be screened for selection criteria over
      the phone and provided with Participant Information Sheet (PIS), informed consent, Physical
      Activity Readiness Questionnaire (PAR-Q), and Patient Determined Disease Steps (PDDS) form
      via post or email. Following screening and initial baseline testing, eligible participants
      will be randomized to immediate-start home-based Pilates, or delayed-start control, by an
      independent researcher who will not be involved in outcome assessments, using a
      computer-generated randomisation tool (www.randomizer.org). The Home-based Pilates group will
      perform two weekly sessions for eight weeks, completed with at least 48-hours between
      sessions, in their own home, supported by a DVD developed and previously implemented and
      evaluated by the lead researcher in a feasibility trial among people with Multiple Sclerosis.
      The instructor on the DVD is a certified Pilates Instructor. Each participant will receive
      documented details of the Pilates protocol, along with the DVD which will operate on a DVD
      player or participant's laptop computer. On activating the DVD, participants will be provided
      with an opening screen, offering four options to choose from; &quot;Play all&quot; plays the entire
      contents of the DVD from start to finish; &quot;Warm Up&quot;, provides introductory teaching points on
      the core principles of Pilates along with teaching and demonstration of the Pilates' warm-up
      exercises; &quot;Main Phase&quot; provides demonstrations and key teaching points of the fourteen
      Pilates exercise routine, and &quot;Post Stretch&quot; demonstrates and teaches the post-stretch
      exercises. Each Pilates session will last approximately one hour and is comprised of seven
      Pilates warm-up exercises and fourteen mat-based beginner's level exercise. Four repetitions
      of each Pilates movement will be performed during sessions in the first two weeks, with
      intensity being self-regulated by the participant based on level of physical condition.
      Repetitions will gradually progress at biweekly intervals, resulting in ten repetitions being
      performed for the final two weeks of the trial (Weeks 7 and 8). Six post-training stretches
      will be maintained for a minimum of thirty seconds. Fidelity, adherence, dose and compliance
      shall be monitored via self-report exercise diaries containing session date, number of
      repetitions completed per exercise, and session RPE (Rate of perceived exertion), recorded by
      the participant immediately following session completion. Exercise diaries will be
      supplemented by a weekly telephone call consisting of direct questions about the frequency,
      intensity, and duration of the Pilates they have completed and whether they have experienced
      difficulties with exercise completion, any adverse events or relapses.

      The Delayed-Start Control group be instructed to maintain their pre-intervention physical
      activity levels during the trial and will be contacted by the lead researcher by email or
      telephone to ensure timely completion of the on-line outcome assessments at biweekly
      intervals. Following the 8-week intervention, Delayed-Start participants will be provided
      with the Pilates DVD for their own use, but no data will be collected. For both groups,
      participants who experience a relapse will be immediately withdrawn from the study, which
      will be recorded by the lead researcher.

    <measure>Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The 21-item MFIS is a recommended core outcome measure in exercise studies in people with Multiple Sclerosis, that measures physical, cognitive and psychosocial components of fatigue. Participants respond to &quot;how often fatigue has affected you in this way during the past 4 weeks&quot;, using a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (Never) to 4 (Almost Always). Physical subscale scores range from 0 to 36, Cognitive from 0 to 40, and Psychosocial from 0 to 8. Total MFIS scores (0 to 84), is computed by summing physical, cognitive, and psychosocial subscale scores, with a higher score indicating greater impact of fatigue on participant activities. A total fatigue cut-off score of ≥38 distinguishes between fatigued and non-fatigued individual. It has been proposed by the Multiple Sclerosis Council for Clinical Practice Guidelines as a reliable assessment tool of perceived fatigue (1998), with excellent test-retest reliability, and good correlation with the Fatigue Severity Scale.</description>

    <description>This is a self-report measure of physical activity in persons with multiple sclerosis. Its validity is well established in MS, and it is sensitive to change following active interventions. Frequency of strenuous (e.g., running or jogging), moderate (e.g., fast walking, easy swimming), and mild (e.g., easy walking) exercise performed for more than 15 minutes during leisure time over a usual week was recorded. Total weekly leisure activity scores were calculated as follows, (strenuous x 9) + (moderate x 5) + (mild x 3). Scores (&gt;=24) indicate activity levels to provide substantial benefits towards overall health contribution.</description>

    <description>This group will perform two weekly sessions of Pilates for eight weeks, completed with at least 48-hours between sessions, in their own home, supported by a DVD developed and previously implemented and evaluated by the lead researcher in a feasibility trial among people with Multiple Sclerosis. Each Pilates session will last approximately one hour and is comprised of seven Pilates warm-up exercises and fourteen mat-based beginner's level exercise. Four repetitions of each Pilates movement will be performed during sessions in the first two weeks, with intensity being self-regulated by the participant based on level of physical condition. Repetitions will gradually progress at biweekly intervals, resulting in ten repetitions being performed for the final two weeks of the trial (Weeks 7 and 8). Six post-training stretches will be maintained for a minimum of thirty seconds.</description>

    <description>Participants randomized to Delayed-start will be instructed to maintain their pre-intervention physical activity levels during the trial and will be contacted by the lead researcher by email or telephone to ensure timely completion of the on-line outcome assessments at biweekly intervals. Following the 8-week intervention, Delayed start participants will be provided with the Pilates DVD for their own use, but no data will be collected. For both groups, participants who experience a relapse will be immediately withdrawn from the study, which will be recorded by the lead researcher.</description>
