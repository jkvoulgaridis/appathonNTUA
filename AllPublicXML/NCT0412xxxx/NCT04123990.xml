  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite its known prevalence in IBD, a recent study conducted with Prof. Cacoub (unpublished)
      on the national health insurance database showed that iron deficiency was an under-diagnosed
      and under-treated co-morbidity. In chronic diseases including IBD, Transferrin Saturation
      Factor is only performed in approximately 10% of cases, whereas it is recommended in
      inflammatory situations including IBD patients (HAS 2011).

      The objective of this study is therefore to obtain updated French data on the prevalence of
      iron deficiency in patients with IBD by applying the recommendations of ECCO and French
      Health High Authority (determination of ferritinemia and Transferrin Saturation Factor)
