  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lingual microcystic lymphatic malformations (LMLMs) are rare congenital vascular
      malformations, presenting as clusters of cysts filled with lymph fluid or blood. They are
      responsible for a heavy burden even with small well-limited lesions because of oozing,
      bleeding, infections, or even speech, chewing or breathing impairment. Pain and aesthetic
      prejudice are also frequently reported. The natural history of LMLMs is progressive
      worsening. LMLMs complex management requires multidisciplinary care in specialised centres,
      and the &quot;wait-and-see&quot; approach is frequently used. In complicated lymphatic malformations,
      whatever the location, treatment with oral sirolimus, an mTOR (mammalian Target of Rapamycin)
      inhibitor, is often used.

      Topical sirolimus is a known effective treatment for some cutaneous conditions such as
      angiofibromas in tuberous sclerosis. Topical applications of sirolimus on the buccal mucosae
      have been reported in erosive lichen planus and oral pemphigus vulgaris with good tolerance
      and none to slight detectable blood sirolimus concentrations.

      The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a 1mg/mL sirolimus
      solution applied once daily on mild to moderate lingual microcystic lymphatic malformation in
      children and adults after 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 and 24 weeks of treatment as compared to usual
      care (no treatment).

      This is a randomized, open-labelled, multicenter pilot study using an individually randomized
      stepped wedge design over a 24 weeks period to evaluate topical application of 1 mg/mL
      sirolimus solution, 0.5 mL to 1 mL according to the size of the lesion, once daily, on
      lingual microcystic lymphatic malformation that do not require systemic treatment, the
      experimental intervention versus usual care (no treatment), the control condition.

      In this design, subjects are included in a cohort where at a randomized time (W0, W4, W8 or
      W12), they switch from an observational period to the interventional period.

      All subjects will be followed for 24 weeks
