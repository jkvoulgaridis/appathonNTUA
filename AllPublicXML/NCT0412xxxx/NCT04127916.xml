    <textblock>
      This study with retrospective data collection does not entail sample size calculation. The
      study will involve patients who received bendamustine + rituximab for relapsed/refractory
      mantle cell lymphoma and meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria at each participating study
      site. Considering the incidence of mantle cell lymphoma in Korea and the number of
      participating sites, the expected sample size is approximately 40.

      1. Inclusion criteria : Patients newly diagnosed with mantle cell lymphoma by a pathologist
           (based on the 2016 revision of the WHO classification) 1) mantle cell lymphoma 2)
           leukemic non-nodal mantle cell lymphoma 3) in situ mantle cell neoplasia

        2. Age ≥ 19 years

        3. Patients who received bendamustine + rituximab as initial therapy and patients who
           received bendamustine + rituximab for the treatment of relapsed/refractory condition are
           both included.

      2. Exclusion criteria :

        1. Patients whose clinical and pathological data are not available

        2. Patients who were not treated with a combination of bendamustine and rituximab

      Data of patients who received bendamustine + rituximab for relapsed/refractory mantle cell
      lymphoma collected before the date of first submission of an IRB application for new project
      will be analyzed.

      The aim is to publish the data analysis and study results before December 2020. The expected
      overall study period is until December 2020.
