      Background:

      Gleich syndrome is also called episodic angioedema with eosinophilia (EAE). People with EAE
      have episodes of swelling. They may also have itching, hives, fever, and weight gain. During
      episodes, the body has very high numbers of white blood cells, especially a kind called
      eosinophils. Researchers think a drug called mepolizumab could help.

      Objective:

      To see if mepolizumab causes EAE symptoms to be less severe and happen less often.

      Eligibility:

      People ages 18 or older with EAE.

      Design:

      Participants will be screened under NIH protocol 94-I-0079.

      Participants will have 8 visits over about 6 months. The timing of some visits will depend on
      each participant s EAE episodes. Visits will include:

        -  Medical history

        -  Physical exam

        -  Blood and urine tests

        -  Optional bone marrow collection at first or second visit. For this, a needle will be
           inserted through the participant s hip bone into the marrow.

      Participants will get mepolizumab 3 times over about 3 months. They will get their first dose
      when their eosinophils are at their lowest point. They will get the drug by IV. A needle will
      guide a thin plastic tube into an arm vein. The drug will be given through the tube over
      about 30 minutes.

      Participants will keep a daily online log for about 3 months. The log will track their
      weight, temperature, and EAE symptoms. During the whole study, they will complete 2 online
      questionnaires about their symptoms. They will fill out 1 daily and 1 monthly.

      Participants will have blood and urine tests 2-3 times a week. For these, they will go to
      their local doctor.

    <textblock>
      Episodic angioedema with eosinophilia (EAE), also known as Gleich s Syndrome,is a rare
      disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of urticaria, fever, angioedema, weight gain and
      dramatic eosinophilia that occur at 3- to 6-week intervals and resolve with spontaneous
      diuresis in the absence of therapy. Although the syndrome is often classified in the broad
      category of idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES), EAE is a distinct eosinophilic
      syndrome that is remarkably homogeneous in clinical presentation. More recently, it has
      become apparent that there is multilineage cycling, involving lymphocytes and neutrophils in
      addition to eosinophils. Early studies described cyclic elevations of serum interleukin 5
      (IL-5) preceding the rise in eosinophilia, and additional studies have shown cyclic
      elevations in other type II cytokines as well as in eosinophilic chemokines. Aberrant T cells
      with a CD3-CD4+ surface phenotype have also been detected in the majority of subjects with
      EAE. The cyclic nature of the disorder and the involvement of multiple cell lineages have
      made it difficult to determine the underlying cause of EAE.

      We hypothesize that IL-5 driven eosinophilia is central to the pathogenesis of EAE.
      Suppression of eosinophil cycling by blocking IL-5 would help determine whether eosinophils
      are indeed the main drivers of the symptoms of angioedema and urticaria and pave the way for
      future mechanistic studies investigating the etiology of this unusual disorder. The purpose
      of this pilot study is to evaluate the effect of mepolizumab, a humanized antibody to IL-5,
      on eosinophil cycling in 12 subjects with EAE. Subjects with EAE will undergo screening on
      the National Institutes of Health protocol 94-I-0079 to establish the periodicity of their
      cycling (if not previously determined) and the optimal timing for the baseline visit. After
      screening, subjects will be followed closely with signs and symptoms recorded in a daily log,
      as well as complete blood counts and research blood collected for one cycle prior to
      administration of mepolizumab. Subjects will receive a total of 3 administrations of
      mepolizumab, one infusion every 4-6 weeks, and have a follow-up visit 4 weeks after the last
      administration of mepolizumab.

      The primary efficacy endpoint will be reduction of symptoms and severity of symptoms after
      mepolizumab. Secondary endpoints will include reduction in peak eosinophils after
      mepolizumab, continued suppression of absolute eosinophil count and reduction in symptoms
      following monthly dosing of mepolizumab therapy.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        A subject will be eligible for participation in the study only if all of the following
        criteria apply:

          1. The subject is male or female, aged 18 years or older.

          2. The subject has a documented diagnosis of EAE.

          3. The subject has symptoms of EAE in the cycle prior to screening, including but not
             limited to fever, swelling, hives or rashes, weight gain, muscle pain, and
             lymphadenopathy.

          4. Cycling of eosinophils is ongoing as indicated by a peak AEC greater than or equal to
             1500/mm^3 during at least one cycle in the prior 3 months.

          5. If taking corticosteroids, the subject is able and willing to stay on a stable dose
             for 6 weeks prior to screening.

          6. The subject agrees to storage of study samples.

          7. The subject is able to provide informed consent.

          8. Females are eligible for this study if they are:

               -  of non-childbearing potential (i.e., women who have had a hysterectomy or tubal
                  ligation or are postmenopausal as defined by no menses in 1 year); OR

               -  of childbearing potential but willing to practice effective contraception or
                  abstinence during administration of the study drug and for 100 days (5 terminal
                  half-lives) after administration of the investigational study drug.

               -  Not breastfeeding.

        Participation of Women:

        Pregnancy: The effects of mepolizumab on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this
        reason, women of childbearing potential must agree to use adequate contraception (see below
        for acceptable methods) prior to study entry, for the duration of study participation, and
        for &gt;5 terminal half-lives (approximately 100 days) after administration of the last dose
        of study drug. Nonreproductive potential is defined as post-menopausal, male partner who
        has azoospermia or is surgically sterile (at least 6 weeks before screening) and is the
        sole sexual partner, surgical sterility, or a congenital or acquired condition that
        definitely prevents conception. Further, postmenopausal is defined as at least 12
        consecutive months with no menses at age 50 or older, or a high follicle-stimulating
        hormone level in the postmenopausal range at ages 45-50 years in subjects not using
        hormonal contraception or hormone replacement therapy.

        Females with reproductive potential must either practice complete and uninterrupted
        abstinence from heterosexual activity or use 2 of the following methods of contraception
        with their partners. The 2 methods must include either 2 barrier methods, or 1 barrier
        method and 1 non-barrier method, both of which must be consistently used:

        Barrier Methods:

          1. Diaphragm with spermicide

          2. Cervical cap with spermicide or contraceptive sponge (for nulliparous subjects only)

          3. Male or female condom (cannot be used together)

        Non-Barrier Methods

          1. An intrauterine device with a documented failure rate of &lt;1%

          2. Hormonal contraception: pill (estrogen/progestin or progestin-only), patch, vaginal
             ring, rod implanted in the skin, or subcutaneous injection methods

        Females of childbearing-potential must have a negative pregnancy test result prior to
        receiving mepolizumab at each visit. During the course of the study, if a woman becomes
        pregnant or suspects she is pregnant, she should inform the study staff and her primary
        care physician immediately. A pregnancy registry has been created for subjects who become
        pregnant while receiving the approved dose of mepolizumab (100 mg subcutaneous injection)
        for asthma.

        Fertility: There is no fertility data in humans. Animal studies showed no adverse effects
        of anti-IL-5 treatment on fertility.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        A subject will not be eligible to participate in the study if any of the following
        conditions are fulfilled at the time of screening:

          1. Treatment with immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory agents including but not limited
             to cyclosporine, interferon-alpha, azathioprine, methotrexate, and cyclophosphamide
             within the past 3 months.

          2. Treatment with biologics including but not limited to mepolizumab, IVIG, anti-TNF
             agents, rituximab, benralizumab, alemtuzumab, reslizumab, dupilumab, lebrikizumab, and
             omalizumab within 6 months or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer). Subjects who
             received rituximab at any time in the past must have normal B-cell numbers to
             participate.

          3. Co-morbid illness, alcohol or substance abuse, or any other condition (e.g., HIV,
             active hepatitis) that, in the opinion of the investigator, places the subject at
             undue risk by participating in the study.

        Co-enrollment Guidelines: Co-enrollment in other trials is restricted, other than
        enrollment on observational studies or those evaluating the use of a licensed medication.
        Study staff should be notified of co-enrollment as it may require the approval of the
        investigator.
