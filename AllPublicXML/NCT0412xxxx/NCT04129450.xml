  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pragmatic clinical trial (PCT) research is to determine whether a
      group-visit approach modeled on Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction can improve function for
      persons with chronic low back pain. This will be done by an embedded PCT within the
      evidence-based &quot;OPTIMUM&quot; (Optimizing Pain Treatment In Medical settings Using Mindfulness)
      program.

      The research will be conducted with three health care system (HCS) sites: Boston Medical
      Center, MA, a safety net health system; UPMC, Pittsburgh, PA, a large health system; and
      Piedmont Health Services, NC, a network of federally funded health centers in partnership
      with the University of North Carolina (UNC), Chapel Hill.

      As per NIH protocol for the funding, the first 12 month (Phase 1) of this PCT will be a pilot
      to plan and test the group-based mindfulness program for chronic pain program in each of the
      three sites with 5 participants/site. Once completed the Phase 2 will be conducted to
      integrate and test the group-based mindfulness program compared to standard of care for
      patients with chronic low back pain (cLBP) in the primary care setting at each collaborating
      site.

      Eligible consenting participants will be randomized to either: the primary care providers
      (PCP) usual care group, or the group with both PCP usual care and the 8 weeks mindfulness
      clinical pain group. Participants will be asked to complete baseline and follow-up surveys
      about pain, function, pain medicine use, mood and anxiety symptoms, and quality of life. The
      surveys will take up to an hour to complete.

    <measure>Change in pain intensity and interference at 8 weeks: PEG score</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The PEG (pain, enjoyment, general activity) composite score will be used to assess pain intensity and interference. The PEG is a 3 item score with potential responses of 0 to 10 with 10 being the most severe pain. The 3 PEG items referring to the past week are: average pain, how pain interfered with enjoyment of life, how pain interfered with general activity To compute the PEG score, add the responses to the questions above, then divide by three to get a final score out of 10.</description>

    <measure>Physical function at 8 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Physical function will be assessed using the 4 item PROMIS (Patient Reported Outcome Measurement Information System). It measure self-reported capability rather than actual performance of physical activities. This includes the functioning of one's upper extremities (dexterity), lower extremities (walking or mobility), and central regions (neck, back), Each question usually has five response options ranging in value from one to five. Scores range from 4 to 20 and higher scores are more favorable.</description>

    <measure>Opioid prescription use at 8 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Current Opioid Misuse Measure® (COMM) will be used to assess opioid prescription use. It is a 17-item, patient self-assessment measure designed to identify individuals taking opioids. Scoring is based on a Likert 5-point scale from 0 (never) to 4 (very often). A score of 9 or above is a positive indicator, ie, participant has been identified as misusing his/her medication and is at an increased risk of abuse.</description>
