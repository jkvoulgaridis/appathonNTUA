  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This open-label pilot study examines whether the hallucinogenic drug, psilocybin, given under
      supportive conditions, is safe and effective for depression in people with Mild Cognitive
      Impairment (MCI) or early Alzheimer's Disease (AD). This study will also assess whether
      psilocybin may improve quality of life in those individuals.

    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study evaluating the potential efficacy of psilocybin to produce improvement
      in depression compared to pre-treatment in people with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) or
      early Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and clinically significant symptoms of depression. The study
      will be an open-label trial in a sample of up to 20 treatment-seeking participants with a
      diagnosis of MCI or early AD. Participants will complete an 8-week course of study treatment
      including two psilocybin sessions (15 mg/70 kg in week 4 and 15 or 25 mg/70 kg in week 6),
      with follow-up assessments up to 6 months after the final psilocybin session. The study will
      assess changes in depressed mood at 1 week after the second psilocybin session compared to
      pre-treatment, and quality of life in participants from pre- to post-treatment.

    <description>The Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia (CSDD) is administered via patient and informant interviews to assess the presence and severity of depressive mood and behavioral symptoms during the past week. Has 19 items, each scored from 0 to 2 with higher scores indicating severe symptom.Total score range from 0 to 57.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and 2 weeks after second psilocybin session</time_frame>
    <description>The Quality of Life Alzheimer's Disease (QOL-AD) scale is a 13-item measure administered via patient and informant interviews to assess overall mood, physical and cognitive function, and quality of relationships in people with Alzheimer's Disease. Each item is scored 1 to 4, with higher score indicating better quality of life. Total score range from 13 to 52.</description>
