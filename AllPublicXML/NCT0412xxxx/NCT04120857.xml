  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Heart failure is common in adults and is the most common hospital diagnosis in older adults.
      Patients with heart failure suffer numerous distressing symptoms daily. Although palliative
      care can improve suffering, rural-dwelling heart failure patients have poor access to
      specialized palliative care. The investigators propose to pilot test a tele-health palliative
      care intervention, PALL-HEART, in rural dwelling heart failure patients who live in Virginia
      and Kentucky.

      Study specific objectives are:

      Primary Aims:

        -  AIM 1: Compare HF patients who participate in a home-delivered tablet-based HF health
           education and gentle stretching intervention, to a health education (HE) group on: a) HF
           symptoms (weight gain, breathlessness, fatigue), b) psychological symptoms (depression,
           diminished QOL, resilience, self-care, and heart rate variability), c) physical function
           (endurance, strength, balance), and d) health care utilization rates (ED visits, office
           visits, hospitalizations).

        -  Hypothesis 1: HF symptoms (weight gain, breathlessness, fatigue), psychological symptoms
           (depression, diminished QOL, resilience, self-care), physical function (endurance,
           strength, balance) will improve in the intervention group.

        -  Hypothesis 2: Health care utilization rates (ED visits, office visits, hospitalizations)
           will decrease in the intervention group.

      Secondary:

        -  AIM 2: Acceptability - Acceptability of the intervention will be determined using: a)
           participation and satisfaction rates (participant logs), b) intervention retention
           rates, and c) barriers to participation (technology and participant motivation issues).

        -  Hypothesis: Subjects in the intervention group will have &gt;80% participation and
           satisfaction rates and be willing to identify barriers to participation.

      acceptability of the intervention for future refinement and large scale testing.

    <measure>Heart Failure Somatic Perception Scale Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This questionnaire measures symptoms of heart failure - The 18-item Somatic Perception Scale asks participants how much they are bothered by 18 symptoms of heart failure in the past week using 5 response options ranging from 0 (I did not have the symptom) to 5 (extremely bothersome). Scores are summed, with higher values indicating higher symptom burden. Scores range from 0-90 with higher values indicating higher symptom burden.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>PROMIS questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This questionnaire screens for symptoms of depression. The 8-item questionnaire assesses self-reported negative mood (sadness, guilt), views of self (self- criticism, worthlessness), and social cognition (loneliness, interpersonal alienation) in the past week. The questionnaire uses 5 response options ranging from 0 (never) to 5 (always). Scores are summed, with higher values indicating higher risk for depression. The total raw score is converted into a T-score. The T-score rescales the raw score into a standardized score. The final score is a standardized score with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This questionnaire measures quality of life in people with heart failure. This questionnaire is a 23-item, self-administered instrument that quantifies physical function, symptoms (frequency, severity and recent change), social function, self-efficacy and knowledge, and quality of life. In the KCCQ, a summary score can be derived from the physical function, symptom (frequency and severity), social function and quality of life domains. Overall scores are transformed to a range of 0-100, in which higher scores reflect better health status. There are summary scores within the KCCQ and the overall summary score is created by the mean of Physical Limitation Score, Total Symptom Score, Quality of Life Score, and Social Limitation Score.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The Resilience Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Resilience Scale is a 25-item administered questionnaire that measures an individual's ability to adapt over time to stressors in life. Scores on the summated scale range from 25 to 175, with higher scores indicating higher resilience. All of the items are positively worded. Items are measured on a 7-point scale from 1(strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree). Responses are summed to produce a total score where a higher score indicates higher resilience.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Self-Care for Heart Failure Index Questionnaire (SCHFI)</measure>
    <time_frame>10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Self-Care for Heart Failure Index Questionnaire (SCHFI) is a 39-item measure of heart failure self-care. The items range from never (1) to always (5). There are 3 subscales: maintenance scale, symptom perception, confidence scale, and management scale. All of the scales are scored in the same way and a total score is not computed. Separate scores for each scale are computed separately.
In general, to standardize a scale score, 1) determine the maximum possible scale score, 2) subtract the number of items from the possible score, and 3) divide 100 by that result to identify a constant for that scale. To score the scale, sum item responses, subtract the number of items answered, and multiply by the constant.The higher the score, the greater the ability to care for heart failure symptoms within each subscale.</description>
