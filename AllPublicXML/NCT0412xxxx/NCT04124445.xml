    <textblock>
      Different studies have revealed different success rates and patient satisfaction after
      cervical facet C-RF. In a study on 32 patients, with 15 months follow up, 25% had complete
      pain relief (8). Another study had shown mean pain relief of 12.5 months and 11.5 months
      following a repeat procedure, with an effectiveness of 95% in 47 patients (8). In one study a
      success rate of 88% after first RF, and 86% following a repeat RF in 49 patients with facet
      mediated cervicogenic headache. They regarded the absence of anesthesia in the distribution
      of the 3rd occipital nerve, a technical failure (9). In a study from New Zealand,
      demonstrated cervical facet RF as the sole treatment modality, produced 61% -74% complete
      pain relief with a median duration of 15-17 months in patients who had responded to facet
      joints diagnostic block (10).

      One more study in 2012 has demonstrated high voltage P-RF had a higher short-term effect
      compare to usual voltage, but results are still lower than C-RF (11). A double blind
      randomized prospective study has illustrated P-RF did not show any success rate in 6 months
      pain control, whereas C-RF had 95% pain control for trigeminal neuralgia (12).

      Cohen in a recent study has compared P-RF with steroid injection for occipital neuralgia or
      migraine with occipital nerve tenderness (13). Six weeks pain relief was 61% in P-RF group,
      and 36% in steroid injection group, with a positive outcome of 34%, and 26% respectively
      (13). One study on 2010 had reached to 52.6%, 6 months pain improvement on occipital
      neuralgia (14).

      Patients fulfilling eligibility criteria will be randomly allocated to PRF or CRF in a 1:1
      ratio. The statistician will use RedCap software to generate random numbers. Patients will be
      registered to Redcap software and will be concealed from both patients and health care staff.
      The study coordinator will enter patients' consent and study eligibility information to the
      Redcap. Once eligible, the Redcap will assign the patient to one of the study group. Patients
      will be blinded in the proposed study. The assessor is the person who will assess treatment
      success at the end of the study based on data from completed questionnaires. Questionnaires
      will be completed every three months by patients through RedCap System. A therapist is the
      person who will perform the procedure (pain specialist physician). The therapist will not be
      blinded, because of the nature of intervention.

      Patient recruitment is estimated to be completed within 15-24 months. If the required sample
      size (calculated below) is recruited prior to this time, patient recruitment will be
      curtailed.

      During the first visit the investigator will perform eligibility for neck RF and patient will
      be received information about the study.

      Patients will be book for two MBB 4-6 weeks apart. If the patient was eligible after the
      second MBB, Patient will be asked to sign Informed consent before screening. Screening and
      recruitment, and randomization, and administer questionnaires will be performed by research
      co-ordinator. Study informed consent form (ICF) can be signed on the RF procedure day. If
      additional visits will be required to finalize the procedures related to the first visit they
      will be scheduled accordingly. After randomization the qualified participants will be
      scheduled for their RF.

      For the female subjects between the age of 18-50 a pregnancy test will be asked to obtain on
      screening visit in order to reduce the risk of pregnancy and potential harm to fetus, unless
      you had previous tubal ligation, or hysterectomy. Post menopause patients are excluded.

      Participants will be asked to complete the follow-up questionnaires at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12
      months.

      LANSS questionnaire will be asked to be completed 6 weeks after RF. If the score was 12 or
      higher, patient will be asked to complete them every 4 weeks after till the score reduce to
      less than 12. LANSS will be sent to the subjects through RedCap software.

      On their last study visit, participants will have an exit interview, in addition to
      completing study measures.

    <description>Radiofrequency ablation, also called rhizotomy, is a nonsurgical, minimally invasive procedure that uses heat to reduce or stop the transmission of pain. Radiofrequency waves ablate, or &quot;burn,&quot; the nerve that is causing the pain, essentially eliminating the transmission of pain signals to the brain.</description>
