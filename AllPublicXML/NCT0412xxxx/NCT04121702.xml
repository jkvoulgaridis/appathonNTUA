  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to establish an innovative Cardiac Tele-Rehabilitation (CTR) model.
      It could expands assistance resources through coordination with public administrations,
      developing a physical exercise program (PEP) assistance model in phase II that resolves the
      current situation of lack of adherence in the PEP due in part to the long waiting time to
      start it. To sum up this study could improve adherence in Cardiac Rehabilitation Phase III.
      It represents an opportunity to validate an innovative model for the realization of the PEP
      for phase II that could be expanded to other centres.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cardiac Rehabilitation (CR) programs show benefits in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality,
      exercise capacity, risk factors and quality of life. The use of new information and
      communication technologies (ICT) allows remote monitoring of activity and rhythm, defining a
      new model of cardiac tele-rehabilitation (CTR) and proving to be safe.

      The investigators intend to evaluate a new model of CR in Phase II in acute coronary syndrome
      (ACS), based on the implementation of the physical exercise program (PEP) in a public sports
      centre (PSC) with tele-monitoring by means of a wearable electronic device, S-PATCH3-Cardio,
      to compare the adherence of a PEP based on a CTR-PSC model with the traditional in-hospital
      program (PEP-H) maintaining the efficacy and safety of the CR program.

      Patients with recent stratified ACS of low and / or moderate risk will be included who will
      be randomly assigned to the PEP-H group who will perform 18 PEP sessions with strength
      training and cardiorespiratory resistance in a hospital, or a CTR-PSC group that performs the
      18 sessions of the PEP with strength training and cardiorespiratory resistance in the PSC.

      All patients will perform the rest of the CR program at the hospital that it includes:
      functional tests, consultations with nurse, cardiologist, rehabilitation doctor, and the
      educational program, with 10 Workshops in a Cardio-healthy Classroom.

    <description>Evaluate changes on level of physical activity measured ussing the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ). It asks about three specific types of activity undertaken in the four domains: leisure time physical activity, domestic and gardening (yard) activities, work-related physical activity, transport-related physical activity. The specific types of activity that are assessed are walking, moderate-intensity activities and vigorous-intensity activities. Computation of the total score for the form requires summation of the duration (in minutes) and frequency (days) of walking, moderate-intensity and vigorous-intensity activities.
Maximun value: the sum total of all Walking, Moderate and Vigorous time variables greater than 960 minutes (16 hours).
Mínimum value: Only values of 10 or more minutes of activity should be included in the calculation of summary scores. Responses of less than 10 minutes [and their associated days] should be re-coded to 'zero'</description>
