      A novel K-wire external fixation device was developed by the investigators. The K-wires can
      be connected by the device. After connection, the structure of the K-wires is transformed to
      an external skeletal fixator. Therefore, the K-wires are stabilized and unable to migrate
      independently. The stability of fracture fixation is better in patient with this K-wire
      external fixation device.

      The purposes of this study are to optimize the K-wire external fixation device and test its
      function in real clinical practice.

      Supracondylar humeral fractures are the most common elbow fractures in children. Closed
      reduction and internal fixation using percutaneous Kirschner wires (K-wires) are widely
      recommended for Gartland type II and III fractures. After percutaneous pinning, the K-wires
      are bent at the skin edge and cut. The cutoff point is about 1 cm outside of the skin.

      The diameters of the K-wires are between 1.5-3.0 mm. The surface of the K-wire is smooth.
      Therefore, the K-wires are easy to rotation and migration. Proximal migration or rotation of
      a K-wire could injure the skin. Distal migration of a K-wire could result in loss of
      reduction and fixation. Therefore, stabilization of the K-wires is important.

      A novel K-wire external fixation device was developed by the investigators. The K-wires can
      be connected by the device. After connection, the structure of the K-wires is transformed to
      an external skeletal fixator. Therefore, the K-wires are stabilized and unable to migrate
      independently. The stability of fracture fixation is better in patient with this K-wire
      external fixation device.

      The investigators got a one-year grant from the Ministry of Science and Technology in Taiwan
      last year. The preliminary data revealed that the torque and torsional stiffness with the
      K-wire external fixation device was greater than traditional pinning.

      The purposes of this study are to optimize the K-wire external fixation device and test its
      function in real clinical practice.
