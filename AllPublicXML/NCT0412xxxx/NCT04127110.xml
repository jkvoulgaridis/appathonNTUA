  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study includes patients diagnosed with a metastatic non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
      with anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) translocation. The standard treatment for patients with
      metastatic non small cell lung cancer with ALK translocation is represented by personalized
      treatment with drugs called ALK inhibitors. During the treatment with an ALK inhibitor, the
      tumour can start to grow again, because the tumour adapts to the drug and develops escape
      mechanisms, becoming resistant. At the tumour cells level, the mechanisms underlying
      resistance can include the development of other alterations, mainly mutations, including in
      the ALK gene. The alterations that developed depend on the drug the tumour has been exposed
      to.

      The alterations can be identified by analysing tumour tissue obtained through a biopsy,
      however, repeating a tumour biopsy is difficult and risky and might not be able to provide
      sufficient tissue for the test. Therefore in the last years, new tests have been developed to
      identify the mutations in the blood.

      Lorlatinib is a drug that inhibits ALK and has already been identified to be able to control
      the tumour growth when ALK mutations are identified and is already approved as standard
      treatment after progression to a previous treatment with ALK inhibitors.

      The purpose of this study is to identify which patient populations may benefit most from
      treatment with lorlatinib, based on the alterations found in their genes.

             including scheduled visits and examinations including follow up

          -  Before patient registration, written informed consent must be given according to the
             International Conference on Harmonisation-Good Clinical Practice (ICH/GCP), and
             national/local regulations

        B) Enrolment in ALKALINE phase II study.

        Inclusion criteria

          -  Age ≥18 years old

          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of NSCLC with ALK rearrangement,
             assessed by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) assay (Abbott Molecular Inc) or

          -  Archival tissue from primary tumour or metastatic site, if available, and blood
             samples

               -  Note: if blood samples cannot be collected (patient's refusal or any other
                  reason), patient will not be eligible for this study.

          -  Treated and/or untreated brain or leptomeningeal metastases will be allowed if
             asymptomatic and/or controlled (stable dose of steroids 7 days before the beginning of

          -  Adequate bone marrow and organ function defined as following:

               -  Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) ≥ 1.5 x 10E9/L;

               -  Platelets ≥ 100 x 10E9/L;

               -  Hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL;

               -  Serum total amylase ≤1.5 Upper Limit Normal (ULN);

                  serum bilirubin ≤1.5 x ULN or direct bilirubin ≤ ULN for patients with total
                  bilirubin levels &gt; 1.5 x ULN; for patients with Gilbert's disease total bilirubin
                  may be &gt; 1.5 x ULN, however direct bilirubin must be normal;

               -  Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST) and Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) ≤2.5 x ULN
                  (≤5.0 x ULN if there is liver metastases involvement);

          -  Women of child bearing potential (WOCBP) must have a negative serum pregnancy test
             within 3 days prior to the first dose of lorlatinib.

               -  Note: women of childbearing potential are defined as premenopausal females
                  capable of becoming pregnant (i.e. females who have had any evidence of menses in
                  the past 12 months, with the exception of those who had prior hysterectomy).
                  However, women who have been amenorrheic for 12 or more months are still
                  considered to be of childbearing potential if the amenorrhea is possibly due to
                  prior chemotherapy, antioestrogens, low body weight, ovarian suppression or other
                  reasons.

          -  Patients of childbearing / reproductive potential should use highly effective birth
             control measures, as defined by the investigator, during the study treatment period
             and for at least 5 weeks after the last dose of lorlatinib for female patients and for
             at least 14 weeks after the last dose of lorlatinib for male patients. A highly
             effective method of birth control is defined as a method, which results in a low
             failure rate (i.e. less than 1% per year) when used consistently and correctly. Such
             methods include:

               -  Combined (oestrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception associated
                  with inhibition of ovulation (oral, intravaginal, transdermal)

               -  Progestogen-only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation
                  (oral, injectable, implantable)

               -  Intrauterine device (IUD)

               -  Intrauterine hormone-releasing system (IUS)

               -  Bilateral tubal occlusion

               -  Vasectomized partner

               -  Sexual abstinence (the reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in
                  relation to the duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual
                  lifestyle of the patient)

               -  Note: Lorlatinib can induce Cytochrome P450 3A4/5 (CYP3A4/5) both in vitro and in
                  vivo. Most hormonal contraceptives are CYP3A substrates, therefore, if this
                  method of contraception is chosen it must be used along with condom (male or
                  female condom) due to the risk of contraception failure.

          -  Female subjects who are breast feeding should discontinue nursing prior to the first
             dose of study treatment and until 7 days after the last dose of lorlatinib.

          -  Patient is willing and able to comply with the protocol for the duration of the study
             including undergoing treatment and scheduled visits and examinations including follow
             up.

          -  Before patient registration, written informed consent must be given according to
             ICH/GCP, and national/local regulations.
