  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot investigation will conduct a randomized placebo-controlled, double-blind study in
      150 volunteers (age: 18-74 years) over a period of 90 consecutive days. A statistician will
      be involved in this project. Body weight, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, blood
      chemistry, blood pressure and heart rate, body and hand grip strength, speed and endurance
      studies including open circuit spirometry-based assessment of pulmonary function will be
      assessed. Other parameters to be evaluated include oxygen consumption, CO2 production and
      metabolic parameters, VO2 max, respiratory exchange ratio (RER), anaerobic threshold,
      ventilatory equivalents for oxygen (VE/V02) and exhaled carbon dioxide (VE/VC02)2,3. Subjects
      will participate in completed maximal graded exercise tests (GXT) on a treadmill or in set
      distance open-field sprints using open-circuit spirometry. Lower and Upper Body Strength will
      be evaluated. E-Diary will be provided to all participants. Survey Monkey program will be
      provided to all subjects and regularly updated by all study participants daily and endorsed
      by the co-Principal Investigator.

      A novel patented Prodovite® VMP35 Multi-Nutrient-Complex (MNC), a vitamin, mineral, and
      phytonutrient encapsulated liquid formulation, was prepared using a novel proprietary SK713
      SLP multi-lamellar clustoidal non-GMO phospholipid Prodosome nutrient absorption/delivery
      technology in a state-of-the-art multistep cGMP and NSF-certified manufacturing facility.
      This developmental technology is biodegradable and biocompatible. Preliminary study in our
      laboratory demonstrated the efficacy of Prodovite® VMP35 in Sports Nutrition. We hypothesize
      that Prodovite® VMP35 supplement will enhance athletic performance, lean-body muscle mass,
      increase exercise tolerance, and improve anabolic parameters in healthy human subjects. The
      aim of this pilot study is to evaluate the effect of oral supplementation of Prodovite® VMP35
      on exercise endurance, muscle strength, anabolic parameters and lean body mass in healthy
      human subjects. We hypothesize that Prodovite® VMP35 supplementation will enhance and
      increase exercise performance, tolerance, lean-body muscle mass, improve anabolic parameters
      and blood chemistry parameters in healthy human subjects. Accordingly, 150 healthy male and
      female subjects will be randomly assigned to receive either Prodovite® VMP35 or placebo in
      the form of single dose sealed containers for 90 consecutive days and muscle strength,
      endurance, speed, anabolic/catabolic parameters and muscle mass will be evaluated by dual
      energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA), hand-grip strength test, cycle ergometer test, spirometer
      assessment and assay of Blood chemistry and serum biomarkers will be evaluated before and
      after intervention.
