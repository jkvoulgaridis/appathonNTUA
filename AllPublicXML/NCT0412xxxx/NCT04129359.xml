  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This cluster randomised trial aims to establish the effectiveness of an online intervention
      designed to improve the ability of parents to 'mentalise' - in other words to understand
      their own mental states and that of others including their partners and young children.
      Effects on maternal mental state, the quality of parent-child interaction and child language,
      social and emotional development will be assessed.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a cluster randomised trial based in Danish general practice. 100 general practices
      will be recruited, each of which will recruit 10 successive women at their first routine
      antenatal appointment. All practices will receive standardised training in assessing maternal
      mental health, neurodevelopmental assessment of the child and assessment of the quality of
      parent-child interaction as well as in completion of an enhanced pregnancy or child
      development record.

      Practices will be randomised either to receive additional training in the principles of
      mentalisation and in the use of an online resource (Robusthed) that parents can use to
      improve their mentalisation skills (https://robustbarn.dk) or not to receive this extra
      training. The trial is therefore comparing Robusthed plus enhanced care as usual with
      enhanced care as usual alone.

      Baseline measures will be taken at recruitment into the trial and outcomes will be collected
      when the child is 15 and 30 months.

    <description>FamilieTrivsel is a modular internet-based low-cost and brief psychoeducation intervention based on the Robusthed (Resilience) programme (RP). Mentalisation approaches are used to increase resilience and ability to handle the challenges of life. The programme is licence free and can be used with low or high intensity and it can be combined with any other interventions. RP provides simple explanations and tools that can be used to discover, understand and regulate one's own thoughts and feelings by activating mental and physical resources and it provides examples and exercises that may promote communication about mental states between parents and the child. The content has been developed to include video-based training sessions based on different stages of pregnancy and early childrearing. RP appears suitable for use in general practice, where the GP sees young parents regularly and thus can direct patients towards components of the programme when need appears greatest.</description>
