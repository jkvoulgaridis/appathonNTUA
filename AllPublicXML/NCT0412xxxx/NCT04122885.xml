  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The general goal of this study is to investigate the effect of treatment on serum
      concentrations of proteins known to impact angiogenesis or tumor growth and establishment in
      patients with peritoneal metastasis of various origin. Since the immune system is thought, by
      many, to have an impact on tumor growth and development, this study also seeks to determine
      the impact of abdominal surgery on postoperative immune function in PM patients, as judged by
      proteins known to influence immune function. This study will not only characterize the
      postoperative plasma but also to determine if the magnitude of any of the changes noted is
      associated with a worse or improved oncologic outcome.

      The principle purpose of this study is to gather perioperative serum/plasma samples from
      patients with PM from a variety of different primary tumors (ovarian, gastric, and
      colorectal) undergoing either CRS and HIPEC versus PIPAC.

      The plasma samples obtained in this protocol will also be used to study the various plasma
      proteins that influence immune function as well as those that influence angiogenesis. In
      addition to the proteins mentioned above, there are also a large number of other proteins
      that have not been investigated thus far in the perioperative window; these proteins also
      merit assessment. The plasma obtained via this study and protocol will also be used to search
      for other tumor growth factors influenced by surgery or to investigate the impact of surgery
      on immune function.

      Aim 1: To determine perioperative serum levels, over time, of a variety of serum proteins
      including but not limited to IGFBP-3, VEGF, Ang 2, PlGF, sVCAM, CHI3L1, MMP-2, MMP-3, MCP-1
      and proteins that influence immune function as well as other proteins in the following 2
      groups of patients:

        1. PM patients treated with CRS and HIPEC

        2. PM patients treated with PIPAC.

      Aim 2: To compare the perioperative blood protein results between the 2 different groups of
      patients.

      Aim 3: To determine, within each group, a possible correlation between the magnitude of these
      effects on oncological outcome (patient overall survival).

      Aim 4: To search for other surgery-influenced plasma or cellular factors that may influence
      early postoperative tumor growth or that hold promise as tumor or prognostic markers.

        Subjects will be recruited from the institutions involved. All patients must meet
        inclusion/exclusion criteria (as indicated above) to be considered.

        Each subject will undergo medical examination during the screening visit (Visit 1) prior to
        enrolment. The personal data and detailed medical history will be recorded. The screening
        will take place no more than 6 weeks before intervention. This screening procedure will
        consist of:

          -  Checking of inclusion/exclusion criteria

          -  Detailed history including medical history

          -  A standard physical examination including the cardiovascular, nervous, respiratory
             systems, conscience, memory, orientation, and body weight

        The patient's informed consent for study participation will be signed at the time of
        enrollment.
