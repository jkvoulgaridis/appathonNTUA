  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a cross-sectional pilot study of head and neck cancer survivors who have completed
      multi-modal treatment to assess and characterize the presence of distinct pain syndromes.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Primary objectives:

        -  To correlate structural and functional MRI signature with one of three pain phenotypes
           in head and neck cancer survivors: 1) no pain, 2) central pain, and 3) nociceptive pain.

        -  To correlate the presence of chronic systemic symptoms with pain phenotype

      Exploratory objectives:

      - DNA, RNA, and plasma will be collected for genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic studies.
      Results will be vertically integrated along with the results of clinical studies described
      within this protocol to identify targets for future correlative studies.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with histologically proven head and neck cancer

          -  Patients without a diagnosis of head and neck cancer (up to 10 patients, see below)

               -  We will also recruit up to 10 patients WITHOUT a diagnosis of head and neck
                  cancer to facilitate optimization of the MRI scanning processes. This will allow
                  us to address logistical issues, such as pressure stimulator set-up and timing of
                  each scan to be performed

          -  Completed multi-modality therapy a minimum of 6 weeks prior to study entry.

          -  Willing and able to provide informed consent

          -  All participants must be at least 21 years of age

          -  Able to speak English

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who are pregnant

          -  Patients who are unable to lie still

          -  Patients who are unable tolerate pressure stimulator

          -  Non-MRI compatible devices such as aneurysm clips, cardiac pacemakers or
             defibrillators, cochlear implants, hardware, or any other implants

          -  Iron-based tattoos, pieces of metal (bullet, BB, shrapnel) close to or in an important
             organ (such as the eye), or other non-MRI compatible metal in the body
