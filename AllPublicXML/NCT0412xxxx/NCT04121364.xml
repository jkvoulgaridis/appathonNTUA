  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to determine if a new bone adhesive is useful in stabilizing dental tooth
      implants. Data collected from the study will examine the strength, performance, and the
      safety of the material.

          -  Committed to Study and Follow-up period;

          -  ASA I or II;

          -  Planned &quot;implant site&quot; must have 1 adjacent tooth;

          -  Sufficient bone Height for safe dental implant placement;

          -  At least 2 mm of apical bone for seating of implant.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any significant disease that would preclude a dental implant

          -  Any oral surgery contraindications

          -  Subjects with mucosal Disease

          -  Subjects with bone diseases or conditions (e.g. Paget's disease, fibrous dysplasia,
             history of osteomyelitis, etc.) in the region of the potential study implant site;

          -  Subjects with a history of local radiation therapy in the head/neck area or
             osteonecrosis of the jaws;

          -  Subjects with any acute and untreated endodontic lesions or periodontal disease;

          -  Subjects receiving, or having a recent or long-term history of receiving, oral or
             parenteral anti-osteoclastic agents [e.g., bisphosphonates, Xgeva速 and Prolia速
             (denosumab); Forteo速 (teriparatide), strontium ranelate, etc.], or anti-angiogenesis
             factors;

          -  Subjects who have major active substance abuse problems (e.g., alcoholism, opiate
             addiction, methamphetamine abuse, etc.);

             or equivalent of electronic cigarette vaping) or chew tobacco;

          -  Subjects with inadequate oral hygiene or who are unmotivated for adequate home care;

          -  Subjects who have physical or mental handicaps that would interfere with the ability

          -  Subjects who have undergone administration of any investigational device within 30
             days of enrollment in the study;

          -  Subjects who are allergic or otherwise sensitive to any materials likely encountered
             during the course of the study (e.g. titanium, suture materials, local anesthetics);

          -  Subjects with conditions or circumstances, which, in the opinion of the Investigator,
             would prevent completion of study participation or interfere with analysis of study
             results, such as history of non-compliance or unreliability

          -  Any site into which the implant is not or cannot be placed during the same visit as
             the extraction;

          -  Any implant site where there is a dehiscence or fenestration of buccal or lingual
             plates of bone greater than 5mm in any direction.
