    <textblock>
      The investigators will perform a double-blind, randomized, sham-controlled clinical trial of
      theta-burst stimulation (TBS) in mixed depressive episodes of both bipolar and major
      depressive disorders. Will be selected 90 patients aged 18-65 years with diagnosis of TB (I
      or II) or MDD in moderate or severe major depressive episode with mixed features. The primary
      endpoint of efficacy will be a continuous outcome of change in Montgomery-Asberg Depression
      Rating Scale (MADRS) from baseline to week 3.

      INTRODUCTION: Mixed-specifier mood disorders are probably a different subgroup in terms of
      response to treatment, socio-demographic parameters, course and family history. The
      investigators will perform a clinical trial of theta-burst stimulation (TBS) in mixed
      depressive episodes of both bipolar (I and II) and major depressive disorders. METHODS: The
      study is designed as a randomized, sham-controlled, double-blinded clinical trial evaluating
      TBS for the treatment of moderate or severe major depressive episodes with mixed features of
      patients receiving at least one first or second line pharmacological treatment for depressive
      episodes without adequate response. Ninety adult (18 to 65 yo) patients will be enrolled and
      submitted to 6-week (comprising 5 consecutive days a week sessions for the first 3 weeks and
      then 2 days a week for a further 3 week) of inhibitory followed by excitatory TBS in
      dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Participants will be assessed using clinical and
      neuropsychological tests before and after the intervention. The primary outcome is change in
      Montgomery-Asberg Depression Scale (MADRS) score over time and across groups. Cognitive
      parameters will also be assessed with neuropsychological tests.

    <masking_description>Allocation masking will be done through sequentially numbered cards that will determine which group each patient will belong to. The card determines whether the coil to be used will produce actual or simulated stimulation. A secretary who does not participate directly in the research will be responsible for handling the numbered cards to the patient prior to each session. Participants and staff will not fully know the status of allocation groups.</masking_description>
