    <textblock>
      This study is the first to evaluate the effectiveness of a Newborn Parenting Class designed
      by Mount Sinai Parenting Center. The study measures how effective the class is in improving
      maternal knowledge on newborn care, decreasing maternal self-perceived anxiety and increasing
      maternal confidence.

      The important role positive parenting plays in promoting a child's developmental trajectory
      has led to the design and implementation of many postpartum education initiatives. With 99%
      of babies in the U.S. born in hospitals, there is a uniqueness of being in the hospital for
      an extended period of time with the opportunity to educate parents on the importance of
      promoting early development. Pediatricians are uniquely well-positioned to address both
      medical and developmental concerns parents may have during critical periods in a child's
      development, yet very few interventions are led by pediatricians. The Mount Sinai Parenting
      Center designed the Newborn Parent Education and Discharge Class (hereafter referred to as
      Newborn Class) to address this issue. The class is 1-hour long and taught be pediatric
      attending and residents to all families who deliver well babies at Mount Sinai. The class
      aims to educate parents about medical issues, responsive parenting, and sleep. It is
      currently taught every Tuesdays and Thursdays. Because of the limited availability of the
      class, not all mothers have the opportunity to attend. This research study will survey first
      time mothers of newborns to explore the effectiveness of attending the class. The study team
      hypothesizes that attending the class would result in increased knowledge on newborn care,
      increased confidence levels and decreased levels of anxiety.

      First time mothers who delivered a full-term singleton vaginally with no major complications
      were included in the study. Only mothers who attended the class (intervention) or expressed
      desire to attend class but were discharged before a class was offered (control) were included
      in analysis. Mothers were recruited between May 2018 and August 2019 at the Klingenstein
      Pavilion of Mount Sinai. Maternal self-perceived anxiety and confidence were measured using
      standardized scales, and knowledge on newborn care was assessed using an internally-developed
      scale.

    <description>Maternal self-perceived anxiety was measured using State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Adults (State only). A 40 self-report items questionnaire, each item scored on 4-point likert-type response scale from 1 (not at all) to 4 (almost always), full range from 20 to 80, with higher score STAI scores suggesting higher levels of anxiety</description>

        Participants of the study are mothers who delivered vaginally a singleton with no major
        perinatal complications at Mount Sinai Hospital. Participants were not randomized into
        control and intervention. This was an Observational study of eligible mothers than attended
        the Newborn Class (&quot;intervention group&quot;) and eligible mothers who wanted to but were not
        able to attend the Newborn Class because it was not available during their stay at the
        hospital (&quot;control group&quot;).
