      The primary objective is to investigate the effects of lofexidine in adults undergoing opioid
      tapering prior to elective lumbar spine surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this clinical trial, an open label design will be used to facilitate opioid tapering
      during a 12-day period prior to elective spine surgery. The primary outcome measure of this
      study is the number of patients who achieve a 50% reduction in daily opioid dose at day 12.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Cancer-related pain.

          2. Medical or surgical conditions that could be adversely impacted by opioid tapering or
             use of lofexidine including, but not exclusively limited to, cardiac disease,
             inflammatory bowel disease, renal or hepatic impairment, vascular disease, and history
             of anaphylaxis. Patients may be excluded for other comorbid medical or surgical

             impacted by opioid tapering or use of lofexidine. Patients may be excluded for other
             comorbid mental health conditions based on the physician investigator's discretion.

          4. Neurological condition that impair functioning in an ambulatory setting or could be
             adversely impacted by opioid tapering or use of lofexidine including, but not

             discretion.

          7. History of adverse effects attributed to opioid tapering or lofexidine use.

          8. Use of medications from drug classes known to have adverse interactions with
             lofexidine including, but not exclusively limited to, beta-blockers, calcium channel
             blockers, alpha 1 and 2 receptor antagonists, tricyclic antidepressants,
             benzodiazepines, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Patients may be excluded
             for use of other medications based on the physician investigator's and research
