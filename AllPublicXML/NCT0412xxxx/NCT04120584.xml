        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Adult females and males between the ages of 18 -75, seeking treatments for Dry Eye
             Disease Due to Meibomian Gland Dysfunction

          2. Tear breakup time (TBUT) ≤10 s;

          3. Evidence of meibomian gland (MG) obstruction, based on total MGS of ≤12 in lower
             eyelids for each eye as assessed by a clinician not involved in the study procedure

          4. Subjective symptom score (using the Standard Patient Evaluation of Eye Dryness [SPEED]
             questionnaire) ≥10;

          5. At least one meibomian gland opening with a visible plugging over the eyelid margin

          6. No ocular pathology requiring treatment other than eye lubricant and conventional
             eyelid hygiene within the last month and during the study

          7. The subjects should understand the information provided about the investigative nature
             of the treatment, possible benefits, and side effects, and sign the Informed Consent
             Form

             the time between the treatment visit and the final study visit. Ocular lubricants are
             allowed if no changes are made during the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Evidence of co-existing ocular conditions potentially posing an increased risk of

             eye)

          2. History of ocular trauma or surgery including intraocular, oculoplastic, corneal or

         16. History of skin disorders, keloids, abnormal wound healing, as well as very dry and
             fragile skin

         17. Severe concurrent conditions, such as cardiac disorders, sensory disturbances.
