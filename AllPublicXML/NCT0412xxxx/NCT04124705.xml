        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants who have a diagnosis of primary hypothyroidism made ≥ 12 months before
             study entry (Visit 1).

          -  Be on continuous thyroid replacement therapy with synthetic T4 for primary
             hypothyroidism for at least 12 months immediately prior to the Screening Visit (Visit
             1).

          -  Be on a stable FDA-approved daily dose of synthetic T4 for a minimum of 3 months prior
             to the Screening Visit (Visit 1). Must enter the study on the same stable dose.

          -  Have euthyroid status indicated by at least 1 documented TSH value within normal
             reference range (0.45 4.12 mIU/L, inclusive) at a minimum of 6 weeks and maximum of 12
             months prior to the Screening Visit (Visit 1). Also have a confirmed TSH value within
             the normal reference range drawn at the Screening Visit (Visit 1).

          -  Male and female participants willing to minimize the risk of inducing pregnancy for
             the duration of the clinical study and follow-up period (35 days after last dose of
             study intervention).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any clinical condition or previous surgery that might affect the absorption,
             distribution, biotransformation, or excretion of Armour Thyroid or synthetic T4.

          -  History of alcohol or other substance abuse within the previous 5 years.

          -  Known or suspected allergy or intolerance to any ingredients of Armour Thyroid,
             including its excipients, levothyroxine (T4), other thyroid replacement medications,
             or pork products.

          -  Have received active treatment with an investigational drug within 30 days or 5 half
             lives, whichever is longer, of Screening Visit (Visit 1).

          -  Current enrollment in an investigational drug or device study or participation in such
             a study within 60 days of entry into this study.
