  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was a two-staged study undertaken in entertainment-sector workers in Spain: the first
      part was transversal and observational, and the second was semi-experimental. A short
      group-based motivational intervention session was implemented by nursing staff, and a before
      and after evaluation was completed. By reducing the patients' perception of their quality of
      life, this brief nursing intervention facilitated a favourable increase in the motivation for
      change among these workers and was effective in 12% of cases.

      Checking whether changes in the perception of the quality of life related to health, after
      the nursing intervention, influence these patients' motivation to change. This was a
      two-staged study undertaken in entertainment-sector workers in Spain: the first part was
      transversal and observational, and the second was semi-experimental. First part undertook in
      284 entertainmentsector workers, selected by non-probabilistic sampling, while second part
      undertook in 50 entertainment-business workers, selected by consecutive sampling from those
      who consumed substances. A short group-based motivational intervention session was
      implemented by nursing staff, and a before and after evaluation was completed. The EuroQol-5D
      and Test for the Evaluation of the Quality of Life in Addicts to Psychoactive Substances
      (TECVASP) were used. The patients' motivation to change was evaluated through the Stages of
      Change Readiness and Treatment Eagerness Scale.

    <description>Health related quality of life (HRQL) meassured by EQ-5D (EuroQuol) The EQ-5D-3L descriptive system comprises the following 5 dimensions, each describing a different aspect of health: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/disconfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 3 respnse levels of severity: no problems, some problems, extreme problems. The respondent is asked to indicate his/her health state by checking the box next to the most appropiate response level of each five dimensions.</description>

    <description>Assessment of the Quality of Life in Psychoactive Substance Addicts Test TECVAS
It consists of 22 items (18 positive and 4 negative [items 15, 19, 20 and 21]) with a graded response format of five alternatives. The response alternatives are coded with the following alternatives: a) in the positive items: nothing (5 points), little (4 points), sometimes (3 points), enough (2 points) and much (1 point); b) in the negative items: nothing (1 point), little (2 points), sometimes (3 points), enough (4 points) and much (5 points). Therefore, in each element, a higher score represents a more positive evaluation of the content, and in the test, a higher score represents a better HRQL.</description>

    <description>Stages of Change Readiness and Treatment Eagerness Scale (SOCRATES Scale) SOCRATES is an experimental instrument designed to assess readiness for change in alcohol and drugs abusers. The instrument yields three factorially-derived scale scores: Recognition (Re), Ambivalence (Am), and Taking Steps (Ts). It is a public domain instrument and may be used without special permission. The statements describes a way that the user might (or might not) feel about his/her drug use. For each statement, he/she has to circle one number from 1 to 5, to indicate how much they agree or disagree with it right now.</description>

    <description>Based on NANDA diagnosis recommendations, entertainment-sector workers were asked to record their perceptions and the meaning of their substance-use problem in a diary. The intervention was subsequently designed based on brief motivational psychoeducational therapy (BMPT).</description>
