  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Artificial Pancreas lab at McGill University has developed an optimization algorithm for
      adults with Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) on Multiple Daily Injection (MDI) therapy with the
      adjunctive use of glucose sensor technology, collectively known as sensor-augmented MDI
      therapy. The algorithm is designed to estimate optimal basal-bolus parameters based on the
      patient's glucose, insulin and meal data over several days. The investigators hope that this
      algorithm will be better able to improve long-term glycemic targets by reducing HbA1c levels
      compared to sensor-augmented MDI therapy alone.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this exploratory study is to test the efficacy of this optimization
      algorithm with sensor-augmented MDI therapy in improving long-term glucose control, using a
      randomized parallel study over three months. The optimization algorithm may lead to the
      automation of physician-adjusted basal rate and Insulin to Carb Ratio (ICR) adjustments.

      84 adults with type 1 diabetes will be enrolled in the study, where they will randomly
      undergo one of two interventions:

        1. Sensor-Augmented MDI Therapy: Participants will undergo their usual MDI therapy along
           with a Freestyle Libre glucose sensor (Abbott Diabetes Care), and a data collection
           mobile application that collects insulin and meal data.

        2. Sensor-Augmented MDI Therapy with the Optimization Algorithm: Participants will undergo
           MDI therapy with a Freestyle Libre glucose sensor (Abbott Diabetes Care) and a data
           collection mobile application that collects insulin and meal data. Every week,
           participants will have their insulin doses adjusted by the optimization algorithm's
           recommendations.

    <description>Multiple daily injections (MDI) (slow acting insulin and Rapid acting insulin) therapy involves four or more daily insulin injections. Once or twice daily, a long acting insulin is injected as a basal dose. These long acting insulins are designed to dissipate slowly and evenly into the bloodstream for 24 to 36 hours following injection. This basal injection aims to mimic the physiological healthy basal insulin released from a healthy pancreas all day. Furthermore, multiple insulin bolus doses are injected at every meal each day using rapid or short acting insulin. These injections are administered before meals and are calculated using patients' ICRs and meal carbohydrate quantities.</description>
