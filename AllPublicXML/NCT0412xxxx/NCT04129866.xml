  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Mobile-Interpretation Bias Modification clinical trial aims to examine the efficacy of a
      brief mobile phone delivered interpretation bias modification to reduce anxiety sensitivity
      cognitive concerns and suicidal ideation in National Guard Personnel. The investigators
      propose a randomized controlled trial testing the efficacy, acceptability, and usability of
      M-IBM with a sample of 114 National Guardsmen with current suicidal ideation and elevated
      anxiety sensitivity cognitive concerns. Participants will complete assessments, receive
      assistance on installing M- IBM on their phone, complete an M-IBM intervention session, and
      complete post-intervention assessments. Baseline measures of psychopathology, and
      usability/acceptability of M-IBM will be obtained during the initial session. In addition,
      1-month, and 3-month follow-ups would be scheduled to examine changes in psychopathology. The
      investigators hypothesize that those randomized to M-IBM will experience reductions in
      anxiety sensitivity cognitive concerns, suicidal ideation. In addition participants will find
      M-IBM acceptable and easy to use.

    <description>M-IBM is based on a slightly modified version of the word sentence association paradigm focused on words and sentences related to common concerns among those with elevated anxiety sensitivity cognitive concerns (i.e., losing control of mental processes).</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Control IBM</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Placebo Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>Control-IBM is identical to M-IBM except that the sentence that follows the cue word is not related to an anxious-threat interpretation of the cue word.</description>
  </arm_group>
  <intervention>
    <intervention_type>Behavioral</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>M-IBM</intervention_name>
    <description>In this paradigm, an ambiguous word or two-word phrase related to ASCC is followed by a sentence that resolves the word-sentence meaning as threatening or benign. For example, participants are presented with an ambiguous word or two-word phrase for 1 second. On half the trials the combination of the word/phrase and sentence creates a benign meaning (as in the previous example). On the other half of trials this combination creates an anxious-threat meaning Participants are required to judge the relatedness of the word/phrase and the sentence. Participants are given feedback during training such that judging the anxious-threat combinations to be &quot;unrelated&quot; and the benign combinations as being &quot;related&quot; would produce a &quot;correct&quot; response. In contrast, if participants produce an &quot;incorrect&quot; response they see &quot;incorrect&quot;.</description>
