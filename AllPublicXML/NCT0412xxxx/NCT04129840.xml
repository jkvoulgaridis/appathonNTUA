  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to compare the effectiveness of three different antihypertensive treatment
      strategies for reaching a target blood pressure (clinic BP) of &lt;/= 130/80 mmHg among patients
      &lt;65years of age and &lt;/= 140/90 mmHg among patients &gt;/=65years of Age in HIV-positive and
      HIV-negative patients with uncomplicated arterial hypertension in rural Tanzania and Lesotho.
