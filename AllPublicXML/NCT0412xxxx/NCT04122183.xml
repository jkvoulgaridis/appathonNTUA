  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if a newly developed program called &quot;I Manage my hearing
      loss&quot; (iManage) will increase the number of individuals who visit an audiologist after
      failing a hearing screening. The iManage program will educate individuals about hearing loss,
      demonstrate that hearing problems are important, demonstrate that support from family and
      friends is important and help participants identify the benefits and concerns related to
      seeking help for hearing loss.

    <time_frame>Baseline (within one week of screening) and 6 months post baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Mean score (which can range between 1 and 11) on each of 6 scales: perceived susceptibility, perceived severity, perceived benefits, perceived barriers, perceived self-efficacy, and cues to action. A higher score indicates greater agreement with the construct.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, 4 weeks post baseline, and 6 months post baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will select the statement that best describes their view of their hearing status, 1 indicates &quot;precontemplation&quot;, 2 indicates &quot;contemplation&quot;, 3 indicates, &quot;preparation&quot;, 4 indicates &quot;action&quot; on the Transtheoretical Model Continuum.</description>
