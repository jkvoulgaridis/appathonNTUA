  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overarching goal of this proposal is to determine whether DNA methylation of the
      mitochondrial DNA impairs mitochondrial function in insulin resistant states such as obesity
      and type 2 diabetes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To determine whether differences in human skeletal muscle DNA methylation patterns in the
      mitochondrial and nuclear genome can explain the lower abundance of ETC and OXPHOS mRNA and
      protein observed in insulin resistant skeletal muscle of obese and type 2 diabetic
      participants. To determine whether patterns of human skeletal muscle DNA methylation in the
      mitochondrial and nuclear genome are predictive of ETC function. We will isolate skeletal
      muscle mitochondria from metabolically well-characterized lean insulin sensitive, obese
      insulin resistant nondiabetic and obese insulin resistant type 2 diabetic volunteers, and
      functionally evaluate each ETC complex (I - IV) and complex V (ATP synthase).
