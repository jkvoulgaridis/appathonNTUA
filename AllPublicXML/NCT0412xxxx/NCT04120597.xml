  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Polycystic ovary syndrome is the most common endocrine and metabolic disorder in gynecology.
      Traditional Chinese medicine has a good clinical effect in the treatment of PCOS. We intend
      to conduct this trial in strict accordance with the requirements of evidence-based medicine,
      through a multi-center, randomized, controlled study, using a double-blind, randomized,
      placebo-controlled study design method to clarify that Zishen Qingre Lishi Huayu Recipe
      restores spontaneous ovulation in PCOS patients. The overall efficacy of improving the
      characteristics of Kaohsiung and glucose and lipid metabolism is optimal, and high-level
      evidence-based evidence is obtained to form a diagnosis and treatment plan for promotion.
