  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current study will be one of the first to develop and test a passive data collection
      technique to detect both meal consumption and disordered eating symptoms in patients with
      clinically significant binge eating and the first just-in-time adaptive interventions
      (JITAIs) systems using passive sensing technology for eating pathology to be empirically
      evaluated. A small iterative open clinical trial using an ABAB design (A= SenseSupport Off,
      B=SenseSupport On) will be conducted to test the feasibility, acceptability, and target
      engagement of SenseSupport when paired with a 12 week in-person CBT treatment program. The
      hypothesis that larger decreases in dietary restriction will be observed during SenseSupport
      On phases compared to SenseSupport Off phases will be tested in this clinical trial.

    <intervention_model_description>Participants will receive 12 sessions of in-person CBT delivered over 12 weeks. In weeks 1-2, participants will wear the CGM devices, but will not receive JITAIs and therapists will not have access to the clinician portal. During weeks 3-4, JITAIs will be &quot;turned on&quot; such that patients begin to receive push notifications based on CGM data and therapists will have access to the clinician portal. The A/B periods will be repeated (weeks 5-6 and 9-10, SenseSupport Off; weeks 7-8 and 11-12 SenseSupport On) to ensure that improvements in dietary restriction are due to SenseSupport and not simply to the effect of time in treatment. Similar to the approach used in prior studies, participants will be ran in small waves (n= 3-5 per wave). During each wave, feasibility, acceptability, and target engagement will be assessed, and if acceptable milestones have not been achieved, SenseSupport will be modified before beginning the next wave.</intervention_model_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of weekly episodes of going ≥ 4 waking hours without eating</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The number of weekly episodes of going ≥ 4 waking hours without eating captured through CGM and EMA data as well as an EDE-Q assessment before each weekly therapy session. Higher numbers indicate more weekly episodes of dietary restriction. There are no subscale scores or a total score. The number of weekly episodes of going ≥ 4 waking hours without eating will be used to assess the amount of dietary restriction occurring throughout the course of treatment as compared to baseline dietary restriction for the participant.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire (EDE-Q)</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed before each weekly treatment session throughout treatment duration (12 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire measures eating pathology. The EDE-Q yields four subscale scores: Restraint, Eating Concern, Shape Concern, and Weight Concern. The possible score range for each subscale is 0 to 6. The total score may also be reported (determined by averaging the subscale scores); the score range for the total score is also 0 to 6. For subscale scores and total score, higher scores indicate more severe pathology. The restraint sub-scale of the EDE-Q will be used to assess utilization of skills related to reducing dietary restraint.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Feedback Questionnaire (FQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed at weekly treatment sessions throughout treatment duration (12 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The feedback questionnaire asks qualitative questions about the application. The feedback questionnaire does not report either subscale scores or a total score. The FQ will be used to obtain qualitative acceptability ratings.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Technology Acceptance Model Scale (TAMS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed at weekly treatment sessions throughout treatment duration (12 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The Technology Acceptance Model Scale measures usefulness and ease of use of a technological product. The TAMS yields two subscale scores (usefulness and ease of use). The possible score range for each subscale is 6 to 49. Higher scores indicate greater usefulness and ease of use. The TAMS will be used to assess the perceived usefulness and perceived ease-of-use of the smartphone application to evaluate acceptability.</description>
