  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to examine the effects of regular exergaming for 8 weeks
      in 24 overweight/obese children and adolescents (10-17 years) on maximal aerobic fitness
      (VO2max) and physical activity levels measured before and after (8 weeks) intervention
      period, and in addition at follow-up (12 weeks). We also wish to investigate the effects on
      markers of cardio metabolic health and body composition, measured at baseline, 8 weeks and 12
      weeks follow-up.

      Also, the participants gaming frequency will be registered throughout the 8 week period, as
      well as during the follow-up between 8 and 12 weeks. Aim of this study is to investigate if
      access to this game can provide health benefits for overweight/obese children and
      adolescents.
