      &quot;SunnysidePlus&quot; will functionally integrate a web based intervention targeting skills to
      promote and support breastfeeding, manage mood,and prevent depression. Sunnyside Plus will
      build upon the previously tested &quot;Sunnyside&quot; intervention which targeted skills to manage
      mood through an interactive website with didactic material and tools. Women in weeks 20-28 of
      their pregnancy will be randomized to receive either Sunnyside Plus or Sunnyside. The
      Sunnyside intervention will consist of 6 weeks of online lessons during pregnancy and booster
      sessions at 2 weeks, 4 weeks, and 6 weeks postpartum. Sunnyside Plus will include additional
      education and support to improve breastfeeding outcomes. Breastfeeding education and skills
      will be provided during the 6 weeks of online lessons during pregnancy. Breastfeeding support
      will continue through 6 weeks postpartum. This postpartum support will involve weekly online
      lessons, text support, and video support calls with a Lactation Educator provided on an
      as-needed basis. SunnysidePlus has the potential to provide a novel paradigm for improving
      breastfeeding outcomes and preventing depression; one that is accessible, highly scalable and
      cost-effective.
