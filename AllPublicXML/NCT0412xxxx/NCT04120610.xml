  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients scheduled for peripheral vascular examination and healthy controls will be measured
      with the FlowMet-R, a noninvasive blood flow monitor, and compared to gold standard
      diagnostics - ABI, TBI, and Doppler Ultrasound. Sensitivity and specificity of the FlowMet-R
      device output in diagnosing PAD and CLI will be assessed on initial visit, 3-month followup,
      and 6-month followup.

        The PAD cohort population is persons who have known or suspected peripheral artery disease,
        and are being seen at a vascular clinic for evaluation.

        The Healthy cohort population is adult persons over 40 without history of PAD and who are
        not currently suspected of suffering from PAD.
