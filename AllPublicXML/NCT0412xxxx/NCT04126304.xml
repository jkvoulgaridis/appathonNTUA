  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In recent years, mycoplasma pneumoniae caused more than 30% of respiratory infections in
      children in China, among which the detection rate of drug-resistant mycoplasma pneumoniae was
      higher than 90%. Pediatricians are facing great challenges.

      In this study, a total of 2312 clinical cases were expected to be collected, including 1160
      cases of outpatient respiratory infection including common cold, acute bronchitis and cough
      after infection, and 1152 cases of hospitalized community-acquired pneumonia, through uniform
      enrollment in 11 multi-centers for 1 year. Clinical data and respiratory samples were
      collected and clinical follow-up was completed.To investigate the infection rate and drug
      resistance gene of mycoplasma pneumoniae in children's respiratory tract infection.To
      evaluate the effectiveness of azithromycin in the treatment of mycoplasma pneumoniae
      respiratory infection.The early prediction model of refractory mycoplasma pneumoniae was
      established.To explore the clinical value of colloidal gold in early diagnosis of mycoplasma
      pneumoniae infection

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research center is a cross-sectional investigation and study, 8 centers including
      Shanghai children's medical center recruit the outpatient respiratory infection cases into
      the group, 6 centers including Shanghai children's medical recruit children with
      community-acquired pneumonia in hospital into the group All of the above cases in the group
      relevant clinical datas are collected, and complete clinical follow-up.Pharyngeal swabs or
      sputum specimens collected during the study were sent to Shanghai children's medical center
      for the detection of MP and macrolidene drug resistance genes.

      Azithromycin was administered orally or intravenously to outpatients who tested positive for
      mycoplasma pneumoniae by colloidal gold method.Finally, MP infection rate of children with
      respiratory diseases including outpatient (common cold, acute bronchitis and cough after
      infection) and hospitalization (community-acquired pneumonia) was statistically observed.The
      detection rate of MP macrolides drug resistance gene was isolated from respiratory disease
      cases.Sensitivity and specificity of MP rapid detection method (antigen and antibody
      detection rapid colloidal gold method) for diagnosis of MP infection;Effectiveness of
      azithromycin in treatment of MRMP infection.

    <description>In 2011, the European society of respiratory diseases (ERS) defined acute disease in patients with non-chronic lung disease. Symptoms include cough, with or without expectoration of phlegm, and other symptoms and signs may indicate lower respiratory tract infection and cannot be explained by other diseases (e.g., sinusitis, asthma).The main symptoms of acute bronchitis are cough, may be accompanied by fever, fatigue, asthma and dyspnea.</description>
