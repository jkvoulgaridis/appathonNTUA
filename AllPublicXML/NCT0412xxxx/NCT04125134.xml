  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single site, prospective, cross-sectional, controlled clinical study on a total of
      66 subjects. The subjects are divided into two groups: Hypertonic Saline Non-Responders (33
      subjects) and Hypertonic Saline Responders (33 subjects). After completion of questionnaires,
      the subjects will undergo Dry Eye Disease testing and functional nerve testing. Subjects who
      qualify will be dispensed 4 weeks of preservative free artificial tears and instructed to
      instill one drop into each eye twice daily. Subjects will return for a follow up visit 4
      weeks later (± 4 days), during which subjects will complete the questionnaires again and the
      Dry Eye Disease tests and functional nerve tests will be repeated.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in SANDE severity score response from visit 1 to visit 2</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The SANDE questionnaire is a paper and pencil questionnaire consisting of two questions (1. severity of dry eye disease symptoms and 2. frequency of dry eye disease symptoms), which are answered on a continuous visual analogue scale. The severity response from visit 2 will be subtracted from that given in visit 1 to provide a subject change. The results of those in the hypertonic saline response group will be compared to those within the hypertonic non-response group.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in tear break up time from visit 1 to visit 2</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The tear break up time is a measure of the stability of the tear film. The measurement from visit 2 will be subtracted from that given in visit 1 to provide a subject change. The results of those in the hypertonic saline response group will be compared to those within the hypertonic non-response group.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Schirmer test from visit 1 to visit 2</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Schirmer test is a measure of tear production. The measurement from visit 2 will be subtracted from that given in visit 1 to provide a subject change. The results of those in the hypertonic saline response group will be compared to those within the hypertonic non-response group.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in meibomian gland expression from visit 1 to visit 2</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Meibomian gland expression allows for a measure of the health of the meibomian glands. The measurement from visit 2 will be subtracted from that given in visit 1 to provide a subject change. The results of those in the hypertonic saline response group will be compared to those within the hypertonic non-response group.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in proparacaine challenge test from visit 1 to visit 2</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The proparacaine challenge test allows for a measure of the amount of peripheral neuropathic pain compared to centralized neuropathic pain. The measurement from visit 2 will be subtracted from that given in visit 1 to provide a subject change. The results of those in the hypertonic saline response group will be compared to those within the hypertonic non-response group.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in hypertonic saline response test from visit 1 to visit 2</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The hypertonic saline response is expected to be able to assess the severity of dry eye disease. The measurement from visit 2 will be subtracted from that given in visit 1 to provide a subject change. The results of those in the hypertonic saline response group will be compared to those within the hypertonic non-response group.</description>
