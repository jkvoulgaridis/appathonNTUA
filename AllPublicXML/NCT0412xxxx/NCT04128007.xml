    <measure>Scalp Investigator Global Assessment Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Achievement of a Scalp IGA score of 'Clear' or 'Almost Clear' plus a 2-grade improvement from Baseline. This global assessment scale has five severity grades reported from 0-4 and defined as Clear (0), Almost Clear (1), Mild (2), Moderate (3), Severe (4).</description>

    <measure>Psoriasis Scalp Severity Index-50 score change</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>Achieve a 50% reduction in Psoriasis Scalp Severity Index (PSSI) from Baseline. The PSSI measures the extent of psoriasis involvement and the severity of erythema, induration, and desquamation of the scalp. Involvement and severity of psoriasis for the PSSI is scored using a scale of 0 to 72, where 0 = no psoriasis and higher scores indicating more severe disease.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Psoriasis Area Severity Index-50 score change</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>Achieve a 50% reduction in Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI) from Baseline. PASI combines the assessment of the severity of lesions and the area affected into single score in the range of 0 (no disease) to 72 (maximal disease). The body is divided into 4 sections (head, arms, trunk, legs); each area is scored by itself and scores are combined into the final PASI. For each section, the percent of area of skin involved is estimated: 0 (0%) to 6 (90% - 100%). For each section percent area of skin involved was estimated: 0 (0%) to 6 (90 - 100%), and severity was estimated by clinical signs: erythema, induration, and desquamation; scale: 0 (none) to 4 (maximum). Final PASI = sum of severity parameters for each section * area score * weight of section (head: 0.1, arms: 0.2, body: 0.3, legs: 0.4).</description>

The PSSI measures the extent of psoriasis involvement and the severity of erythema, induration, and desquamation of the scalp.

SI-NRS is a subject-reported severity of itch at its highest intensity during the previous 24-hour period.
