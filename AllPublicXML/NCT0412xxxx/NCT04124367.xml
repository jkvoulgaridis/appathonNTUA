  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is a leading cause of adult long-term disability worldwide. Recovery of arm and hand
      function after stroke is limited to about 50% of patients and full recovery is achieved in
      only 12% of stroke survivors by 6 months after stroke. Within the first 8-12 weeks
      post-stroke, a proportional recovery of 70%, corresponding to good recovery, may be achieved,
      but at later stages no major gain is observed with current therapy practices. Accordingly,
      there is a need to find new potential therapeutic tools to enhance post-stroke motor
      recovery. Rehabilitation supported by neuroplastic intervention is a new and pragmatic
      therapeutic approach in the treatment of stroke, giving way to a concept of 'recovery
      enhancers'.

      The objective of this study is to assess whether an additional therapy with Cerebrolysin and
      anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (atDCS) increases the success of conventional
      rehabilitation therapy in subacute and chronic stroke patients with unexploited potential for
      functional recovery despite intact structural and functional pathways in the brain.

      Hypothesis:

      The hypothesis is that the combination of Cerebrolysin and atDCS facilitates motor learning
      in subacute and chronic stroke patients. Accordingly, motor function recovery at day 21
      post-baseline is expected to be higher in the verum group (conventional rehabilitation +
      task-specific motor training + Cerebrolysin + atDCS) as compared to the control group
      (conventional rehabilitation + task-specific motor training + placebo + sham-transcranial
      direct current stimulation).

      The primary objective is to show a significantly higher proportional recovery rate in the
      Action Research Arm Test (ARAT) at day 21 post-baseline in the verum group as compared to the
      control group.

      The secondary objective is to assess the impact of this neuroplastic intervention on finger
      dexterity (Nine-hole peg test - 9HPT), hand grip strength, and neurological deficits
      (National Institutes of Healths Stroke Scale - NIHSS) at the end of therapy (day 21
      post-baseline). Safety data are collected throughout the study and thereafter in case of
      ongoing serious adverse events (SAEs) at study endpoint.

      Optional secondary parameters include electroencephalography (EEG) parameters and Brain
      Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) status analyses to document plastic changes in the brain,
      in particular changes of the cortical network functionality during neurorehabilitation, and
      to assess the impact of neuroplastic intervention on the BDNF synthesis rate as well as the
      influence of different BDNF polymorphisms.

    <measure>Action Research Arm Test (ARAT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 21</time_frame>
    <description>The ARAT assesses upper limb functioning. The ARAT consists of 19 items grouped into four subscales: grasp, grip, pinch, and gross movement. The total score on the ARAT ranges from 0 to 57, with the lowest score indicating that no movements can be performed, and the upper score indicating normal performance.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Nine-Hole Peg Test (NHPT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 21</time_frame>
    <description>The NHPT is used to measure finger dexterity. The NHPT is composed of a square board with 9 pegs. At one end of the board are holes for the pegs to fit in to, and at the other end is a shallow round dish to store the pegs. The NHPT is administered by asking the patient to take the pegs from a container, one by one, and placing them into the holes on the board, as quickly as possible. Patients must then remove the pegs from the holes, one by one, and replace them back into the container. Patients are scored based on the time taken to complete the test activity, recorded in seconds.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Hand grip dynamometry</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 21</time_frame>
    <description>Hand grip dynamometry measures grip strength. The best out of three strength tests of the impaired hand is used as resultant score. A score is taken with the non-affected hand, followed by the impaired hand.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 21</time_frame>
    <description>The NIHSS is a 15-item impairment scale, intended to evaluate neurologic outcome and degree of recovery for patients with stroke. Total scores on the NIHSS range from 0 - 42, with higher values reflecting more severe cerebral infarcts and correspondingly more severe neurological impairment.</description>
