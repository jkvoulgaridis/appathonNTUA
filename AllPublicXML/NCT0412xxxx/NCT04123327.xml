    <textblock>
      A cross-sectional study (N=400) will investigate the prevalence of symptom preoccupation and
      its role in AF-related disability. Subjectively-rated assessments will be gathered from 400
      AF patients.

    <textblock>
      In the present study we aim to investigate symptom preoccupation in patients with atrial
      fibrillation (AF) to further improve the understanding of the role of psychological factors
      in AF-related disability. A cross-sectional study (N=400) will investigate the prevalence of
      symptom preoccupation and its role in AF-related disability. Subjectively-rated assessments
      will be gathered from 400 AF patients.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>[Time Frame: From baseline to 12 weeks] Atrial Fibrillation Effect on Quality-of-Life (AFEQT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>AFEQT is an atrial fibrillation-specific measure that taps into the QoL-domains: symptoms, daily activities, treatment concern, and treatment satisfaction. The scale has 20 items, with the total score ranging from 0 (severe symptoms and disability) to 100 (no symptoms and disability), with responses provided on a seven-point rating scale from &quot;no limitations/symptoms&quot; to &quot;severe limitations/symptoms&quot;.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cardiac Anxiety Questionnaire (CAQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>It an 18-item scale that measures cardiac anxiety by three subscales fear (e.g., &quot;When my heart is beating fast I get frightened&quot; avoidance (e.g., I avoid exercise or other physical work) and attention (e.g., I pay attention to my heart beat). The responses are given on a four-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (never) to 4 (always), a greater score indicates greater cardiac anxiety.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Measures depressive symptoms on nine items scoring from 0 (not at all) to 3 (nearly every day) per item. Scores were categorized as follows: zero to minimal depressive symptoms (0-4), mild to moderate depressive symptoms (5-10), or severe depressive symptoms (10 or above).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) scale measures the severity of worry and anxiety. In healthy controls, the mean score was 4.9 (SD=4.8); a score of 10 or greater on the scale corresponds to a cut-off point for identifying cases of GAD.</description>

  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The University of Toronto Atrial Fibrillation Severity Scale (AFSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>AFSS will assess AF symptoms and how affected the patient is by AF-specific symptoms such as dyspnea, palpitations etc. The AF symptom score ranges from 0-35 with a higher score indicating higher symptom severity.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Symptoms Checklist, Frequency and Severity Scale (SCL)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>SCL is a disease specific checklist used to measure AF-related symptoms (e.g., palpitations, dizziness) on two subscales: symptom severity (mild to extreme; 16 items, scores ranging from 0 to 48) and symptom frequency (never to always; 16 items, scores ranging from 0 to 64) over the past four weeks. Higher scores correlate with more frequent and severe symptoms.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-4)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>To assess stress sensitivity and perception of stress. Each item is rated on a five-point scale and a higher score corresponds to more perceived stress.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule (WHODAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>WHODAS is a reliable and well validated measure of general health and disability. We use the version consisting of 12-items evaluating six domains: cognition, mobility, self-care, getting along, life activities and life participation. Each item is rated on a 5-point scale, with higher scores indicating increased disability.</description>
