  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of Kinesio tape on delayed onset muscle
      soreness of the biceps muscle of your arm following strenuous exercise of the bicep muscle.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants will complete 4 testing sessions that will be held on 4 separate days (Baseline,
      Eccentric Exercise day, 48 hours post exercise, and 72 hours post exercise). All sessions
      will take place in the National Institute of Fitness and Sport, where the Department of
      Kinesiology laboratories are located.

      During the first session (Baseline), the purpose and procedures of the research will be
      explained by the investigator, co-investigator, or a research assistant in more detail.
      Participants will read and sign the informed consent form and then undergo an
      exclusion/inclusion criteria assessment which includes the Physical Activity Readiness
      Questionnaire (PAR-Q), and brief questionnaire. All study personnel/staff obtaining informed
      consent will be trained in the responsible conduct of research. All participants will be
      asked if they have a known allergy to Kinesio Tape (KT) or if they have sensitive skin. Those
      with sensitive skin will be administered an allergy test. After screening and enrollment,
      participants will complete baseline assessments of muscle pain and function, pain
      sensitivity, and psychological risk factors (See outcome measures).

      During Session 2, strength of the non-dominant bicep will be measured first. Participants
      will then perform an eccentric exercise protocol designed to induce delayed onset muscle
      soreness (DOMS) on the non-dominant arm. Strength of the non-dominant bicep will be measured
      immediately post the eccentric exercise protocol. At the end of this session, subjects will
      be randomly assigned to one of two intervention groups (experimental KT group, placebo KT
      group) or a control group (i.e., no intervention performed). The experimental group will
      receive KT with proper technique and tension (10-20%), while the placebo group will receive
      KT without technique and tension.

      Sessions 3 and 4 will occur approximately 48 and 72 hours post Session 2, respectively. All
      the outcome variables will be measured during these sessions. For participants in the KT
      groups, the tape will be removed at the end of session 4, as described below.

    <measure>Change in pain during elbow extension and elbow flexion</measure>
    <time_frame>This measure will be assessed at baseline and 48 hours and 72 hours following completion of the eccentric exercise protocol</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects will perform the following elbow movements: 1) moving from a fully flexed starting position through active range of motion to full extension 2) moving from a fully extended starting position through active range of motion to full flexion. Ratings of muscle pain intensity will be assessed following each contraction using a 0-100 scale, with &quot;0&quot; indicating &quot;no pain&quot; and &quot;100&quot; indicating the &quot;most intense pain imaginable&quot;.</description>

    <measure>Change in pressure pain threshold of the affected biceps</measure>
    <time_frame>This measure will be assessed at baseline and 48 hours and 72 hours following completion of the eccentric exercise protocol</time_frame>
    <description>Using a hand-held, clinical grade pressure algometer (Wagner Instruments, Greenwich, CT), pressure will be applied to the biceps brachii muscle of the affected (non-dominant) arm while the arm is stationary at approximately 90 degrees of elbow flexion. Pressure will increase at a rate of about 1kg/s until the subject first reports feeling pain.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Active Total Elbow Range of Motion (AT-ROM)</measure>
    <time_frame>This measure will be assessed at baseline and 48 hours and 72 hours following completion of the eccentric exercise protocol</time_frame>
    <description>AT-ROM in elbow flexion and extension of the elbow joint will be measured with a standard goniometer and the subject in the supine position on a padded table. The subject is instructed to flex and extend the non-dominant arm at the elbow &quot;as far as you can&quot;. Elbow flexion and extension is assessed in the sagittal plane with the arm parallel to the trunk and in the anatomic position. The center fulcrum of the goniometer is placed over the lateral epicondyle of the humerus. The stationary arm of the goniometer is fixed along the lateral midline of the humerus in line with the acromion process and the moving arm along the lateral midline of the radius in the line with the styloid. Three measurements of active elbow flexion and extension will be conducted at each assessment time point, with the average of the three measurements used as the outcome measure for each time point.</description>

    <measure>Change in Maximal Strength of non-dominant bicep.</measure>
    <time_frame>This measure will be assessed at baseline and 48 hours and 72 hours following completion of the eccentric exercise protocol</time_frame>
    <description>Maximal strength will be assessed by performing a maximal contraction with the arm flexed at 90 degrees. The participant will be seated on a Biodex strength testing machine, with both feet on a support and the upper arm supported at 45 degrees of shoulder flexion by a padded support arm, with the forearm flexed at 90 degrees during the contraction. Three maximal contractions will be performed at 60 degrees per second with 60 seconds of rest between trials.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Self-reported function of the affected arm</measure>
    <time_frame>This measure will be assessed at baseline and 48 hours and 72 hours following completion of the eccentric exercise protocol</time_frame>
    <description>The QuickDASH focuses on the subject's ability to use the affected arm during activities of daily living [23,24]. Subjects rate their symptoms and ability to perform specific tasks using a 5-pt hierarchical Likert scale. A score of zero represents no dysfunction at all, while higher scores represent more limitations in self-reported function, with a score of 100 being the highest possible score.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain catastrophizing</measure>
    <time_frame>This instrument will be administered at baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Will be measured with the Pain Catastrophizing Scale. It is a self-report measure, consisting of 13 items scored from 0 to 4, resulting in a total possible score of 52. The higher the score, the more catastrophizing thoughts are present.</description>

    <measure>Fear of movement or reinjury</measure>
    <time_frame>This instrument will be administered at baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Will be measured with the Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia -- (TSK-11). total TSK-11 scores range from 11-44 points with higher scores indicating greater fear of pain, movement, and injury.</description>

    <description>Tape will be applied to the biceps muscle of the nondominant arm from approximately the shoulder to the elbow for up to 72 hours. For the KT group taping will be applied with a lymphatic application method according to the guidelines recommended by Kenzo Kase. This type of application is known to improve blood and lymphatic circulation which enhances the removal of metabolic products. The tape will be applied with a tension of 10-20%.</description>
