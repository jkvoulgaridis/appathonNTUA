        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  1. Pathologically (histologically or cytologically) confirmed diagnosis of recurrent
             or second primary squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the head and neck. Known p16 status
             for oropharynx carcinoma.

             2.Patients must have had prior radiation for head and neck SCC with ≥ 75% of the
             present tumor volume in areas that have been previously irradiated to at least 45 Gy
             or the intersection between the first irradiation and the reirradiation fields had to
             be greater than 65%.

             3. Patients with at least one high risk factors after salvage surgery ①positive
             margin; ②close margin（&lt;5mm); ③ENE;④PNI;⑤LVI; ⑤ rStaging III-IV( AJCC 8th).

             4. No macroscopic residual disease after salvage surgery.

             5.No distant metastasis.

             6.Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG) performance scale: 0-1.

             7.Adequate organ and bone marrow function: CBC: absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1.5
             × 10^9 / L; platelet count (PLT) ≥ 80 × 10^9 / L; hemoglobin content (HGB) ≥ 8.0 g /
             dL.

        aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ≤ 2.5 × ULN.

        8.Female subject of childbearing potential should have a negative urine or serum pregnancy
        test ＜ 72 hours prior to receiving the first dose of study medication. If the urine test is
        positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will be required.

        9.Female subjects of childbearing potential should be willing to use 2 methods of birth
        control or be surgically sterile or abstain from heterosexual activity for the course of
        study therapy through 120 days after the last dose of study medication. Subjects of

        free from menses ＞ 1 year.

        10.Male subjects should agree to use an adequate method of contraception starting with the
        first dose of study therapy through 120 days after the last dose of the study therapy.

             childhood asthma, type I diabetes mellitus and hypothyroidism only requiring hormone
             replacement, or skin disorders (such as vitiligo, psoriasis, or alopecia) not
             requiring systemic treatment.

             3.Subjects who are using systemic immunosuppressive agents and continue the dose
             within 2 weeks prior to the enrollment.

             4.Is currently participating in and receiving study therapy or has participated in a
             study of an investigational agent and received study therapy or used an
             investigational device within 4 weeks prior to randomization.

             5.There have been other malignant tumors in the past 5 years, except the cured skin
             basal cell carcinoma, cervical carcinoma in situ and superficial bladder cancer.

             6.Prior therapy with anti-PD-1,anti-PD-L1,anti-CTLA4 antibody.

             controlled severe infection Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection (HIV antibody
             positive) Known acute or chronic active hepatitis B (HBV DNA positive) infection or

             hypertension (SBP ≥ 160mmHg or DBP ≥ 100mmHg) Prior arterial thromboembolism event,
             including myocardial infarction, unstable angina, stroke, and transient ischemic

             8.Upon the judgment by the investigator, subjects have other factors that possibly
             cause the halfway-termination of this study, such as other serious illnesses
             (including mental illness) requiring concomitant treatment, serious laboratory
             abnormalities, with family or social factors, which may influence the safety of the
