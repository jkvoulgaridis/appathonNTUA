  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The design of a phase I, open-label, dose finding study was chosen in order to establish a
      safe and tolerated dose of single agent WVT078 in patients relapses and/or refractory
      Multiple Myeloma (MM)

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This first-in-human trial with WVT078 is a dose escalation study whose primary purpose is to
      characterize the safety, tolerability, and determine recommended dose regimen(s) of WVT078 in
      subjects with MM who have received two or more standard of care lines of therapy including an
      IMID, a proteasome inhibitor, and an anti-CD38 agent (if available) and are relapsed and/or
      refractory to or intolerant of each regimen. In addition, this study will assess preliminary
      anti-MM response of and characterize the pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity of WVT078. The
      results of this study will inform the future development of WVT078 as a treatment for
      relapsed and/or refractory MM.
