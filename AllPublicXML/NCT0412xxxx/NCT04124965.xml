    <description>An Adverse Event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product, which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE could therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product.</description>

    <time_frame>From Baseline at each scheduled assessment during Treatment and Observation Periods (up to Week 60)</time_frame>
    <description>The total MG-ADL score is obtained by summing the responses to each individual item (8 items; Grades: 0, 1, 2, 3). The score ranges from 0 to 24, with a higher score indicating more disability.

    <time_frame>From Baseline at each scheduled assessment during Treatment and Observation Periods (up to Week 60)</time_frame>
    <description>The total MG-Composite score is obtained by summing the responses to each individual item (10 items; Grade:0-9 depending on item). The score ranges from 0 to 50, with lower scores indicating lower disease activity.</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline in Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis (QMG) score at each scheduled assessment during Treatment and Observation Periods</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline at each scheduled assessment during Treatment and Observation Periods (up to Week 60)</time_frame>
    <description>The total QMG score is obtained by summing the responses to each individual item (13 items; Responses: None=0, Mild=1, Moderate=2, Severe=3). The score ranges from 0 to 39, with lower scores indicating lower disease activity.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of participants using rescue medication (intravenous infusion of immunoglobulin G (IVIg) or plasma exchange (PEX)) during the study</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline at each scheduled assessment during Treatment and Observation Periods (up to Week 60)</time_frame>
    <description>Rescue therapy for the study will consist of IVIg or PEX. Study participants who experience disease worsening (eg, an increase of 2 points on the MG-ADL or 3 points on the QMG scale between 2 consecutive visits) may be considered for rescue therapy at the discretion of the Investigator.</description>

    <ipd_description>Data from this study may be requested by qualified researchers six months after product approval in the US and/or Europe, or global development is discontinued, and 18 months after trial completion. Investigators may request access to anonymized IPD and redacted study documents which may include: raw datasets, analysis-ready datasets, study protocol, blank case report form, annotated case report form, statistical analysis plan, dataset specifications, and clinical study report. Prior to use of the data, proposals need to be approved by an independent review panel at www.clinicalstudydatarequest.com and a signed data sharing agreement will need to be executed. All documents are available in English only, for a pre-specified time, typically 12 months, on a password protected portal. This plan may change if a determination is made that the data cannot be adequately anonymized.</ipd_description>
