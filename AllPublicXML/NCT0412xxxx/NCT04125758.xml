  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic stress has been shown to impact long-term emotional and physical health. When nearly
      three-quarters of Americans report stress at levels that exceed what they consider healthy,
      there is a desperate need to understand factors that contribute to effective stress
      regulation. This work seeks to develop a measure tied to awareness and acceptance of stress
      that has shown promise as a predictor of multiple markers of mental and physical well-being,
      understand how it relates to awareness of the body, and explore whether it can be trained to
      alleviate suffering and promote well-being. This study aims to 1) Conceptually replicate and
      extend previous findings linking greater stress-physiology coherence to higher well-being. 2)
      Assess whether awareness of physiology is associated with stress-physiology coherence. 3)
      Explore whether stress-physiology coherence can be trained through a brief mindfulness
      training intervention.

    <measure>Change in subjective stress-heart rate coherence</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and post-test, separated by 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Within-participant association between repeated measures of subjective stress (1-100 Visual Analog Scale rating) and heart rate over the course of a stress-induction paradigm. Stronger positive associations indicate higher stress-heart rate coherence.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change in Accuracy on Method of Constant Stimuli (MCS) Interoceptive Accuracy Task</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and post-test, separated by 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will complete a modified version of the MCS heart beat detection task used by Brener, Ring, and Liu. Participants will be asked to report whether a series of five tones are simultaneous with five of their heart beats. Each trial involves five heart beats. Each heart beat is followed by a tone, and the lag between heart beat and tone is varied across trials with five delay conditions: 0 ms, 100 ms, 200 ms, 300 ms, 400 ms, or 500 ms. Thus, each trial involves five beat-tone pairs, separated according to a single delay condition. Delays will be pseudorandomly presented across trials. Varying delays allow for individual differences in when participants perceive their heart beat. A continuous measure of judgement precision is defined as the participant's interquartile range (IQR) of the distribution of percent of simultaneous responses for each delay condition. IQR ranges from 0 to 450. Lower IQRs indicate more consistent responses and thus higher accuracy.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change in Meta-Awareness Measured on a Method of Constant Stimuli Light-Tone Task</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and post-test, separated by 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will complete a Method of Constant Stimuli (MCS) light-tone task. Participants will be asked to report whether a series of five tones are simultaneous with five light flashes. Each trial involves five light-tone pairs. Each light flash is followed by a tone, and the lag between light flash and tone is varied across trials with five delay conditions: 0 ms, 100 ms, 200 ms, 300 ms, 400 ms, or 500 ms. Thus, each trial involves five light-tone pairs, separated according to a single delay condition. Delays will be pseudorandomly presented across trials. After each trial in the task, participants will be asked how confident they are in their response on a simple likert scale ranging from 1 = not at all confident to 4 = completely confident. Meta-awareness is defined as the correlation between accurate responses (simultaneous judgements at the 0 ms delay) and confidence ratings. Scores thus range from -1 to 1. Higher scores indicate more meta-awareness.</description>
