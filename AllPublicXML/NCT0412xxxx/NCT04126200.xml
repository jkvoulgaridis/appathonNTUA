  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA) is a target present on tumor cells in participants with
      multiple myeloma. Belantamab mafodotin (GSK2857916); also referred to as GSK'916; is an
      antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) containing humanized anti-BCMA monoclonal antibody (mAb). This
      is a phase I/II, randomized, open-label, platform study designed to evaluate the effects of
      GSK'916 (belantamab mafodotin) in combination with other anti-cancer drugs in participants
      with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM). The Platform design incorporates a single
      master protocol, where multiple treatment combinations, as sub-studies, will be evaluated
      simultaneously. This study will include two parts; dose exploration (DE) and cohort expansion
      (CE). In the DE phase, the safety and tolerability profile of GSK'916 (belantamab mafodotin)
      will be evaluated when administered in combination with other anti-cancer agents. This may
      identify a recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) for each partner, as well as efficacy of each
      combination. The CE phase of the study will evaluate the clinical activity of the
      combinations in comparison to monotherapy in additional participants with RRMM.

    <intervention_model_description>There will be a DE phase which will evaluate the safety and tolerability profile of GSK'916 (belantamab mafodotin) when administered in combination with other anti-cancer treatments. A RP2D for each combination treatment will be identified based on the safety and preliminary efficacy in DE. This will be followed by a CE phase which will evaluate the clinical activity of the combination treatment in comparison to GSK'916 (belantamab mafodotin) monotherapy in additional participants.</intervention_model_description>
