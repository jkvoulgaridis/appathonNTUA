  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fifth metatarsal stress fracture is a failure of a healthy metatarsal bone subject to
      repetitive microdamages. It has a high prevalence in soccer players and is classified as a
      high-risk stress fracture. Based on Torg classification, the treatment options may be
      conservative or surgical. The recent increase of evidences about Shock Wave Treatment in
      different bone pathologies, including stress fractures, suggests the possibility to use this
      conservative intervention option also in patients candidate for surgery. This randomized
      clinical trial included 18 soccer players diagnosed of proximal fifth metatarsal stress
      fracture, randomly matched in Surgery group and Shock Wave group. Patients of Surgery group
      were treated with intramedullary screw fixation; patients of Shock Wave group received 3
      weekly sessions of Focused Shock Wave Treatment (F-ESWT), using an electrohydraulic device
      set to an energy flux density (EFD) of 0.21 mJ/mm2 and 2000 impulses. Patients of both groups
      were followed monthly until their return to play (RTP) using radiography, Visual Analogue
      Scale (VAS), Tegner Activity Level Scale and AOFAS score.

    <description>Tegner activity scale grades the daily life activities and recreational and professional sports practice. A score of 0 represents sick leave or disability pension because of knee problems, whereas a score of 10 corresponds to participation in national and international elite competitive sports &gt;6 score can only be achieved if the person participates in recreational or competitive sport.</description>
