  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During the study period, any patient who enters labour and reports to the maternity ward and
      meets the inclusion and non-inclusion criteria is offered to participate in the study by the
      midwife acupuncturist present.

      After signing the informed consent, a numbered envelope with the randomization arm is
      assigned to the patient. The acupuncturist midwife does not perform the delivery herself. At
      the time of the expulsive efforts, she punctures the point drawn at random. The patient's
      participation in the study ends when she leaves the labour room after the birth.

      During the study period, any patient who enters labour and reports to the maternity ward and
      meets the inclusion and non-inclusion criteria is offered to participate in the study by the
      midwife acupuncturist present. She's responsible for explaining the purpose and
      practicalities of the study orally and issues a written information document. The information
      provided is the same regardless of the midwife present. If she agrees to participate in the
      study, the patient signs the consent form.

      After signing the informed consent, a numbered envelope with the randomization arm is
      assigned to the patient. The acupuncturist midwife does not perform the delivery herself. At
      the time of the expulsive efforts, she punctures the point drawn at random. She collects the
      clinical Research Form from the time the patient signs the consent form until she leaves the
      labour room after the birth.

      The patient's participation in the study ends when she leaves the labour room after the
      birth. No further follow-up is planned.
