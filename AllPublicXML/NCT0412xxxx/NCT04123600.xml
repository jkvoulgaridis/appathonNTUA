  <brief_summary>

      The aim of the study is to monitor the performance of the Signature Orthopaedics Origin Stem
      and Logical Acetabular Cup as part of post-market vigilance and continuous improvement
      efforts.

      The objective of this PMCF study is to collect data confirming safety, performance and
      clinical benefits of the Origin Stem and Logical Cup when used for primary total hip
      arthroplasty at 2 years follow-up. This prospective follow-up series is necessary to obtain
      data specific to the Origin Stem and Logical Cup considering their relatively recent launch
      to the market.

      The study includes pre-operative, operative, discharge, 1 year post-operative and 2 year
      post-operative evaluations, where data concerning the performance and safety of the device
      are gathered. In particular, the revision rate of the components will be monitored as the
      primary objective, along with pre- and post-operative measurement of the Oxford Hip Score
      (OHS) patient-reported outcome measure (PROM) to quantify patient satisfaction, and
      radiographic analysis to monitor bony response to the implant and qualify the effectiveness
      of the cementless fixation.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  patient has active infection or sepsis (treated or untreated)

          -  patient has any vascular insufficiency, muscular atrophy, or neuromuscular disease
             severe enough to compromise implant stability or postoperative recovery.

          -  patient is female of child-bearing age and not taking contraceptive precautions

          -  patient has inadequate bone stock to support the device (e.g. severe osteopenia,
