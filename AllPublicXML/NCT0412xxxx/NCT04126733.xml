  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn if combination of the two drugs regorafenib and
      nivolumab is an effective treatment for pMMR - MSS colorectal cancer, a special type of
      cancer of the colon or rectum (pMMR stands for proficient Mismatch Repair; MSS stands for
      Microsatellite Stable) and whether it is safe for patients. Regorafenib works by blocking
      several different proteins involved in tumor growth. Nivolumab is an immunotherapy drug
      encouraging the body's own immune system to attack cancer cells.

      Both drugs have been approved, but not for how they are being used as combination therapy in
      this study. Brand name of regorafenib is Stivarga; brand name of nivolumab is Opdivo.
