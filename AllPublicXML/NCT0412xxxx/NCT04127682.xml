  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Antibiotics are one of the most commonly prescribed drugs in pediatric care all over the
      world. Over prescription of antibiotics is a major public health problem and the most
      important factor in the emergence of antibiotic resistance.

      In Egypt, a recent study conducted in El-Minya governorate to investigate antibiotic use in
      PHC centres and in governmental hospitals, revealed that physician prescriptions of
      antibiotics for ARIs were extremely high as 82% of pediatric visits for ARIs resulted in an
      antibiotic prescription. Most of these infections are caused by viruses and do not require
      antibiotic treatment.

      Numerous interventions to improve antibiotic prescribing practices have been reported from
      various countries with varying results. No single intervention appears to have superior
      efficacy, but combinations of interventions are typically more effective, and strategies that
      target health care professionals and/or patients (or parents of young children) have achieved
      success at reducing antibiotic prescriptions for ARIs.

      Despite the emergence of antibiotic resistance and international efforts to reduce antibiotic
      use, prescription still high and inappropriate. Children are a vulnerable group and
      inappropriate antibiotic prescription may affect their health and may contribute to
      development of many diseases as allergies beside emergence of antibiotic resistance. Also,
      most of acute respiratory infections in children are viral infections and they receive
      antibiotic for it. So, it is important to study the antibiotic prescription rates and pattern
      for this group and to find the factors related to this. Also, it is important to find
      effective intervention to ensure appropriate prescriptions.
