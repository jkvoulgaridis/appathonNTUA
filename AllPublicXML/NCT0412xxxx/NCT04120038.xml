  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of 14 weeks of the SMART Program on the
      walking capacity and confidence of individuals with unilateral lower limb amputation (LLA).
      Our primary hypothesis is that SMART can improve walking capacity in individuals with LLA.
      Our secondary hypothesis is that SMART can improve ambulation confidence, knowledge, and
      skills for self-management, depression, body image, pain, balance confidence, dynamic
      balance, activities of daily living, satisfaction with life and habit formation for walking
      in individuals with LLA.

      Participants will receive a tablet preloaded with a dedicated icon that enables direct
      connection to the SMART platform. In-person training on tablet use and the online SMART
      platform will be provided for participants. A 'quick startup' guide will be affixed to the
      back of the tablet. Participants will be asked to complete one education module per week at
      their own convenience over the 10-week intervention period. The educational modules include
      psychological adaptation, residual limb management, nutrition/weight control, managing a
      prosthetic limb, managing chronic conditions and enhancing mobility. The modules include
      instructional movies, goal setting logs, and quizzes. A module can be stopped or &quot;re-wound&quot;
      at any point, and the participant's place and work-to-date is automatically saved. The SMART
      platform will be asynchronously monitored through a web portal by the trainer, who will be a
      PhD candidate in Rehabilitation Sciences and observe participant progress and provide
      feedback if required. If there is no online activity within a 7-day (consecutive) period, the
      trainer will contact the participant to inquire the reasons for inactivity and troubleshoot
      any problems including technical issues.

      Clinical outcomes measures will be collected at three timepoints (T1-T3).
