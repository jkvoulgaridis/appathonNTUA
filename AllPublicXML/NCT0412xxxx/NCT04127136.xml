    <textblock>
      Outcomes of treatments for binge eating spectrum eating disorders are yet to yield desirable
      results, reporting up to 60-70% of patients remaining symptomatic at post-treatment.

      Adana City Training and Research Hospital Obesity Center is designed to provide
      multi-disciplinary health care services and training for groups of obese patients seeking
      professional help. The center includes a physician, dietitian, physiotherapist, psychologist,
      public relations officer, and a nurse acting as a life coach. Program is planned to carry
      initial assessment, health screening, necessary medical attention related to obesity,
      cognitive change, behavioral change, and sustainability activities. The initial assessment
      part consisted of one on one interviews of the patient with the physician, psychologist,
      dietitian, physiotherapist, and the nurse. Then, the patient is consulted with an
      endocrinologist, cardiologist, psychiatrist, and physical therapy and rehabilitation
      specialist to elucidate the significant factors that resulted in excessive weight gain and
      barriers in losing. Patients with severe or mismanaged medical conditions, including chronic
      diseases, neurological diseases, significant affective and psychotic disorders, and substance
      abuse or addiction disorders were directed to relevant clinics before registration. The
      patients who completed the screening are arranged into groups and weekly group meetings are
      planned. In two group meetings, basic medical knowledge and frequently asked questions are
      discussed. The center staff and the patients get acquinted. In the following twenty weeks,
      trainings by the physician, dietitian, psychologist and physiotherapist are conducted about
      medical information about obesity, using the technology to aid weight loss, what, when, how
      and why to eat, nutrition groups, ration management, water consumption, self-awareness,
      stress management, obesity and the association between the psychological processes, warming
      up and mobilization, correct stance and posture, and adequate physical activity. In addition
      to group meetings, in monthly individual meetings, the progress of the patients are
      evaluated.

      During the course of the program the patients with BED reported improvements in BED episodes
      and increased weight loss rate which give the idea to conduct a study. The primary goal of
      the study was to analyze the change in the severity of binge eating disorder in patients
      registered to the program. We expected to show a decrease in the frequency of the BED
      episodes in all the patients. The secondary goal includes the analysis of the context of the
      training program to compare the effectiveness of the topics and the methods.

      The study was a single-arm, prospective, quasi-experimental study with interrupted
      time-series design. There were no sampling methods; all patients registered to the center
      program with binge eating disorder and completed the acquaintance step were asked to be
      included. Inclusion criteria were having registered to the center for training, passed the
      first three steps, age between 18 to 65 years, a body mass index (BMI) equal to or over 30,
      and having binge eating disorder. Patients who failed to attend more than four pieces of
      training and complete a binge eating evaluation were excluded from the study. The training
      materials were developed by the trainers and edited by the author for the final version
      before training.

      The cases were analyzed for the change in the severity of binge eating disorder in the
      program. The data collection was performed via socio-demographic information form, binge
      eating disorder evaluation (BEDE) form, and progress record forms. BEDE was a structured form
      exclusively using DSM-5 BED diagnosis and the severity criteria1. Progress record form
      included weekly session content that was administered by a physician, dietitian,
      psychologist, and the physiotherapist and the monthly individual meetings data. BEDE and
      progress record forms were applied before the trainings that focuses on cognitive change and
      repeated every four weeks for 20 weeks. The patients were planned to receive 80 hours of
      training by the physician, dietitian, psychologist, and the physiotherapist.

    <description>The Binge eating disorder form, constructed exclusively using DSM-5 BED diagnosis and the severity criteria, was consisted of 12 questions, addressing major criteria including the characterization of recurrent episodes of binge eating and the sense of lack of control over eating during the episode, the feelings at the time and after eating, the presence of distress and finally the frequency. Based on the frequency of episodes, four severity groups were set according to the weekly episodes: mild, moderate, severe, and extreme, respectively. The first ten questions were in closed forms and designed to detect the presence or the characterization of the episodes. Answers with &quot;yes&quot; reflect the presence of the symptoms or the episodes and mean a worse outcome. The last two focus on the frequency of the symptoms. Higher scores mean a worse outcome. We expected the subjects to show a change in the severity of binge eating episodes.</description>
