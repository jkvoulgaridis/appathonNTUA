  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine if the clinical impression of clinicians, ie that patients are improving with
      the current treatment pathway for Dupuytren's (contracture release followed by radiation),
      can be substantiated with scientific evidence.

      This is an observational, pilot study. Participants will be treated according to a standard
      treatment pathway, which includes contracture release treatment modalities such as limited
      fasciectomy, PNA and CCH injection, followed by post-operative radiation. All enrolled
      participants will undergo radiation treatment as soon as possible following contracture
      release. Radiotherapy will consist of 5 daily treatments of 300 cGy delivered to the palmar
      area followed by a 6-8 weeks break then a second 5 day course of radiation at 300 cGy, for a
      total of 3000 cGy in 10 total fractions. This dosing schedule is commonly used in the
      published literature. The data to be collected about participants, is their Southampton
      Dupuytren's score, history and clinical symptoms and photographs of their hand. This
      information will be obtained at baseline (pre-surgical intervention), at radiation treatment
      planning, approximately 6 weeks after completion of all radiation and at 1 and 2 years
      following completion of radiotherapy.

    <measure>Southampton Dupuytren's Scoring System (SDSS) Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>The primary study endpoint is the patient's self-reported function which will be assessed using the validated Southampton Dupuytren's Scoring System (SDSS) questionnaire. The SDSS is a 5 item questionnaire with item scores ranging from 0 (no problem) to 4 (severe problem). Total scores are a sum of the 5 item scores with a total score range of 0 to 20. High scores indicate greater impairment due to the disease.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>The secondary endpoint will be the recurrence rate (which is defined as an increase in joint contracture on any treated joint of at least 20 degrees at one year post-treatment compared to six weeks post treatment) and skin toxicity, which will be assessed by CTCAE v5.0.</description>
