    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to help determine if 10 injections of Botox ® 100 units
      is less painful than 20 injections of Botox ® 100 units based on effectiveness in reducing
      urge incontinence episodes. Study will also be assessed for the pain of procedure and adverse
      outcomes of 20 injections versus 10 injections.

    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized clinical trial to assess whether or not 10 injections of 100 units
      of intradetrusor Botox® toxin is perceived as less painful compared to 20 injections of 100
      units of intradetrusor Botox® toxin for the treatment of refractory overactive bladder.
