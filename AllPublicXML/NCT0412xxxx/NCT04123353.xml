  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this sub-study is to calculate the reproducibility and other
      technical performance measures of various magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) image analysis
      algorithms in order to assess their suitability for detecting changes due to multiple
      sclerosis (MS) in a real-world setting in participants with MS. The secondary objective of
      this sub-study is to use the primary endpoint results to calibrate measurements across
      scanners within each MS PATHS center.
