  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multicenter, dose-escalation phase I study to assess the safety,
      tolerability and preliminary efficacy of KN044 in participants with all advanced solid tumors
      who are not able to have current standard anti-tumor therapies. The purpose of this study is
      to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) , to characterise the safety, pharmacokinetics
      (PK), immunogenicity, pharmacodynamics (PD) and anti-tumor activity of KN044 as a single
      agent in adult participants with advanced solid tumors.

      This study will involve patients and follow the standard &quot;3 + 3&quot;design. KN044 will be
      antimedical intravenously over 30 minutes with planned doses of 0.03, 0.1, 0.3, 1, 3, 6,10
      mg/kg Once every 3 weeks for first 4 doses, then every 3, or 6, or 12 weeks for up to 1 year
      if no intolerable toxicities occur and per agreement with investigator antimedical monitor
      based on emerging data.
