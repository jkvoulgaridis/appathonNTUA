  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics (PK) of
      EP-104IAR in patients with osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single injection, 24-week study to
      evaluate the safety, efficacy and PK of EP-104IAR in subjects with osteoarthritis knee pain

      Following screening and baseline assessments to determine eligibility, each participant will
      receive a single IA injection of either EP-104IAR or placebo (vehicle). Participants will be
      followed up for 24 weeks following the injection for safety, PK and efficacy assessments.
