    <textblock>
      The concomitant co-mutation with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation might
      influence the clinical outcomes. The investigators will identify the impact of concommitant
      mutation on clinical outcome in patients with advanced -EGFR mutated adenocarcinoma.

      The investigators will compare the genetic alterations between tumors of pre and post Tyrosin
      Kinase Inhibitor(TKI) treatments and predict the resistance mechanism for EGFR-TKIs by
      next-generation sequencing(NGS) analysis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The current standard therapies in the treatment of advanced EGFR-mutated lung cancer patients
      are the 1st or 2nd EGFR-TKIs. Although 70-80% of patients treated by EGFR-TKIS show good
      responses, they have progression after around 12 months. The concomitant co-mutation with
      EGFR mutation might influence the drug response of EGFR TKI. The investigators will compare
      the progression-free survival (PFS) of EGFR-TKI according to co-occuring mutations.

      The patients experience the change of molecular profiles after using the TKI. Therefore, the
      investigators will investigate the molecular profiles through NGS panel with foundation
      medicine in the tissue of pre/post EGFR-TKI, compare the change of the molecular profiles and
      tumor mutation burden(TMB), and identify novel mechanisms of drug resistance.

      The investigators will collect the tumor tissues and blood of around 80 patients in
      multi-centers prospectively. Then, They will be sent to FoundationOne in the US and perform
      NGS analysis. The type of EGFR-TKIs would be selected according to physicians' preference.
      NGS will be performed twice before the EGFR-TKIs treatment and after the progression.
