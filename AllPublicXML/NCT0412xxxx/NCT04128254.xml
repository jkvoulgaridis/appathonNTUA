  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Deep vein Thrombosis (Deep Venous Thrombosis, DVT) and Pulmonary Embolism, Pulmonary
      Embolism, PE) both collectively known as Venous thromboembolism (VTE) (Venous Thrombus
      Embolism, VTE), is a common clinical disease, and tremendous harmful. Ankle fractures in
      patients requiring long-term bed braking, increase the incidence of lower extremity deep vein
      thrombosis, anticoagulant therapy as an important measures to prevent thrombosis in clinical
      widely accepted, however, the literature anticoagulation effect incision healing. Whether to
      strike a balance between the two, to develop a foot fracture in accordance with the Chinese
      characteristics of anticoagulant solution is we try to solve the problem. The purpose of this
      study is aimed at the use of oral anticoagulants and physical anticoagulant treatment knee
      far foot fracture patients randomized controlled studies in China.
