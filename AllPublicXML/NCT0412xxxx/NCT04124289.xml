  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be an observational cohort study to evaluate pain measurement after surgery using a
      new functional pain scale.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients admitted for orthopedic surgery may take part in this research. Participants will be
      assessed using three different pain scales: numeric rating scale (NRS), FACES pain scale and
      a new functional pain scale (FPS).

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in pain score using functional pain scale questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 4 days.</time_frame>
    <description>Change in pain measurement using new functional pain scale from baseline postoperatively until discharge. The functional pain scale is a scale of 10 descriptive words related to pain and ability to function, ranging from minimal to immobilizing</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in pain score using FACES pain scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 4 days.</time_frame>
    <description>Change in pain measurement using FACES pain scale from baseline postoperatively until discharge. The scale includes pictures of facial expressions with correlating numerical scale of 0-10, 0 being no hurt and 10 being the worst hurt.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in pain score using numeric 0-10 rating scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 4 days.</time_frame>
    <description>Change in pain measurement using standard numeric rating scale from baseline postoperatively until discharge. The numeric rating scale is 0-10 where 0 is no pain, 5 is moderate pain and 10 is the worst pain.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in functionality</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 4 days.</time_frame>
    <description>Change in patient's ability to complete daily functions from baseline postoperatively until discharge. Physical therapy and occupational therapy reports will be reviewed to see if pain appears to interfere with the ability to participate in rehabilitation therapy.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient preference for ease of use of the three pain scales (functional, FACES or numerical)</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 4 days.</time_frame>
    <description>Questionnaire: Patient will be asked to answer one question to choose which of the three pain scales they prefer for reporting their level of pain. On a scale of 1 to 3 with 1 being the best for reporting pain, the patient will choose which pain scale they would rank a 1.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Provider preference for ease of use of the three pain scales (functional, FACES or numerical)</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 4 days.</time_frame>
    <description>Questionnaire: Provider will be asked to answer one question regarding which of the three pain scales they found easiest to complete. On a scale of 1 to 3 with 1 being the best for ease of use, the provider will choose which pain scale they would rank a 1.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Opioid administration</measure>
