  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cystadrops® is currently indicated in adults and children from 2 years of age diagnosed with
      cystinosis with corneal crystal accumulation observed.

      However administration of Cystadrops® in patients below 2 years old could be of value for
      these patients and prevent the crystal deposit. It is the reason why as part of the
      Cystadrops® pediatric investigational plan (PIP), RECORDATI Rare Diseases committed to
      conduct a clinical study to assess Cystadrops® safety and efficacy in the pediatric
      population from 6 months to less than 2 years old.
