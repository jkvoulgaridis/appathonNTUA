    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate safety and effect of combining an oncolytic adenovirus
      (delolimogene mupadenorepvec; LOAd703) with atezolizumab in patients with melanoma. LOAd703
      will be administered intratumorally for up to 12 injections while atezolizumab will be
      administered intravenously for the duration of the active study visits (up to 57 weeks). The
      patients are then monitored for survival for maximum study participation of 48 months. The
      treatments will be given every 3 weeks. The patients will then be monitored for toxicity, PK,
      ADA, immune responses, virus shedding, tumor response by RECIST 1.1 and survival.

      This is a single arm, open-label, multicenter trial. This study aims to evaluate safety and
      effect of combining an oncolytic adenovirus (delolimogene mupadenorepvec; LOAd703) with
      atezolizumab in patients with melanoma. Patients will receive up to 12 LOAd703 intratumoral
      treatments in combination with intravenous infusions of atezolizumab. LOAd703 will be tested
      at two dose levels to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of LOAd703 evaluated in the
      study using a BOIN design. The LOAd703 dose can be divided for intratumoral injection into as
      many as 3 tumor lesions. Atezolizumab will be tested at a fixed dose. At least 25 response
      evaluable patients will be enrolled at the MTD for evaluation of their response using
      binominal testing. The maximum number of evaluable patients in the study is 35. The patients
      will then be monitored for toxicity, PK, ADA, immune responses, virus shedding, tumor
      response by RECIST 1.1 and survival.

             functional respiration capacity. However, history of radiation pneumonitis in the
             radiation field (fibrosis) is permitted.

         25. Unstable angina, uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia, recent (within 3 months) history of
