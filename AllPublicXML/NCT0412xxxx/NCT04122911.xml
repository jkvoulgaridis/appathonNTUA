        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Signed informed consent prior to initiation of any study-specific procedures or
             treatment, as confirmation of the patient's awareness and willingness to comply with
             the study requirements.

          -  Patients ≥18 years of age.

          -  Histologically confirmed Metastatic Neuroendocrine Carcinoma (Ki67&gt;20% Ki67 must be
             quantified in percentage) with documented progression of disease per investigator
             assessment following or during first-line platinum-based treatment.

          -  ECOG performance status (PS) of 0-2.

          -  At least 28 days since prior radiation therapy or surgery and recovery from treatment.

          -  Patients must have measurable disease which must be evaluable per RECIST v1.1.

          -  Estimated life expectancy of ≥12 weeks.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  - Patients &lt; 18 years of age

          -  Diagnosis of well differentiated G1/G2 NEN

          -  Psychiatric or addictive disorders or other conditions that, in the opinion of the
             investigator, would prevent the patient from meeting the study requirements.

          -  Serious active infection requiring i.v. antibiotics and/or hospitalization at study
             entry.

          -  Patients who are treated with any medicinal product that contraindicates the use of
             the study drug, may interfere with the planned treatment, affects patient compliance
             or puts the patient at high risk for treatment-related complications.

          -  Pregnant or lactating females. Serum pregnancy test to be assessed within 7 days prior
             to study treatment start, or within 14 days with a confirmatory urine pregnancy test
             within 7 days prior to study treatment start. Women of childbearing potential (defined
             as &lt;2 years after last menstruation and not surgically sterile) not using effective,
             non-hormonal means of contraception (intrauterine contraceptive device, barrier method
             of contraception in conjunction with spermicidal jelly). Perimenopausal women must be
             amenorrheic for at least 12 months to be considered of non-childbearing potential

          -  Patients with meningeal carcinomatosis

          -  Patients with organ allografts requiring immunosuppression

          -  Patients with known positive HIV status

          -  Patients with a hypersensitivity to Temozolomide or Dacarbazine

          -  Any laboratory values at baseline as follows:

        Hematology:

          1. ANC &lt;1.5x109/L or 1500/mm3

          2. Platelet count &lt;100x109/L

          3. Hemoglobin &lt;8 g/dL (Note: hemoglobin levels may be supported by transfusion or
             erythropoietin or other approved hematopoietic growth factors).

        Coagulation:

          1. INR &gt;1.5 except for patients on stable anticoagulant therapy

          2. aPTT ≥1.5 times ULN or greater than the lower limit of the therapeutic range Note: The
             use of full-dose oral or parenteral anticoagulants is permitted as long as the INR or
             aPTT is within therapeutic limits (according to the medical standard in the
             institution) and the patient has been on a stable dose of anticoagulants for at least
             two weeks at the time of Day 1, Cycle 1.

        Serum chemistry:

          1. Total bilirubin &gt;1.5 times ULN

          2. AST or ALT &gt;2 times ULN (&gt;5 times ULN for patients with known liver involvement)

          3. ALP &gt;2 times ULN (&gt;5 times ULN for patients with known liver involvement and &gt;7 times
             ULN for patients with known bone involvement).
