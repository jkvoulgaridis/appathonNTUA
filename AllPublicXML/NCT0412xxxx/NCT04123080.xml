  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bleeding is the most common complication associated with polypectomy of large pedunculated
      colonic polyp. Although several techniques have been developed to minimize bleeding, none of
      these methods has become the gold standard. To prevent post-polypectomy bleeding effectively,
      the investigators developed and attempted a new endoscopic technique for removal of large
      long-stalked pedunculated colonic polyps using band ligations. This study aims to evaluate
      the safety and efficacy of a novel technique using endoscopic band ligation for removal of
      long-stalked pedunculated colon polyps.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A prospective single-center study was conducted. Targeted polyps were large (head size &gt;10
      mm) with long stalk length (&gt;10 mm) in the distal colon. After finding target lesions by
      standard colonoscopy, conventional upper endoscopy with rubber band (endoscopic band
      ligation, EBL) was applied to squeeze the mid-portion of the stalk to form an omega shape,
      which had the dual effect of ligation and compression of feeding blood vessels. After
      strangulation of the stalk, snare polypectomy was performed at the stalk site just above the
      ligation. The investigators evaluated several parameters, including completeness of
      resection, procedure time, and complications, including immediate postpolypectomy bleeding,
      delayed postpolypectomy bleeding, and perforation.

    <description>A conventional upper endoscope loaded with a band ligator was inserted in the colon and was advanced to the site of the pedunculated polyp. After approaching the lateral side of the stalk and grasping the mid-portion of the stalk using a tripod grasper. Then, the rubber band was released from the cap to ligate the stalk. Thereafter, we performed polypectomy of the remaining stalk just above the ligation by extending the electrosurgical snare.</description>
