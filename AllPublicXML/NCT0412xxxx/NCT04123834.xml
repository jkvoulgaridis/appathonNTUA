  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The use of implants for conventional anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) graft fixation has been
      associated with several problems including graft injury, implant osteolysis, implant
      migration and soft tissue irritation. Implantless ACL surgery offers additional benefits
      involving lower cost, improved graft incorporation and ease of revision surgery. The
      investigators aimed to compare the functional outcome of implantless bone-patellar tendon
      autograft using press-fit fixation technique and hamstring autografts using implant.

      Purpose: The use of implants for conventional anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) graft fixation
      has been associated with several problems including graft injury, implant osteolysis, implant
      migration and soft tissue irritation. Implantless ACL surgery offers additional benefits
      involving lower cost, improved graft incorporation and ease of revision surgery. The
      investigators aimed to compare the functional outcome of implantless bone-patellar tendon
      autograft using press-fit fixation technique and hamstring autografts using implant.

      Materials and Methods: A prospective cohort study design was used. Between March 2013 and
      March 2014, 12 patients underwent implantless ACL reconstruction using press-fit femoral
      technique, while 24 patients underwent implant ACL reconstruction. Objective functional
      outcome were measured using rolimeter, and subjective functional outcome were measured
      according to IKDC, Tegner-Lysholm and KOOS.

    <time_frame>At 1 month after surgery.</time_frame>
    <description>International Knee Documentation committee (IKDC) score evaluate improvement or deterioration in symptoms, function, and sports activities.
Number of items: 18 subscales:
symptoms: pain, stiffness, swelling, locking/catching and giving-way of the knee.
sports activities: functions such as going up and down the stairs, rising from a chair, squatting and jumping
function and activity of daily living: knee condition prior to injury
Response options vary for each item. Item 6 dichotomizes response into yes/no; items 1, 4, 5, 7, 8, and 9 use 5-point Likert scales; and items 2, 3, and 10 use 11-point numerical rating scales. The total score is calculated as (sum of items)/(maximum possible score) × 100. Possible score range 0-100, where 100 = no limitation with daily or sporting activities and the absence of symptoms. Higher values represent a better outcome.</description>
