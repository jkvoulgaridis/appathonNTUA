      Objective: This study aimed to investigate the effect, onset and duration of action, and
      short-term outcomes of acupuncture therapy in the treatment of patients with severe chronic
      subjective tinnitus.

      Methods: This study is a randomized, controlled trial evaluating patients with chronic,
      idiopathic and severe tinnitus. A total of 105 participants were divided into two groups
      using the randomization method: the study group that received real acupuncture therapy (n =
      53) and the sham acupuncture group. Ten acupuncture sessions were applied over five weeks.
      After treatment, each participant was monitored for up to three months according to the
      changes in the Visual Analog Scale (VAS), Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI), Pure-Tone
      Audiometry and Speech Discrimination scores.

      This was a prospective, randomized, controlled study, approved by the local ethics committee
      and carried out in a single center in accordance with the ethical principles of the Helsinki
      Declaration (E-18-2165).

      The inclusion criteria of the study for patients were determined as; (a) male and female
      patients aged 18 to 60 years, (b) unilateral or bilateral subjective tinnitus, (c) with a
      history of severe subjective tinnitus for at least one year, (d) patients with severe
      tinnitus according to the THI questionnaire result (over 38 points), (e) the patients who
      could not detect etiology of tinnitus in the otolaryngology examination, (f) not having
      received any treatment within the last six months. The patients who applied to the
      otorhinolaryngology clinic of our hospital were included in the study.

      According to the randomization method, the group to which each participant was assigned was
      only known to the researcher who applied acupuncture therapy. The participants and the
      remaining researchers that administered THI to the participants were blinded to the groups.

      The data were obtained from the patients' responses to VAS and THI questionnaires. Each
      participant completed the VAS and THI questionnaires seven times during the course of the
      five-week treatment and the three-month follow-up after treatment.

    <description>Ten acupuncture sessions were applied over five weeks. In this study, acupuncture style is the traditional Chinese model, acupuncture was performed on 11 acupuncture points (TE21, SI19, GB2, TE22, ST7, TE17, GB20 of the affected side, and GB20, TE05, KI3 of both sides) using sterile, single-use, 0.25 mm thick, 40 mm long needles (Dongbang Medical Co., Boryeong, Korea). The acupuncture points were selected by taking previous studies as reference. The depth of the needle differed depending on the anatomical structure of the participant and the nature of the acupuncture points, but it was approximately 5-10 mm. The acupuncture needles were applied until the participant experienced de-qi and removed after 20 minutes.</description>
