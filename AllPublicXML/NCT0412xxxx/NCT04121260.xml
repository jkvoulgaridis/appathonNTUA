    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant administered a medicinal (investigational or nonâ€‘investigational) product. An AE does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the intervention. A serious adverse event (SAE) is an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Multiple myeloma (MM) diagnosed according to the International Myeloma Working Group
             (IMWG) diagnostic criteria

          -  Participants must have measurable, secretory disease as defined by any of the
             following:

               1. Serum monoclonal paraprotein (M-protein) level greater than or equal to(&gt;=)1.0
                  gram/deciliter (g/dL) or &gt;= 0.5 g/dL for Immunoglobulin (Ig) A, IgD, IgE or IgM
                  MM; or

               2. Urine M-protein level &gt;= 200 milligram (mg)/24 hours; or

               3. Serum Ig free light chain (FLC) &gt;= 10 mg/dL and abnormal serum Ig kappa lambda
                  FLC ratio if participant does not have measurable M-protein in serum and urine

          -  Response (partial response or better based on investigator's determination of
             response) to at least 1 prior treatment regimen

          -  Progressive disease based on investigator's determination of response on their last
             regimen

          -  Participant must have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status
             score of 0 or 1

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participant has received daratumumab or other anti-CD38 therapies previously

          -  Participant has received prior antitumor therapy as follows, prior to the first dose
             of study drug:

               1. Targeted therapy, epigenetic therapy, or treatment with an investigational drug
                  or an invasive investigational medical device within 21 days or at least 5
                  half-lives, whichever is less;

               2. Monoclonal antibody treatment for multiple myeloma within 21 days;

               3. Cytotoxic therapy within 21 days;

               4. Proteasome inhibitor therapy within 14 days;

               5. Immunomodulatory agent therapy within 7 days;

               6. Radiotherapy within 21 days. However, if the radiation portal covered less than
                  or equal to (&lt;=) 5 percent (%) of the bone marrow reserve, the participant is
                  eligible irrespective of the end date of radiotherapy

          -  Participant has had a plasmapheresis within 28 days before Cycle 1 Day 1

          -  Participant has known meningeal or central nervous system involvement of MM

          -  Concurrent medical condition or disease (example [e.g.], active systemic infection)
             that is likely to interfere with study procedures or results, or that in the opinion
             of the investigator would constitute a hazard for participating in this study
