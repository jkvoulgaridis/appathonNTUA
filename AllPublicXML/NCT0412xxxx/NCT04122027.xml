    <textblock>
      Liver transplantation (LT) is a life-saving procedure for patients with end-stage liver
      diseases. Although with continuous advancement in technology, it remains a high-risk
      operation. The goal of LT is not only ensure survival of the patients but also to restore
      them back to their pre-morbid state with a good quality of life. Neurological sequelae can
      have major impact on postoperative outcomes after LT and yet the reported literature is
      scarce. Studies from Western countries showed some evidence on the use of cerebral oximtery
      in cardiac surgery to prevent neurological mishaps. LT shares similar intra-operative
      fluctuation of the haemodynamices as in cardiac surgery, causing disturbances in regional
      cerebral oxygenation and theorectically cerebral oximetry should be of great value as well in
      LT surgery. Data from a large randomised controlled trial is lacking from the current
      literatures. We therefore propose a prospective randomized controlled trial on the use of
      this device in adult LT and see whether its use could reduce neurological mishaps.

      Liver Transplant Liver transplantation (LT) is a life-saving procedure for patients with
      end-stage liver disease. Despite continuous advancement in technology, it remains a high-risk
      operation. The building-up of an oxygen debt during LT can lead to an increased risk of poor
      postoperative outcomes (1, 2). Furthermore, patients with acute liver failure or end-stage
      liver disease are prone to hepatic encephalopathy, which can lead to disturbance of
      auto-regulation in the brain, which may eventually cause cerebral hypoxia and ischaemia.
      Irresversible metabolic disturbances can impair cerebral auto-regulation, causing poor
      neurological outcomes after LT (3). The prevalence of encephalopathy, delirium and stroke in
      transplant recipients is 12-40% (3). Hypotheses for these conditions include prolonged stay
      in the intensive care unit (ICU) (so-called &quot;ICU psychosis&quot;), the use of Tacrolimus (4),
      rapid correction of hyponatraemia (5) and impaired cerebral auto-regulation (3), but no
      definite conclusion can be made most of the time. Among these hypotheses, impairment of
      cerebral auto-regulation has never been documented in large clinical trials for Chinese
      patients in LT.

      Cerebral oximetry (Near infra-red spectroscopy, NIRS) There is no &quot;gold standard&quot; for
      measuring cerebral auto-regulation. Monitoring of the brain oxygenation, such as direct
      tissue O2 tension and jugular bulb O2 saturation, has been used as a surrogate of
      auto-regulation but it is invasive. Transcranial laser Doppler (TCD) of the middle cerebral
      artery has been validated in healthy volunteers as well as real patients as a good
      measurement of cerebral blood flow (6, 7). Similarly, near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), a
      non-invasive and continuous method, can also monitor the regional cerebral oxygenation
      (rScO2) and is increasingly used in cardiac surgery. A previous report has validated the use
      of NIRS when compared to TCD, as the latter requires a trained technician to monitor and
      supervise. NIRS provides a timely, real-time, inexpensive, easily measurable alternative to
      TCD, and thus should have a great potential for clinical usage in LT. Similar to other
      non-invasive oximetry (e.g. pulse oximetry), measurement can be done through adhesive tapes
      over bilateral forehead and connected to the machine (INVOSâ„¢ 5100C Cerebral/Somatic Oximeter
      by Covidien). This system is the ONLY cerebral/somatic oximetry system with FDA cleared
      improved outcome claims (8). Plachky et al. showed that 50% of patients demonstrated a
      decline in cerebral oxygen saturation when clamping of the vessles during LT and it had
      positive correlation with the postoperative cerebral disrubances (9). Nonetheless, the
      clinical application for patients undergoing LT is scarce and its application is novel. The
      use of this technology may potenitally be limited by the presence of high levels of bilirubin
      acting as a chromophore interferring with its data acquistion. However, in a pilot study of 9
      patients who underwent LT investigators using this technology were able to demonstrate that 3
      out of 9 patients had either transient or persistent impaired auto regulation throughout the
      operation. This in turn was associated with higher Model of End-Stage Disease Score (MELD)
      &gt;15 (p=0.015), more postoperative seizures and stroke (P&lt;0.0001) (3). A recent systematic
      review (10) of 901 Caucasians from 24 publications showing a decrease in NIRS (&gt;15% relative
      to baseline) could have impaired postoperative cognitive function (28 versus 26; MMSE) and
      reduced LOS (14 versus 23 days) in open surgery. In the field of LT, impaired cerebral
      autoregulation (25%), cerebral deoxygenation in the anhepatic phase (36%) and cerebral
      hyperoxygenation with reperfusion of the grafted liver (14%) were identified by NIRS and
      could lead to adverse neurological outcome such as seizures, transient hemiparesis and
      stroke. Nonetheless, no large prospective randomized trial and no Chinese cohort were
      included.
