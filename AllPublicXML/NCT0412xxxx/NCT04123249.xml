  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Surgery is a very common treatment in clinical practice. As an important part of surgery,
      anesthesia is a safe and comfortable pain-free surgical environment, and it is easy to leave
      sequelae and other negative effects. General anesthesia can lead to postoperative sleep
      rhythm disorder, and severe cases can develop postoperative operative sleep disturbances
      (PSD). Postoperative sleep disorders were associated with postoperative hemorrhagic
      hypoxemia, postoperative pain sensitization, postoperative cognitive dysfunction, and
      cardiovascular complications such as blood pressure fluctuations caused by sympathetic
      excitation. In addition, postoperative sleep disorders can increase the number of apneas in
      patients with sleep apnea, and hypoxemia caused by apnea is an independent risk factor for
      nocturnal acute myocardial infarction. Normal sleep is divided into non-rapid eye movement
      sleep (NREM) and rapid eye movement sleep (REM). The sleep characteristic of REM is the
      presence of rapid eye movement during sleep, which is less stable than NREM and is associated
      with dreaming and muscle movement. The sleep characteristic of NREM is deep sleep, also known
      as slow wave sleep. The study found that most intravenous anesthetics and inhaled anesthetics
      can directly stimulate GABAergic neurons in the Ventrolateral preoptic area (VLPO), and
      induce anesthesia through endogenous sleep-regulated neural circuits. Among them, the
      anesthesia induced by intravenous anesthetic propofol can not only replace NREM sleep, but
      also replace REM sleep; while inhaled anesthetics can not meet REM sleep, and the rebound of
      REM sleep increases later. Therefore, the choice of anesthetic drugs during surgery has
      positive significance for the adjustment of postoperative sleep conditions.
