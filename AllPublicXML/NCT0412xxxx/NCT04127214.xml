  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a naturalistic study implementing a routine assessment to monitor the evolution of
      the patients with eating disorders being treated in various centers of &quot;ITA Salud Mental&quot; in
      Spain.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      &quot;ITA Salud Mental&quot; offers integrated treatment for eating disorders including outpatient,
      inpatient and day hospital care. The routine assessment implemented to this aim includes both
      general measures to gauge the therapeutic progress (CORE system) and measures specific for
      eating disorders (EAT, BITE), which are administered from the beginning to the end of
      treatment in different time points combined with clinical data included in the patients'
      health record such as diagnosis, body mass index, previous treatments, and chronicity. The
      analysis of these data will permit to evaluate the therapeutic effects of this integrated
      treatment and the factors which might influence the outcomes.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Clinical outcomes in routine evaluation outcome measure (CORE-OM)</measure>
    <time_frame>CORE-OM is administered at baseline, at one week, and then routinely every three months (using A and B short forms alternatively every three weeks) until the end of treatment (or study completion).</time_frame>
    <description>CORE-OM is a 34-item self-report questionnaire for the assessment of subjective well-being, symptoms or problems, life functioning, and risk. It has good psychometric properties and it has been validated for the Spanish population. Its transdiagnostic nature makes it suitable for all kinds of eating disorders especially if we take into account the frequent comorbidities with other mental disorders (e.g., depression, anxiety) of these patients. Short forms of this questionnaire (versions A and B) are used to monitor patients' progress.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Eating Attitudes Test (EAT)</measure>
    <time_frame>EAT is administered at baseline, at one week, and then routinely every three months until the end of treatment (or study completion).</time_frame>
    <description>The EAT (children and adult versions) is a 26-item standardized self-report questionnaire devised to measure symptoms and concerns characteristic of eating disorders. Although the EAT has been used as a screening tool, here it is used to gauge symptom severity. It has good psychometric properties and it has been validated for the Spanish population.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Bulimic Investigatory Test, Edinburgh (BITE)</measure>
    <time_frame>BITE is administered at baseline, at one week, and then routinely every three months until the end of treatment (or study completion).</time_frame>
    <description>BITE is a 33-item standardized self-report questionnaire measuring eating disorders symptoms and severity. It is especially suited for binge eating disorders and bulimia nervosa. The test is well sensitive to measure the effectiveness of the therapy and the changes of symptoms. It has good psychometric properties and it has been validated for the Spanish population.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Body Mass Index (BMI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Patients' weight and height is recorded at baseline and then every month until the end of treatment (or study completion).</time_frame>
    <description>The BMI is defined as the body mass divided by the square of the body height, and is universally expressed in units of kg/m2, resulting from mass in kilograms and height in meters. It is widely used for the assessment of therapeutic progress in eating disorders and obesity.</description>

    <description>The ITA Model combines outpatient intervention (mainly psychotherapy), day hospital care and hospitalization as a function of patients' characteristics. Case conceptualization of the psychological processes of patients is formulated and revised within a team including psychologists, psychotherapists, psychiatrists, nutritionists, physicians, nurses, and social workers. The major emphasis of the ITA model is on psychological interventions which include individual psychotherapy, family therapy and/or guidance, and group therapy of various formats and contents (e.g., drug abuse, mindfulness, emotion work) tailored to the needs of each patient. However, when required, drugs are prescribed adjusting type of medication and dosage to the need of the patient.</description>
