      Introduction and Aim: With the increase in life expectancy in cancer, it gains importance in
      the care process and the problems experienced by caregivers. However, the problems
      experienced by individuals caring for cancer patients are often ignored. The most common
      problems faced by cancer caregivers are sadness, anxiety, sleep disorders, and fatigue.
      Although reflexology has positive effects on sleep and anxiety in different patient groups,
      there is no study on its effectiveness in cancer caregivers. The aim of this study was to
      evaluate the effectiveness of reflexology on sleep and anxiety of caregivers.

      Materials and Methods: The study was conducted as a double-blind placebo-controlled design.
      After the groups were determined with block randomization, the reflexology investigation was
      applied to the experimental group for three consecutive days, while for the placebo group,
      the hands was moved around the foot for the same periods but no deep stimulation was applied.
      On the fourth day, a sociodemographic diagnostic form, state anxiety scale and
      Richard-Campbell Sleep Scale were administered to the participants by a blinded researcher.
      Data were analyzed with SPSS 25.0 package program. Written permission was obtained from the
      relevant ethics committee, hospital and participants to conduct the study.
