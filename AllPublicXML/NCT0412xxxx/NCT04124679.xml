  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      General anesthesia is a medically induced state of low reactivity consciousness which is
      similar to natural sleep.Some studies found that general anesthesia as an independent risk
      factor could result in a desynchronization of the circadian time structure and cause
      postoperative sleep disorders characterized by reduced rapid eye movement (REM) and slow wave
      sleep (SWS),which have signiﬁcant deleterious impacts on postoperative outcomes, such as
      postoperative fatigue, severe anxiety and depression, emotional detachment and delirium, and
      even pain sensitivity or postoperative pain of patients.Acupuncture can regulate plant nerve
      activity by increasing slow-wave sleep time to improve sleep quality.The results of
      polysomnography monitoring showed that the sleep latency, total sleep time, awakening index
      and sleep quality were all significant improved after acupuncture treatment.And
      transcutaneous electrical acupoint stimulation（TAES） works by stimulating Shu yu acupoints,
      which is more convenient than the normal electric acupuncture. The purpose of this paper is
      to study the effect of TAES on sleep after thoracoscopic surgery

      Patients scheduled for thoracoscopic surgery under general anesthesia were enrolled. Patients
      were randomized to transcutaneous electrical acupoint stimulation group (TAES group) and
      control group (C group). Patients in the TAES group received continuous transcutaneous
      electrical acupoint stimulation for 30min before sleep on one night before the operation,
      30min before start of the operation and 30min before sleep for the first, third and fifth
      night after the operation. The portable sleep monitor (PSM) was performed on one night before
      the operation and the first, third and fifth night after the operation. The subjective sleep
      quality using the Athens Insomnia Scale on one night before the operation and the first,
      third and fifth night after the operation. The subjective sleep quality using the Athens
      Insomnia Scale were also recorded.
