  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During a brain surgery targeted to remove a brain tumor, the neurosurgeon wakes up the
      patient to delimit the tumor area exactly, and identify the surrounding areas, to limit the
      surgery damages. The present project aims at testing the patient in this awake phase to
      determine the brain areas implied in time to contact (TTC) perception, a function that allows
      determining the arrival time of moving objects and used in many tasks of our daily life.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Time to contact (TTC) estimation is a major visual function that allows an observer
      determining the time a moving object will take to reach him. It is however striking to note
      that the different brain areas supporting this function are not clearly identified, in
      particular the contribution of non-visual areas that are engaged in the definition of a
      peri-personal space for the observer. This lack could be fulfilled during a brain surgery
      experiment. Indeed, in such a surgery, the patient is awakened, and the surgeon apply direct
      cortical stimulation to de-activate specific brain areas while testing different cognitive
      function. The failure to succeed in the task indicates that this area is engaged in the
      cognitive function. The present study therefore will test different brain areas to
      investigate their respective contribution in the TTC estimation function.

      Three groups of participants will be tested, in pre and per surgery phases. After an initial
      pre-surgery phase, patients for which the tumor does not interfere with the TTC estimation
      anility will be enrolled in the Pré-Per group, and tested during the brain surgery. Patients
      for which the pre-test indicates that the TTC estimation is damaged by the tumor, will be
      tested in pre-surgery phase only, constituting the Pré-End group. Finally, a control group,
      paired with the patients, will be tested as well.

      For the patients, all the testing phases will be achieved during their medical process. The
      awake surgery is now a well-established technique, currently and usually done at the
      University Hospital Toulouse, and the present test in the per surgery phase only lasts a
      couple of minutes, no more than 5 minutes. As such, there is no additional risk carried out
      in the project.

    <description>Look at how the cognitive functions of perception of time before contact are attached to brain structures, their communication with other zones, their alteration due to brain tumors for patients with a brain tumor compared to control subjects. The treatment of the study being an awakened awakening as part of the routine care, there is no risk of serious adverse event.
Brain mapping will be done through neurological examinations which are questionnaires and a risk-free task. All the tasks and all the questionnaires described in the paragraph &quot;arm and intervention&quot; will make it possible to meet this outcome.</description>

    <description>Look to see if brain areas other than those targeted for stimulation in awake surgery are stimulated and therefore play a role in estimating time to contact.The treatment of the study being an awakened awakening as part of the routine care, there is no risk of serious adverse event.

    <description>A total of 120 patients with brain tumors will be divided into our two groups, divided as follows:
In the group Pre-Per, 20 patients will be included by localization of electrical stimulation (60 patients in total). A patient who would be stimulable in two different areas could be included in two different groups.
In the group Pre-End, the subjects will be distributed by localization of the brain tumor, by lobe. A total of 20 participants will be included per lobe, corresponding to the frontal, temporal or parietal lobes (as a reminder, a tumor in the occipital lobe is an exclusion criterion), for a total of 60 participants</description>

    <description>In the task, participants will see an object approaching toward them. During its movement, the object disappears, and the participants have to press a button to indicate when they estimate the object to contact with them. The motion parameters of the ball will be varied. The pre and post-surgery phases will test the participants in a long duration version of the task, approximately 30 minutes. The per surgery phase will be made of a 5 minutes version of the task, and the participants will receive a direct cortical stimulation for 4 seconds, at an intensity of 1 to 10 mA, in the premotor ventral area, or posterior parietal cortex or somesthetic associative areas.</description>

    <description>The patient is first anesthetized for opening the scalp and skull, then awake. During this waking phase, the surgeon passes a few quick and simple tests to the patient, visual (for example, line bisection), language (for example, repeating a list of words) etc. While doing this task, the neurosurgeon disrupts the functioning of certain brain regions by direct electrical stimulation of the cortex in order to identify the regions whose dysfunction will have an impact on the current task.
During the operation, the areas involved in the construction of the peri-personal space will be stimulated by direct electrical stimulation, for a duration of 4 seconds at an intensity of 1 to 10 mA. These areas are:
Ventral premotor cortex (with the exception of the primary motor cortex controlling the dominant hand, so as not to interfere with the motor response of the patient)
Posterior parietal cortex
Associative somesthetic areas</description>
