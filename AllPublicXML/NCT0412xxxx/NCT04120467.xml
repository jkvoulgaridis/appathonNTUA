  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Context Dance is an intrinsically motivating activity comprising social interaction,
      stimulation through music, the joy of moving despite motor limitations induced by pathology,
      and which has good perceived benefits among participants. Moving with pleasure is essential
      to finding the motivation to engage in rehabilitation program and physical activity. In
      stroke context, physical activity and rehabilitation were difficult to carry out because of
      cognitive and motor disabilities. Moreover, when the rehabilitation is over, the diminishing
      motor stimulation gradually limits autonomy in daily tasks. It is therefore urgent to provide
      persons in a post-stroke situation with motivating physical activity opportunities. Very few
      studies have studied dance in a context of stroke, while this physical activity is highly
      adapted and effective for other chronic conditions.

      Objectives: The main objective is to assess the effects of dance practice on cognitive and
      motor functions for persons after stroke. The secondary objective is to investigate the
      effects of dance on quality of life, motivation and adherence. The investigator's hypothesis
      is that the practice of dance induces an increase of balance and motor capacities, and
      improving the quality of life, adherence and motivation after a stroke.

      Materials and method :

      Forty-eight subjects with stroke in subacute phase will be randomized into two groups: 1)
      intervention (dance and standard rehabilitation) and 2) control (standard rehabilitation).
      Before intervention, stroke severity, cognitive abilities and motor capacities will be
      tested. Two baseline tests will occur to assess the stability of individuals will be planned.
      Participants will attend a dance class weekly during 6 weeks. The cognitive and motor
      functions (balance, lower-limbs strength, coordination and motor level), the quality of life
      (Stroke-specific quality of life scale) will be measured at 4 and 6 weeks in both groups.
      Participant satisfaction with regard to dance will be tested, as well as adherence and
      adverse effects.

      Perspectives:

      The joy of dancing and the possibility of including other non-disabled people should
      facilitate adherence and motivation and increase the recovery of cognitive and motor
      functions.This project should motivate physiotherapists and dance teachers to increase the
      offer of dance classes for persons with motor and cognitive impairments.This action will be a
      basis for combating people's sedentary lifestyle after a stroke.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline cognitive-motor functions in both groups (dance vs. control): cognitive recovery</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The cognitive function will be measured with the Montreal Cognitive Assessement scale.There are 12 items for cognitive domains: memory is tested by a short-term memory recall task (5 points); visuospatial ability is tested using a clock-drawing test (3 points) and a 3-dimensional cube copy (1 point); executive function is tested using a trail-making test (1 point), a phonemic fluency task (1 point), and a 2-item verbal abstraction task (2 points); attention, concentration, and working memory is tested using a attention task (1 point), a serial subtraction task (3 points), and digits tasks (1 point each); language is tested using a 3-item confrontation naming task with animals (3 points) and repetition of 2 syntactically complex sentences (2 points); orientation in time and place was also tested (6 points).
The minimum score is 0 and the maximum score is 30. Higher scores indicate better cognition. Normal score: &gt;26/30.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline cognitive-motor functions in both groups (dance vs. control): balance recovery</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks and 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The balance will be measured with Balance Evaluation System test (miniBest test).
The test has a maximum score of 28 points from 14 items that are each scored from 0-2. &quot;0&quot; indicates the lowest level of function and &quot;2&quot; the highest level of function. The minimum score is &quot;0&quot; and maximum score is &quot;28&quot;.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline cognitive-motor functions in both groups (dance vs. control): balance confidence recovery</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks and 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The balance confidence will be measured with the Activities-Specific Balance Confidence scale (ABC-scale).
The ABC-scale is a self-reported questionnaire providing information on balance confidence in the performance of 16 different daily activities, such as stair climbing, walking in the house, and walking on slippery floors. The questionnaire contains 16 items scored on a range from 0% to 100% (0 indicating no confidence and 100 indicating full confidence). The total ABC scale score of ≤67 indicates an increased risk of fall.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline cognitive-motor functions in both groups (dance vs. control): coordination recovery</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks and 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The coordination will be tested using the Lower Extremity Motor Coordination (LEMOCOT) test.
The subject will be sat on an adjustable chair with their feet resting flat on thin rigid foam, heels on the proximal target, and with knees and hips at 90° of flexion. Then, after a familiarization trial, they will instructed to alternately touch the proximal and distal targets, placed 30cm apart, with their big toe, for 20s, as fast as possible, without sacrificing the accuracy to increase speed. The number of touched targets will be counted and registered for analyses.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline cognitive-motor functions in both groups (dance vs. control): functional ability recovery</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Motor level will be assessed with a Functional Independence Measure Instrument (MIF). Motor level will be assessed with a Functional Independence Measure Instrument. The scale contains 18 items, of which 13 items are in physical domains and 5 items are related to cognition. Motor items measure self-care, sphincter control, locomotion, and transfer. Cognitive ones evaluate subject's communication and social cognition. Based on level of independence, each item is scored from 1 to 7, where 1 indicates total dependence and 7 represents complete independence. Possible scores range from 18 to 126. Higher values represent a better outcome.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline Quality of life in both groups (dance vs. control)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The quality of life of persons with chronic strokes will be measured using the Stroke-specific quality of life scale (SS-QoL).
The SS-QOL contains 12 subscales with a total of 49 items. Scoring of the SS-QOL concerns the past week and is rated on a 5-point Likert scale. Response options are scored as 5 (&quot;no help needed/no trouble at all/strongly disagree&quot;), 4 (&quot;a little help/a little trouble/moderately disagree&quot;), 3 (&quot;some help/some trouble/neither agree nor disagree&quot;), 2 (&quot;a lot of help/a lot of trouble/moderately agree&quot;), and 1 (&quot;total help/could not do it at all/strongly agree&quot;). The SS-QOL provides domain scores and a summary score, with higher scores indicating better function. The total score is calculated by averaging the domain scores. The minimum score is 12 and the maximum score is 245.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline Motivation for Physical Activity practice in both groups (dance vs. control)</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks and 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A motivation scale towards health-oriented physical activity. The motivation scale towards health-oriented physical activity (MS-PA) contains a total of 18 items. Scoring is rated on 7-point scale (1 = &quot; strongly disagree &quot; and 7 = &quot; strongly agree &quot;). The minimum score = 18 and maximum score = 126. Higher values represent a worse motivation.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of dance practice on adverse effects: existence of pain and fatigue after each dance class</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 6 weeks (after each dance class)</time_frame>
    <description>The pain and fatigue will be measured with numeric rating scale (NRS). The 11-point numeric scale ranges from '0' representing one extreme (e.g. &quot;no pain&quot; or &quot;no fatigue) to '10' representing the other extreme (e.g. &quot;pain as bad as you can imagine&quot; or &quot;worst pain imaginable&quot; or &quot;worst fatigue imaginable&quot;). Scores range from 0-10 points, with higher scores indicating greater pain or fatigue intensity.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Level of participant's satisfaction with dance class</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Participant satisfaction assessed with an exit survey adapted from a previous study report that investigated dance for a person with chronic stroke. The survey asked participants to rate nine statements about the dance program using a 5-point scale (where 1 = &quot;strongly disagree&quot; and 5 = &quot;strongly agree&quot;). Higher values represent a better satisfaction.</description>

    <description>One group will receive a 60-minute dance class weekly over a 6 weeks period. A physiotherapist - dance teacher will lead the classes, supported by at least one volunteer.
The class structure will consist of five components: warm up (10 minutes), technical exercises (10 minutes), improvisation (15 minutes), a short routine (15 minutes) and a cool down/feedback time (10 minutes). Dance exercises will be targeting flexibility, balance, endurance, upper and lower limbs functions, interaction between dancers, perception and memory. Using choreography or short routine, the class will include repeating the dance moves - which fosters memorization - and also the additional challenge of remembering a sequence of moves.
Given the great variability of each participant's functional ability, the complexity and the intensity of the dance exercises will progress according to each participant's capacity, in order to fulfill an appropriate challenge at moderate treatment intensity.</description>
