    <textblock>
      In this prospective, randomised, controlled, unblinded,monocentric study, we aim to evaluate
      the safety and efficacy of higher power CLOSE-guided PVI in patients referred for a first
      ablation for paroxysmal AF. We aim to include 100 patients into two groups (1:1). The
      experimental group will receive AF ablation with 45 Watt and stricter stability criteria (3
      mm for 3 seconds) compared to the control group which will receive AF ablation according to
      the standard CLOSE-protocol (35 Watt and stability criteria of 3 mm for 8 seconds).

      BACKGROUND: In a population of paroxysmal AF 'CLOSE'-guided PVI (Target Ablation index (AI)
      &gt;550 and &gt;400 for anterior and posterior wall respectively, interlesion distance ≤6mm) has
      been shown to obtain single-procedure durable PV isolation. However, the optimal RF power and
      stability criteria is unknown.

      OBJECTIVES: With this study, we aim at evaluation the efficacy and the safety of higher power
      (45 watts) and stricter stability criteria (3 mm for 3 sec) as compared to a standard CLOSE
      protocol (35 watts with stability of 3 mm for 8 sec) in patients referred for a first
      ablation for paroxysmal AF.

      POPULATION: Eligible patients are patients with paroxysmal AF who are planned for a
      'CLOSE'-guided PV isolation for paroxysmal AF. At the time of the procedrual planning, we
      will ask the patient his/her consent for collectio of data. We aim at including 100 patients.
