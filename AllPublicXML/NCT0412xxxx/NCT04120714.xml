  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Internet has grown considerably in the last twenty years, and as a result, cases of
      excessive iinterney use have emerged. These cases, which have clinical similarities with
      substance addiction, involve the various activities related to the Internet (online gambling,
      discussion forums, online networking, e-mail, pornography, shopping, etc.). However, to date,
      only the pathological use of Internet gaming (PUIG) is referenced in the 5th edition of the
      Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5, section III).

      In PUIG, an individual loses control when gambling online. He/she typically spends 8 to 10
      hours on this activity, sometimes without eating or sleeping. Usual obligations, such as
      school or work, or family obligations are neglected. PUIG can cause great psychological and
      social suffering. Neurological complications (epilepsy) and deaths (cardiac arrest) related
      to PUIG have also been reported. These situations are all the more dramatic because they
      often affect adolescents and young adults. In Asia, PUIG has become a public health problem.
      To date, no treatment has been validated for this disorder.

      Non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) techniques can modulate neural activity in the
      dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). This modulation makes it possible to reduce addictive
      behaviours through different mechanisms (reduction of craving, impulsivity, and
      decision-making disorders). These techniques could be effective for PUIG.
