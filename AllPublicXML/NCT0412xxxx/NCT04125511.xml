  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      68Ga-FAPI has been developed as a tumor-targeting agent as fibroblast activation protein is
      overexpressed in cancer-associated fibroblasts and some inflammation,such as IgG4-related
      disease.And it might be more sensitive than FDG in detecting a certain type of inflammations
      according to our preliminary research.Thus this prospective study is going to investigate
      whether 68Ga-FAPI PET/CT may be superior for diagnosis, therapy response assessment and
      follow-up of IgG4-related disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Immunoglobulin G4-related disease (IgG4-RD) is an immune-mediated fibroinflammatory condition
      that is capable of affecting multiple organs. Common forms of presentation include:Type 1
      (IgG4-related) autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP)，IgG4-related sclerosing cholangitis, major
      salivary gland enlargement or sclerosing sialadenitis; Orbital disease, often with proptosis
      and retroperitoneal fibrosis. The involved organs share a number of core pathologic features
      and striking clinical and serologic similarities, including tumor-like swelling of involved
      organs, a lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate enriched in IgG4-positive plasma cells, and a variable
      degree of fibrosis that has a characteristic &quot;storiform&quot; pattern. 68Ga-FAPI has been
      developed as a tumor-targeting agent as fibroblast activation protein is overexpressed in
      cancer-associated fibroblasts and it might be a pan-tumor PET agent. Recently we have
      reported a case of IgG4-related disease revealed by 68Ga-FAPI and 18F-FDG PET/CT which showed
      FAPI was not more tumor-specific than FDG, furthermore,it might be more sensitive than FDG in
      detecting a certain type of inflammations—like the pancreatic lesion. Thus this prospective
      study is going to investigate whether 68Ga-FAPI PET/CT may be superior for diagnosis, therapy
      response assessment and follow-up of IgG4-related disease.
