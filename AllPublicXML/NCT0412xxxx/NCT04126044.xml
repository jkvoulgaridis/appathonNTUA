    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind, randomized (1:1), parallel group, single dose, 2-arm, comparative PK
      study of PF-06439535 (CN) and bevacizumab-EU administered intravenously to Chinese healthy
      male volunteers. Approximately 66 subjects will be enrolled to ensure that at least 58
      subjects (29 per arm) complete the study procedures and have evaluable PK data. The study
      will be conducted at 1 center in China.

             normal and Creatinine &lt;1.5 mg/dl) upon study entry.

          3. Body Mass Index (BMI) of 18 to 28 kg/m2; and a total body weight &gt;50 kg (110 lbs).

          4. Evidence of a personally signed and dated informed consent document indicating that

          5. Subjects who are willing and able to comply with scheduled visits, treatment plan,
             laboratory tests, and other study procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Evidence or history of clinically significant hematological, renal, endocrine,
             pulmonary, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, hepatic, psychiatric, neurological, or
             allergic disease (including drug allergies, but excluding untreated, asymptomatic,
             seasonal allergies at time of dosing).

          2. Evidence or history of heart failure, arterial or venous thromboembolism, bleeding
             diathesis, acquired coagulopathy or coagulopathy factor abnormality with international
             normalized ratio (INR) of &gt;=1.5, or history of gross hemorrhage within the past 6
             months prior to Screening (eg, hemoptysis or hematuria requiring medical
             intervention).

          3. Evidence or history of relevant and clinically significant intra abdominal
             inflammation, gastrointestinal perforation or gall bladder perforation.

          4. Major surgery or elective surgery within 3 months before or after administration of
             study treatment. At least 28 days should elapse from the time of minor surgical
             procedure, including placement of an access device and dental procedures.

             measurement (confirmed by a single repeat, if necessary) following at least 5 minutes
             of rest. If BP is &gt;= 140 mm Hg (systolic) or &gt;= 90 mm Hg (diastolic), the BP should be
             repeated 2 more times and the average of the 3 BP values should be used to determine
             the subject's eligibility.

          8. Clinically significant abnormalities in laboratory test results.

          9. Screening supine 12 lead ECG demonstrating a corrected QT (QTc) interval &gt;450 msec or
             a QRS interval &gt;120 msec. If QTc exceeds 450 msec, or QRS exceeds 120 msec, the ECG

             to affect subject safety or the overall results of the study may be permitted on a
             case by case basis, following approval by the sponsor.

         18. Blood donation (excluding plasma donations) of approximately 1 pint (500 mL) or more

             of this protocol.

         21. History of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B, or hepatitis C; positive
             testing for HIV, hepatitis B surface antigen (HepBsAg), hepatitis B core antibody
             (HepBcAb), or hepatitis C antibody (HCVAb).

         22. Subjects who are investigator site staff members directly involved in the conduct of
             the study and their family members, site staff members otherwise supervised by the
             investigator, or subjects who are Pfizer employees, including their family members,
             directly involved in the conduct of the study.

         23. Other acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition including recent (within the
             past year) or active suicidal ideation or behavior or laboratory abnormality that may
             increase the risk associated with study participation or investigational product
             administration or may interfere with the interpretation of study results and, in the
             judgment of the investigator, would make the subject inappropriate for entry into this
             study.
