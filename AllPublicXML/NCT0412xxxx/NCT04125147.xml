      This study evaluates the difference in postoperative bleeding between two study groups, FDA
      cleared MONTAGE Settable Resorbable Hemostatic Bone Putty and standard of care (no bone
      hemostat) during pedicle subtraction osteotomy procedures.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pedicle Subtraction osteotomy (PSO) is a surgical option for treating several spinal
      deformities. It has been utilized in alignment disorders of the fused spine, in the lumbar
      spine to treat large sagittal deformities and in patients with ankylosing spondylitis with
      thoracolumbar kyphotic deformity.

      PSO typically results in substantial loss of blood (as much as 2L) with a significant portion
      of the loss likely occurring at the osteotomy surfaces post-surgically. The control of
      peri-operative blood loss is considered a critical issue by spine surgeons. A variety of
      methods have been proposed for the reduction of blood loss during or immediately after spine
      surgery, including preoperative use of erythropoietin, autologous blood, cell salvage,
      intra-operative controlled hypotension, and the use of anti-fibrinolytic drugs. Bone
      hemostats have traditionally not been part of the standard of care to promote hemostasis
      probably because most traditional options (e.g., bone wax) are nonabsorbable and thus might
      interfere with fusion at the osteotomy site.

      MONTAGE is a settable (hardening) bioabsorbable polymer and hydroxyapatite/beta tricalcium
      phosphate based putty, used in the control of bleeding from bone during spine, orthopedic,
      craniomaxillofacial, thoracic and other surgical procedures, and has been FDA cleared.

Each incidence of instability will be categorized as belonging to one of the following groups: 1) hardware malplacement, 2) loosening or dislodgement, 3) nonunion or nonfusion with hardware fracture 4) nonunion or nonfusion without hardware fracture and 5) perihardware fracture.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Presence of spinal deformity requiring a PSO at a single site level, such as for
             patients with thoracolumbar kyphotic deformity, sagittal imbalance, and spinal global
             malalignment.

          -  Non-smokers (have proven to quit smoking for at least 6 months prior to surgery) and
             current smokers.

          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential must be willing to use acceptable methods of
             contraception (birth control pills, barriers, or abstinence). A pregnancy test at the
             Week 0 visit must be administered, and must be negative, for inclusion into the study.

          -  Subject understands and is willing to participate in the clinical study and can comply
             with required visits and the follow-up regimen.

          -  Subject has read and signed the Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics
             Committee (IEC) approved Informed Consent Form before screening procedures are
             undertaken.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects whose spinal deformity is deemed by the investigator to be of such severity
             that a possible surgical intervention would be either harmful or not warranted.

          -  Subjects with morbid obesity (i.e. a Body Mass Index [BMI] â‰¥ 40).

             their mobility making them completely bedridden).

          -  Subjects who, in the opinion of the investigator, show evidence of infection,
             cellulitis, and/or osteomyelitis.

          -  Subjects with abnormally low platelets, abnormal coagulation parameters, or with
             documented bleeding disorders, including a prior history of excessive bleeding during
             surgery.

             newly diagnosed malignancy, treated with cytotoxic therapies or radiation therapy.

          -  Subjects on any investigational drug(s) within 30 days preceding randomization (i.e.

             subject during the course of the study.

          -  Subjects with:

             (i) Alcohol abuse as recorded by an average daily intake of &gt; 4 units in females, &gt; 5
             units in males (i.e. 1 oz. of spirit, glass of wine, or can of beer per unit).

        (ii) Drug abuse as evidenced by the subject's use of illegal drugs or prescription drugs
        that have not been prescribed for him/her.

          -  Subjects with one or more medical conditions, as determined by medical history,
             including renal, hepatic, hematologic, active auto-immune or immune diseases that, in
             the opinion of the Investigator, would make the subject an inappropriate candidate for
             this study.

          -  Subjects with a history of osteoporosis, as defined by imaging, or on medication for
             osteoporosis or documented fracture of fragility (Hip fracture, osteoporotic
             compression fracture, distal radius fracture). If there are any concerns these may be
             arbitrated by the study PI.
