  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this project, the investigators will extend prior results of parent-reported executive
      function growth and symptom reduction in children receiving home-based treatment with the
      Collaborative Problem Solving treatment approach (CPS), with a particular focus on examining
      children who have attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The investigators will
      examine executive functioning (EF) of children who are receiving CPS, measuring EF with
      parent-report and objective computer-based tasks, at two timepoints: at the start of
      treatment and approximately four months later, and will collect symptoms at these plus three
      additional timepoints: at discharge, 6-months after discharge, and 12-months after discharge.

    <description>CPS is an approach for understanding and reducing challenging behavior in youth. Under CPS, caregivers are taught to understand and identify the specific neurocognitive skill deficits that underlie their child's challenging behavior. Then the caregivers are taught to interact with the child in a way that solves chronic behavior problems while building the lagging neurocognitive skills to avoid future problems.</description>
