    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to compare the hydronidone capsules (specification: 30
      mg/particle, test preparation) developed by Shanghai Ruixing Gene Technology corporation with
      Self reference preparation hydronidone capsule (specification: 15 mg/capsule) Differences in
      the extent and rate of absorption of healthy male subjects in Fasting state in China. Through
      the main pharmacokinetic parameters and relative bioavailability, whether the two are
      bioequivalent, and provide a basis for the registration of the test preparation
