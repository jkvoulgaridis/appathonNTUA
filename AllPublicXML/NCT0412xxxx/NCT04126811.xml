    <textblock>
      To observe the efficacy of apatinib combined with AI regimen chemotherapy compared with AI
      regimen chemotherapy and single-agent apatinib in patients with unresectable soft tissue
      sarcoma. The main observations were progression-free survival (PFS) and progression-free
      control rate (PFR), followed by objective response rates (ORR, CR+PR), disease control rate
      (DCR, CR+PR+SD), and overall survival ( OS).

      To observe the safety of apatinib combined with AI chemotherapy.
