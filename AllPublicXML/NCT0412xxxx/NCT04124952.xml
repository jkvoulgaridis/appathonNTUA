  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study to assess the spectacle independence and quality of vision of patients
      receiving the AcrySof® Panoptix® Intraocular lens (IOL) after uneventful cataract surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a single-arm unmasked clinical evaluation study of spectacle independence after
      successful bilateral cataract surgery. Subjects will be assessed pre-operatively, operatively
      and at 1 day, 1 month and 3 months post-operatively. Clinical evaluations will include
      administration of a spectacle independence questionnaire, as well as measurement of bilateral
      visual acuity and manifest refraction.

        Inclusion Criteria

        Subjects are eligible for the study if they meet the following criteria:

        Note: Ocular criteria must be met in both eyes.

          -  Presenting for uncomplicated bilateral cataract surgery and have an interest in
             spectacle independence using a multifocal IOL or multifocal toric IOL option

          -  Gender: Males and Females.

          -  Age: 40 or older.

          -  Willing and able to provide written informed consent for participation in the study.

          -  Willing and able to comply with scheduled visits and other study procedures.

          -  Have good ocular health, with no pathology that compromises visual acuity (outside of
             residual refractive error and cataract)

          -  Have regular corneal astigmatism with a magnitude that can be treated with a non-toric
             IOL or a toric IOL in the approved ranged for the Panoptix lens.

          -  Have 20/32 (0.2 logMAR) or better potential acuity in both eyes

        Exclusion Criteria If any of the following exclusion criteria are applicable to the subject
        or either eye, the subject should not be enrolled in the study.

          -  Irregular astigmatism (e.g. keratoconus)

          -  Corneal pathology (e.g. scar, dystrophy, pterygium, severe dry eye)

          -  Monocular status (e.g. amblyopia)

          -  Previous radial keratotomy, corneal refractive surgery or other corneal surgery (e.g.
             corneal transplant, lamellar keratoplasty)

          -  Previous anterior or posterior chamber surgery (e.g., vitrectomy, laser iridotomy)

          -  Diabetic retinopathy

          -  Macular pathology (e.g. age-related macular degeneration, epiretinal membrane)

          -  History of retinal detachment

          -  Subjects who have an acute or chronic disease or illness that would confound the
             results of this investigation (e.g., immunocompromised, connective tissue disease,
             clinically significant atopic disease, diabetes, and any other such disease or
             illness), that are known to affect postoperative visual acuity.

          -  Participation in any investigational drug or device trial within the previous 30 days
             prior to the start date of this trial (or currently participating).

        The principal investigator reserves the right to declare a patient ineligible or
        non-evaluable based on medical evidence that indicates they are unsuitable for the trial.

        Pregnancy has a known effect on the stability of refractions and visual acuity. As such,
        subjects who become pregnant during the study will not be discontinued but their data may
        be excluded from analyses of effectiveness.
