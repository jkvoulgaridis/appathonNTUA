  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sedentary lifestyle in Asian children together with aversive parenting style may compromise
      their physical and psychological health. The aim of the proposed stratified, randomized
      controlled study are to explore the beneficial effects of Japanese martial art (karate) and
      Chinese martial art (Ving Tsun kung fu) training on improving the psychophysical health in
      this population. Over fifty-two Asian children (age = 6-12 years) will be recruited from
      schools in Hong Kong and then randomly assigned to either a karate group or a Ving Tsun
      group. Children in both groups will receive the respective physical and spiritual martial art
      training for 3 months (3 times/week, one hour each). Outcomes will be evaluated at baseline
      and after the intervention by a blinded assessor. Primary outcomes include muscle power of
      the arms and legs as measured by a medicine ball throw test and a standing long jump test,
      respectively. Secondary outcomes include flexibility as quantified by a sit-and-reach test,
      aggression as measured by the Reactive-Proactive Aggression Questionnaire, and attention as
      measured by the Child Behavioral Checklist-Youth Self-Report. Both karate and Ving Tsun kung
      fu training programs are predicted to improve physical health of Asian children. It is
      expected that these training programs can be incorporated into the physical education classes
      or extracurricular activities in schools or in the community to improve project
      sustainability.
