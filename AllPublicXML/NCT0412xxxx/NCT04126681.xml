  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of HQP1351 in patients with chronic
      myeloid leukemia in chronic phase (CML-CP) who are resistant and/or intolerant to first- and
      second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors. The efficacy of HQP1351 is determined by
      evaluating the subjects' event free survival (EFS).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2, randomized, open label, pivotal study to evaluate the efficacy and safety
      of HQP1351 in CML CP patients who are resistant and/or intolerant to first- and
      second-generation TKIs in China. A total of 141 CML CP patients will be included in this
      study. After screening, eligible subjects will be randomized by 2:1 ratio to enter HQP1351
      therapy cohort and best available therapy (BAT) cohort. When the subjects in the two cohorts
      reach EFS assessment, they can crossover to contralateral cohort if the investigator and
      Sponsor think they could be clinically benefited. During treatment, each subject will be
      assessed regularly for hematological, cytogenetic and molecular responses. At the same time,
      safety information also will be evaluated.
