    <textblock>
      The first large population-based study to evaluate lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) and
      their impact on quality of life in night workers. The study objective is to assess the
      prevalence and bother of LUTS in the population of night workers.

      This study will be conducted as a questionnaire survey with assessment of LUTS using a
      standardized protocol based on definitions by the International Continence Society (ICS). The
      International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), the Overactive Bladder— Validated 8-question
      Screener (OAB-V8), the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), the Athen Insomnia Scale, the
      Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire (WPAI), the 12-Item Short Form Health
      Survey (SF-12) questionnaires will be included. Participants will be also asked to rate how
      often they experienced individual LUTS and the degree of associated bother.
