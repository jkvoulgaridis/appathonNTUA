    <textblock>
      Aim: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a hereditary disease. Approximately 5% of the world's
      population carries trait genes for haemoglobin disorders, mainly, sickle-cell disease and
      thalassaemia. The incidence of sickle cell disease varies according to different geographical
      locations. Persons with SCD experience both acute and chronic pain. it is important that
      nonpharmacological therapies be investigated and used as complements to pharmacological
      therapies to address and treat both acute and chronic pain for those with SCD. An educational
      program involving parents with children with SCD can help parents use nonpharmacological
      methods for their children in reducing pain. The training program allows parents to develop
      their knowledge of the SCD and the importance of non-pharmacological methods, and may provide
      parents with the opportunity to develop preventive attitudes towards reducing pain crises.
      The research has two purposes. The first is to identify the non-pharmacological approaches
      that parents use to help their children with sickle cell disease in Turkey, Chad. Second, to
      determine the effectiveness of non-pharmacological approaches given to parents in Turkey,
      Chad.

      Method: This study is an experimental research method using a quasi‐experimental design. This
      study used a pretest and posttest, with a design that is used is the two group
      pretest-posttest design. The study was conducted on the parents of children with sickle cell
      disease diagnosed and followed up in the Pediatric Hematology Oncology polyclinics of two
      hospitals in Chad in Central Africa between September 2015 and February 2016. The study found
      in April 2016 and July 2016 between Turkey's southern Antalya and Mersin two university
      hospital outpatient Children's pediatric hematology oncology has made clinic on sickle cell
      disease diagnosed and monitored the children's parents. The parents were selected using
      eligibility criteria and the study was performed in three steps (Pre-intervention testing
      session, education session, and post-intervention testing session). In the first step,
      &quot;Information Form&quot;, &quot;Parents' Experience of Nonpharmacological Methods Questionnaire&quot;, and
      &quot;Nonpharmacological Approaches Used by Parents for Their Children and Knowledge of Parents
      about Nonpharmacological Approaches Questionnaire&quot; questionnaires were applied to parents. In
      the second step an individual education was conducted by the researcher using the education
      book. In the third step, the questionnaire were reapplied after 3 weeks.

      In this study, nonpharmacological approaches used by parents of sickle cell anemia patients
      were determined. However, the effectiveness of the education given to non-pharmacological
      approaches to parents was examined.

      The study was first applied to parents in Chad. Then applied to parents in Turkey. n the
      study, parents' experience of nonpharmacological approaches questionnaire was used.

      The form consisted of 8 multiple-choice questions, including a single open-ended question. If
      the parent used a nonpharmacological approach for the child, the name of the
      nonpharmacological approach (open ‐ ended question) was written on the form.

      In addition, the form was asked to write the frequency of using a nonpharmacological approach
      (sometimes / always / not use). Parents' pre- and post-educational knowledge of
      non-pharmacological methods to reduce the pain of children with SCD was measured with a
      closed-ended questionnaire developed by the researchers in the literature (he knows/he does
      not know). Nonpharmacological approaches in sickle cell disease training book was the
      intervention of this study. Nonpharmacological approaches in sickle cell disease training
      book &quot;Parental Education Program for Nonpharmacological Approaches Used in Pain in Children
      with Sickle Cell Disease&quot;, was prepared according to previous studies by the researchers. The
      language used for administration of the instruments and the language used in education book
      was French / Arabic / Turkish.

In addition, the form was asked to write the frequency of using nonpharmacological approach (sometimes/always/not use). The questionnaire about the nonpharmacological approach used by the parents was created by the researchers. This form, prepared by the researcher according to the literature, includes nonpharmacological approaches that parents can use in pain crisis.</description>

Nonpharmacological approaches of pain relief parental information questionnaire was prepared according to previous studies by the researchers (Williams&amp;Tanabe, 2016; Wong, 2013; Demir, 2012; Monti&amp;Yang, 2005; Delicou &amp; Maragkos, 2013).
Five expert opinions were consulted for the understandability of the questionnaire before the study. Two of them were doctors specializing in Sickle Cell Disease and three of them were the lecturers of the nursing department.</description>
