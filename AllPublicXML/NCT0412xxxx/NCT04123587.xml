  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was designed to reproduce candidate single nucleotide variants found by whole
      exome sequencing in some type 2 diabetic patients dependent on sulfonylurea in a separate
      patient group. The validation of the dependence-related variations performed in this study is
      expected to help decision-making in the clinical use of sulfonylurea in the future.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sulfonylurea, one of the oral hypoglycemic agents, is the oldest and most widely used drug.
      The use of sulfonylurea was overwhelming compared to metformin especially in East Asia, where
      insulin secretion was notable during the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes. However,
      sulfonylurea causes hypoglycemia and weight gain, increases cardiovascular disease and
      mortality compared to other oral preparations. With the recent development of other oral
      hypoglycemic agents for lowering blood glucose without the risk of hypoglycemia and with
      cardiovascular protection, sulfonylurea is in a decreasing state of use worldwide.

      But some patients tend to be highly dependent on sulfonylurea for blood glucose control. It
      suggests that there will be a group of patients whose the action of sulfonylurea is strongly
      influenced by genetic factor, since insulin secretion of pancreatic beta cells is very
      hereditary, genetic variations that increase the risk of type 2 diabetes are found mainly in
      genes related to beta cell dysfunction rather than insulin resistance, and the more risk
      variants of type 2 diabetes, the less likely the effect of sulfonylurea is.

      The investigators had performed whole exome sequencing in patients showing dependence on
      sulfonylurea and identified tens of candidate variants.

      In this study, the investigators will select patients with dependence on sulfonylurea by
      prospective intervention (by discontinuing and resuming sulfonylurea) and perform genetic
      tests.
