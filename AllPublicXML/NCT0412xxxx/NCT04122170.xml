  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase 2B study is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study.
      The study is designed to evaluate the efficacy of PB2452 in reversing the anti-platelet
      effects of ticagrelor as part of a dual antiplatelet regimen and to evaluate the safety and
      tolerability of PB2452 in subjects aged 50-80 years old.

      Approximately 200 subjects between 50-80 years old will be enrolled across the US or other
      countries across 5-15 sites. The subjects will be randomized at a ratio of 3:1 receiving
      either the PB2452 investigational study drug or placebo. Hence, a total of approximately 150
      subjects will be receiving PB2452 and approximately 50 subjects will be receiving placebo.

  <detailed_description>

      The study will consist of a Screening period, a Check-in day and Pretreatment Period, an
      on-site Randomization/Treatment day, a Follow-up Visit (Day 7), and a Final Follow-up visit
      (Day 35). Seven days prior to Randomization, subjects will be administered ASA 81 mg orally
      once daily (QD) until the final dose on Day 1. Beginning in the morning on Day -2, a single
      dose of oral ticagrelor 180 mg will be given, followed by oral ticagrelor 90 mg every 12
      hours for 4 additional doses through to Day 1 (2 hours before study drug is initiated; this
      will be 5 total doses of ticagrelor).

      On Day 1, subjects who meet all the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria
      will randomized with 3:1 allocation ratio (active:placebo), to receive an IV dose of PB2452
      or placebo 2 hours following the 5th ticagrelor dose. Subjects may be discharged from the
      clinical site between Days 3 and 7 inclusive and will return for a Follow-up visit on Day 7,
      if already discharged, and on Day 35 (±3 days).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject provides written informed consent and agrees to comply with all protocol
             requirements throughout study participation.

          -  The subject is male or female between ≥50 and ≤80 years of age.

          -  The subject has a body mass index between 18 and 35 kg/m2 and a weight of ≥ 50 kg but
             ≤ 120 kg, inclusive, at screening.

          -  The subject is considered by the Investigator to be in good general health as
             determined by medical history, clinical laboratory test results, vital sign
             measurements, 12 lead ECG results, and physical examination findings at screening.
             Subjects with chronic, stable, and well-controlled medical conditions, are eligible
             provided they meet all other inclusion/exclusion criteria.

          -  Subjects entering the study must be willing to start and/or document an 81 mg daily
             dose of aspirin on Day -7 and must document daily dosing until the final dose is
             administered on the morning of Day 1. Subjects already taking daily aspirin must
             suspend aspirin dosing after Day 1 until discharge from the clinical facility.

          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential must not be pregnant, lactating, or planning
             to become pregnant for 3 months after the last dose of study drug. Female subjects of
             childbearing potential must use two effective methods of birth control from screening
             and before study drug administration through to the end of the study.

          -  Male subjects with partners of childbearing potential must agree to use appropriate
             and effective measures of contraception.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  In the opinion of the Investigator there are concern(s) regarding the inability of the
             subject to comply with study procedures and/or follow up, or, if the subject is not
             suitable for entry into the study.

          -  History of any acute or chronic medical disorder expected to decrease the life
             expectancy of the subject to an extent where the subject's study participation is
             affected.

          -  History or presence of gastrointestinal (GI), hepatic (with the exception of Gilbert's
             syndrome), or any other condition known to interfere with absorption, distribution,
             metabolism, or excretion of drugs.

          -  Significant renal insufficiency as indicated by estimated GFR &lt;15 mL/min/1.73m2
             according to the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD).

          -  Any clinically significant acute illness, medical/surgical procedure, or trauma within
             4 weeks of the administration of study drug or any planned surgical procedure that
             will occur during the study.

          -  Any clinically significant abnormal findings in physical examination, vital signs,
             laboratory assessments, and ECG parameters identified during screening or check-in.

          -  Any specific contraindication to ticagrelor as described in the ticagrelor prescribing
             information.

          -  Receiving chronic treatment with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [including
             aspirin (&gt;100 mg daily), anticoagulants, or other antiplatelet agents that cannot be
             discontinued 14 days prior to screening including clopidogrel, prasugrel, ticlopidine,
             dipyridamole, or cilostazol].

          -  Concomitant use of digoxin or lovastatin at doses &gt; 40 mg.

          -  Positive test result for hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis C virus antibody, or
             human immunodeficiency virus types 1 or 2 antibodies at screening.

          -  Concomitant therapy with strong CYP3A inhibitors, CYP3A substrates with narrow
             therapeutic indices, or strong CYP3A inducers, which cannot be stopped within at least
             5 half-lives, but not shorter than 10 days, before randomization.

          -  Has received another investigational drug within 30 days of the administration of
