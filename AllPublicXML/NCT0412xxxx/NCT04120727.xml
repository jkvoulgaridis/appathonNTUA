  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Osteoarthritis is the most common articular disease affecting the joint in a comprehensive
      and progressive manner. It is a chronic pathology correlated with age since nearly one in two
      adults is affected by osteoarthritis. The care of osteoarthritis is based on pharmacological
      and non-pharmacological treatment. The latest recommendations support the non-pharmacological
      part including regular physical activity, therapeutic education and weight loss. Today tools
      are lacking for the patient and the practitioner to ensure long-term motivation and support.

      Connected objects, as future-oriented tools, are a customizable way to meet the expectations
      of both patients and professionals. The main objective of this study is to analyze the
      expectations regarding the use of a smartphone application for monitoring and support in the
      practice of exercises and regular physical activity in patients osteoarthritic.

      The secondary objective is to collect information on the use of connected objects dedicated
      to the management of osteoarthritis by patients and health professionals.

      This study is aimed at patients with predominant knee osteoarthritis and health professionals
      with a link to the pathology.

      A semi-directed interview according to a pre-established interview guide will be performed.
      Interviews are conducted by trained professionals and recorded with a dictaphone.
      Self-questionnaires are submitted to the patient after the interview.

      The recordings are transcribed as quickly as possible in text format. The verbatim will then
      be coded (axial coding) then grouped by categories and then by themes.

      The objective is to determine the expectations of patients and health professionals regarding
      a smartphone application dedicated to osteoarthritis.

      This study will serve as a basis for designing a tool of this type to improve the long-term
      management of osteoarthritis.
