  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well ramucirumab and pembrolizumab work in treating EGFR
      mutant non-small cell lung cancer that has come back (recurrent) or spread to other places in
      the body (metastatic). Ramucirumab may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the
      enzymes needed for cell growth. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as
      pembrolizumab, may help the body?s immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with
      the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving ramucirumab and pembrolizumab may work
      better in treating EGFR mutant non-small cell lung cancer compared to pembrolizumab alone.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To evaluate response rate of the combination of ramucirumab and pembrolizumab in EGFR
      mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To evaluate safety, tolerability, and survival for patients receiving pembrolizumab and
      ramucirumab.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To characterize predictive immunologic biomarkers of response in tissue and peripheral
      blood of patients receiving ramucirumab and pembrolizumab combination therapy.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive ramucirumab intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes and pembrolizumab IV over 30
      minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 35 cycles in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, every 3 months for
      1 year, and then every 6 months for 1 year.
