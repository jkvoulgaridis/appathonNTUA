    <textblock>
      The M6-C Post Approval Study is a long term follow-up study of subjects previously enrolled
      and treated in the M6-C Artificial Cervical Disc IDE Study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A prospective, concurrently controlled, multi-center pivotal study to evaluate the safety and
      effectiveness of the M6-C™ Artificial Cervical Disc compared to anterior cervical discectomy
      and fusion (ACDF) was performed in the United States under IDE #G050254. To fulfill the
      concurrent control design of the study, there were clinical sites that evaluated the safety
      and effectiveness of the M6-C™ Artificial Cervical Disc and there were other clinical sites
      that evaluated ACDF. Subjects in the study were treated between May 2014 and June 2016 and
      remain in follow-up. The M6-C™ Artificial Cervical Disc received FDA approval to market on
      February 6, 2019. As a condition of approval, the FDA requested that the sponsor perform a
      post market approval study (PAS). The subjects enrolled and remaining in the M6-C IDE pivotal
      study are the prospective patient population for the PAS.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall subject success</measure>
    <time_frame>10 year follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>A study subject will be considered an overall success if he/she meets the following criteria:
No serious adverse event(s) classified as device or device procedure related (as determined by the CEC), and
No subsequent surgical procedure at the index level (including revision, removal, reoperation, or supplemental fixation), and
Maintenance or improvement in neurological function, and
Improvement on the NDI of at least 15 points.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Neck Disability Index (NDI)</measure>
    <time_frame>annually to 10 years</time_frame>
    <description>The NDI is a patient reported outcome questionnaire for the measurement of pain and function related to cervical spine problems. A total NDI score is determined by adding the scores of the individual questions and dividing that total by the maximum possible score (i.e., 50 if all questions are answered) to yield a percentage. Therefore, the NDI score ranges from 0% to 100%. A lower score represents less pain and dysfunction.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Neck and arm pain</measure>
    <time_frame>annually to 10 years</time_frame>
    <description>A visual analogue scale is a patient reported outcome measure utilized to determine neck and arm pain on a zero to ten scale with zero being the least amount of pain and 10 the most possible pain.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>SF-36 Health Survey</measure>
    <time_frame>annually to 10 years</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-36 is a patient reported outcome questionnaire to measure health-related Quality of Life. An increase in score from baseline represents an improvement in health.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>annually to 10 years</time_frame>
    <description>The following 5 point Likert Scale will be used to further assess subject satisfaction:
How satisfied are you with the results of your surgery? Very Satisfied; Satisfied; Neutral; Unsatisfied; Very Unsatisfied
All things considered, would you have the surgery again? Very likely; likely; not sure; Unlikely; Very Unlikely
Would you recommend the surgery to a friend or family member? Very likely; likely; not sure; Unlikely; Very Unlikely</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Odom's Criteria</measure>
    <time_frame>annually to 10 years</time_frame>
    <description>At the 5, 7 and 10 year follow-up visits, the Investigator will rate the clinical disposition of each study subject according to Odom's Criteria[18] as follows:
Excellent: No symptoms related to cervical disease. Able to perform daily activities without limitations.
Good: Moderate symptoms related to cervical disease. Able to perform daily activities without significant limitations.
Satisfactory: Slight improvement is symptoms related to cervical disease. Significant limitations in daily activities.
Poor: No improvement in, or aggravation of, symptoms related to cervical disease. Not able to perform daily activities.</description>

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Since the subjects have already been screened as part of the IDE's pivotal study, and
             only subjects that participated in that study make up the subject cohort for this
             long-term follow-up study, there are no additional inclusion criteria

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who were withdrawn or withdrew consent to participate in the investigation

          -  Subjects who do not consent to participate in long-term follow-up or provide personal
             contact information to the sponsor (solely for the purposes of tracking subjects to
             help ensure follow-up compliance)

          -  Patients with terminal failures (SSI or device- or procedure-related SAE) by Month 24
             and all known patient deaths in the M6-C IDE study are excluded for enrollment into
             the PAS
