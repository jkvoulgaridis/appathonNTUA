  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      S-ICD avoids the use intravascular leads and their associated risks, has been increasingly
      used for primary and secondary prevention of sudden death. The long-term safety and feasible
      of S-ICD system in Asian population with a smaller body size remain unclear. The
      investigators propose to perform a prospective study in Korean population to investigate the
      safety and feasibility of S-ICD for primary or secondary prevention of sudden cardiac death.

      The investigators propose to prospectively recruit 300 patients who are qualified to receive
      the EMBLEM S-ICD system by following the proposed BSC Patient Screening Steps in 10 sites in
      Korea. All patients will be follow-up as standard of care to collect acute procedural and
      device related complications as well as long-term, device related, clinical and patient
      reported outcomes. Follow up data will be systematically collected over 24 months
      post-implant.
