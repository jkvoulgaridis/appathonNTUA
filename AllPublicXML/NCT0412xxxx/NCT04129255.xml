      Evaluating the impact of OCTREOTIDE LAR on the immune response by studying Regulatory T-cell
      (T-Reg) and Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) and the immunoregulatory cell population
      in peripheral blood of NET G1 / G2 patients treated with Octreotide LAR
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      MDSCs and T-Regs will be evaluated at baseline pre-treatment with octreotide, after 15 days,
      at three and at six months and before each octreotide LAR administration for 12 months. MDSC
      cells will be detected by surface receptors LIN-, CD11b, CD14, CD15, CD33, CD124-IL4-Ra,
      CD184-CXCR4, CD279-PD1, HLA-DR and T-reg cells from CD3, CD4, CD8 receptors , CD25, CD39,
      CD45RA, CD45R0, CD62L, CD127, CD152-CTLA-4, CD184-CXCR4, CD278-ICOS, CD279-PD-1. Briefly, CD4
      + cells will be separated by negative selection, using the mixture of human CD4 antibodies.
      Octreotide is currently a registered drug to the FDA, EMA and AIFA with the indication for
      the treatment of well and moderately differentiated NETs functioning and not working on the
      front line. .

    <description>The primary objective of the project is to evaluate changes in immune-regulatory cells induced by OCT LAR from baseline to month 6. Therefore, we will observe the impact of OCTREOTIDE LAR on the immune response by studying T-Reg and MDSC and the immunoregulatory cell population in peripheral blood of patients with neuroendocrine tumors G1 / G2 treated with OCT LAR.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Signed informed consent prior to initiation of any study-specific procedures or
             treatment, as confirmation of the patients awareness and willingness to comply with
             the study requirements.

          -  Patients ≥18 years of age.

          -  Patients with histologically confirmed well and moderately differentiated
