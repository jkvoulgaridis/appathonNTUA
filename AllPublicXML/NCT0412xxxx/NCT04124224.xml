  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For 19 years, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention-funded Arizona Prevention
      Research Center (AzPRC) has been engaged in academic community collaborative research to
      reduce chronic disease health disparities among the Latino border communities in Arizona. Our
      research project, Unidos: Linking Individuals' to Social Determinant and Community Health
      Services, will result in a model Community-Clinical Linkage intervention to reduce chronic
      disease risk among Latinos in Arizona. Further, the investigators expect this intervention
      model to be applicable in other regions and populations. To execute this research, the AzPRC
      will implement the intervention in partnership with county health departments and Federally
      Qualified Health Centers. In Unidos the county/community-based CHWs will: 1) support and
      connect participants to health promotion resources; 2) provide individual and group-based
      support guided by a novel framework for understanding Latino's health advantages, the
      sociocultural resiliency model; and, 3) leverage community resources to help individuals
      address SDH-related needs.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Latinos in Arizona, who are predominantly of Mexican-origin, are disproportionately affected
      by chronic disease and social conditions that contribute to health disparities. Important
      social determinants of health (SDH)--conditions where people live, work, and play--include
      barriers to healthy food, physical activity, poverty, discrimination, and housing instability
      as well as insufficient access to quality and culturally-responsive services. Such factors
      are increasingly recognized within primary care and population health as equal drivers of
      chronic disease and clinical indicators. Latino health is complex with not only
      disproportionate barriers, but also health advantages compared to other groups.

      Recently, federally qualified health centers (FQHCs) have begun to incorporate assessments of
      their clients' SDH. With their foci on high-level clinical care for underserved populations,
      however, the capacity of these entities to respond to social and community needs is markedly
      limited. Community-clinical linkage (CCL) models provide opportunities for FQHCs to work
      collaboratively with other entities to leverage extant community resources and capacities.
      County health departments are uniquely positioned to collaborate with primary care partners
      and other community agencies to address social determinants.

      Existing evidence of the effectiveness of CCLs in improving the health status of Latinos and
      their antecedent social conditions is scarce. The AzPRC will address this gap by executing a
      practice-based public health research study within four underserved, predominantly
      Mexican-origin communities. Our core research project, Unidos: Linking Individuals' to Social
      Determinant and Community Health Services, will result in a model CCL intervention to reduce
      chronic disease risk among Latinos in Arizona. Further, the investigators expect this
      intervention model to be applicable in other regions and populations. To execute this
      research, the AzPRC will implement the intervention in partnership with county health
      departments and FQHCs. In Unidos the county/community-based CHWs will: 1) support and connect
      participants to health promotion resources; 2) provide individual and group-based support
      guided by a novel framework for understanding Latino's health advantages, the sociocultural
      resiliency model; and, 3) leverage community resources to help individuals address
      SDH-related needs. The aims of this research study are to

        1. Implement and evaluate Unidos, a community-delivered, SDH-focused CHW intervention. The
           core elements of the evaluation will include community-responsive, mixed methodologies.
           Our hypothesis is that the Unidos intervention will reduce overall chronic disease risk,
           defined from the biological component from the American Heart Association's Life's
           Simple 7. A rigorous quasi-experimental design will be employed to determine Unidos'
           effect from electronic health records extracted 12 months after enrollment, with
           comparisons of clients participating vs not participating in the 6-month intervention.
           Exploratory analyses of cost effectiveness will be executed to further inform the
           scaling and sustainability of the intervention within local and county health department
           infrastructures.

        2. To test the sociocultural resilience model of Latino health advantages through the
           collection and analysis of longitudinal data that includes rich markers of reported
           health status, health behaviors, and psychosocial factors. The investigators have two
           hypotheses: a) the CHW-led, culturally embedded, intervention will lead to enhanced
           social support, social networks, health behaviors, quality of life and general health;
           and b) social support and social networks will mediate improvements in reported health
           observed over 6 months.

        3. A secondary aim is to examine whether our novel, CHW-administered assessments,
           contribute to the understanding of Latino health risk and advantages beyond a
           self-administered SDH tool that recently became integrated in the electronic health
           record (EHR) of two of our four clinical partners. The partners' use of this
           self-administered SDH tool is part of a national effort where select FQHCs across the
           country are testing whether it has utility for understanding and better addressing the
           population health needs of the patients they serve.

    <description>The investigators will collaborate with our community partners to implement and evaluate a Community-Clinical Linkage (CCL) model in which Community Health Workers (CHWs) connect individuals to social determinant and community health services and build sociocultural resilience through CHW-facilitated individual and group support. As a public health practice-based study that incorporates evidence-based strategies, the investigators seek to establish Unidos effectiveness in Arizona counties with the highest percentage of Latinos of Mexican origin (Yuma, Pima, Santa Cruz, and Maricopa). Unidos CHWs, based in local health departments, will use evidence-based strategies to address three elements that are important in addressing chronic disease risk: 1) health promotion resources and programs; 2) individual and group-based social support; and 3) leveraging community resources to address social determinants of health.</description>

        Arizona counties with significant Latino populations experience underlying social and
        economic disparities that place them at risk for chronic disease and negative health
        outcomes. The participating Maricopa, Pima, Yuma, and Santa Cruz counties are where a
        significant number of the Latino population for the state reside. Compared to the US
        population, communities in Arizona with a higher percentages of Latinos are more likely to
        face poverty, be uninsured, and have chronic disease risks.
