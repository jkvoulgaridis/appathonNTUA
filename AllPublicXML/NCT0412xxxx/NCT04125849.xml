  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Esophageal cancer is one of the major diseases that seriously threatens an individual's
      health and life. To reduce the incidence of postoperative complications and mortality of
      esophageal cancer, thoraco-laparoscopic oesophagectomy (TLE) has been recommended by many
      guidelines since the 2000s. Additionally, with developments in endoscopy technology in recent
      years, mediastinoscopy-assisted transhiatal esophagectomy (MATHE) has been used in clinical
      practice. In 2015, the first mediastinoscopy combined with laparoscopic radical esophagectomy
      was reported systematically by Hitoshi Fujiwara. This surgical procedure has been performed
      in many centres in China. However, there is no multicentre prospective randomized controlled
      study that explored the safety, feasibility and short-term clinical efficacy between
      mediastinoscopy-assisted transhiatal esophagectomy and thoraco-laparoscopic esophagectomy. We
      aim to evaluate the feasibility and safety of MATHE.

    <textblock>
      Esophageal resection remains the mainstay of treatment for esophageal cancer patients.
      Despite improvements in surgical technique and perioperative management, esophagectomy
      carries considerable operative risk. To reduce the incidence of postoperative complications
      and mortality of esophageal cancer, the optional of minimally invasive esophagectomy has been
      recommended by many guidelines since 2000s. In addition, with the development of endoscopy
      technology in recent years, mediastinoscopy-assisted transhiatal esophagectomy (MATHE) has
      been used in clinical practices. In 2015, the first mediastinoscopy combined with
      laparoscopic radical esophagectomy was reported systematically by Hitoshi Fujiwara. This
      surgical procedure has been performed in many centers of China since then. Compared with MIE,
      MATHE allows controlled dissection of upper mediastinum and biopsy of mediastinal lymph
      nodes. No study directly comparing MATHE versus MIE has been reported to date. In this
      report, we compare MATHE with MIE in terms of surgical feasibility, safety, and survival.We
      intend to adopt a randomized controlled study method. The study group is
      mediastinoscopy-assisted transhiatal esophagectomy (MATHE) group, and the control group is
      thoraco-laparoscopic esophagectomy (TLE) group. This study is expected to provide high-level
      evidence for the new methods and to provide better treatment options for patients with
      esophageal cancer.
