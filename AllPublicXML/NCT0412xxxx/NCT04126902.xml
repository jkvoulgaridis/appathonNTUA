    <textblock>
      Introduction: The etiology/pathophysiology of preeclampsia remains an enigma. Cellular
      immunity is a key factor in the etiology of late-onset preeclampsia (L-PrE). Presepsin is
      split out from the phagocytes membranes after phagocytosis. To investigators knowledge, this
      is the first study in literature to investigate maternal blood concentrations of presepsin in
      preeclampsia and healthy pregnant women.

      Methods: The investigators examined maternal plasma interleukin-6, presepsin and pentraxin-3
      concentrations in pregnant women with (n=44) and without L-PrE (n=44). These three
      inflammatory markers concentrations measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were
      compared.

      This observational case-control study was designed at Cengiz Gokcek Women's and Children's
      Hospital, Gaziantep, Turkey, in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology between June 2018
      and January 2019. The protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee for Clinical Research of
      Gaziantep University (Reference number: 2018/393). The study strictly adhered to the
      principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. All subjects included in the study gave oral and
      written informed consent. Eighty-eight women were enrolled in the study in two groups. All
      participants will gave their oral and written informed consent before their inclusion in the
      study.

    <description>The diagnosis of L-PrE, as defined by the Committee on Terminology of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), is established based on the presence of proteinuria (urinary excretion of protein ≥300 mg in a 24-h urine specimen, or proteinüria ≥1+ in dipstick) and a blood pressure level of ≥90/140 mmHg (two blood pressure measurements 6 h apart) that occurs after 34 weeks of gestation in a previously normotensive woman. The diastolic and/or systolic blood pressure &lt;110/160 mm Hg, it was accepted as mild; and in case these values exceeded this level, it was accepted as severe. The study population consisted of 50 late-onset preeclampsia patients as study group and 50 patients with normal pregnancies as control group.</description>
