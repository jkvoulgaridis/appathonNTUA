          4. Newly diagnosed auto immune type 1 diabetes confirmed by at least one positive auto
             antibody:glutamic acid decarboxylase (anti-GAD65), protein tyrosine phosphatase-like
             protein (anti-IA-2); zinc transporter 8 (anti-ZnT8); islet cell (cytoplasmic)
             (anti-ICA).

          5. Able to receive first dose of study drug within 100 days of diagnosis of T1DM.

          6. Peak stimulated C-peptide levels ≥0.2 pmol/mL (0.6 ng/mL) following standard liquid
             mixed meal tolerance test (MMTT), to be conducted when the subject is metabolically
             stable, at least 2 weeks from diagnosis and within 42 days prior to randomization.

          7. Study participants are to complete all recommended immunizations at least 4 weeks
             prior to first dose with study drug and in accordance with local immunization
             guidelines. Immunization with a live vaccine must be done at least 4 months prior to
             the first dose. In the event a subject has not had all vaccinations recommended
             according to local guidance, the screening period may be extended beyond 42 days to
             allow these vaccinations to be administered, but first dose of study drug must be
             administered within 100 days of diagnosis of T1DM. Must be willing to comply with the
             standard of care for diabetes management.

          8. A negative pregnancy test at screening is required for all sexually mature female
             subjects prior to participation in the study.

          9. Subject and/or guardian must be able to communicate well with the investigator, to
             understand and comply with the requirements of the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Diabetes forms other than auto immune type 1 such as maturity-onset diabetes of the
             young (MODY), latent autoimmune diabetes of the adult (LADA), acquired diabetes
             (secondary to medications or surgery), type 2 diabetes by judgement of the
             investigator.

          2. Diabetic ketoacidosis within 2 weeks of the baseline MMTT test.

             count (WBC) outside the range of 1,500-15,000/mm3 (1.5-15.0 x 109/L) neutrophil count
             (&lt;1500/mm3) (&lt;1.5 X 109 / L) lymphocyte count &lt;500/mm3 (&lt;0.5 X 109 / L) hemoglobin
             (Hgb) &lt;8.0 g/dL platelets &lt;100,000/mm3 (&lt;100 x 109/L)

             aPTT and PT/ INR at screening.

          7. Tuberculosis infection assessed by positive QuantiFERON TB-Gold test (QFT) at
             screening. Subjects with a positive QFT test may participate in the study if further
             work up (according to local practice/guidelines) establishes conclusively that the
             subject has no evidence of active tuberculosis. If presence of latent tuberculosis is
             established, then anti tuberculosis treatment must have been initiated and maintained
             according to local country guidelines.

          8. Chronic infection with Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV). A positive HBV surface
             antigen (HBsAg) test, at screening, excludes a subject. Subjects with a positive HCV
             antibody test should have HCV RNA levels measured. Subjects with positive (detectable)
             HCV RNA should be excluded.

          9. Positive human immune virus HIV test (ELISA and Western Blot) at screening.

         10. Evidence of EBV, CMV and/or HSV infection above laboratory upper limit of normal at
             screening.

         11. Major dental work (e.g. tooth extractions or dental surgery with access to dental
             pulp) within 8 days of first dose; febrile illness within 48 hrs of first dose.

         12. Use of other investigational drugs or use of immunosuppressive agents at the time of
             enrollment, or within 5 half-lives of enrollment, or until the expected PD effect has
             returned to baseline, whichever is longer; or longer if required by local regulations.

         13. History of multiple and recurring allergies or allergy to the investigational
             compound/compound class being used in this study.

         14. History of severe hypersensitivity reaction or anaphylaxis to biological agents, e.g.
             human monoclonal antibody.

         15. History of malignancy of any organ system (other than localized basal cell carcinoma
             of the skin), treated or untreated, within 5 years of screening, regardless of whether
             there is evidence of local recurrence or metastases.

         16. Active serious psychiatric disorders (diagnosed or treated by a psychiatrist), such as
             eating disorders and psychosis or history thereof.

         17. Any complicating medical issues or clinically abnormal laboratory results that may
             cause an increased safety risk to the subject as judged by the investigator.

         18. Ongoing, and up to 2 weeks prior to screening, use of medications that may affect
             glucose control (e.g, systemic steroids, thiazides, beta blockers). A short course of
             oral steroids &lt;10 days if medically required is permissible with sponsor notification.

         19. History of drug abuse, nicotine or harmful alcohol use within 12 months prior to first
             dose, or evidence (as determined by the investigators) of such abuse at screening. For
             example, harmful alcohol use in adults is defined as five or more drinks per day for 5
             or more days in the past 30 days. Harmful alcohol use by adolescents (age 13-18 years)
             is to be determined by the investigator, based on local culture and laws. Any alcohol
             use by children (age 6-12) is a disqualifier.

         20. Use of any prescription drugs other than those allowed by this protocol Section 6
             herbal supplements, prescribed medicinal use of cannabis/marijuana and/or
             over-the-counter (OTC) medication, dietary supplements (vitamins included) within two
             weeks prior to first dose. If needed, (i.e. an incidental and limited need)
             paracetamol/acetaminophen is acceptable, but must be documented in the Concomitant
             medications / Significant nondrug therapies page of the CRF.

         21. Taking medications prohibited by the protocol.

         22. Pregnant or nursing (lactating) women, where pregnancy is defined as the state of a
             female after conception and until the termination of gestation, confirmed by a
             positive hCG laboratory test.

         23. Women of child-bearing potential, defined as all women, who are sexually active,
             physiologically capable of becoming pregnant (e.g. menstruating), unless they are
             using highly effective methods of contraception during dosing and for 14 weeks after
             stopping the investigational drug. Highly effective contraception methods include:
             Total abstinence from heterosexual intercourse (when this is in line with the
             preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject). Periodic abstinence (e.g.
             calendar,ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not
             acceptable methods of contraception. Female sterilization (have had surgical bilateral
             oophorectomy with or without hysterectomy), total hysterectomy or tubal ligation at
             least six weeks prior to first dose. In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the
             reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level
             assessment. Male sterilization in the sexual partner of female study participant (at
             least 6 months prior to screening). For female subjects on the study the vasectomized
             male partner should be the sole partner for that subject. Use of oral (estrogen and
             progesterone), injected or implanted hormonal methods of contraception or placement of
             an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS) or other forms of hormonal
             contraception that have comparable efficacy (failure rate &lt;1%), for example hormone
             vaginal ring or transdermal hormone contraception. In case of use of oral
             contraception, women should be stable on the same pill for a minimum of 3 months prior
             to first dose.
