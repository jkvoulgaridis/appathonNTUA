    <textblock>
      The participants will visit the laboratory on 3 occasions, once for a preliminary visit and a
      further two occasions to complete experimental trials in a randomised order. The experimental
      trials will consist of cycling under two conditions; HIIE-First followed by Continuous
      (Trial-A) or Continuous-First followed by HIIE (Trial-B). Participants will be asked to
      standardise their diet for 24-hours and complete an overnight fast prior to visiting the
      laboratory. Participants will then complete 60-min of cycling split throughout the day into
      two 30-min bouts, HIIE or continuous cycling before breakfast followed by a 3.5 hour rest
      period before completing their remaining 30-min HIIE or Continuous cycling before lunch. Each
      experimental trail will last approximately 8 hours and begin at 08:00am. Throughout the trial
      measurements of subjective feelings of appetite, gastric emptying rate, substrate utilisation
      and regular blood samples will be taken. Post-trial nutritional and well-being questionnaires
      will be collected at 24-h post.

      Study hypothesis

        1. The order in which continuous and HIIE is undertaken will result in differences in
           gastric emptying rate after ingesting a semi-sold lunch?

        2. Depending on which mode of exercise is undertaken first will result in different
           gastrointestinal hormone responses, metabolic responses and appetite responses
           throughout the trial day?

        3. Will the order in which different modes of exercise, undertaken within the same day
           effect nutritional intake and well-being 24-h after both exercise bout have been
           completed?

        4. Is substrate oxidation effected by the order in which multiple exercise bout of
           different modes are undertaken within the same day.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is a growing amount of literature committed to understanding if becoming more active
      will have beneficial effects on metabolic health; secondly do the traditional physical
      exercise and dietary approaches to managing obesity result in prolonged weight loss. The
      purpose of this study is to determine whether high intensity intermittent exercise (HIIE) and
      continuous exercise carried out in differing sequences within a day will have a beneficial
      health impact.

      Participants will complete two 8h experimental trials in a randomised cross-over design. Each
      participant will complete 60-min of exercise in both trial arms; HIIE-First or
      Continuous-First separated by a minimum of 7 days. One trial will consist of a 30-min HIIE
      cycling session (10 x 1min of peak power output followed by 2min rest). After completion of
      this bout of exercise, participants will ingest a standardised breakfast. Following a rest
      period of 3h before completing the remaining 30-min of exercise (50% peak maximal oxygen
      uptake), before consuming a standardised semi-sold lunch meal. The second trial will be
      identical other than participates will undertake the continuous exercise first followed by
      the HIIE. Regular appetite, breath and blood samples will be taken throughout the trials. In
      The 24 hours following the end of each trial, participants will be asked to record their
      dietary intake and record their feeling of well-being documented on a questionnaire. There
      will be no long-term follow up following completion of the study.

      Therefore, the aim of this research project is to identify whether the order of HIIE and
      continuous exercise separated within the day results in changes to gastrointestinal health,
      appetite, and metabolic responses.
