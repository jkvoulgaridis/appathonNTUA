  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Observational, retrospective study in adults (≥18 years) with severe asthma (maintenance
      treatment with high dose inhaled corticosteroids combined with long-acting agonist β2) and
      eosinophilic phenotype, who at the discretion of the investigator were candidates to receive
      benralizumab in the individualized access program approved by national health authorities.

      Primary Objective: To describe the demographic and baseline characteristics in patients with
      severe eosinophilic asthma who participated in the individualized access program approved in
      Spain and received at least one dose of benralizumab.

      Secondary Objectives: To describe clinical outcomes in severe eosinophilic asthma patients
      who received at least three doses of benralizumab in the individualized access program.
