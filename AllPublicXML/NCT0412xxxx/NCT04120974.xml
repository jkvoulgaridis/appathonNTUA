  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, post-marketing, single-arm clinical investigation on the effects of
      optimal insulin injection technique, in conjunction with the use of disposable Becton
      Dickinson (BD) Micro-Fine Plus 32G pen needles, by Type I and Type II Diabetes Mellitus
      patients, with or without lipohypertrophy, on clinical outcomes like HbA1c and hypoglycemic
      events, as well as changes in insulin Total Daily Dose (TDD) and patient's Quality of Life
      (QoL). During this study, each subject will be trained in the optimal insulin injection
      technique by personal training as well as by following online video training modules on a
      specific web-based platform.
