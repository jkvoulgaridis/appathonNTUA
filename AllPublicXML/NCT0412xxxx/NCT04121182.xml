  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Infections in nursing home are associated with high morbidity and mortality. Pulmonary
      infections are known to be the most problematic. In our INCUR observational study of 773
      residents, 20.13% of residents had pneumonia during the year of follow-up. On average, the
      extra cost of pneumopathies was 4,467 euros / patient for the long-term care facility and
      3,044 euros for the hospital.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The pneumopathies in nursing home are the main cause of hospitalization of residents.
      Depending on the series, 9 to 50% of residents with pneumonia should be transferred. This
      reflects the difficulties faced by nursing home care teams in these situations. The
      respiratory symptomatology of nursing home residents is difficult to grasp and the prescribed
      antibiotic therapy is often considered inappropriate (25% to 75% of cases). Prevention of
      resident pneumonia, such as vaccination against pneumococcus remains poorly practiced,
      influenza vaccination teams or vitamin D supplementation.

      In addition to the risk of mortality, lung diseases are often the cause of a rapid functional
      decline. Preventing pneumonia in nursing homes is therefore an important issue in the
      prevention of dependence, the quality of life, the health care system (use of hospitalization
      and transfer to emergencies) and health expenditure. In this vulnerable population, a
      prevention intervention seems particularly relevant.

      In this research project, the investigators hypothesize that a multi-domain prevention
      intervention for pneumonia carried out by nursing teams in nursing homes can reduce the
      incidence of pneumonia. They also believe that this action would reduce emergency transfers
      and health expenditures.

At the end of the randomization, half of the institutions will benefit from an &quot;on-line&quot; training on the prevention and management of pulmonary disease in residents. Other institutions will continue their usual practice (routine care) and will not benefit from training during the study period.</intervention_model_description>
