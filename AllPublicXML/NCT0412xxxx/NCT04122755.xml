    <textblock>
      An open-label study designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of
      ALA-1000 in opioid-dependent subjects. To characterize the PK profile of ALA-1000 in 5 single
      ascending dose cohorts and a sixth cohort of single ALA-1000 after receiving buprenorphine
      sublingual films for 7 days.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will include opioid-dependent subjects who have been receiving stable, orally
      administered buprenorphine for at least 2 weeks or buprenorphine na√Øve subjects who will be
      stabilized on orally administered buprenorphine for 3 days prior to ALA-1000 administration.

      All subjects will be washed off of oral buprenorphine for 7 days prior to ALA-1000
      administration except Cohort 6 which will receive ALA-1000 administration after 7 days of
      buprenorphine sublingual film dosing.

      The subsequent cohorts will be initiated after safety and PK information from the preceding
      cohorts is available.

      The expected maximum duration of participation for each subject is 192 days approximately,
      consisting of up to a 7-day screening period, up to a 31-day residential phase, and up to a
      154-day nonresidential period.
