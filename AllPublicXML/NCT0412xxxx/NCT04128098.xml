  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Non-specific chronic low back pain is defined as pain that originates in the lumbar spine, is
      persistent, lasts more than 3 months, and is unrelated to an inflammatory, traumatic, tumour,
      malformation, or infectious cause. Chronic low back pain is one of the most frequent reasons
      for consulting a physician, and one of the most common sources of disability, particularly as
      a result of socio-professional withdrawl. It is a major consumer of health resources
      (diagnostic investigations, multiple treatments) and involves heavy expenses for the
      investigator's health insurance system. In view of this major public health issue, in
      November 2017, the Health Insurance and several specialized health organizations launched a
      &quot;general public&quot; campaign to raise awareness of low back pain. This campaign, entitled &quot;Back
      pain? The right treatment is movement&quot; was designed to encourage appropriate physical
      activity in patients with low back pain.

      Among the available therapies, multimodal programs are recommended as a first line treatment.
      In order to incorporate physical activity into patients' daily lives, these rehabilitation
      programs are based on a comprehensive multidisciplinary approach (therapeutic education,
      muscle strengthening, reconditioning, ergonomics, psychological, social, professional and
      nutritional management and cardiovascular risk factors). Although such programmes have
      already shown short term effectiveness, few data are available on their continued
      effectiveness in the medium term (1 year). This project aims to identify good and bad
      responders to a multimodal program in the medium term, based on common clinical parameters
      (Quebec City questionnaire score and spontaneous walking speed), and to identify the
      mechanisms underlying this response.

      In addition, in clinical practice, heterogeneity in maintaining the effectiveness of the
      program is observed but little documented. The limited data available show a heterogeneity of
      these programs and one of the objectives of this project will be to identify the existing
      barriers and levers available to improve this situation.
