  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to determine the mass balance and routes of excretion of total
      radioactivity after a single oral 30mg (100µCi) dose of [14C] HQP1351 given as a suspension.
      For further clinical development, human mass balance data are required to elucidate the
      absorption, metabolism, and excretion of HQP1351.
