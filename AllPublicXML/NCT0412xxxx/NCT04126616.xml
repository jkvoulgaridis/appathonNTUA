  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a highly prevalent pulmonary disease
      providing major morbidity and mortality. Bronchial obstruction is the cornerstone in
      assessment of the disease whereas associated pulmonary vascular disease remains poorly known.

      Improving knowledge on pulmonary vascular adaptive skills in COPD patients could allow for
      better understanding disease exacerbations, evolution towards chronic pulmonary hypertension
      (PH) and therapeutics to be offered to the patients.

      Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an innovative and non-invasive tool capable of pulmonary
      vascular evaluation. This work aims at identifying pulmonary vascular impairment in COPD
      patients using functional MRI.

      Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a highly prevalent pulmonary disease
      providing major morbidity and mortality. Bronchial obstruction is the cornerstone in
      assessment of the disease whereas associated pulmonary vascular disease remains poorly known.

      However, it has been shown that emphysema, frequently observed in COPD, contains major
      vascular lesions. Alteration of pulmonary vascularisation have been found during exacerbation
      of the disease.

      Moreover, it is well established that such vascular lesions form the substrate for
      endothelial dysfunction, expressed as an impairment of vascular adaptation during exercise,
      and evolving towards chronic pulmonary hypertension (PH). Owing to its severe effects on the
      right-sided heart, it signs a pejorative turn in patients' survival and quality of life.

      Finally, COPD patients' phenotypes are very heterogeneous and the clinical response to PH
      treatments is variable; while some get a benefit, others are counter-indicated due to adverse
      effects.

      Improving knowledge on pulmonary vascular adaptive skills in COPD patients could allow for
      better understanding disease exacerbations, evolution towards PH and therapeutics to be
      offered to the patients.

      This area of research remains widely unknown because of the lack of simple tools to assess
      pulmonary vascularisation which could be used in clinical routine. Magnetic resonance imaging
      (MRI) is an innovative and non-invasive tool capable of pulmonary vascular evaluation. This
      work aims at identifying pulmonary vascular impairment in COPD patients using functional MRI.
