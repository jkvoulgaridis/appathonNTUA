  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently, the effect of exercise on metastatic breast cancer has not been extensively
      studied, even though the benefits are evident in the curative setting. The investigators
      designed the EFFECT study to assess the effects of a 9-month structured and individualised
      exercise intervention in 350 patients with metastatic breast cancer (stage IV) on
      cancer-related physical fatigue, Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL), and other disease
      and treatment-related side effects at six months (primary endpoint).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The EFFECT study is a multicentre, randomised controlled trial. The intervention group will
      participate in a 9-month exercise intervention. The exercise program will start with a
      6-month period, where patients participate in a supervised multimodal exercise program twice
      a week supplemented with unsupervised exercises. The multimodal exercise program comprises
      aerobic-, resistance- and balance components. After completing the initial six-month period,
      one supervised session will be replaced by one unsupervised session until month nine.

      Unsupervised exercises will be supported by an activity tracker (FitBit) and an exercise App
      specifically designed for the EFFECT trial. Patients randomized to the control group will
      also receive an activity tracker (like the intervention group). The investigators will advice
      control patients to avoid inactivity and be as physically active as current abilities and
      conditions allow, with the aim to progress towards being physically active for 150min/week in
      line with the current exercise guidelines.
