  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will determine the effects of simultaneous exercise and cognitive training on
      cognitive function in healthy older adults. Specifically, this study will compare the use of
      a tablet-based cognitive training system while exercising with exercise alone, cognitive
      training alone, and a neutral control condition on cognition.
