  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The heterogeneity of depression suggests that different neurocircuits and pathophysiological
      mechanisms are involved. Anhedonia - the inability to experience pleasure from, or the lack
      of motivation to carry out, usually enjoyable activities - is an endophenotype within the
      depression spectrum, with a distinct pathophysiology of dopaminergic mesolimbic projections.
      Anhedonia is common in depression and associated with treatment resistance. Pramipexole, an
      agonist to the dopamine -receptor 3, is an established treatment of Parkinson's disease.
      Based on its mechanism of action, pramipexole might be efficacious in a subtype of depression
      characterized by anhedonia and lack of motivation - symptoms linked to dopaminergic
      hypofunction. In this proof-of-concept pilot study the investigators test the anti-anhedonic
      and antidepressant effects of add-on pramipexole using an &quot;enriched population study design&quot;
      including only depressed patients with significant anhedonia. To understand the neurobiology
      of anhedonia in depression and to identify treatment predictors, the investigators also do
      assessments of anhedonia-related neurocircuitry using (f)MRI and blood biomarkers.
