      This is an open label, multi-center, randomized control phase II trial, to compare the
      efficacy and safety of sintilimab combined with anlotinib versus standard platinum-based
      chemotherapy as a first-line treatment in advanced NSCLC patients without driven-gene

    <textblock>
      This is an open label, multi-center, randomized control study comparing the combination of
      sintilimab and anlotinib with standard platinum-based chemotherapy in treat-naïve advanced
      (unresectable stage IIIB, IIIC and IV patients without driven-gene mutations) NSCLC patients.
      Eligible subjects are 1:1 randomized into the experimental group (sintilimab combined with
      anlotinib) or the control group (standard platinum-based chemotherapy).
