    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical trial is to determine whether Probiotic can modulate the
      psychological stress experienced by healthy medical, dental and health science students
      preparing for university/institute of technology semester examination (s), measured by
      self-report scales and hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis activity, compared with placebo.

      The target group of the proposed study will consist of stress vulnerable / sensitive, healthy
      male and female adult participants currently enrolled in medical, dental or health science
      university course that are experiencing psychological stress induced by preparation for
      university/institute of technology semester examination (s).
