  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Metabolic acidosis is one of the important and life-threatening pathophysiological changes in
      DKA and its monitoring is essential. It is known that the level of carbon dioxide (CO2) in
      the blood is correlating with the degree of metabolic acidosis. The CO2 level can be measured
      via the exhaled air by nasal cannula capnography (EtCO2) which is currently utilized to
      monitor the patient ventilation in many situations. Our primary objective is to study the
      degree of correlation between continuous EtCO2 monitoring and the severity of metabolic
      acidosis in blood gas measurement in patients with diabetic keto-acidosis (DKA). Secondary
      objectives are: ability of EtCO2 in ruling in or out DKA; discriminating the different
      severity grades of DKA. It is a cross-sectional, observational, prospective cohort study in
      convenience sample of children presenting with clinical manifestations consistent with DKA.
      Will be conducted in pediatric Emergency Center, Hamad General Hospital. Will include all DKA
      patients and excluding any condition or medication that affect the acid-base status.

      The study will be conducted in pediatric emergency center, Hamad General Hospital, a
      recognized academic institution, in Doha, Qatar.

      The DKA was defined as: hyperglycemia (blood glucose &gt;11 mmol/L or 200 mg/dL), venous pH &lt;7.3
      and/ or bicarbonate &lt;15 mmol/L, and the association with, ketonemia, and ketonuria. The
      severity of DKA is categorized as mild (venous pH &lt;7.3 or bicarbonate &lt;15 mmol/L), moderate
      (venous pH &lt;7.2 or bicarbonate &lt; 10 mmol/L) and severe (venous pH &lt; 7.1 or bicarbonate &lt;5
      mmol/L).

      Eligible patients are all children with already known or newly diagnosed diabetics,
      regardless weather has been enrolled in previous encounter or not.

      The patients with the following criteria are excluded: older than 14 years of age, airway
      obstruction, chest infection, complex congenital heart disease, Congestive heart failure,
      central or peripheral neurological disorders, hyper/hypothermia, and sever pain.

      Physicians and nurses, and research assistance staff will be trained in the use of nasal
      capnography including the proper size, connection and wave forms shapes and its
      interpretation.
