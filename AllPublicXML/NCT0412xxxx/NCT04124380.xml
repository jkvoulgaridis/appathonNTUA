  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sexual assault can lead to devastating consequences including the development of chronic
      conditions including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and alcohol use disorders (AUD).
      Interventions delivered soon after exposure to assault can decrease the long-term negative
      consequences of sexual assault but existing interventions are limited in their ability to
      target concurrent PTSD symptoms and alcohol use and little is known about how to make best
      practice treatment decisions in the early period following sexual assault. A greater emphasis
      on transdiagnostic processes that are related to both PTSD and alcohol use, such as fear and
      reward systems, can elucidate mechanisms of recovery, lead to the development of more
      effective intervention approaches, and guide clinical decision making for patients recently
      exposed to sexual assault.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Following sexual assault, many individuals will develop chronic problems including
      posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and alcohol use disorders (AUD). Intervention provided
      soon after assault can decrease the risk of developing chronic psychopathology and associated
      negative consequences. Interventions that address common underlying mechanisms of PTSD and
      alcohol use, such as fear and reward systems, have strong potential utility as efficacious
      and accessible interventions for clinicians treating patients recently exposed to sexual
      assault. This proposal is designed to test fear and reward as crucial processes underlying
      recovery following sexual assault and elucidate the most efficacious treatment targets.
      Employing experimental tasks (safety-signal learning paradigm and probabilistic reward task)
      to capture baseline underlying vulnerabilities in fear and reward systems respectively will
      allow for exploration of how these processes impact recovery. A randomized clinical trial (N
      = 180) will be conducted to test efficacy of intervention approaches that target PTSD or
      alcohol use compared to supportive telehealth. In addition, a phased study design will allow
      for exploration of efficacy of primary and secondary intervention approaches to test the
      questions of 1) whether it is more efficacious to target PTSD or alcohol use first; and 2)
      whether it is necessary to target both PTSD and alcohol use to facilitate recovery or if one
      is sufficient. This proposal is significant in exploring transdiagnostic mechanisms
      implicated in recovery following sexual assault, fear and reward, and using a novel design to
      compare efficacy, ordering, and necessity of two distinct intervention approaches.

    <measure>Alcohol Use Interview</measure>
    <time_frame>Past month</time_frame>
    <description>Alcohol use will be measured using the Timeline Followback Interview (TLFB) to measure frequency and quantity of drinking behavior over the past month. The TLFB is a count of total drinks per day over the last month. Higher number of drinks on the TLFB represents higher alcohol use and worse outcomes.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Alcohol Use Self-Report</measure>
    <time_frame>Past month</time_frame>
    <description>Alcohol use will be measured using the Daily Drinking Questionnaire (DDQ) to assess for self report of typical weekly drinking (quantity, frequency). The DDQ asks for an estimated number of drinks consumed on each day in a typical week over the last month. Higher estimates for number of typical drinks each day on the DDQ represents higher alcohol use and worse outcomes.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Severity (PTSD) Interview</measure>
    <time_frame>Past two weeks</time_frame>
    <description>PTSD symptom severity will be measured using the Posttraumatic Stress Symptoms Scale- Interview Version for DSM-5 (PSS-I-5). The PSS-I-5 is a 20 item scale, with a minimum score of 0 and a maximum score of 80; higher values represent increased PTSD symptom severity and worse outcomes.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Severity (PTSD) Self-Report</measure>
    <time_frame>Past two weeks</time_frame>
    <description>PTSD symptom severity will be measured using the Posttraumatic Stress Symptoms Scale- Self-report Version for DSM-5 (PSS-SR-5). The PSS-SR-5 is a 20 item scale, with a minimum score of 0 and a maximum score of 80; higher values represent increased PTSD symptom severity and worse outcomes.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Psychosocial Functioning</measure>
    <time_frame>Past two weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The single-item Global Psychosocial Functioning (GPF) item will be used as an indicator of functioning. The GPF will be reworded so as to be disorder non-specific. It is rated on a scale from 0 - 100 with higher scores representing better outcomes.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of Life Functioning</measure>
    <time_frame>Past two weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The single-item Global Quality of Life (GQL) item will be used as an indicator of functioning. It is rated on a scale from 0 - 100 with higher scores representing better outcomes.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Alcohol Cravings</measure>
    <time_frame>Past week</time_frame>
    <description>The 5-item Penn Alcohol Craving Scale (PACS) will be given to assess current urges and cravings to drink alcohol. Items assess frequency, intensity, and duration of thoughts about drinking and participants rate their perceived ability to resist drinking. Total sum score on this measure ranges from 0 to 30. Higher scores represent more alcohol cravings and worse outcomes.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Alcohol Consequences</measure>
    <time_frame>Past week</time_frame>
    <description>The Short Inventory of Problems (SIP) will be given to assess alcohol related negative consequences. The SIP is a 15 item scale, with 3 items per subscale. This measure was adapted to use a time frame of the past week for responses. This measure has a minimum score of 0 and a maximum score of 15. Higher values represent increased alcohol-related problems and worse outcomes.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Depression Self-Report</measure>
    <time_frame>Past week</time_frame>
    <description>Depression will be measured with the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptoms (QIDS-SR16) self report version. The QIDS-SR16 is a 16 item scale, with a minimum score of 0 and a maximum score of 48; higher values represent increased depression and worse outcomes.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Depression Interview</measure>
    <time_frame>Past week</time_frame>
    <description>Depression will be measured with the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptoms (QIDS-C16) interview version. The QIDS-C16 is a 16 item scale, with a minimum score of 0 and a maximum score of 27; higher values represent increased depression and worse outcomes.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Reward</measure>
    <time_frame>Past week</time_frame>
    <description>Reward functioning will be measured with the Snaith-Hamilton Pleasure Scale (SHAPS), self-report. The SHAPS is a 14 item scale, with a minimum score of 0 and a maximum score of 14; higher values represent increased anhedonia and worse outcomes.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Fear</measure>
    <time_frame>Past week</time_frame>
    <description>Fear will be measured with the Posttrauma Avoidance Behavior Questionnaire (PABQ), self-report. The PABQ is a 25 item scale, with a minimum score of 25 and a maximum score of 100; higher values represent increased fear and worse outcomes.</description>
