  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Platelet-rich fibrin matrix (PRFM) is made from platelets that are extracted from a patient's
      blood, and many plastic surgeons and dermatologists have used it to fill in wrinkles and
      lines on the face. Both patients and doctors have observed that it gives extra volume in
      these areas and improves overall appearance. However, there is no research that shows how
      PRFM affects skin quality, such as pores, spots, red areas, and texture. The aim of this
      study is to determine whether PRFM has a role in rejuvenating facial skin.

    <time_frame>Evaluation distributed at initial visit, at 6 weeks, and at 12 weeks following treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>Patient-reported outcome measure validated for skin resurfacing techniques. Each item is rated on a 0-4 scale. The final score is computed by dividing the total score for the instrument by 24 and multiplying by 100, giving a range of 0-100. The difference in the change in SROE score for each cohort was calculated.</description>

    <description>Evaluation targeted specifically at identifying changes in the skin parameters analyzed by VISIA. Each item is rated on a 0-4 scale. The final score is computed by dividing the total score for the instrument by 24 and multiplying by 100, giving a range of 0-100. The difference in the change in VISIA outcomes score for each cohort was calculated.</description>
