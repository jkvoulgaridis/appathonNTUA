  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates a novel shared decision making tool for multiple sclerosis (MS). Half
      the patients will be given access to MS-SUPPORT before their scheduled appointment with their
      healthcare provider, the other half will not be given access.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      MS-SUPPORT is a novel shared-decision making tool. More specifically, it is a web-based
      decision aid (DA) that includes 'values clarification exercises' to support people with MS
      (PwMS) incorporate their preferences and values when faced with a DMT treatment decision.
      Each 'values clarification exercise' includes a written passage about a specific topic, with
      a series of questions. It covers topical domains related to living with MS and treatment
      decision making, including but not limited to lifestyle, tolerability, safety, risk
      tolerance, health goals, and personal values.

      This validation study will evaluate the effect of using MS-SUPPORT on starting or switching
      DMTs, patient-provider communication, DMT adherence, Quality of Life (QoL), decision quality
      (the concordance of the treatment chosen, which includes no treatment, with the patient's
      values), quality of care, and decisional conflict. Participants will include adult patients
      with relapsing forms of MS and their MS healthcare providers (HCP). Patients will be
      randomized into one of two groups: MS-SUPPORT (intervention) or Usual Care (control).

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient-provider communication</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured once, up to 2 months after the index HCP visit.</time_frame>
    <description>We will use COMRADE, a validated patient self-report scale that measures communication, decision-making effectiveness, satisfaction with healthcare provider communication, and confidence in the decision made.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Adherence to DMT</measure>
    <time_frame>Quarterly, up to 12 month follow-up after the index HCP visit.</time_frame>
    <description>We will measure self-reported adherence to DMTs by asking patients to report the number of doses they took in the past month (or relevant dosing interval for that DMT if dosing is less frequent than one month) and divide that by the number of expected doses during that dosing interval. This value ranges from 0.0 to 1.0, with 1.0 indicating perfect adherence.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Decision Quality</measure>
    <time_frame>Quarterly, up to 12 month follow-up after the index HCP visit.</time_frame>
    <description>We will assess the extent to which the treatment chosen is consistent with the patient values by asking a question such as &quot;My treatment plan is helping me achieve my treatment goals&quot; and &quot;My treatment plan reflects what's important to me when I think about the pros and cons of treatment.&quot;</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of Life--Healthy Days Core Module</measure>
    <time_frame>Quarterly, up to 12 month follow-up after the index HCP visit.</time_frame>
    <description>We will use the 4-item Healthy Days Core Module from the Health-Related Quality of Life (HR-QOL-14). This module assesses self-rated general health, including the number of days that the person is limited in their usual mental and physical activities. This measure was originally drawn from the State-based Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) which has been used since 1993.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>CAHPS Quality of Care</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured once, up to 2 months after the index HCP visit.</time_frame>
    <description>The 4-item communication items from the Patient Experience Measures from the Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS) Health Plan Survey coupled with a global assessment of their HCP and a single item from the CAHPS® Clinician &amp; Group Surveys, Patient-Centered Medical Home (PCMH4: Someone from provider's office talked with patient about specific health goals) will be assessed.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Decision Conflict</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured twice. First measurement, up to 1 month after starting the study. Second measurement, up to 2 months after the index HCP visit.</time_frame>
    <description>A 4-item validated short-form of the original decisional conflict scale (SURE) will be used. These 4 items ask yes/no questions; the scoring algorithm combines the total score (maximum 4, minimum 0). Any score under 4 is considered a positive for decisional conflict.</description>
