      This study will evaluate the individual and interactive pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic
      effects of smoked cannabis and nicotine.

      The proposed study will be conducted at the Johns Hopkins Behavioral Pharmacology Research
      Unit (BPRU). All participants will be healthy adult volunteers who are regular
      nicotine/tobacco users, and have prior experience with cannabis use. Participants will
      complete seven outpatient experimental test sessions (completed in a randomized order), under
      double-blind conditions in which participants will first self-administer smoked cannabis
      (either active or placebo), followed by nicotine (via a tobacco cigarette or an e-cigarette);
      there will also be one condition in which participants smoke active cannabis alone (without
      subsequent nicotine use). Nicotine self-administration will occur in an ad libitum fashion
      for 5 hours. Nicotine products will be the individual participant's preferred brand of
      cigarettes or the commercial pod-style e-cigarette the JUUL (pods will contain either 3% or
      5% nicotine pods). Active cannabis will contain 10 mg tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) while
      placebo will contain 0 mg THC. During the ad libitum nicotine/tobacco-use period, various
      puffing behaviors (e.g., puff volume, puff duration, puff number, inter-puff-interval) will
      be measured using specialized equipment. Acute subjective effects of cannabis/nicotine,
      cannabis/nicotine withdrawal symptoms, craving, vital signs, and cognitive/psychomotor
      performance will also be assessed throughout the experimental sessions.
