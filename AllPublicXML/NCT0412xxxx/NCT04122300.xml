  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Congenital nasolacrimal duct obstruction (CNLDO) occurs in approximately 10 to 20% of all
      term newborns, and is the most common cause of persistent tearing and ocular discharge in
      children. CNLDO causes symptoms in up to 6% of children during the first year of life. The
      first clinical signs appear during the first month of life in 95% of cases and usually
      consist of tearing and debris on the eyelashes (&quot;mattering&quot;). Mucopurulent eye discharge
      occurs commonly in infants with CNLDO and, in the absence of other signs of infection,
      suggests bacterial overgrowth in the stagnant tear pool of the lacrimal sac.

      This study investigates whether early administration of Euphrasia eye drops (Weleda AG,
      Arlesheim) in preterm neonates presenting with first ocular discharge with or without tearing
      and reddened eye fosters the resolution of the ocular discharge and reduces the need for
      topical antibiotic therapy.

    <description>At inclusion, before the start of the therapy, a bacterial/viral and chlamydial conjunctival swab is conducted. Afterwards, both eyes of neonates are washed four times a day (i.e., every six hours) with NaCl 0.9%. Subsequently, a drop of Euphrasia is placed into the lower conjunctival sac of each eye, and followed by a lacrimal sac digital massage. If no ocular discharge is apparent for over 24 hours, the therapy is stopped. In case of worsening of symptoms or a positive swab without any improvement of symptoms an antibiotic therapy is initiated: tobramycin (Tobrex 0.3% eye drops, Novartis Pharma Switzerland). An additional swab is performed at 96 hours (i.e. at the end of the study).</description>
