      This is a research study that aims to examine whether Veterans with mild Traumatic Brain
      Injuries are at risk for dementia by studying their memory, brain wave activity, brain
      structure and proteins that can be elevated after brain injury and in dementia.

      The specific aim of this project is to examine whether Veterans with mild Traumatic Brain
      Injuries are at risk for dementia by studying their memory, brain wave activity, brain
      structure and proteins that can be elevated after brain injury and in dementia.

      This study will recruit patients with a history of mild-moderate traumatic brain injury, mild
      cognitive impairment, as well as healthy controls in order to better understand how single or
      repetitive mild Traumatic brain injuries may contribute to the development of dementia. It
      will be prospective in nature. Participants will be asked to complete a series of 3 study
      sessions. During the first study session, each subject will be asked to complete a
      neuropsychological assessment. If the subject's testing scores fall under the study criteria,
      they will also be asked to complete a computer task. In the second study session, the
      investigators will measure the subjects brain waves using an EEG while they complete a
      computer task. During the computer task, subjects will be asked to study a list of words and
      the investigators will test the subjects on their memory for those words. During the final
      study session, the investigators will ask subjects to complete (1) an MRI scan, (2) a
      standard blood draw procedure, and (3) a lumbar puncture procedure.

      Clinical Implications: These studies will provide a better understanding of which individuals
      with Traumatic Brain Injury will develop dementia, and how many years in the future dementia
      may occur.

    <description>MCI control subjects, age-, education- and sex-matched with older mTBI subjects (aged 60-90) will be recruited if they meet diagnostic criteria for MCI (without a history of TBI) based on the judgement of a behavioral neurologist following the 2011 MCI criteria. Specifically, subjects will test in the impaired range on one or more cognitive domains on neuropsychological testing and will not have impairments in function (i.e. will not meet diagnostic criteria for dementia). MCI subjects will be matched for their Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score with older mTBI subjects. Of note, subjects with MCI may or may not meet diagnostic criteria for MCI due to AD. The intent of this control group is to recruit a broad range of MCI subjects without TBI as controls for subjects with cognitive impairment who have a history of mTBI.</description>
