    <textblock>
      This study explores the use of a new form of neuromodulation known as transcutaneous
      auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS) which stimulates the ear. This stimulation will be
      delivered concurrently with upper limb motor rehabilitation training (3 days/week for 4
      weeks) in chronic stroke patients. Patients will undergo a series of baseline assessments
      (including a brain scan), a 4-week course of motor rehabilitation, and post-assessments
      (including a second brain scan)

      This study aims to refine and develop closed loop taVNS, establish activity with key
      biomarkers, and show initial feasibility in a small clinical trial. For paired taVNS to
      succeed as a clinical treatment, it is critical to develop and refine a closed-loop taVNS
      platform that delivers stimulation concurrently during specific movements of the motor
      rehabilitation training.

      Aim 1 develops this novel motion-gated closed-loop system that delivers taVNS in synchrony
      with specific upper limb motor activation (n=5) Aim 2 will combine the development of the
      closed-loop system with the investigator's mechanistic understanding to explore an open-label
      pilot trial (n=20) using closed-loop taVNS paired with task-specific training to determine
      the feasibility, safety, and potential effect size of this novel combination therapy.

    <description>The Fugl-Meyer Assessment of the Upper Extremity (FMA-UE) is a stroke rehabilitation assessment of arm/hand movement impairment. It is scored by assigning 30 items assessing voluntary arm/hand movements and 3 items assessing reflexes an ordinal rating (0=unable, 1=partial, 2=near normal), then summing the ratings to obtain a general statement of ability. Possible aggregate scores range from 0/66 to 66/66 points. Higher scores indicate greater levels of arm movement ability.</description>
