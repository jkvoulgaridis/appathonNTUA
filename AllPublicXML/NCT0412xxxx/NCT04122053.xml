  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Personalized nutrition is one of the most up to date trends in human nutrition and gains much
      interest of general public and scientists as well. Although we have gained some knowledge on
      gene-trait associations, the real effectiveness and usefulness of genotype-based nutritional
      recommendations is unknown. Many personalized nutrition companies are on the market today,
      some of them use personalized nutrition based on genotype analysis. For this reason,
      scientific basis of this approach should be clarified. Moreover, the effect of using genotype
      information in dietary interventions aimed at decreasing caffeine intake has never been
      tested. Our project can thus increase knowledge which can be applied in dietary counseling
      practice. Although we focus on caffeine intake, the study is designed as a proof of concept.

      Considering current knowledge and recognizing the existing gaps we hypothesize that providing
      genotype information may increase adherence to dietary recommendations.

      The main aim of the project is thus testing the effectiveness of a genotype-based
      personalized dietary intervention targeted at decreasing caffeine intake.

      Specific aims of the study include:

        -  Implementation of the application for mobile devices which will be designed to assess
           caffeine intake.

        -  Testing whether providing information on CYP1A2 polymorphism affects effectiveness of
           the dietary intervention aimed at decreasing caffeine intake.

        -  Testing whether changes in dietary behavior can persist over time To accomplish the
           study goals a group of healthy adults will be enrolled. Participants will complete an
           informed consent procedure. As we aim at decreasing caffeine intake, we plan to first
           screen for people drinking at least 2 cups of coffee or with total caffeine intake over
           200 mg/day. Then genotype screening will be performed and eligible volunteers will be
           randomly assigned to one of the study groups which receive either dietary advice or
           dietary advice and genotype information.
