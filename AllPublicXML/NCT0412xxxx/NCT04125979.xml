  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Through prospective, randomized and controlled clinical study, patients with early lung
      cancer who do not need lymph node dissection according to routine diagnosis and treatment
      were selected. The feasibility and safety of preserving vagal pulmonary branch intact during
      minimally invasive surgery were compared with traditional minimally invasive surgery, and the
      feasibility and safety of preserving vagal pulmonary branch intact during minimally invasive
      surgery were clarified. The effect of preserving pulmonary branches of vagus nerve in
      minimally invasive surgery of early lung cancer on preventing or reducing pulmonary
      complications after operation was evaluated by main observation indexes (incidence of
      pulmonary complications) and secondary evaluation indexes. It will provide a safer, simpler
      and more effective new technology for patients with early lung cancer undergoing minimally
      invasive surgery, and provide a basis for the popularization of this new technology.

      According to the suggestion of statistical experts and the minimum sample size, 120 IA1-2
      patients who are going to undergo thoracoscopic lung surgery were selected according to the
      criteria of admission and exclusion. The risk and benefit were informed and the informed
      consent of the subjects was signed. The patients were numbered and randomly divided into two
      groups: group A with vagus nerve preservation during minimally invasive surgery and group B
      with traditional minimally invasive surgery for early lung cancer. The incidence of pulmonary
      complications within 5 weeks after operation (see the evaluation criteria for details),
      operation time, intraoperative bleeding volume, postoperative drainage volume, postoperative
      mortality, incidence of cardiovascular complications, rate of re-tracheal intubation, rate of
      re-admission to ICU, duration of stay in ICU, hospitalization costs were observed.
      Statistical analysis and evaluation of the safety of preserving pulmonary branches of vagus
      nerve in minimally invasive surgery and the effectiveness of preventing or reducing pulmonary
      complications after minimally invasive surgery.

             system;
