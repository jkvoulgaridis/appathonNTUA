  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is the first study of AMT-130 in patients with early manifest HD and is designed to
      establish safety and proof-of-concept (PoC). CT-AMT-130-01 is a Phase I/II, randomized,
      multicenter, dose escalation, double-blind, imitation surgery, first-in-human (FIH) study.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      AMT-130 is an investigational, single administration gene therapy intended to modify the
      disease course for HD. Preclinical studies have shown that AMT-130 lowers huntingtin protein
      and improved Huntington disease signs in animal models.

      This 5-year trial consists of a blinded 18-month Core Study Period to evaluate the safety and
      potential impact of AMT-130 on disease progression and an unblinded 3.5-year Long-Term Period
      with annual follow-up visits to evaluate the safety of AMT-130 and disease progression.
