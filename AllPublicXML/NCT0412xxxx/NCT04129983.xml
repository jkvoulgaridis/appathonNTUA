    <textblock>
      To study the effective treatment of sudden deafness by giving prednisone, hyperbaric oxygen
      and somatosensory stimulation to sudden deafness patients.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      60 cases of sudden deafness within 2 months of 14-80 years old were randomly divided into two
      groups. They underwent hearing tests, magnetic resonance imaging of the head, and routine
      hospital admissions. One group was given prednisone for 1 mg / kg body weight × 7 days +
      somatosensory stimulation × 30 days, the other group was given prednisone for 1 mg / kg body
      weight × 7 days + hyperbaric oxygen × 15 days, and repeated electrical audiometry every week.
      One month and three months after the experiment, repeated audiometry.

    <description>60 cases of sudden deafness were inquired about their medical history and examined by hearing and cranial magnetic resonance. They were randomly divided into two groups and given different treatments. The hearing test was repeated every 7 days. One month and three months after the treatment, the hearing examination was reexamined.</description>
