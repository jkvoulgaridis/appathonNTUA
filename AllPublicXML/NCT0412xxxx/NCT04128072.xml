  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cutaneous T-Cell Lymphoma (CTCL) has a chronic, relapsing course with patients undergoing
      multiple, consecutive therapies. Treatment aims at the clearance of skin disease,
      minimization of recurrence, prevention of disease progression and preservation of quality of
      life.

      The treatment of CTCL is primarily determined by the disease extent. Prolonged complete
      remissions have been obtained with skin-directed therapies in early stage Mycosis fungoides
      (MF) (IA-IIA), whereas advanced stages CTCL (IIB-IVB) are often refractory to treatment and,
      thus, have an unfavorable prognosis.

      Currently, there is no standard treatment option for CTCL, especially for advanced stages,
      and the optimal treatment sequence is still debated with a large variability in the
      therapeutic approach across countries. Patients with advanced-stage disease or refractory
      cutaneous CTCL should be treated with systemic therapies and, whenever possible, should be
      offered to participate in clinical trials. Currently, there is a urgent call for new
      treatments in CTCL with higher response rate and prolonged time to progression;

      In this study, we propose a very innovative treatment schedule in which mogamulizumab is used
      before Total Skin Electron Beam therapy (TSEB) for systemic disease control and as a
      maintenance treatment after skin-directed therapy. We hypothesize that our regimen will show
      a more manageable toxicity profile than a combination treatment and allow for a long-term
      mogamulizumab administration.
