  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aim: To investigate the effectiveness of a novel elastic taping-augmented functional movement
      power training (KT-FMPT) program in improving leg muscular performance, body balance, motor
      proficiency and functional independence in children with developmental coordination disorder
      (DCD).

      Methodology: In this clinical trial, twenty children with DCD (aged 6-12) will be randomly
      assigned to either a KT-FMPT group or a placebo control group. Children in the KT-FMPT and
      control groups will receive elastic taping-augmented FMPT and general jogging exercise with
      non-elastic taping, respectively, for 12 weeks (2 hours/week). Major outcome measures: body
      balance and leg muscle activity will be measured via muscle sensors along with a force
      platform. Secondary outcome measures: leg muscle strength, motor proficiency and functional
      independence will be assessed by a digital dynamometer, the Movement Assessment Battery for
      Children-2 and Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory, respectively (before- and
      after-intervention measurements).

      Significance: The KT-FMPT group is predicted to display much better muscular and motor
      performances than the control group. This novel training program can be readily adopted in
      clinical, school, or home settings to improve functional independence in children with DCD,
      an outcome with positive socioeconomic implications. Moreover, study findings will inspire
      future research work in children with other childhood-onset disabilities.

    <description>Subjects assigned to the Kinesio Taping - Functional Movement Power Training (KT-FMPT) group will receive FMPT concurrent with KT. The FMPT protocol was developed by the research team with reference to common physiotherapeutic exercises for children with motor disabilities.9 It comprises 5 functional movement exercises and 6 lower-limb power/resistance training exercises using weights or resistance bands.</description>
