      This observational applied research international study aims to assess the validity of
      breathing maneuvers as a vasoactive maneuver and Oxygenation-Sensitive Cardiac Magnetic
      Resonance Imaging (OS-CMR) in a patient population. OS-CMR results will be compared to the
      clinical gold standard of Fractional Flow Reserve (FFR) and instant wave-free ratio (iFR) as
      a secondary objective, to determine if this non-invasive, no pharmaceutical agent imaging
      technique can identify areas of oxygenation deficit in myocardium perfused by a stenosed
      coronary artery.

        Study population will be composed of patients with suspected or known CAD and healthy
        volunteers. The primary group will consist of patients with 1- or 2-vessel CAD. Patients
        diagnosed with 3-vessel or no obstructive disease in an angiography visit after the CMR
        exam will be included as a sub-group, with not more than 25% of the study population being
        in this group. Healthy volunteers will serve to act as a control for the assessment of a
        diagnostic cut-off.

        Patient who performed the CMR and then the angiography, who are deemed to have no
        obstructive (no vessel) CAD or 3-vessel CAD, will be assigned to a subgroup of the study.
        No vessel disease will be those who have no vessel stenosis of &gt;0.75. 3-vessel disease will
        be those who have a stenosis of &gt;0.75 in all three coronary arteries.
