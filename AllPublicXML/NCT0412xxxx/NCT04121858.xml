    <textblock>
      This study is an RCT to evaluate the effectiveness of Brain Safe on reducing anticholinergic
      exposure. Over 42 months, the trial will enroll 700 community-dwelling older adults who were
      prescribed one or more strong anticholinergics. Participants will be randomized to use the
      Brain Safe app or an attention control medication list app for 12 months, with monthly usage
      reminders.

    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized clinical trial (RCT) of the efficacy of a direct-to-consumer
      intervention called Brain Safe to primarily reduce older adults' exposure to prescription
      anticholinergics and secondarily improve cognitive function and health-related quality of
      life. Over 42 months, the trial will enroll 700 community-dwelling older adults who were
      prescribed one or more strong anticholinergics. Participants will be randomized to use the
      Brain Safe app or an attention control medication list app for 12 months, with monthly usage
      reminders.

      The primary objective is to test the effect of Brain Safe on anticholinergic exposure at 12
      months. We hypothesize that anticholinergic exposure will be lower among those randomized to
      the Brain Safe intervention compared to those randomized to the attention control app at 12
      months. Our primary, powered outcome is the total standard daily dose (TSDD) measure of
      anticholinergic exposure at 12 months, which is calculated over the preceding 6 months of
      prescription data. We will electronically capture prescription data monthly and compute TSDD
      at baseline, 6, and 12 months.

      The secondary objective is to test the effect of Brain Safe on: (a) cognitive function and
      (b) health-related quality of life at 12 months. We hypothesize older adults randomized to
      Brain Safe will have higher (a) cognitive function, measured by using an objective,
      performance-based composite, and (b) health-related quality of life (HRQOL), compared to
      those randomized to the attention control app, at 12 months.

      Exploratory objectives are to test the effect of Brain Safe on anticholinergic exposure,
      cognitive function, and HRQOL at 6 months. This aim will explore the presence of early
      effects of Brain Safe at 6 months.
