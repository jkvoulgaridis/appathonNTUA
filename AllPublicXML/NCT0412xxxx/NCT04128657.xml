  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the past decade, colorectal cancer management improved considerably with total mesorectal
      excision as well as the multidisciplinary management relying on neoadjuvant
      radiochemotherapy. This forward leap is currently responsible for an increase in the
      survivorship of colorectal cancer patients to more than 50% at 5 years. Additively the
      surgical approach is now more inclined towards sphincter preserving procedures, which allows
      the conservation of body image but can have negative bowel function repercussions consisting
      of urgency and incontinence ; all these terms encompassed in the low anterior resection
      syndrome.

      In the light of these findings many studies developed assessment tools in order to
      objectively measure this functional alteration among which are the low anterior resection
      syndrome questionnaire (LARS) and the WEXNER score. These tools designed to assess bowel
      function after sphincter-preserving surgery are now translated and validated into various
      languages and used in different countries.

      The LARS score relies on the frequency of the symptoms and allows the categorization of
      patients into 3 groups: no LARS (0-20 points), minor LARS (21-29 points), and major LARS
      (30-42 points). It assesses the frequency of emptying, incontinence ( liquid, gas ), and
      other symptoms such as urgency and incomplete voiding. On the other hand, the WEXNER score
      relies on the examination of the frequency of three types of fecal incontinence (solid,
      liquid, and gas) and their consequences (pad wearing and lifestyle alteration) with frequency
      options ranging from never (score 0) through to always (meaning at least once per day; score
      4). The score ranges from 0 (perfect continence) to 20 (complete incontinence).

      The aim of our study is to adapt and validate the LARS and WEXNER score to the moroccan
      arabic dialect.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The translation of the LARS and WEXNER score to the moroccan dialect ( arabic ) has been done
      in another study using translation and back translation in concordance with the international
      guidelines. The questionnaire is administered to a total of 102 patients either directly or
      via telephone. Reproducibility will be tested through test and retest as one sub-group will
      be administered the questionnaire twice with an interval of 1 to 2 weeks. Patients will also
      be administered the questionnaires of the European Organization for Research and treatment of
      Cancer (EORTC) : QLQ-C30.

      The validity of the LARS and WEXNER score will be tested by using the indicators of
      discriminant validity and convergent validity which will be determined in this study by
      computing the correlations between the LARS and WEXNER scores to the EORTC QLQ-C30.

      For discriminant validity testing, variables used will be factors known to affect bowel
      function after colorectal surgery such as gender, age, neoadjuvant therapy, distance of the
      tumor from the anal verge, prior temporary stoma, length of postoperative period, the need
      for a reintervention and the occurrence of complications.

      We recruited for our study patients treated in the National Oncology Institute of Rabat and
      in the Al azhar oncology center in the surgical department of Pr. Souadka Abdelilah with a
      minimum post operative interval of 6 months.

      The validation of a moroccan dialectical version of the LARS score and WEXNER score will
      allow a better understanding of the bowel function post surgery and thereby the
      identification of patients with the highest scores which will allow a better understanding
      and possible inclusion of these tools in patient outcome assessment.
