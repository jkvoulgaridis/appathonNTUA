  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To observe the effectiveness of SHR-1210 (Camrelizumab) combined with apatinib in the
      treatment of unresectable sarcoma patients with chemotherapy failure. The main observations
      were progression-free survival (PFS) and progression-free control rate (PFR), followed by
      objective response rate (ORR) (CR+PR), disease control rate (DCR) (CR+PR+SD), and overall
      survival (OS).
