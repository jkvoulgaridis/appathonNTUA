  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Digestive Functional Disorders (DFD), represent 50% of medical check ups, the symptoms
      interfere with patients quality of life and generate high health costs. On the other hand,
      with the worldwide overweight and obesity increase,causing an over production of low-calorie
      products, which increase the non-caloric sweeteners (NCS) consumption.

      Hypothesis: A diet without NCS will reduce gastrointestinal symptoms in volunteers with
      dyspepsia and IBS.

      Objective: To asses the effect of a diet without NCS, on the gastrointestinal symptoms in
      patients with dyspepsia and IBS.

      Secondary Objectives: To compare the effect of a diet without NCS against a diet with NCS on
      anthropometry, changes in body composition, biochemical parameters, glucose and insulin. To
      asses the change in the gut microbiota using real-time PCR (polymerase chain reaction)

      Methodology: it will be an experimental, open, parallel, controlled study lasting 12 weeks,
      patients with dyspepsia or IBS will be randomized assigned to a diet with or without NCS.

      Laboratory studies, dietary and symptoms questionnaires, anthropometry measurements and
      faecal sample will be carried out.

      Analysis Results: A double data capture will be carried out to minimize errors, for the
      statistical analysis of using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version
      25, descriptive statistics will be used to report the baseline data of the volunteers. Using
      means and standard deviation, the variables of gastrointestinal symptoms will be used a
      chi-square test and a p &lt;0.05 will be considered significant. Different analyzes will be done
      to evaluate volunteers with IBS and those with dyspepsia. For the intestinal microbiota
      analysis, a comparison will be made between the percentages of Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes and
      Actinobacteria of sample 1 and 2 and a chi-square test will be performed considering a p
      &lt;0.05 significant

      Recruitment will be carried out in the gastroenterology service, where patients will have
      their diagnosis of IBS or dyspepsia, participants are invited to participate in the study to
      subsequently sign the informed consent.

      Once signed the patient is scheduled for blood studies, their nutritional evaluation will be
      carried out and their menu will be delivered.

      Patients will be followed for 12 weeks to re-conduct their nutritional evaluation and
      laboratory studies.
