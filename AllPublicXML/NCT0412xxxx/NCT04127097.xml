      effect of the watching cartoons on the fear and anxiety levels of children during treatment.

      Method: The population of the study consisted of children aged 5-10 years who were brought to
      a state hospital in a southeastern province for blood collection. A total of 92 children, 43
      of whom were in the cartoon group and 49 of which were in the control group, were included in
      the study. Research findings; Data Form was obtained by using Child Anxiety Scale and Child
      Fear Scale. The children in the cartoon group were shown the cartoons they wanted during the
      treatment. Anxiety and fear levels before and during the blood collection were evaluated in
      the cartoon and control groups. The anxiety level of the children was evaluated according to
      their own expressions, and the level of fear was evaluated independently according to both
      the children's own statements and the observers' statements.
