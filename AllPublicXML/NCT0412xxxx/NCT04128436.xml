  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Progesterone (P4) is essential for the secretory development of endometrium and the
      maintenance of early pregnancy. In the luteal phase following controlled ovarian stimulation
      in in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatment, P4 profile is completely different from natural
      cycles (Fauser, 2002).

      Since the optimal luteal P4 levels are not well known, in normal IVF treatment a standard
      regime of exogenous P4 is given without considering the ovarian response for stimulation and
      the steroid levels in luteal phase. In 2005 Humaidan et al, showed that following the fresh
      embryo transfer, low luteal P4 levels (39 nmol/l) has a negative impact on ongoing pregnancy
      rates (Humaidan, 2005). In the following randomized controlled trials (RCTs), the use of
      exogenous human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) after gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH)
      agonist trigger as a luteal phase support (Humaidan, 2010, 2013), the mid luteal P4 levels
      increased to 77-409 nmol/l and birth rates per transfer raised to %24.

      In the light of these, it is essential that the progesterone levels in luteal phase is above
      the certain threshold for induction of the normal secretory development of endometrium
      following the IVF treatment and for the maintenance of pregnancy.

      The implantation window is defined as that period when the uterus is receptive for
      implantation of the free-lying blastocyst. For maximal effectiveness of assisted reproductive
      technologies in women, it is important to know the optimal time for embryo transfer which
      implies a need to predict the period of uterine receptivity. Blood progesterone levels can be
      an indirect indication for implantation window and the embryo transfer timing.

      The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of early and mid luteal progesterone
      levels on ongoing pregnancy rates and to determine the optimal luteal P4 levels in IVF cycles
      following the fresh blastocyst transfer in order to improve the reproductive outcomes.

    <textblock>
      During Covid-19 pandemic we decided to make an interim analysis in March 2020.
    </textblock>
  </detailed_description>
  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    With the interim analysis, a marked decrease in ongoing pregnancy rate was noted in patients
    with a drop in serum progesterone level from OPU+3 day to OPU+5 day

    <description>As part of standard in vitro fertilization treatment, Crinone gel will be used starting the next morning following the oocyte pick-up (OPU) as a luteal phase support. On the trigger day, on the day OPU+2/3 (early luteal phase) and on the embryo transfer day (OPU+5, mid luteal phase) blood samples will be taken from patients for evaluating the progesterone levels. Blood samples will be collected at the 6th hour following the morning dose of vaginal progesterone gel. No other intervention will be done to the patients.</description>
