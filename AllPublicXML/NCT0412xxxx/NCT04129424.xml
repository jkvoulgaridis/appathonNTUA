  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII), known as insulin pump therapy, has been
      widely used for diabetes patients in recent years. Many clinical studies have proved the
      priority of CSII to multiple insulin injections including better glycaemic control with lower
      daily insulin requirement, lower glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) level and reduced risk of
      severe hypoglycaemia. The best mode of CSII is a kind of programmed and individualized
      insulin infusion mode. But at present, the applying of insulin pump is mainly during
      hospitalization period in China, which is not conformed with daily living scenarios of
      patients. The outpatient insulin pump treatment is much closer to the real living scenarios
      of patients. However, lack of management experience and widely accepted formative model of
      insulin pump applying in clinic restricted use of insulin pumps in clinical in China. The
      investigators aimed to explore a safe and effective management mode of insulin pump operating
      to enable a wide population to have access to daily use of CSII, and to maximize the rational
      use of limited medical resources.

      In this study, the investigators plan to enroll patients of different types of diabetes,
      including type 1 diabetes mellitus, type 2 diabetes mellitus, gestational diabetes mellitus,
      perioperative diabetes mellitus, pancreatogenic diabetes mellitus (after total
      pancreatectomy) and diabetes patients in perioperative periodï¼Œeach type of diabetes patients
      were divided into three groups according to the time (7days, 14days and 28days) reaching the
      target blood glucose. Those patients are educated to record blood glucose and frequency of
      hypoglycemia during the study period. After achieving goal blood glucose, follow-up will
      continue one week to evaluate whether the blood glucose reached our goal and adjust the
      insulin pump parameter if necessary. The investigators plan to apply continuous glucose
      monitoring(CGM) for each patient during follow up. The investigators aim to explore the best
      time to reach goal blood glucose considering frequency of hypoglycemia, economic factors,
      insulin pump parameters at the end of study and the final insulin pump parameters at the end
      of follow up. The investigators aim to enroll patients with six different types diabetes
      because those patients have different insulin secretion pattern, which induced to different
      mode of CSII. The investigators set the goal fasting blood glucose at 4-6mmol/L and the goal
      postprandial blood glucose at 6-8mmol/L. The blood glucose of hypoglycemia was lower than
      3.9mmol/L.
