    <textblock>
      A phase 1 randomised, placebo-controlled, single-blind study to characterise the biomarker
      effects of the CSF-1 receptor antagonist JNJ-40346527 in participants with mild cognitive
      impairment. A maximum of 54 participants will be recruited to the two part study. The first
      part of the study will identify whether it is possible to identify biomarkers that may be
      used in future studies with JNJ-40346527 and part 2 will investigate a minimal efficacious
      JNJ-40346527 dose.

      Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a slow, progressive disease that profoundly affects memory and
      everyday function. There are treatments available that can help manage symptoms, but at
      present there is no cure, and no treatment that is effective at slowing the progression of
      AD. AD can begin to cause brain damage decades before symptoms such as memory loss become
      apparent.

      The trial will investigate the effect of the drug JNJ-40346527 on CSF-1R (colony stimulating
      factor-1 receptor), which is a protein on the outside of cells present in the brain. CSF-1R
      is responsible for the regulation of various cells, including microglial cells. Recent
      research suggests that reducing numbers of these microglial cells may be beneficial in
      slowing the progression of Alzheimer's disease. The Investigators want to see how well
      JNJ-40346527 is able to block CSF-1R, and in turn suppress these microglial cells. The study
      is designed to investigate whether or not it is possible to identify changes in levels of
      proteins which interact with CSF-1R, and changes in the activity or number of affected
      microglial cells present in the brain. This evidence may provide useful &quot;biomarkers&quot;,
      measures of change in the body, which the Investigators could track to see how the drug is
      working. These &quot;biomarkers&quot; could then be used in further larger studies to more thoroughly
      test the benefits of the drug JNJ-40346527. The present study is not designed to test whether
      or not this drug can slow the progression of Alzheimer's disease.

      If biomarkers are identified in the study, further studies will be designed to test whether
      JNJ-40346527 can slow or prevent the progression of Alzheimer's disease.

          -  Able to read and write in English and with minimum 7 years of formal education.

          -  Be considered eligible according to the following Tuberculosis (TB) screening
             criteria:

               1. Have no history of latent or active TB at screening. An exception is made for
                  participants who have a history of latent TB (defined for the purpose of this
                  study as having had a positive result from either the tuberculin skin test or the
                  QuantiFERON-TB® Gold test prior to screening) and documentation of having
                  completed an adequate treatment regimen for latent TB within 1 year prior to the
                  first administration of study agent. Adequate treatment for latent TB is defined
                  according to local country guidelines for immunocompromised patients. If no local
                  guidelines for immunocompromised patients exist, United States (US) guidelines
                  must be followed. It is the responsibility of the Investigator to verify the
                  adequacy of previous anti-TB treatment and provide appropriate documentation.

               2. Have no signs or symptoms suggestive of active TB upon medical history and/or
                  physical examination.

               3. Have had no recent (within approximately 3 months) close contact with a person
                  with active TB or if there has been such contact, have been evaluated by a
                  physician specialising in TB and found not to have evidence of, or require
                  treatment for latent TB.

          -  At screening, the results of the following laboratory tests performed at the local
             laboratory must be within the limits specified below (note: the Investigator may
             consider the participant eligible if the previously abnormal laboratory test result is
             within acceptable range on repeat testing. Repeat testing to be done 28 days before
             dose administration. If results from the laboratory test completed on the same day as
             the lumbar Puncture are outside the limits specified below, the Investigator may
             choose to repeat tests and continue the participant in the study, depending on their
             clinical assessment of any likely outcome/risks).

               1. Haemoglobin ≥8.5 g/dL (International System of Units [SI]: ≥85 g/L)

               2. White Blood Cells (WBC) count ≥3.0 x 103 cells/mm3 (SI:≥ 3.0 x 109 cells/L)

               6. Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels
                  ≤1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN)

               7. Total bilirubin levels ≤1.5 x ULN

               8. Serum creatinine ≤1.5 mg/dL

          -  Be otherwise healthy on the basis of clinical laboratory tests performed at screening.
             If the results of serum chemistry, haematology, or urinalysis tests not specified in
             the inclusion criteria above are outside of the normal range, the participant may be
             included only if the Investigator judges the abnormalities or deviations from normal
             not to be clinically significant or to be appropriate and reasonable for the
             population under study.

          -  Any conditions that are clinically significant and may deem the participant's
             participation in an investigational trial unsafe, e.g., symptomatic cardiovascular
             disease (including re-vascularisation procedures within the previous year), severe
             renal or hepatic failure, any clinically relevant abnormalities in blood parameters
             included in local routine assessments, severe loss of vision, hearing or communicative

             recovering haemorrhage (parenchymal or subdural), or obstructive hydrocephalus.
             Research participants with an MRI scan demonstrating markers of small vessel disease
             (e.g. white matter changes or lacunar infarcts) judged to be clinically insignificant,
             or microbleeds are allowed.

          -  Participation in a clinical trial with an Investigational Medicinal Product (IMP) in
             the last 30 days or 90 days in case of biologics.

          -  Diminished decision-making capacity that renders the individual not capable of
             consenting.

          -  Any other factors in the opinion of the Investigator that could contraindicate the
             participation of the research participant into this trial.
