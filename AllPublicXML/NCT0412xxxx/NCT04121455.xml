  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to obtain first, exploratory information on the safety and
      efficacy of olaptesed pegol in combination with radiation therapy in patients with newly
      diagnosed glioblastoma of unmethylated MGMT promoter status either not amenable to resection
      (biopsy only) or after incomplete tumor resection.
