  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research compares the relative efficacy of two empirically-supported, standardized
      programs of cognitive remediation for treatment of cognitive deficits and community function
      in schizophrenia to help inform best practices. The proposed study advances public health by
      developing and evaluating new behavioral techniques for improving psychosocial outcome in
      individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Evidence over the past 30 years has revealed that 70-80% of individuals with schizophrenia
      exhibit marked neurocognitive deficits on measures of attention, learning and memory,
      problem-solving, language and sensory-motor skill. Particular significance has been attached
      to these deficits as their severity has been linked to impaired community function, social
      problem-solving and progress in psychosocial rehabilitation programs. Cognitive remediation
      (CR) is a type of behavioral intervention that addresses cognitive deficits in schizophrenia
      by restoring lost cognitive skills or providing strategies for bypassing deficits through
      task practice. Meta-analyses have revealed that cognitive remediation is a validated approach
      to improving cognitive function in schizophrenia, however a lack of precision regarding the
      active elements of the intervention have prevented its recommendation as a standard treatment
      for the illness. The present three-year proposal seeks to identify cognitive training
      mechanisms that are most effective at improving cognitive function in schizophrenia by
      comparing two different systematic programs of CR with different foci: drill-and-practice
      exercises vs. compensatory strategies. Both programs have strong preliminary empirical
      support. One-hundred and thirty-five clients diagnosed with schizophrenia or schizoaffective
      disorder will be randomly assigned to one of three groups: a neuroplasticity-based,
      drill-and-practice program of computer-assisted cognitive training exercises designed to
      restore lost cognitive capacity; a manualized strategy training method for bypassing deficits
      in cognition, or a computer games control condition. Study measures, organized according to
      an experimental therapeutics approach, with targets distinguished from outcomes, will assess
      generalization of any observed training effects.

    <description>The MCCB includes state-of-the-art cognitive probes selected by 74 experts using the RAND panel method. The battery has strong reliability in schizophrenia and includes multiple forms for many subtests to help control for practice effects. Summary T-scores range from 20 to 80 with higher scores indicating better cognitive performance.</description>

    <description>The restorative remediation intervention will consist of a target of 50 hours (5 hours per week, 1 hour per day, over 3 months) of a sequence of computerized cognitive exercises designed to improve cognitive function through repeated drill-and-practice of exercises largely focused on attention, working memory and verbal episodic memory. Cognitive deficits will be directly targeted by these exercises. Exercises will be started at individually determined levels of difficulty at which each client will be successful, e.g., 80% accuracy. Task difficulty will be increased as performance improves.</description>

    <description>Participants in this intervention will be treated for 24 hours (2 hours per week, one day per week over 3 months) with Compensatory Cognitive Training (CCT). The therapy targets four cognitive domains: (a) prospective memory, (b) attention and vigilance, (c) learning and memory, and (d) executive function. The program is a group-based intervention that teaches strategies via interactive, game-like activities to maintain interest and enhance motivation and engagement.</description>
