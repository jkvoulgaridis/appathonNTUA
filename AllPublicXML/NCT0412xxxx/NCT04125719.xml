    <textblock>
      In this study, patients with metastatic melanoma who have at least one injectable lesion that
      has been refractory to PD-1 therapy (n=30 patients) will be enrolled. Cohort 1 will include
      15 patients who progressed within 3 months (primary resistance) of starting PD-1 therapy and
      cohort 2 will be patients who progressed after at least 3 months of PD-1 therapy. Patients
      will receive up to 7 injections of PVSRIPO intra-lesionally in combination with Nivolumab.
      Nivolumab will be administered according to the FDA-approved dosing schedule of 480 mg
      intravenously every 4 weeks, beginning ~10 days after the first PVSRIPO infusion and will
      continue for 4 cycles. Nivolumab may be continued up to 2 years per standard of care after
      the completion of the PVSRIPO injections.

      Patients must have histologically proven unresectable melanoma, stage IIIB, IIIC, IIID, or
      stage IV (AJCC staging must be documented in patient's medical record, as determined by CT of
      the chest, abdomen and pelvis, and/or whole body PET scan, and MRI of the brain within 4
      weeks prior to administration of study drug). Patients must have failed PD-1 therapy as
      judged by the treating physician.

      Patients will initially receive one injection of PVSRIPO intra-lesionally. Based on a phase 1
      study of the agent in adult patients with recurrent GBM, the starting amount to be delivered
      will be 1x108 tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) prior to initiation of nivolumab.
      Nivolumab will be administered according to the FDA-approved dosing schedule of 480 mg
      intravenously every 4 weeks, beginning ~10 days after the first PVSRIPO infusion and will
      continue for 4 cycles. PVSRIPO will then be given intralesionally to multiple lesions (if
      present) at days 38, 66, and 94.

      At Day 108 after 4 doses of nivolumab and 4 treatments of PVSRIPO, imaging and a full disease
      assessment will be done and iRECIST determined. A patient with complete response (CR) or a
      partial response (PR) (at least at 75% decrease in the sum of all diameters of all target
      lesions plus new lesions) will continue on nivolumab for up to 2 years. For patients with PR
      (&lt; 75% decrease), stable disease (SD), or progressive disease (PD), an additional 3
      treatments of PVSRIPO q4weeks can be given concurrently with 3 doses of monthly nivolumab.
      The lesions will be chosen at discretion of principal investigator (PI) and can be new
      lesions, previously injected lesions, or untreated lesions. At Day 234 (±7 days), (after 7
      total PVSRIPO injections and 8 doses of nivolumab), patients with PD will be off study, any
      patient with CR, PR, SD can receive up to 2 years total of nivolumab. If a patient has no
      remaining injectable lesions at any point during the study, PVSRIPO will not be given, but
      patients can continue on nivolumab.

             abstinent or use a condom during the treatment period and for 7 months after the last
             dose of study treatment to avoid exposing the embryo. Men must refrain from donating
             sperm during this same period.

        ii. The reliability of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the duration of
        the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. Periodic
        abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or postovulation methods) and
        withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.
