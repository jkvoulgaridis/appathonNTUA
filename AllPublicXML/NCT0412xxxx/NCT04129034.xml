    <textblock>
      Single arm pilot study to evaluate the safety and initial feasibility of the Neurolyser XR, a
      high intensity focused ultrasound device, for non-invasive treatment of axial chronic low
      back pain
    </textblock>

    <textblock>
      Study design: Prospective, single arm

      Timeline: six month enrollment period and 12 months follow-up period.

      Sites: The study will be conducted at five sites in Canada: McGill University, Toronto
      Western, Silver Medical Group, Precision Sport &amp; Spine, Kinetix Integrated Orthopaedic &amp;
      Regenerative Medicine

      Study population: Thirty adult patients diagnosed with facet related low back pain.

      Primary study objective: Safety and efficacy of the Neurolyser XR for the treatment of
      chronic low back pain secondary to zygapophyseal joint syndrome.

      Safety is measured by the incidence and severity of treatment related adverse events.

      Efficacy is measured by the changes in pain severity at the treatment area, using a numerical
      rating scale (NRS), of 0 to 10 between baseline and 6 months.
