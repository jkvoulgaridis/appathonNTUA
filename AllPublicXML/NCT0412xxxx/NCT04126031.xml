      This study will assess the pharmacokinetics, safety, and tolerability of single and multiple
      doses of intravenous ceftazidime-avibactam in hospitalized infants and neonates from 26 weeks
      gestation to 3 months of age. In Part A of the study all patients will receive a single dose
      of ceftazidime-avibactam. In Part B all patients will received multiple doses of
      ceftazidime-avibactam. Efficacy will be assessed in the infants and neonates receiving
      multiple doses of ceftazidime-avibactam.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a 2-part, Phase 2a, non-randomized, open-label multicenter, multinational study of
      intravenous ceftazidime-avibactam in hospitalized neonates and infants with suspected or
      confirmed bacterial infection. In Part A of the study, patients already receiving intravenous
      antibacterial therapy with another antibiotic will receive a single intravenous dose of
      ceftazidime-avibactam followed by observation for 48 hours and a Late Follow-Up assessment
      4-5 weeks later. In Part B of the study, patients with suspected or confirmed Gram-negative
      bacterial infections requiring intravenous antibacterial therapy will receive multiple doses
      of intravenous ceftazidime-avibactam for up to 14 days. At the discretion of the
      investigator, patients may also receive other antibiotics if the infection is suspected to
      include Gram-positive bacteria, multi-drug resistant Gram-negative bacteria, or anaerobic
      bacteria. At the discretion of the investigator, patients may be switched to oral therapy or
      outpatient parenteral antimicrobial therapy with an alternative antibiotic after receiving
      intravenous ceftazidime-avibactam for at least 48 yhours. Clinical outcomes will be assessed
      at the End of Intravenous (EOIV) treatment with ceftazidime-avibactam, the End-of-Therapy
      (EOT), the Test-of-Cure (TOC) at 7-14 days after the last study therapy and at a Late
      Follow-Up (LFU) visit, 28-55 days after the last dose of ceftazidime-avibactam. Safety
      assessments will occur throughout the study. Ceftazidime-avibactam blood levels will be
      assessed during the first 12 hours after the single dose of ceftazidime-avibactam in Part A
      and during 12 hours after at least 3 consecutive doses of ceftazidime-avibactam in Part B.

          1. At study entry, subject has confirmed or strongly suspected infection with a pathogen
             known to be resistant to CAZ-AVI or only a Gram-positive pathogen or viral, fungal, or

          3. Anticipated need for antibacterial therapy longer than 14 days (eg, osteomyelitis,
             endocarditis). This applies to both study treatment with CAZ-AVI as well as adjunctive
             IV antibacterial treatment for suspected co infection with Gram-positive organisms or
             multi drug resistant Gram-negative organisms.

          4. Receipt of more than 24 hours of nonstudy systemic antibacterial treatment for
             Gram-negative organisms after culture and before administration of study doses of

             organisms is permitted, provided CAZ-AVI is initiated within 24 hours after culture.

          5. Intravenous treatment with chloramphenicol within 24 hours of administration of study
             doses of CAZ-AVI.
