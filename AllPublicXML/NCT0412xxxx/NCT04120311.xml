      This phase I trial will assess primarily the safety and secondarily anti-inflammatory effect
      of Episcleral Dexamethasone in patients suffering from macular edema and other disorders of
      the retina, choroid and vitreous. Numerous studies have documented the anti-inflammatory
      activity of Dexamethasone in macular edema associated with diabetes, branch retinal vein
      occlusion, and non-infectious posterior uveitis. The investigators hypothesize that
      Episcleral Dexamethasone is safe, tolerable and that its anti-inflammatory activity will
      interface with the pro-inflammatory cascade associated with macular edema due to diabetes,
      surgery, trauma, vein occlusions, uveitis and retinal degeneration to improve visual
      structure and function. The investigators hypothesize that Episcleral Dexamethasone is safe,
      tolerable and that its anti-inflammatory activity will reduce macular edema and improve
      vision. The investigator's objective is to primarily assess the safety, tolerability and
      pharmacokinetics of Episcleral Dexamethasone in patients with macular edema; to secondarily
      assess efficacy in reducing macular edema and improving visual structure and function. The
      main outcome of the study is safety assessment. Secondary outcomes are assessment of visual
      acuity and anatomical changes in the macula as measured via optical coherence tomography
      (OCT) and fluorescein angiogram.
