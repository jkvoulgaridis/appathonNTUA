  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A pragmatic, single blinded, randomized, controlled non-inferiority trial of Cytisine versus
      Nicotine Replacement Therapy for continuous abstinence is conducted in the government run
      primary health hospitals in Mongolia.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: In Mongolia, smoking cessation assistance in the governmental health sector
      consists of behavioral counseling and a 3-week regimen of the NRT patch that costs 175 USD.
      This cost for low income adults limits effectiveness. A 2014 study documented the superiority
      and lower cost (&lt;20 USD) of Cytisine versus NRT for continuous abstinence. Trial
      investigators are testing the comparative effectiveness of Cytisine in the &quot;real life
      setting&quot; of their national health care system and, if proven effective, will include coverage
      for Cytisine in the national health plan.

      Research Question/Objective: To determine whether a 25 day course of Cytisine tablets is at
      least as effective as 25 days of NRT in helping smokers remain abstinent for at least one
      month.

      Design: A pragmatic, single blinded, randomized, controlled non-inferiority trial.

      Setting: Nine governmental primary care centers in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, and outskirts.

      Participants: Mongolian adult smokers referred to government-run addiction units.

      Intervention and procedures: Participants are randomized to 5 weeks of treatment (n=352) or
      usual care (n=352) and a 6-month follow-up. The treatment consists of a 25-day course of
      Cytisine tablets and behavioral counseling. Usual care consists of 25 days of NRT and
      behavioral counseling.

      Measurements: The primary outcome is continuous abstinence (&lt; 5 cigarettes smoked since quit
      date) at 1 month. Secondary outcomes include 7-day point prevalence abstinence rates and
      adverse events.
