  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) is a rare, heterogeneous histiocytic disorder occurring
      most commonly in children. Because of the rarity of LCH in adults and a lack of prospective
      randomized trials, the treatment strategy for adults is mostly based on pediatric protocols.
      The overall response rate of therapy based on vinblastine plus prednisone in adults is lower
      than in children and the treatment tends to show higher toxicity.There is little data to
      guide therapy after frontline treatment. In a phase 2 trial, thalidomide as monotherapy gave
      a 70% response rate in recurrent/refractory low risk LCH but there were no responses in six
      high risk children. We want to analyze the efficacy and toxicity of thalidomide combined with
      dexamethasone and cyclophosphamide regimens in the treatment of recurrent/refractory LCH
      among adult patients at our hospital.
