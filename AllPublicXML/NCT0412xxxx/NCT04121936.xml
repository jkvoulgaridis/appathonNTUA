      The first large population-based study to evaluate lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) in
      Poland. The study objective is to assess the prevalence and bother of LUTS in the population
      aged ≥40 years in Poland.

      This study will be conducted as a telephone survey with assessment of LUTS using a
      standardized protocol, which included the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) and,
      for overactive bladder (OAB), the OAB-V8 questionnaire. Participants will be asked to rate
      how often they experienced individual LUTS and the degree of associated bother.

      The study will be performed in a representative group of Polish population (n = 6,000)
      covering all geographic regions of Poland (defined by the Central Statistical Office of
      Poland).

    <description>The prevalence of specific symptoms will be assessed using a standardised protocol based on the definitions provided by the International Continence Society (i.e. storage symptoms, voiding symptoms and post-micturition symptoms) [Abrams P, Cardozo L, Fall M, et al. The standardisation of terminology of lower urinary tract function: report from the Standardisation Sub-committee of the International Continence Society. Neurourol Urodyn. 2002;21:167-178]. Participants will be asked to rate how often they experienced individual LUTS during the past month. A Likert scale will be used with the following options: none (score 0), &lt;1 in 5 times (score 1), &lt;half the time (score 2), about half the time (score 3), &gt;half the time (score 4), or almost always (score 5).</description>
