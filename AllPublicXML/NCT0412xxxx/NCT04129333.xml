  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Procedural pain in resuscitation is common in the conscious patient. However, analgesia and
      sedation may be impossible because of the acute pathology leading to resuscitation,
      comorbidities or the urgency of the invasive procedure. In addition, the use of analgesics
      and sedatives is responsible for adverse effects. In this context, hypnosis appears to be an
      additional analgesic tool that would reduce the consumption of analgesics and sedatives and
      thus reduce their side effects.
