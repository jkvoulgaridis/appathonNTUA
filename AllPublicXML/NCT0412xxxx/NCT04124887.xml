      The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the efficacy of NaF, NaF with TCP, NaF with
      CPP-ACP, and NaF with CXP varnishes on newly erupted first permanent molar teeth. The study
      was carried out in 40 healthy, high caries risk children (DMFS &gt;8), aged six to seven years
      with newly erupted permanent first molars who referred to the Pediatric Dentistry Clinic of
      Kırıkkale University Faculty of Dentistry, Kırıkkale, Turkey. A total of 140 teeth were
      divided randomly into four groups and the varnishes were applied to the determined teeth at
      baseline, one and three months. The same varnish was used, if there is more than one first
      molar to be applied of the same patient. The groups were comprised as follows:

      Group 1: Duraphat Varnish containing 5% NaF (Colgate-Palmolive, NSW, Australia) (n = 35),
      Group 2: Clinpro™ White Varnish containing 5% NaF with TCP (3M ESPE, MN, USA) (n = 35), Group
      3: Embrace ™ Varnish containing 5% NaF with CXP (Pulpdent, MA, USA) (n = 35), Group 4: MI
      Varnish containing 5% NaF with CPP-ACP (GC, Tokyo, Japan) (n = 35). All dental treatments of
      the patients were completed before the varnish application and oral hygiene instructions were
      given to all children at the start of the study.

      Patients were called for follow up appointments at 1, 3 and 6 months, and in the follow-up
      period DIAGNOdent device (laser fluorescence scanning) was used to monitor mineralization
      changes. LF measurements were made at baseline (T0), after one month (T1) three months (T2)
      and six months (T3). Within and between group comparisons were analysed statistically.
