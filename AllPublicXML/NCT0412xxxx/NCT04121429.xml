  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular treatments should not be interrupted following hospital admission, in order to
      decrease patients' morbidity. However, following ICU admission, such treatments are
      frequently interrupted and/or modified. The question of the study is to investigate wether
      such treatment interruption might be responsible for prognosis modifications.

      Cardiovascular treatments should not be interrupted following hospital admission, in order to
      decrease patients' morbidity. However, following ICU admission, such treatments are
      frequently interrupted and/or modified.

      Few studies have investigated the outcome impact of medications interruption and/or
      modifications following hospital admission. We did consider that it might be interesting to
      study whether treatment continuation, interruption, and/or re-introduction following ICU
      admission may modify patients' outcome either in the ICU or following hospital discharge (at
      3,6 and 12 months).
