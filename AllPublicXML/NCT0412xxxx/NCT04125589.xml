  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are doing a study of women with and without binge-eating disorder to learn
      more about what happens when people engage in everyday decision-making activities. The
      investigators are interested in learning more about brain activity during everyday
      decision-making and how everyday decision-making relates to a variety of daily experiences.
      Examples of everyday decisions include deciding which product to buy, deciding what to eat
      for a snack, and deciding how to spend free time.
