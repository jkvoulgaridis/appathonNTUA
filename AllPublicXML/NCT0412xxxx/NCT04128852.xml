  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a post-marketing clinical follow-up study for MagnetOs Putty. MagnetOs Putty is
      a synthetic bone-like material which is routinely used by surgeons as a treatment for
      patients with degenerative disc disease who will undergo surgery for spinal fusion (extreme
      lateral interbody fusion (XLIF)). MagnetOs Putty will be used according to the instructions
      for use.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, following a screening period of maximum 30 days, 20 patients will undergo a
      single/two-level XLIF procedure and will receive MagnetOs Putty at the diseased level(s).
      They will be followed up at discharge, Week 6, Month 3, Month 6 and Month 12 post-surgery.
      The primary endpoint will be analyzed at Month 12.

      In this study, MagnetOs Putty will be applied according to the latest Instructions For Use
      (IFU) approved in Europe. Specifically, MagnetOs Putty will be used as bone void filler in
      Degenerative Disc Disease patients with up to grade 1 spondylolisthesis requiring treatment
      with single or two-level lateral lumbar interbody fusion (XLIF). In the context of filling of
      intervertebral implant (e.g. interbody cage), the choice of implant should be appropriate to
      enable successful fusion but will be left to the investigator discretion.

      The extreme lateral interbody fusion surgical procedure will be left to the investigator
      discretion.

      Radiographs will be taken at Screening, Day 0, Month 3 and 12, while CT-scans will only be
      taken at Month 6 and Month 12.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Per the current Instruction For Use, MagnetOs Putty must not be used in the following
        clinical situations:

          1. To treat conditions in which general bone grafting is not advisable.

          2. In conditions where the surgical site may be subjected to excessive impact or
             stresses, including those beyond the load strength of fixation hardware (e.g. defect
             site stabilisation is not possible).

          3. In case of significant vascular impairment proximal to the graft site.
