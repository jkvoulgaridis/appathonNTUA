    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate several interventions given to
      participants with severe asthma. Interventions are administered in a crossover manner with
      16-week treatment periods followed by 8 to 16 week washout.

      PrecISE is a clinical study sponsored by the U.S. National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute
      (NHLBI) to investigate several treatments for severe asthma. PrecISE will enroll 800 adults
      and teenagers (ages 12 years and older) with severe asthma who have symptoms that are not
      well-controlled on high dose of inhaled corticosteroids including those who have frequent
      asthma attacks. Each person who agrees to enroll in the PrecISE study will receive several
      treatments for research purposes based on their type of severe asthma.

      The goal of PrecISE is to understand how to treat different types of severe asthma, by using
      precision medicine. Precision medicine is an approach that targets treatments to defined
      subgroups of patients who share similar characteristics, for example, patients with a certain
      genetic variation or patients with high number of blood eosinophils.

      Researchers from over 30 locations across the US, as well as sites in Canada and the United
      Kingdom, are involved in PrecISE.

    <description>Asthma symptom control is assessed via ACQ-6, the average score of these six items (range 0-6). The seven-point response scale: 0 = 'totally controlled' and 6 = 'severely uncontrolled'. Negative change from baseline values indicate improved asthma control.

    <description>CompEx is a composite outcome specific to asthma that combines clinically-relevant deteriorations captured by diary events with exacerbations. CompEx events include exacerbations and deterioration events defined based on daily recordings of peak expiratory flow (PEF) morning/evening (L/min), reliever use morning/evening (doses), symptoms morning/evening (score 0-3) from twice-daily recordings. Participants will be asked to describe their morning and symptoms using the following scale: 0-No symptoms to report, 3-I could not sleep because of my asthma/I could not perform my normal activities because of my asthma.</description>

                       promptly notify her doctor

                    -  Any pregnancy (of a participant or a partner) will be monitored for adverse
                       events with respect to pregnancy outcome until one month after birth.

         15. Requirement for daily systemic corticosteroids above 10 mg of prednisone (or

         19. Any clinically significant abnormal findings in the history, physical examination,
             vital signs, electrocardiogram, hematology or clinical chemistry during run-in period,
             which in the opinion of the site investigator, may put the participant at risk because
             of his/her participation in the study, or may influence the results of the study, or
             the participant's ability to complete the entire duration of the study

         20. Additional exclusions for specific interventions (and not for others) are listed in
             the Appendices I-VI, Section 5.2

        Safety Exclusion Criteria:

        Participants who meet the following criteria will be excluded from the study:

          1. Hemoglobin &lt;10 g/dL

          2. Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) &lt;1000/µl for black participants, &lt;1500/µl for other
             participants

          3. Lymphocytes &lt;500/µl

          4. Platelet count &lt;100,000/µl

          5. Alanine Transaminase (ALT)/Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST) &gt;2x upper limits of normal
             (ULN)

          6. Bilirubin ≥2x ULN

          7. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) &lt;60 ml/min/1.73 sq m

          8. Positive Human Immunodeficiency Virus, Types 1 &amp; 2 (HIV 1&amp;2) Ab/Ag immunoassay
             followed by a confirmatory positive test (Geenius™ HIV-1/HIV-2 antibody
             differentiation immunoassay)

          9. Positive Hepatitis B surface Ag (active infection) or Hepatitis B core total antibody
             (marker of past infection that could reactivate)

         10. Positive Hepatitis C RNA test following positive Hepatitis C Antibody

         11. EKG with significant clinical findings

        A positive QuantiFERON-TB (tuberculosis) Gold test requires further screening. A
        participant may be included in PrecISE if at least one of the following criteria are met:

          1. A chest radiograph (CXR) done within the last six months of the test that shows no
             evidence of active TB

          2. A chest CT scan done within the last six months of the test that shows no evidence of
             active TB

          3. Documentation of adequate treatment for latent TB In cases of an indeterminate
             QuantiFERON-TB test result, a second blood specimen must be drawn. A chest x-ray is
             not required if the participant has a negative QuantiFERON-TB Gold test.

        Comorbid Conditions:

        Comorbidities are commonly present in severe asthma. Specific questionnaires will be used
        to identify common comorbidities as follows:

          1. Sleep apnea: STOP-BANG

          2. GERD (GERD- Questionnaire)

          3. VCD (Pittsburgh vocal cord dysfunction index)

          4. Chronic Rhinitis Sinusitis (Sinonasal questionnaire-SNQ5)

          5. Depression-Anxiety (Hospital anxiety and depression Scale: HADS) These questionnaires
             are best used as screening tools. As such they typically have high sensitivity but
             relatively low specificity. Many of their symptoms overlap with the symptoms reported
             by participants with asthma who do not suffer from these conditions. Therefore,
             participants who meet the established cut offs for these questionnaires will need to
             be evaluated by the investigator to consider the clinical significance of the positive
             questionnaire based on history and physical and available testing. The investigator
             will need to judge the presence, severity and control of a specific condition and
             determine if it is sufficiently controlled to keep the participant in the PrecISE
             protocol. If the comorbid condition(s) is/are not adequately controlled, the
             investigator may refer the participant for further evaluation/treatment, prior to
             enrollment in PrecISE. Rescreening is permitted (after at least four weeks) to
             determine if the participant is able to move forward in PrecISE once the comorbid
             condition(s) is/are under adequate control. It is expected that some of the
             participants may also have other conditions such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes
             and obesity. These should be evaluated clinically as part of the complete history and
             physical done at initial evaluation. Their inclusions should be based on the
             investigator clinical judgement in line with good clinical practice principles.
