  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A total hip replacement is one of the most successful and cost-effective surgical procedures
      in orthopaedics, and involves replacing both the hip ball and socket. Its goal is to provide
      pain relief, allowing the person to return to a normal lifestyle. JRI Orthopaedics have
      developed the ACE Acetabular Cup System, which has a H-A.C. coating to promote
      ossoeintegration of the device within the host bone. To increase the surgeons choice and thus
      suitability for the patient, there is the option of 3 different socket liners (ceramic,
      polymer or dual mobility).

      To ensure maximum safety and performance of medical devices surveillance of the device should
      be carried out over the devices lifetime. This study is a 10 year surveillance study to
      assess the clinical, functional and radiological outcomes of the CE-marked ACE Acetabular Cup
      System. This is done by examining patient outcomes through questionnaires, reviews of X-rays
      and complications by patients who have received a total hip replacement using the ACE
      Acetabular Cup System at participating sites.
