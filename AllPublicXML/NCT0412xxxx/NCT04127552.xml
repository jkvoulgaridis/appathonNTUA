  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that cardiovascular and metabolic alterations can occur in
      patients with adrenal adenomas and possible Autonomous Cortisol Secretion (pACS).
      Investigators hypothesize that adrenalectomy in selected patients, following the 2016 ECE
      guidelines, can improve metabolic parameters and cardiovascular risks and features.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adrenal incidentalomas are clinically silent masses discovered inadvertently during
      diagnostic imaging procedures performed for unrelated reasons. Depending on the criteria
      applied, up to 50% of patients with adrenal incidentalomas may have biochemical evidence of
      cortisol excess. Possible autonomous cortisol secretion (pACS), as defined in the 2016
      European Society of Endocrinology Guidelines, is characterized by a partial, incomplete
      suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis without the typical signs of
      overt cortisol hypersecretion.

      Investigators will perform a prospective longitudinal study in patients with adrenal
      incidentalomas associated with possible autonomous cortisol secretion, aiming to assess the
      effect of surgical and conservative management on cardiovascular and metabolic features.

      Data will be detected at baseline, at 1 and at 5 years follow-up to quantitatively identify
      the different cardiovascular and metabolic alterations in: (1) patients with non-functioning
      adrenal adenoma; (2) patients with possible autonomous cortisol secretion receiving
      conservative management; (3) patients with possible autonomous cortisol secretion receiving
      adrenalectomy according to the 2016 European Society of Endocrinology guidelines; (4)
      patients without adrenal masses.

    <description>Perform the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Sleep disturbances will be evaluated by The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). This questionnaire contains 19 self-related questions which are combined to create 7 component scores with a range of 0-3 points (0:no difficulty, 3: severe difficulty). Global score is the result to the addition of all component scores with a range of 0-21 points (0:no difficulty, 21: severe difficulty).</description>

This questionnaire includes questions on infectious diseases of upper and lower respiratory tract, gastrointestinal tract, skin and urogenital tract and flu contracted during the previous 12 months. Questions investigate on the number and duration of infections, necessity of antibiotic or antifungal therapy, hospital stay and days of absence from work. Final score represents the frequency of infections.</description>

    <description>Quality of life will be evaluated by the Physical Component score and the Mental Component score of the self-administered questionnaire SF-36-Item Health Survey questionnaire.
This questionnaire measures eight scales: physical functioning, role physical, bodily pain, general health (physical component) and vitality, social functioning, role emotional, mental health (mental component).
Interpretation of the score will be the following: at each item of the questionnaire corresponds a percentage value (from 0% to 100%). The average of the single items constitutes the scale total percentage (from 0% to 100%); missing data are not considered during calculation. High score defines a more favorable health state.</description>

The global score is obtained adding all single scores, with a range of 0-63. Higher score constitutes worse burden of symptoms (0-13: minimal depression, 14-19: mild depression, 20-28: moderate depression, 29-63: severe depression).</description>

    <description>Perform the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) questionnaire. This is a 19-item questionnaire that covers six domains: desire, arousal, lubrication, and orgasm, satisfaction, and pain. The ranges of the domain scores are as follows: for desire 1.2 - 6.0, for arousal, lubrication, orgasm and pain 0 - 6.0 and for satisfaction 0.8 - 6.0. The higher scores of the six domains indicate better sexual functioning about that domain. The overall FSFI score is obtained by summing the six domain scores. The overall FSFI scores range from 2.0 to 36.0, with higher scores indicating better sexual functioning.</description>
