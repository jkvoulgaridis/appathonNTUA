  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, Phase II, multi-center study evaluating DM199 in approximately 60
      (sixty) Participants in two cohorts.

      Cohort I: African Americans with CKD (Stage II or III), hypertension and non-diabetic Cohort
      II: Participants with IgA nephropathy diagnosis and CKD (Stage II or III)

      Participants in each cohort will be enrolled in a parallel assignment to one of two doses:

      Dose 1: DM199 2.0 µg/kg SC 2x week for 95 days Dose 2: DM199 5.0 µg/kg SC 2x week for 95 days
