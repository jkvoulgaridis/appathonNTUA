      A pilot study comparing the effects of pea protein versus whey protein on the preservation of
      muscle mass and functionality in individuals undertaking a weight loss regimen.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A single site, double-blind, randomized clinical trial designed to compare the effects of pea
      protein or whey protein or maltodextrin supplementation on muscle mass and functionality in
      males and females with obesity undertaking a weight loss regimen. Eligible participants will
      be randomized to one of the three groups (pea protein, whey protein, maltodextrin) and will
      be asked to attend 3 in-person clinic visits (0, 6, and 12 weeks) for blood and urine
      collection and assessments of muscle mass and muscle function. A separate visit for screening
      and for a fasting blood sample, as well as a Pre-Study visit and a meeting with a registered
      dietitian, will be required.
