    <textblock>
      Despite its known prevalence, a recent study conducted with Prof. Cacoub (unpublished) on the
      national health insurance database showed that iron deficiency was a poorly diagnosed and
      poorly treated comorbidity. In patients with Chronic Kidney Disease but Non-Dialysis, the
      determination of Ferritinemia and Transferrin Saturation Factoris performed in only 30% and
      10% of cases whereas they should be performed routinely in inflammatory situations and in
      case of anemia (HAS 2011, KDIGO 2012). The objective of this study is to obtain updated data
      on the prevalence of iron deficiency in France in patients with CKD-ND, applying the
      international recommendations and those of the French Health High Authority (determination of
      ferritinemia and Transferrin Saturation Factor).
