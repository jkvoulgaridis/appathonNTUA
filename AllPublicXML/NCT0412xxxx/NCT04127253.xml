  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this research is to evaluate and quantify hypoalgesic effects caused by
      imagination and observation with or without the presence of transcranial direct current
      (tDCS) in healthy participants. The secondary objective of this research is to evaluate the
      possible relationships between hypoalgesic effects and different physical and cognitive
      variables such as the ability to generate motor mental images, mental chronometry and levels
      of physical activity.

    <measure>Pressure pain threshold</measure>
    <time_frame>Change in Pressure pain threshold just before the start of the intervention, immediately at the end of the intervention and 15 minutes after the end of the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Pressure pain threshold has been defined as the minimal amount of pressure at which a sense of pressure first changes to pain or discomfort</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Ability to generate motor images</measure>
    <time_frame>Just before the start of the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The ability to generate motor images will be measured through The movement imagery questionnaire-revised (MIQ-R) is an 8-item self-report inventory that was used to assess visual and kinesthetic motor imagery ability. Four different movements are included in the MIQ-R, which is comprised of 4 visual and 4 kinesthetic items. For each item, participants read a description of the movement. They then physically performed the movement and were instructed to reassume the starting position after finishing the movement and before performing the mental task, imagining the movement visually or kinesthetically. Each participant then rated the ease or difficulty of mentally generating that image on a 7-point scale, in which 7 indicates &quot;very easy to see/feel&quot; and 1 &quot;very difficult to see/feel.&quot; The internal consistencies of the MIQ-R have been consistently adequate.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mental Chronometry</measure>
    <time_frame>Just before the start of the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Mental chronometry is a reliable measure that has been widely used to record objective measurements of the ability to create mental motor images</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The degree of physical activity</measure>
    <time_frame>Just before the start of the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The level of physical activity will be assessed using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire, which allows the participants to be divided into 3 groups according to their level of activity, which can be high, moderate, and low or inactive</description>
