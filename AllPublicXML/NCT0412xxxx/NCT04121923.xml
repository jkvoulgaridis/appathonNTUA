  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of the Belun Ring
      Pulse Oximetry system for screening of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in adults during
      standard polysomnography sleep study conditions. The primary outcome metric is the
      Apnea-Hypopnea Index (AHI).

      The goal, in its entirety, is to evaluate the performance of the Belun Ring Pulse Oximeter
      during a standard polysomnography sleep study and its ability to compare to the determined
      Apnea-Hypopnea Index (AHI) of the subjects. It is expected that the Belun Ring Pulse Oximeter
      will adequately record SpO2, pulse rate, body position and heart rate variability throughout
      the duration of the study.

    <description>All patients scheduled for attended overnight in-lab polysomnography (PSG) will undergo PSG testing. On the same night of the PSG testing, these same patients will also wear the Belun Ring device. After the study, we will compare results of the Belun Ring device with the results of the PSG on the same patient. There will be no separate arm to test a different device.</description>

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject must have the ability to understand and provide written informed consent.

          -  Subject is 18 to 90 years of age.

          -  Subject must be willing and able to comply with study procedures and duration.

          -  Male or female of any race.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject requires oxygen therapy or noninvasive ventilation.

          -  Subject has a current diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD),
             neuromuscular disease, periodic limb movement, or narcolepsy.

          -  Compromised circulation, injury, or physical malformation of fingers, toes, hands,
             ears or forehead/skull or other sensor sites which would limit the ability to test
             sites needed for the study. (Note: Certain malformations may still allow subjects to
             participate if the condition is noted and would not affect the particular sites
             utilized.)

          -  Subject is on medication known to interfere with heart rate, such as beta blockers,
             digoxin, or calcium receptor agonists.

          -  Subjects with severe contact allergies to standard adhesives, latex or other materials
             found in pulse oximetry sensors, ECG electrodes, respiration monitor electrodes or
             other medical sensors (self-reported).

          -  Unwillingness or inability to remove colored nail polish from test digits.

          -  Other known health condition, which should be considered.
