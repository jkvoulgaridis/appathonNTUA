    <textblock>
      This study will assess the physiological demands experienced by healthy volunteers
      participating in components of a Singing for Lung Health session. Oxygen consumption, heart
      rate, and fixed body sensor output puts related to balance and movement intensity will be
      assessed. The same parameters will also be assessed during walking on a treadmill at
      different speeds for comparison.

    <description>Oxygen consumption, in mL per kilogram per minute, will be assessed during different components of Singing for Lung Health(physical warm up, rhythm exercises, pitch exercises, vocal exercises, repertoire and relaxation. This will be compared with oxygen consumption while walking at three speeds on a treadmill (slow, medium and brisk). Oxygen consumption will be assessed using portable metabolic measurement equipment (Oxycon Mobile made by Vyaire).</description>
