    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety and tolerability of ABBV-0805 in adult participants with
      Parkinson's Disease and results from it will help guide the design of future clinical
      studies. ABBV-0805 is administered every 28 days by intravenous (IV) infusion.

    <description>An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation participant administered a pharmaceutical product which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. The investigator assesses the relationship of each event to the use of study drug as either probably related, possibly related, probably not related or not related. A serious adverse event (SAE) is an event that results in death, is life-threatening, requires or prolongs hospitalization, results in a congenital anomaly, persistent or significant disability/incapacity or is an important medical event that, based on medical judgment, may jeopardize the participant and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent any of the outcomes listed above. Treatment-emergent adverse events/treatment-emergent serious adverse events (TEAEs/TESAEs) are defined as any event that began or worsened in severity after the first dose of study drug.</description>

             malformation, subdural hematoma, hydrocephalus, space occupying lesion (such as an
             abscess or brain tumor such as meningioma).

          -  Received any drug by injection within 30 days or within a period defined by 5
             half-lives, whichever is longer, prior to study administration, unless approved by the
             Investigator in consultation with the AbbVie Therapeutic Area Medical Director.

          -  Treated with any investigational product within a time frame equal to 5 half-lives, if
             known, or within 6 weeks (for small molecules) or 6 months (for monoclonal antibodies
             or other biologics) prior to the first dose of study drug.

          -  Participant with recent history of drug or alcohol abuse (within 6 months prior to
             study drug administration) that could impact adherence to the protocol in the opinion
             of the investigator.

          -  Participant with evidence of dysplasia or history of malignancy with the exception of
             excised or treated cervical cancer, some indolent malignancies (such as basal cell
             carcinoma or squamous cell carcinomas), remission from any malignancy for more than 5
             years or participants with slow growth prostatic carcinoma may be eligible to

             vaccine, oral polio vaccine, and nasal influenza vaccine.

          -  Participant with symptoms of an active infection or history of prior infection (viral,
             fungal, or bacterial) requiring hospitalization or IV antibiotics within 8 weeks
             before first dose of study drug.

          -  Participant with history of abnormal laboratory result that, in the opinion of the
