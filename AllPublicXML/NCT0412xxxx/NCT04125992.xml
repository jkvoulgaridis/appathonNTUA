  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Distal Radial Access (DRA) to the coronaries has emerged recently. It's done via the
      distal radial artery in the radial fossa, which is known as the snuff-box. The rationale of
      conducting this research is to assess this new access advantages and disadvantages, in
      comparison with the standard conventional forearm radial access and examine if it's worthy to
      be a future alternative method for coronary angiography. It aims to randomly compare between
      the new distal radial access via the snuffbox and the conventional forearm radial access for
      percutaneous coronary angiography and angioplasty procedures. The objectives of comparing
      both procedures are to analyze the frequency of complications in terms of occlusion, arterial
      spasm, hematoma, and to weigh accesses effectiveness in terms of time and attempts to
      puncture, crossover rate, procedure duration, hemostasis time, and convenience of the
      patients and operators.

      Candidates for coronary angiography are being randomized into the interventional group to
      undergo the angiography through the distal radial artery as the access site, or the control
      group accessing through the radial artery in the forearm. Procedural and post procedural
      outcomes and complications are being reported while patients are in hospital. All patients
      undergo doppler ultrasonography within 24 hours after the procedure.

    <description>The patient grasps his thumb towards the palm to bring the radial artery up to the surface. The left hand is set on the right side of the groin toward the operator, who stands on the right side, with the dorsal surface of hand upwards.
Afterward, the access site is disinfected, lidocaine HCL is SC injected for local anesthesia. Subsequently, the distal radial artery is palpated to find the point of the strongest pulse. Later, at a 45-degree angle, the artery is punctured with a 21-gauge needle and a 0.018 soft, flexible, metallic wire is then inserted in the needle. Through the sheath, 200 micrograms of Nitroglycerin is given. A 5000 unit of unfractionated heparin is administered through the IV line. A weight-adjusted dose of heparin is further added if PCI is needed. Then, a 0.035 wire is introduced in the sheath with other required instruments such as the intracoronary device and the catheters. After pulling out the sheath, a compression device, Safe Guard, is used for hemostasis.</description>
