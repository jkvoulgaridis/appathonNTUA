  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study establishes a repository for imaging data generated during image-guided
      proton therapy for various pediatric cancers. The data facilitate the estimation of patient
      positioning uncertainty, the comparison of image guidance methods, and the identification of
      factors contributing to large setup deviations to improve the accuracy of radiation therapy
      in the future.

      Primary Objective

      To establish a repository of imaging data acquired during the radiation therapy course with
      linked radiation treatment plans and clinical information from pediatric patients of all
      cancer types receiving image-guided proton therapy to facilitate secondary and exploratory
      objectives.

      Secondary Objectives

        -  To estimate distributions of patient setup uncertainty measured with daily pre-
           treatment volumetric cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) scans.

        -  To compare patient setup corrections derived based on 2D (orthogonal radiographs) and 3D
           (volumetric CBCT scans) image guidance.

        -  To assess residual setup errors after CBCT-guided correction based on post- correction
           repeat CBCT.

        -  To estimate distributions and time trends of patient motion during a radiation therapy
           course based on weekly pre- and post-treatment CBCT scans.

        -  To identify clinical and treatment factors that contribute to significantly large setup
           uncertainty and intra-fractional movement in pediatric patients.

      Exploratory Objectives

        -  To determine variation in patient anatomy using images acquired during the treatment
           course.

        -  To evaluate the usefulness of on-treatment CBCT scans for detecting daily changes in
           proton ranges, evaluating deviations from planned tumor dosimetry, and triggering
           adaptive replanning.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Image guidance data collected in this study include daily volumetric pre-treatment CBCT for
      image guidance, post-correction CBCT, weekly post-treatment CBCT, and 2D orthogonal
      radiographs. Setup uncertainty will be estimated for head and body cohorts separately,
      further divided into different anatomic sites. The usefulness and necessity of daily
      volumetric image guidance for pediatric proton therapy patients will be determined. Knowledge
      gained from this study will provide a basis for reducing patient positioning uncertainty and
      designing optimal treatment plans for pediatric patients receiving proton therapy.
