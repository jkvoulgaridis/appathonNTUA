    <textblock>
      A prospective, randomized, controlled post-market clinical investigation that will enroll
      pediatric subjects requiring laceration repair. The investigation population will consist of
      30 subjects fulfilling the eligibility criteria for the clinical investigation. The subjects
      will be randomly assigned at a 1:1 ratio to either the Zip 4 Surgical Skin Closure Device
      group or the Standard of Care sutures group.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The commercial use of the Zip device has demonstrated applicability and acceptance in many
      medical specialties, including laceration closure in the Emergency Department setting.
      However, while clinical studies have demonstrated quantitative performance benefits of the
      device in orthopedic, dermatology, cardiac and cardiology specialties, no quantitative
      studies have been conducted in the Emergency Department setting with the device with which
      emergency medicine physicians may make quantitative, informed treatment choices. The Sponsor
      (ZipLine Medical) and the study doctor (investigator) have furthermore identified the
      pediatric patient population presenting for laceration repair in the Emergency Department as
      a group that may uniquely benefit from the use of the Zip device.

      Standard care for wounds of this type require cleaning the wound, anesthetizing the wound and
      closing the wound with sutures that typically require subsequent removal at a later date. The
      Zip device is non-invasive and therefore requires no injected anesthesia or sedation for
      wound closure. In addition, the referenced clinical studies have demonstrated at least a 3
      times speed advantage over sutures. The Zip device ease of use and consistency of outcomes
      enables less skilled or experienced caregivers to perform fast, efficient and excellent wound
      closure, which can improve department and staff efficiency, patient throughput and overall
      patient satisfaction. Finally, the Zip device may be removed by the patient or parent at
      home, eliminating a return-to-clinic visit for removal.

      ZipLine Medical believes that the demonstrated benefits of the Zip device will be more
      pronounced with the specified pediatric population due to reduced procedure time, elimination
      of injected anesthesia and elimination of a return visit for suture removal. ZipLine Medical
      believes that this will reduce fear and anxiety in pediatric patients. Furthermore, ZipLine
      Medical believes that the Zip device can improve Emergency Department efficiency and patient
      throughput, reduce overall healthcare cost and improve overall patient (and parent)
      satisfaction.

    <description>A Wound Evaluation Score will be documented by an independent reviewer of photos taken at Day 0 and compared to 10 Day and 30 Day to evaluate the satisfaction and outcomes of the Zip 4 Surgical Skin Closure Device in comparison to conventional sutures used in a pediatric population presenting for laceration repair. The WES evaluates six clinical variables including incision edges, contour irregularity, width, edge inversion, inflammation and overall cosmesis. A score of 6 is considered optimal, while a score of &lt; or =5 suboptimal.</description>

The satisfaction rating for the Zip 4 Surgical Skin Closure Device will be compared to conventional sutures used in a pediatric population for laceration repair.

    <description>The device is a class IIa device as per Annex II of the MDD 93/42EEC, as amended by Directive 2007/47/EEC. A CE-mark was affixed in 2014. The Zip device adheres to the skin adjacent to an incision or laceration by use of pressure-sensitive skin adhesives. A combination of acrylic and hydrocolloid adhesives is used to provide a skin-friendly environment while providing the necessary tack to maintain skin adhesion during a maximum wear time of 14 days. In addition to the pressure-sensitive adhesives, the device's closure and force distribution components are made up of polyurethane monofilm, polyethylene tape, polyester and nylon.</description>
