  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to simultaneously establish the metrological characteristics
      of the new executive function markers (decision making and multiple flow management) derived
      from repeated ERP variations and to identify their ability to test whether a short treatment
      using Ginkgo biloba versus placebo extracts can modify the cognitive performance and
      functional capacity of patients in the very early stages of age-related cognitive decline.
      This trial, using subjects as their own control (cross-over) in repeated measurements will
      establish the reproducibility characteristics of the measurements and intra-individual
      variations of ERP over time in this population

      This study is a single-center, randomized clinical trial testing the effects of Ginkgo biloba
      extracts versus placebo on event related potential ERP registration measurements in
      Electroencephalography (EEG) during neuropsychological tasks. The Hold-Release (HR)
      neuropsychological test allows the study of behavioral and neurofunctional correlates using
      several different techniques for online recording of brain activity. This test measures the
      engagement of focused attention and the loading of information into working memory, as
      opposed to the disengagement of attention.

      The study will be carried out in a randomized cross-over design, with &quot;Ginkgo&quot; vs. Placebo&quot;,
      or inversely, for 170 days each (approximately 6 months), separated by an 8-weeks wash-out
      period. A follow-up visit will be held 3 months after the last treatment of the study.

      The cross-over design uses each patient as its own control, which allows an easy comparison
      between the 2 groups &quot;Placebo&quot; vs. &quot;Ginkgo&quot; by limiting inter-patient variations. In
      addition, by doubling the number of patients per treatment compared to a classic study design
      in 2 groups, cross-over reduces the number of patients to be recruited, which facilitates
      recruitment on a single site.

      The study requires the recruitment of thirty-two (32) informative participants with cognitive
      complaints.
