  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple myeloma (MM) with chromosome 17 deletion (del(17p) represents one of the most
      dangerous genetic variant of this disease, since it is associated with a high level of
      genomic instability. Del(17p) is present in approximately 10% of patients at diagnosis, and
      its frequency increases with disease evolution. The adverse prognosis of del(17p) has been
      observed in patients treated with conventional chemotherapy and new drugs. Only very few
      studies have suggested an advantage in treating del(17p) MM patients with specific therapies.
      In particular, several recent trials combining lenalidomide plus dexamethasone with a new
      agent, suggested that high risk cytogenetics patients may benefit from newest generation
      drugs. Yet, in all studies, outcome of patients with high risk genetic features have been
      derived from subgroup analyses, with all the limitations of this approach. To date no trial
      has been designed with the specific aim to test genotype-adapted therapies.

      The objective of the present study is to evaluate the combination of
      daratumumab-pomalidomide-dexamethasone (DPd) in relapsed or relapsed/refractory MM patients
      harboring del(17p).

      Treatment of relapsed or relapsed/refractory MM patients harbouring del(17p) is a relevant
      unmet medical need. A clinical trial designed to test a tailored treatment for this patient
      population would be a major improvement. In this perspective the combination DPd seems
      attractive since:

        -  both daratumumab and pomalidomide are therapies not interfering with DNA replication,
           thus not increasing the intrinsic genomic instability of del(17p) plasma cells.

        -  the POLLUX study has shown that daratumumab in combination with lenalidomide is highly
           effective in relapsed and relapsed/refractory MM patients.10

        -  the IFM 2010-02 trial has suggested that pomalidomide may be effective in del(17p)
           patients.

        -  the DPd combination has been successfully tested in MM patients with advanced disease.

      Patients will undergo screening for protocol eligibility within 28 days (4 weeks) of
      enrolment.

      After providing written informed consent to participate in the study, patients will be
      evaluated for study eligibility. It is to note that patients can be enrolled based on the
      presence of del(17p), as per center evaluation. However, the presence of del(17p) should be
      confirmed by the central laboratory (University of Torino laboratory), which will perform the
      test in 5 working days.

      After registration, subjects who meet all the inclusion criteria will be treated according to
      the protocol, only after the presence of del(17p) has been confirmed by the central
      laboratory.

      Treatment period includes administration of 28-day cycles of treatment with DPd until any
      sign of progression or intolerance.

      The response will be assessed after each cycle. The LTFU period will start after development
      of confirmed progressive disease (PD) or treatment interruption due to toxicity. All patients
      are to be followed for survival during the LTFU period every 3 months via telephone or office
      visit.

          -  Myocardial infarction within 6 months before Cycle 1, Day 1, or unstable or
