  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy of barbotage therapy by comparing the
      clinical and sonographic changes in patients that solely receive barbotage to patients
      receiving the standard of care, barbotage with cortisone injection.

    <textblock>
      Calcific tendonitis is a condition caused by calcium deposits building up in a person's
      muscles or tendons. If calcium builds up in an area, a person may feel pain and discomfort
      there. The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy of barbotage therapy (injecting
      and washing the shoulder joint with saline) by comparing the amount of pain, shoulder
      function, and X-Rays in patients with calcific tendonitis that receive the standard of care,
      barbotage with cortisone injection, against barbotage with saline injection. Receiving
      barbotage without cortisone is therefore considered experimental.
