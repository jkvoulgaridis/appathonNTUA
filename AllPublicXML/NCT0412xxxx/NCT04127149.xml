  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an interventional multi-centre study comparing two groups of general practitioners
      with or without an ultrasound scanner over a period of 6 months. The evaluation focuses on
      the management of patients for 8 pathologies:

        -  Pneumonia

        -  Pleural effusion

        -  Renal colic

        -  Hepatic colic or cholecystitis

        -  Subcutaneous abscess or cyst

        -  Fracture of long bones

        -  Intra-uterine pregnancy or extra-uterine pregnancy or miscarriage

        -  Phlebitis The principal hypothesis is that there are fewer complementary exams in the
           group of doctors using ultrasound scanners.

      The secondary hypotheses are:

        -  There is better patient orientation (emergency care, specialist consultation, return
           home) in the group of doctors using the ultrasound scanners.

        -  The global cost of the care is lower in the group of doctors using the ultrasound.

        -  Using ultrasound during the consultation decreases the anxiety of the patient.

        -  Using ultrasound increases the duration of the consultation.

        -  There is no difference between the predicted and the real orientation of the patients.
