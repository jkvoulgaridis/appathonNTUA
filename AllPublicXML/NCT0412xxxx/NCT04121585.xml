      Summary from initial protocol

      Goal: Validation of the HA (hydroxylapatite) coated SL-PLUS™ stem within an observation study

      Study design: prospective, multicenter, observational, non-comparative study

      Study population: 240 consecutive cases (HA-coated implants), 60 cases per study site

      Intervention (if applicable): Implantation of a total hip endoprosthesis Main
      goals/endpoints: Radiological: radiolucent lines, osteolysis, hypo- and hypertrophy of the
      cortex, loosening of the implant or migration; clinical: Harris Hip Score, implant-related
      complications, revisions; patient questionnaires HOOS and EQ-5D

      Type and extent of the risks associated with the study participation as well as benefits for
      the patient:

      All patients will benefit from the hip prostheses without exception. There are no increased
      risks for the patients participating in the study compared to patients who do not
      participate. Normal, necessary follow-up exams will be performed over the course of 10 years.
      These follow-up exams will then be quantitatively evaluated within the scope of the study in
      accordance with a standardized protocol. Accordingly, the benefit for the patients from the
      participation in the study is currently not yet foreseeable.

    <measure>Harris Hip Score</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 10 years after implantation</time_frame>
    <description>The Harris Hip Score (HHS) is a clinician-based outcome measure frequently used for the evaluation of patients following a total hip arthroplasty. The score considers information on pain, function and range of motion. The scale ranges from 0 - 100 whereas, a higher score indicates a favorable outcome.</description>

    <measure>WOMAC Osteoarthritis Index</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 10 yeares after implantation</time_frame>
    <description>The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) is widely used in the evaluation of Hip and Knee Osteoarthritis. It is a self-administered questionnaire consisting of 24 items divided into 3 subscales:
Pain (5 items): during walking, using stairs, in bed, sitting or lying, and standing upright Stiffness (2 items): after first waking and later in the day Physical Function (17 items): using stairs, rising from sitting, standing, bending, walking, getting in / out of a car, shopping, putting on / taking off socks, rising from bed, lying in bed, getting in / out of bath, sitting, getting on I off toilet, heavy domestic duties, light domestic duties</description>

    <measure>EuroQuol-5D questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 10 years after implantation</time_frame>
    <description>EQ-5D is a standardised measure of health status developed by the EuroQol Group in order to provide a simple, generic measure of health for clinical and economic appraisal</description>
