  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to estimate nicotine uptake and assess subjective effects during
      ad libitum use sessions of 4 flavors of JUUL ENDS (also referred to as nicotine salt pod
      system; NSPS) products (i.e., Virginia Tobacco, Mint, Menthol and Mango) with 2 different
      nicotine concentrations. Subjective effects will also be assessed to gain an understanding of
      the user's experience during and after JUUL ENDS product use to evaluate the abuse liability
      of the products. The subject population will consist of healthy adult, male and female
      smokers, 21 to 65 years of age.
