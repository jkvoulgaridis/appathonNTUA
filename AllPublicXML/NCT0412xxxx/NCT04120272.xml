  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Introduction: With the increase of the elderly population, the number of elderly patients
      undergoing surgery is increasing, and postoperative delirium is 11-51% depending on the type
      of surgery. In recent cohort studies have shown that delirium might reduce cognitive function
      and develop dementia.

      Since delirium is difficult to treat, the key to treatment is prevention, and about 40% is
      prevented when prophylactic intervention is applied. However, delirium is difficult to
      diagnose and difficult to predict, therefore, biomarkers are needed to diagnose and
      prevention.

      Exosome and brain efficiency test(electroencephalogram, and pulse wave test) have the
      potential of simple biomarkers that can diagnose postoperative delirium and predict cognitive
      decline.

      Purpose: The purpose of this study is to investigate the risk factors affecting delirium in
      the elderly who have spinal surgery and to search for biomarkers of delirium for early
      detection and prevention of delirium.
