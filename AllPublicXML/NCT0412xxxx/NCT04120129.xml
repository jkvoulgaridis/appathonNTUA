  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to establish the feasibility of using TMS for COFP pain management
      in the interim period before surgery. This will be investigated by comparing the
      non-intervention group's self-reported pain to those who recieved TMS at several timepoints.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants will be randomized to either receive transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS),
      Sham-TMS (a non-therapeutic TMS coil which sounds and feels similar to normal TMS), or
      standard treatment during the weeks of wait time before surgery for chronic orofacial pain
      (COFP). TMS is a noninvasive, painless magnetic device which, when applied to the head for a
      few minutes, has been shown to reduce pain in people with COFP. The sham TMS is a
      sub-therapeutic level of magnetcic stimulation which makes the same sound as normal TMS and
      causes a similar tingling of the skin.

      Both those who receive this new pain intervention and those who do not will be asked to fill
      out a short online survey about their pain at several points during the study. The survey
      takes about 10 minutes to fill out and each of the 5 TMS sessions last 10 minutes.

    <description>A secondary objective is to establish how long the effects of TMS last. This will be done by comparing self-reported pain scores prior to TMS, after TMS and at several timepoints thereafter in those who recieved the treatment. Short-form McGill Pain Questionnaire 2 (SF-MPQ-2) will be used</description>

    <description>Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) is a noninvasive brain stimulation technique which produces short pulsatile magnetic fields (similar to that of an MRI) via two extracranial, figure 8-shaped electric coils which can induce a small, temporary, electric current in the brain currently approved and used for depression.</description>

    <description>The sham TMS does cause some stimulation to the participant so that the participants get the sensation of treatment without any cortical excitation that TMS delivers. The sensation experienced is similar to the muscle twitching or finger tapping experienced by TMS participants.</description>
