      A study to assess efficacy, safety, and tolerability of a single-dose intra-articular
      administration of UBX0101 in patients with moderate to severe painful knee osteoarthritis
      (OA).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-dose, parallel-group study to
      assess the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of a single-dose intra-articular (IA)
      administration of UBX0101 in patients with moderate to severe painful knee osteoarthritis
      (OA).

      Approximately 180 patients will be randomized (1:1:1:1) to one of four treatment groups
      (three dose levels of UBX0101 and Placebo; approximately 45 patients per group), all
      administered by IA route at Week 0. The four treatment groups will be enrolled concurrently.

      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the effect of IA administration of UBX0101
      on the change from baseline to Week 12 of pain in the target knee.

          -  Patients who are ambulatory with a diagnosis of OA of the knee and who have baseline
             pain with a mean of ≥ 4 and ≤ 9 on the 11-point (0-10) average daily pain NRS for at
             least five of seven days during the Screening period.

          -  Kellgren-Lawrence grade of 1-4 on a weight-bearing radiograph of target knee.

          -  Patients aged ≥ 40 and ≤ 85 years.

          -  Patients are permitted but not required to use an oral NSAID, serotonin and

             participation in the study or that could interfere with the study objectives, conduct,
             or evaluation or prevent the patient from fully participating in all aspects of the
             study.

          -  Patients with a body mass index (BMI) ≥40 kg/m2 or a body habitus that precludes the
             MRI.

          -  Patients with fibromyalgia

          -  Systemic autoimmune disease with musculoskeletal involvement or any history of a

             knee within 8 weeks prior to Screening

          -  Patients with a history of traumatic knee injury to the target knee, including, but
             not limited to, patients with meniscal root tear, within 2 years of study entry.
