      The Role of Bariatric Surgeries in Management of Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overall global prevalence of Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease diagnosed by imaging is
      around 25.24%. The highest prevalence of NAFLD is reported from the Middle East 31.79% and
      South America 30.45% whereas the lowest prevalence rate is reported from Africa 13.48%.

      Unlike NAFLD, Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis is more aggressive and is associated with a risk
      of approximately 10 to 29% of progression to cirrhosis within10 years. Therefore, early-stage
      NASH represents a group of patients that is most likely to benefit from treatments in order
      to prevent progression to cirrhosis and its complications. Obesity is the most common and
      well documented risk factor for NAFLD, the majority (&gt;95%) of patients with severe obesity
      undergoing bariatric surgery will have NAFLD. To date, weight loss achieved via lifestyle
      intervention remains the mainstay of treatment of NASH.

      Bariatric surgery contributes to weight loss in two main ways: restrictive procedures and
      malabsorptive procedures.

      In 2018, the AASLD board stated that it is premature to consider foregut bariatric surgery as
      an established option to specifically treat NASH. Accordingly, the effects of bariatric
      surgery on hepatic fibrosis are still unclear. In Egypt there is lack in such type of study
      thus this research will conducted to evaluate the prevalence of NAFLD and NASH in obese
      patients undergoing bariatric surgery and to assess the role of bariatric surgery in
      management of NAFLD related hepatic morbidity in our locality.

    <measure>change in the degree of steatosis by The Controlled Attenuation Parameter Score</measure>
    <time_frame>one year</time_frame>
    <description>change in the degree of steatosis of NAFLD patient Post Bariatric Surgery by CAP Score The Controlled Attenuation Parameter;( CAP™) This is a quantitative measurement expressed in dB/m. It varies continuously between 150 and 400 dB/m. A healthy liver will produce a measurement around 150-200, whilst a fatty liver will be measured at around 300-400 dB/m.
CAP Score ----Steatosis Grade ------Amount of Liver with Fatty Change
238 to 260 dB/m --S1 ----11 to 33%
260 to 290 dB/m---- ---S2 -------34 to 66%
Higher than 290 dB/m ----S3 ---67% or more</description>

    <description>FibroScan® is a non-invasive device that assesses the 'hardness' (or stiffness) of the liver via the technique of transient elastography FibroScan® results range from 2.5 kPa to 75 kPa
Fibrosis score F0 to F1: No liver scarring or mild liver scarring
Fibrosis score F2: Moderate liver scarring
Fibrosis score F3: Severe liver scarring
Fibrosis score F4: Advanced liver scarring (cirrhosis) Assessment of liver fibrosis by TE in NAFLD is shown in table (1) F0 to F1- F2- F3 -F4

    <time_frame>one year</time_frame>
    <description>change in the degree of Fibrosis by NAFLD fibrosis(NFS) score The NFS is calculated based on six readily available parameters (age, BMI, hyperglycemia, platelet count, albumin, and AST/ALT ratio) The NFS is then divided into three groups: &lt; 1.455 which represent F0-F2, between 1.455 and 0.675 represent indeterminate, and &gt; 0.675 represent F3-F4.</description>

    <time_frame>one year</time_frame>
    <description>pre and post operative liver biopsy will be taken to assess the degree of liver steatosis,inflammation and fibrosis Histological re-evaluation will be planned approximately 1 year after surgery for patient with steatohepatitis only(NAS score&gt;3) , The histological variables will be investigated by a single specialized hepatopathologist and will be scored according to the NAFLD Activity Score (NAS recently published by the Pathology Committee of the NASH Clinical Research Network) The NAS score represents the sum of scores for steatosis (0-3), ballooning (0-2), and lobular inflammation (0-3). The score ranges from 0 to 8 with the NAS score of 5-8 considered diagnostic of NASH, the NAS score of 3-4 considered borderline NASH, and the NAS score of 0-2 considered not diagnostic of NASH. Additionally, there is a separate fibrosis stage ranging from 0 to 4 (0: no fibrosis, 1: perisinusoidal or periportal, 2: perisinusoidal and portal/periportal, 3: bridging fibrosis, 4: cirrhosis).</description>
