  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A randomized multiple baseline feasibility trial where participants will start taking
      metformin at one of 3 randomly determined points (3-months, 6-months or 9 months) during the
      12-month trial. All subjects will be on a daily dose of metformin for a minimum of 3 months
      and a maximum of 9 months.
