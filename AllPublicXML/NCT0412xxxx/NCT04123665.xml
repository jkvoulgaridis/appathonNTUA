  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate and compare the gingival health of a test dentifrice
      (0.454% weight by weight [w/w] stannous fluoride) to a negative control dentifrice by
      comparing modified gingival index, bleeding index and plaque index scores.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a single-center, examiner-blinded, randomized, stratified, two-treatment
      parallel group, 24-week clinical study in healthy adult volunteers with moderate gingivitis.
      Eligible participants will be stratified based on gender and baseline mean whole mouth
      modified gingival index (MGI) score (Low: less than or equal to [&lt;=] 2.00/High greater than
      [&gt;]2.00) to ensure a balance in gingivitis across both treatment groups, and then randomized
      into one of two treatment groups. Treatment effect will be evaluated by comparing MGI ,
      bleeding index and plaque index scores after 12 and 24 weeks use of a dentifrice containing
      0.454% w/w stannous fluoride to a negative control dentifrice. During the 24 week treatment
      period, participants will apply a full ribbon of dentifrice to the head of a study toothbrush
      and brush their teeth in their usual manner at home for one timed minute twice daily (morning
      and evening) and record on their study diary completed brushings.

    <measure>Evaluation and Comparison of Gingival Health Measured by Bleeding Index (BI) at 24 Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>At Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>BI-to assess bleeding elicited on probing as a measure of gingival condition. Gingivae were air dried and examiner assessed bleeding using a probe which was gently inserted into gingival crevice to depth of approximately(app)1millimeter(mm)and run around tooth(angle of app60[degrees(deg)] to long axis of tooth), gently stretching epithelium while sweeping from interproximal to interproximal along sulcular epithelium. BI assessed on facial and lingual gingival surfaces of each scorable tooth(7in each arch). 3scores were recorded buccally/labially,3scores lingually/palatally. All scorable teeth in one quadrant were probed first(app30seconds[sec])before recording number of gingival units which bled. Values presented as means across all tooth surfaces with minimum and maximum scores in agreement with minimum and maximum index values(i.e.,0-2).BI score:0=no bleeding after30sec,1=bleeding upon probing after30sec,2=immediate bleeding observed. Lower scores indicate better results.</description>

    <description>Turesky Modification of Quigley Hein Plaque Index-to assess plaque on all gradable teeth. Participants rinsed the plaque in dye solution of 5milliliters(mL)of solution for 10 sec, then expectorated and rinsed with 10 mL of water for 10 sec and then expectorated again. Plaque was assessed with each tooth being divided into 6 areas including mesiofacial, facial, distofacial, mesiolingual, lingual and distolingual surfaces. Values presented as means across all tooth surfaces with minimum and maximum scores in agreement with minimum and maximum index values (i.e.,0-5). Disclosed plaque scored as:0=no plaque, 1=slight flecks of plaque at the cervical margin of the tooth,2=a thin continuous band of plaque (1mm or smaller) at the cervical margin of the tooth, 3=a band of plaque wider than 1mm but covering less than 1/3 of the area, 4=plaque covering at least 1/3 but less than 2/3 of the area,5=plaque covering 2/3 or more of the crown of the tooth.

    <measure>Number of Bleeding Sites After 12 and 24 Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>At Week 12 and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Number of gingival bleeding sites were measured as part of bleeding index via a single examiner using a color-coded periodontal probe. The probe was engaged approximately 1 mm into the gingival crevice. A moderate pressure was used whilst sweeping from interproximal to interproximal along the sulcular epithelium. For each participant, the scoring system used to measure bleeding sites is as follows: 0= no bleeding after 30 sec, 1= bleeding upon probing after 30 sec, 2= immediate bleeding observed. Lower bleeding sites indicate better results.</description>

        <title>Evaluation and Comparison of Gingival Health Measured by Bleeding Index (BI) at 24 Weeks</title>
        <description>BI-to assess bleeding elicited on probing as a measure of gingival condition. Gingivae were air dried and examiner assessed bleeding using a probe which was gently inserted into gingival crevice to depth of approximately(app)1millimeter(mm)and run around tooth(angle of app60[degrees(deg)] to long axis of tooth), gently stretching epithelium while sweeping from interproximal to interproximal along sulcular epithelium. BI assessed on facial and lingual gingival surfaces of each scorable tooth(7in each arch). 3scores were recorded buccally/labially,3scores lingually/palatally. All scorable teeth in one quadrant were probed first(app30seconds[sec])before recording number of gingival units which bled. Values presented as means across all tooth surfaces with minimum and maximum scores in agreement with minimum and maximum index values(i.e.,0-2).BI score:0=no bleeding after30sec,1=bleeding upon probing after30sec,2=immediate bleeding observed. Lower scores indicate better results.</description>

        <title>Evaluation and Comparison of Gingival Health Measured by BI at 12 Weeks</title>
        <description>BI-to assess bleeding elicited on probing as a measure of gingival condition. Gingivae were air dried and examiner assessed bleeding using a probe which was gently inserted into gingival crevice to depth of app 1 mm and run around tooth (angle of app 60 deg to long axis of tooth), gently stretching epithelium while sweeping from interproximal to interproximal along sulcular epithelium. BI assessed on facial and lingual gingival surfaces of each scorable tooth (7in each arch). 3 scores were recorded buccally/ labially, 3scores lingually/ palatally. All scorable teeth in one quadrant were probed first (app 30 sec) before recording number of gingival units which bled. Values presented as means across all tooth surfaces with minimum and maximum scores in agreement with minimum and maximum index values (i.e.,0-2). BI score:0=no bleeding after 30 sec, 1=bleeding upon probing after 30 sec,2=immediate bleeding observed. Lower scores indicate better results.</description>

        <description>Turesky Modification of Quigley Hein Plaque Index-to assess plaque on all gradable teeth. Participants rinsed the plaque in dye solution of 5milliliters(mL)of solution for 10 sec, then expectorated and rinsed with 10 mL of water for 10 sec and then expectorated again. Plaque was assessed with each tooth being divided into 6 areas including mesiofacial, facial, distofacial, mesiolingual, lingual and distolingual surfaces. Values presented as means across all tooth surfaces with minimum and maximum scores in agreement with minimum and maximum index values (i.e.,0-5). Disclosed plaque scored as:0=no plaque, 1=slight flecks of plaque at the cervical margin of the tooth,2=a thin continuous band of plaque (1mm or smaller) at the cervical margin of the tooth, 3=a band of plaque wider than 1mm but covering less than 1/3 of the area, 4=plaque covering at least 1/3 but less than 2/3 of the area,5=plaque covering 2/3 or more of the crown of the tooth.

        <title>Number of Bleeding Sites After 12 and 24 Weeks</title>
        <description>Number of gingival bleeding sites were measured as part of bleeding index via a single examiner using a color-coded periodontal probe. The probe was engaged approximately 1 mm into the gingival crevice. A moderate pressure was used whilst sweeping from interproximal to interproximal along the sulcular epithelium. For each participant, the scoring system used to measure bleeding sites is as follows: 0= no bleeding after 30 sec, 1= bleeding upon probing after 30 sec, 2= immediate bleeding observed. Lower bleeding sites indicate better results.</description>

        <population>Analysis was performed on ITT population [N=91] which included all participants who received study treatment and had at least one post-baseline efficacy measurement. Number analyzed included participants with available data for each specified category.</population>
