      The prevalence of nitrous oxide use in hospitals in Turkey

    <textblock>
      Nitrous oxide has a long history of use in the healthcare field for over 150 years. However,
      this gas is slowly being abandoned for various reasons. The decrease in N2O use is probably
      due to its side effects and negative impact on global warming. Proven side effects include
      irreversible toxic effects on bone marrow, relative or absolute contraindications related to
      neuro and cardiac anesthesia, increased incidence of post-operative nausea and vomiting,
      increased risk of miscarriage in pregnant women (5), the greenhouse effect of nitrous oxide.
      In 2013, B. Husum et al. investigated the frequency of N2O use in public hospitals in
      Scandinavian countries and it was confirmed that N2O use was reduced and limited. According
      to the results of this research, N2O was administered with a volatile anesthetic agent in
      21.5% of general anesthesia applications in Scandinavian countries. N2O was used as the
      second agent in Denmark by 2.4%, Finland by 17%, Iceland by 34.5, Norway by 32.1%, Sweden by
      27.5%. In Turkey there are not enough reports of N2O use prevalence. In this study, we will
      investigate the extent of use and avoidance reasons N2O in Turkey. And we aim creating
      awareness.
