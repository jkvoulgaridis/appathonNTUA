    <textblock>
      The overall objective of this study is to evaluate whether the addition of secondary
      distribution HIV self-test kits (SD-HIVST) to existing partner notification guidelines
      increases the proportion of male partners who access facility-based HIV testing services
      (HTS), when compared to the partner notification strategy alone
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>

      Pregnant women 18 years of age or older who enter antenatal care (ANC) at Chipata Level 1
      Hospital in Lusaka, Zambia will participate.

      HIV-positive and HIV-negative pregnant women will be randomized to one of two groups: partner
      notification alone or partner notification plus secondary distribution of HIV self-test kits
      (SD-HIVST). Women will return to the clinic 30 days after enrollment for an exit visit during
      which time information about their experience with the partner notification strategies will
      be collected. A random sample of women and health care workers will also participate in
      qualitative interviews.
