  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To date, no drug therapy has been approved for primary (PPMS) &amp; secondary (SPMS) progressive
      multiple sclerosis. The urgent need to find new therapies - if possible with minimal side
      effects - led us to the search for the potential therapeutic effects of early harvest olive
      oil. The positive effect of phenol-rich, flavonoid and lignin-based olive oil on the
      modification of intestinal microbe populations and their by-products of metabolism is well
      known, such as the extent of gut-associated lymphoid tissue immune-stimulation due to
      antioxidants, anti-inflammatory and immunoregulatory properties. The aim of this Greek,
      Randomized, Double Blind, Controlled Prospective Study, is to evaluate the effect of
      freshly-pressed extra virgin olive oil in the progression of the cognition in patients
      diagnosed with PPMS or SPMS. Specific inflammatory markers in blood, stool and CSF will be
      detected to confirm the general, beneficial effect of freshly pressed EVOO on the gut
      microbiota, the metabolomic profile and the immune system of patients, as their
      cross-interaction has been shown in many clinical studies. Positive results of this
      mild,nutritional, therapeutic intervention can also lead to the clinical use of these
      biomarkers for both diagnosis and follow up of the patients.

      Study Type: Interventional Study Design: Allocation: Randomized Intervention Model: Parallel
      Assignment Masking: Double Blind (Subject, Investigator) Primary Purpose: Prevention
      OBJECTIVES OF THE TRIAL The objectives of this study are:To investigate the efficacy of
      freshly pressed EVOO as a disease course modifying treatment for primary (PPMS) or secondary
      (SPMS) progressive multiple sclerosis in a phase III double-blind -controlled study in
      objective measurements in patients with primary (PPMS) or secondary (SPMS) progressive
      multiple sclerosis.

      STUDY DESIGN This is a Greek, randomized, double-blind, -controlled study group of
      Freshly-Pressed EVOO + MeDi compared to EVOO + MeDi and to Medi only. Qualifying patients
      will be randomly assigned to receive 50mL of freshly-pressed EVOO or extra virgin olive oil
      or MeDi dietary protocol on a daily basis for 24 months. Patients undergo assessments at
      baseline,12 and 24 months +/- 7 days after beginning treatment.

      Duration: The total study duration will be 30 months. Patients will receive study
      interventions for 24 months.

      Number of Subjects 150 subjects total will be enrolled; 50 in the experimental group (freshly
      pressed EVOO+MeDi); 50 in the Control Group 1(extra virgin olive oil+MeDi) and 50 in control
      Group 2(same dietary habits-MeDi protocol).
