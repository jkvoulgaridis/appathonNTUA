  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to provide an initial assessment of the potential impact DERM could have on
      the number of onward referrals for a face to face dermatologist review and/or biopsy from a
      teledermatology-based service, and to improve the understanding of the patient pathways that
      exist.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      DERM, an Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based diagnosis support tool, has been shown to be able
      to accurately identify melanoma, non-melanoma skin cancers (NMSC) and other conditions from
      historical images of suspicious skin lesions (moles).

      This study aims to establish whether the use of DERM in the patient pathway could reduce the
      number of unnecessary referrals to dermatologist review and/or biopsy.

      Suspicious skin lesions that are due to be photographed for a dermatologist to review, will
      have two additional photographs taken using a commonly available smart phone camera with and
      without a specific lens attachment. The images will be analysed by DERM, and the results
      compared to the clinician's diagnosis (all lesions) and histologically-confirmed diagnosis
      (any lesion that is biopsied).

    <description>Patients attending a Medical Photography facility with at least 1 suspicious skin lesion will be approached to participate in the study. Participants will have an additional macro and dermoscopic image of each suspicious skin lesions suitable for photography. Photographs will be taken by a healthcare professional using an iPhone XR smart phone camera with a DL1 dermoscopic lens attachment. The images will be encrypted and electronically transmitted to Skin Analytics' cloud servers for analysis by DERM. The suspected diagnosis determined by DERM will be compared with dermatologist review and histologically confirmed diagnosis, where obtained. Healthcare resource utilization information and patient satisfaction data will also be collected</description>
