  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A prospective, multi-center, multi-national, randomized controlled trial to evaluate safety
      and effectiveness of endoscopic hemostatic powder, 'Nexpowder' for hemostatic treatments of
      nonvariceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding.

      This study is a prospective, multi-national, multi-center, single blind (for patients),
      controlled investigation planned to evaluate safety and effectiveness of Nexpowder with 352
      subject patients.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This investigational study is designed to compare effectiveness of using the standard-of-care
      hemostatic therapy only, versus the standard-of-care hemostatic therapy plus an additional
      hemostatic treatment using Nexpower for patients with nonvariceal, upper gastrointestinal
      bleeding from ulcers with high-risk stigmata (Forrest classification Ia, Ib, or IIa).

      The primary end-points will be evaluated by assessing the rates of re-bleeding, which occur
      over three (3) days following initial hemostasis achieved with the standard-of-care
      hemostatic therapy.

      Secondary end-points consist of evaluating three items: 1) Ease of use of Nexpowder applied
      for the test group after reaching initial hemostasis, 2) Nexpowder device malfunction and 3)
      safety follow-up to check occurrence of adverse event(s)/re-bleeding at 30-day (+5) time
      point.

      Only the subjects whose initial hemostasis has been achieved will be registered for this
      investigation but those who initial hemostasis has failed to be reached with the
      standard-of-care therapie(s) shall not be registered for this investigation.

    <description>Nexpowder generates gelation-effects when the powder comes into contact with water, forms a physical barrier to control hemorrhage, preserve ulcer sites and thereby demonstrates its effective hemostatic performance. Hydrogels, which turned into gel-formation through water contacts in the gastrointestinal tract protect the wound sites for over 24 hours, are subsequently detached from the lesion, and completely excreted from the patient body system within 3 days.</description>
