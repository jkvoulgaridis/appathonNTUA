      Introduction: The success rate of weight loss maintenance is limited. Therefore, the purpose
      of this study is to investigate the maintenance of weight loss and immunometabolic health
      outcomes after diet-induced weight loss followed by one-year treatment with a glucagon-like
      peptide-1 receptor agonist (liraglutide), physical exercise, or the combination of both
      treatments as compared with placebo in individuals with obesity.

      Methods and analysis: This is an investigator-initiated, randomized, placebo-controlled,
      parallel group trial. The investigators will enroll women and men (age 18 to 65 years) with
      obesity (body mass index 32 to 43 kg/m2) to adhere to a very low-calorie diet (800 kcal/day)
      for eight weeks in order to lose at least 5 % of body weight. Subsequently, participants will
      be randomized in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to one of four study groups for 52 weeks: 1) placebo, 2)
      exercise 150 min/week + placebo, 3) liraglutide 3.0 mg/day, and 4) exercise 150 min/week +
      liraglutide 3.0 mg/day. Re-screening is allowed within the recruitment period.

      The primary endpoint is change in body weight from randomization to end-of-treatment.

      Ethics and dissemination: The trial has been approved by the ethical committee of the Capital
      Region of Denmark (H-16027082) and the Danish Medicines Agency (EudraCT 2015-005585-32). The
      trial will be conducted in agreement with the Declaration of Helsinki and monitored to follow
      the guidelines for good clinical practice. Results will be submitted for publication in
      international peer-reviewed scientific journals.

    <textblock>
      Obesity is associated with increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease and type 2
      diabetes (T2D), along with increased risk of all-cause mortality [1,2]. Obesity management
      guidelines recommends weight loss of more than 5 % of initial body weight to improve
      cardiometabolic risk factors, with greater weight loss producing greater benefits [3,4]. A 5
      to 10 % weight loss improves lipid profile (~20% reduction in triglycerides, ~15 % reduction
      in LDL-cholesterol, ~8 % increase in HDL-cholesterol levels) [1,4,5], reduces systolic and
      diastolic blood pressure (~5 and ~4 mmHg, respectively) [3,6], reduces HbA1c [3,4], and
      improves insulin sensitivity [7-9]. However, weight regain reverse these health benefits
      [10,11]. Furthermore, intentional weight loss is typically followed by a 30 to 50 % regain of
      lost weight within the first year [12-14]. The main biological reasons for the rapid weight
      regain may be that weight loss causes a decrease in total energy expenditure to a degree that
      is greater than predicted from the decrease in fat and lean mass [15,16] in combination with
      increased appetite in the weight-reduced state [17,18].

      Increasing energy expenditure by increasing physical activity is the first-line lifestyle
      modification in the treatment of obesity along with reducing food intake. For exercise
      interventions targeting general public health recommendations (at least 150 min/week of
      moderate intensity aerobic exercise), the associated weight loss is often modest (0-3 %)
      without concomitant calorie restriction [19-21]. However, independent of weight loss,
      increasing physical activity improves body composition, glycemic control, low grade
      inflammatory profile, and cardiorespiratory fitness in individuals with overweight and
      obesity [22-25]. In addition, exercise may preserve lean mass during weight loss [26] and
      thereby counteract the associated decrease in resting metabolic rate [27], which may explain
      the observation that individuals performing regular exercise have less body weight regain
      after weight loss compared to participants that do not exercise [28,29].

      Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is an incretin hormone primarily secreted from
      enteroendocrine L-cells in the gut after food intake. GLP-1 stimulates glucose-dependent
      insulin secretion thereby lowering blood glucose and reduces appetite and thereby food intake
      [30,31]. Treatment for 56 weeks with the GLP-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA), liraglutide (3.0
      mg), as an adjunct to regular diet and physical activity recommendations has been shown to
      improve glycemic control and induce moderate weight loss of 4.0 % in patients with T2D [32]
      and 5.4 % in non-diabetic individuals with overweight or obesity [33] compared to placebo. In
      addition, liraglutide has been shown to maintain a diet-induced weight loss over 56 weeks
      [34] and maintain very low-calorie diet-induced improvements of fasting plasma glucose and
      triglycerides over 52 weeks of weight loss maintenance superior to similar diet-induced
      weight loss maintenance in obese nondiabetic individuals [18].

      Obesity is associated with chronic low-grade inflammation [35,36] which is linked to the
      development of atherosclerosis and insulin resistance [37-39]. Physically active individuals
      have lower inflammatory biomarker concentrations than their inactive counterparts [24],
      possibly explained by antiinflammatory effects of an acute bout of exercise [40] and lower
      levels of visceral adipose tissue [41]. GLP-1 has also emerged as an immunomodulatory agent
      [42,43]. In mice, GLP-1 RA administration reduces macrophage accumulation and inflammatory
      markers in the arterial wall [44], adipose tissue [45], and heart [46]. Similarly, GLP-1 RAs
      have shown antiinflammatory effects in human coronary artery endothelial cells and aortic
      endothelial cells [47]. In humans with T2D, short term GLP-1 RA treatment exert
      antiinflammatory actions, reflected in reduced levels of the macrophage activation molecule
      sCD163 [48] and reduced production of several proinflammatory markers, such as TNF-α, IL1β,
      and IL-6 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells [48,49]. Another study showed no improvement
      of obesity-associated adipose tissue dysfunction in T2D patients after GLP-1RA treatment
      [50]. One year treatment with GLP-1 RAs reduce the inflammation marker, high-sensitivity
      C-reactive protein, in overweight and obese individuals [33] and T2D patients [51]. Notably,
      in patients with T2D and high cardiovascular risk, GLP-1 RAs reduced the rate of occurrence
      of first major cardiovascular event [52,53].

      Thus, both physical activity and GLP-1 RA treatment seem to facilitate weight loss
      maintenance, improve metabolic health, and reduce systemic inflammation. However,
      diet-induced weight loss decreases energy expenditure and increases appetite. The
      investigators hypothesize that the combination of physical activity and liraglutide treatment
      improves weight loss maintenance and immunometabolic health since the decreased energy
      expenditure is targeted with exercise and the increased appetite with liraglutide.

      Objective:

      The objectives of this study are to investigate the maintenance of weight loss and
      immunometabolic health outcomes over 52 weeks with liraglutide treatment, physical exercise,
      and the combination in individuals with obesity, after a very low-calorie diet.

      Endpoints:

      Primary endpoint: The primary endpoint is change in body weight from after the initial weight
      loss phase (baseline/V1) to end of treatment after 52 weeks (end/V3).

      Secondary endpoints: The secondary endpoints are changes in a) body composition (lean/fat
      mass ratio) and b) metabolic health (glucose tolerance, lipid status, waist circumference,
      blood pressure) from V1 to V3.
