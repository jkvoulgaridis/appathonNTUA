  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Almost 50% of all children have at least 1 episode of noisy breathing before the age of 2
      years and almost 25% of these children have more episodes of noisy breathing. The lack of an
      objective technique for diagnosing noisy breathing children often leads to overrated
      diagnosis of &quot;wheezing&quot;, whereas there may be other noisy breathing phenotypes, like
      &quot;rattling&quot;, that don't favor from the same therapeutic treatment. Presumably, different
      underlying pathophysiological mechanisms are involved with different biomarker profiles
      characteristic for different phenotypes. The goal of this study is to optimize the diagnosis
      of noisy breathing infants and toddlers. Children will be followed for a treatment period of
      6 weeks and will visit the paediatrician 3 times (week 0, 3 and 6). During the consultations
      breath sound analysis will be performed and a breath sample and a nasal mucus will be
      collected to analyse biomarker profiles. Both methods for diagnosing noisy breathing infants
      are non-invasive and will be compared to the standard procedure of the paediatrician which
      consists of auscultation and palpation of the chest. An objective and non-invasive method for
      diagnosing noisy breathing infants and toddler will pave the way for more cost-effective and
      personalized prescription of therapies which will increase the quality of life of children
      with noisy breathing.
