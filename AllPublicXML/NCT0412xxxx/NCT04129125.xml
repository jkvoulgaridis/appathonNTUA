    <intervention_model_description>ZOOM Reperfusion Catheters are single lumen catheters that are intended to be used, in conjunction with a vacuum source, to remove thrombus in order to restore blood flow to the brain during an acute ischemic stroke.
The active control treatment consists of using a mechanical thrombectomy device that is FDA cleared to improve patient functional outcome after stroke. Either Trevo® Pro (Stryker) or Solitaire™ (Medtronic) can be used upon physician's discretion.</intervention_model_description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age 18 and older

          2. NIHSS &gt;=6

          3. The operator feels that the stroke can be treated with endovascular thrombectomy
             approaches and the interventionalist estimates that groin puncture can be achieved
             within 24 hours from the onset of symptoms

          4. Pre-event mRS score 0-1

          5. Large vessel occlusion of the internal carotid artery (ICA) or middle cerebral artery
             (MCA)-M1 segments as evidenced by MRA or CTA

          6. ASPECT &gt;=6

          7. Less than 1/3 MCA territory involved, as evidenced by baseline CT or MRI

          8. If stroke onset is within 6-24 hours, perfusion imaging is required to demonstrate a
             small core infarct volume (≤50cc for patients under 80 years old and ≤20cc for
             patients 80 years or older).

          9. Non-contrast CT/CTA or MRI/MRA for trial eligibility performed or repeated at treating
             stroke center or outside medical facility within two hour of treatment initiation.

         10. If indicated, IV t-PA should be administered as soon as possible, but no later than 3
             hours from onset of stroke symptoms (onset time is defined as the last time when the
             patient was witnessed to be at baseline), with investigator verification that the
             subject has received or is receiving the correct IV t-PA dose for the estimated weight
             prior to randomization

         11. Consenting requirements met according to local IRB or ethics committee

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Female known to be pregnant at time of admission

          2. Patient has suffered a stroke in the past 3 months

          3. Presence of an existing or pre-existing large territory infarction

          4. Pre-existing neurological or psychiatric disease that would confound the neurological
             or functional evaluation, e.g. dementia with prescribed anti-cholinesterase inhibitor.

          5. Known history of severe contrast allergy or absolute contraindication to iodinated
             contrast or nickel.

          6. Clinical history, past imaging or clinical judgement suggest that the intracranial
             occlusion is chronic

          7. Life expectancy of less than 6 months prior to stroke onset

          8. Clinical symptoms suggestive of bilateral stroke or stroke in multiple territories

          9. Subject participating in another clinical trial involving an investigational device or
             drug

         10. Known cancer with metastases

         11. Evidence of active systemic infection

         12. Any known hemorrhagic or coagulation deficiency

             Image Exclusion Criteria

         13. Evidence of intracranial hemorrhage on CT/MRI

         14. Core infarct lesion volume &gt;50 cc

         15. CTA or MRA evidence of extracranial carotid stenosis requiring treatment for
             intracranial access

         16. Excessive vascular access tortuosity that will likely prevent endovascular access

         17. Intracranial stent implanted in the same vascular territory that would preclude the
             safe deployment/removal of the thrombectomy devices.

         18. Occlusions in multiple vascular territories (e.g., bilateral anterior circulation, or
             anterior circulation/vertebrobasilar system) as confirmed on CTA/MRA, or clinical
             evidence of bilateral strokes or strokes in multiple territories

         19. Significant mass effect with midline shift as confirmed on CT/MRI

         20. Evidence of intracranial tumor (except small meningioma defined as ≤ 3cm and
             asymptomatic) as confirmed on CT/MRI
