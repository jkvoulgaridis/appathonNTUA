  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Monitored anesthesia care (MAC) is currently the dominant method of endoscopic sedation for
      approximately one third of all US gastroenterologists. The popularity and success of MAC can
      be ascribed to many factors including increased patient turnover and improved patient
      satisfaction. Patients undergoing MAC maintain spontaneous breathing and routinely receive
      supplemental oxygen. In case of airway obstruction, additional airway adjuncts may be used
      such as supraglottic airway devices including oropharyngeal airway, nasopharyngeal airway,
      laryngeal mask, etc. A nasopharyngeal airway is a simple device that can be conveniently
      inserted into the supraglottic airway to secure an open passage. This is a randomized
      controlled trial designed to evaluate the efficacy of the routine use of nasopharyngeal
      airway in preventing airway obstruction during deep sedation. Patients undergoing
      gastrointestinal endoscopy under monitored anesthesia care using target-controlled infusion
      of propofol at AUBMC will be randomly and equally apportioned to the nasopharyngeal group
      (group A) or control group (group B). Episodes of desaturation, airway maneuvers, hemodynamic
      instability, adverse events related to NPA insertion, duration of the procedure, and the
      anesthetic dose will be recorded. The satisfaction of the anesthesiologist,
      gastroenterologist, and patient will be scored. The aim of this study is first to assess the
      efficacy of NPA in reducing respiratory events, and second, to identify the safety of this
      device as well as patient, gastroenterologist and anesthesiologist satisfaction.
