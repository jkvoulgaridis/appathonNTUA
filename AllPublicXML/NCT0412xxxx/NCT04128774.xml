  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: This project elaborates on a novel finding of the investigators that has not yet
      been reported in literature, namely the presence of elevated levels of atypical B cells in
      participants with glioblastoma. ln the period 2015 2018 the investigators analysed the blood
      immune subset composition of a cohort of 180 participants undergoing neurosurgery. The most
      relevant finding was the presence of an abnormally elevated level of B cells in the blood of
      the great majority of participants with glioblastoma. These B cells may be involved in the
      immunosuppression associated with glioblastoma that makes this tumor refractory to
      immunotherapy. Multiple regression analysis indicated that the increase in the frequency of
      atypical B cells in participants' peripheral blood was related with the administration of
      dexamethasone prior to surgery. However, this study design did not allow the investigators to
      address the causality of the relationship between dexamethasone and atypic B cell
      dysregulation. Alternative treatments to dexamethasone exist.

      Objective: To investigate the effect of dexamethasone in the dysregulation of atypic B cells
      in participants with glioblastoma.

      Study design: Observational case control pilot study with 20 participants (10 per group).

      Study population: Newly diagnosed participants with glioblastoma. Intervention (if
      applicable): Observational study. Main study parameters/endpoints: Changes in the immune
      subset composition and functionality in the peripheral blood of participants with
      glioblastoma upon administration of dexamethasone for neurological signs of peritumoral edema
      (oral dexamethasone).

      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group
      relatedness: The investigators will collect blood (28 ml) during the first visit and again
      (28 ml) at the time of surgery (2 weeks Â± 3 days). There will not be additional site visits,
      physical examinations or any other tests, questionnaires. Blood collection is only a minor
      discomfort and it does not represent any additional risk.
