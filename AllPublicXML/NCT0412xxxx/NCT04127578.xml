  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Study PRV-PD101 is a Phase 1/2a, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, sham
      procedure-controlled, ascending dose, first in-human study that will evaluate the safety of
      intra-cisternal PR001A administration in patients with moderate to severe Parkinson's disease
      with at least 1 pathogenic GBA1 mutation. Two escalating dose cohorts are planned (low dose
      and high dose, with a sham procedure as control). The duration of the study is 5 years.
      During the first year, patients will be evaluated for the effect of PR001A on safety,
      tolerability, immunogenicity, biomarkers, and clinical efficacy measures. Patients will
      continue to be followed for an additional 4 years to continue to monitor safety as well as
      selected biomarker and efficacy measures.
