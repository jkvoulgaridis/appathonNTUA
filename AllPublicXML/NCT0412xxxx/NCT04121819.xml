  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) is a rare, heterogeneous histiocytic disorder occurring
      in patients of all ages from neonates to the elderly. The current standard treatment protocol
      for children with de novo multisystem LCH is vinblastine plus prednisone. This regimen has
      never been proven effective for adults in a prospective study, since the only prospective
      trial evaluating the efficacy of a vinblastine/prednisone regimen in adults was prematurely
      closed due to unacceptable toxicities. A retrospective study showed an advantage for
      cytarabine monotherapy compared with vinblastine/prednisone in bone LCH patients. This phase
      2, prospective, single-center study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of
      cytarabine monotherapy in adults with newly diagnosed MS-LCH or LCH with multifocal single
      system (SS-m) involvement.
