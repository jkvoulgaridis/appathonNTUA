    <textblock>
      Lower limb peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a common, important manifestation of systemic
      atherosclerosis. Stenosis or occlusions in the superficial femoral artery (SFA) may result in
      intermittent claudication or even critical ischemia, which may be treated by balloon
      angioplasty with or without stenting .

      Atherosclerotic disease in the femoropopliteal (FP) artery consists of perfusion to the legs
      and feet. Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) has been routinely used to manage FP
      artery disease and is recommended as an alternative to surgical bypass. Recently, newer
      endovascular approaches such as covered stent, drug-eluting balloon (DEB), drug-eluting stent
      (DES), or catheter based atherectomy have been introduced as treatment options for FP artery
      disease. Nevertheless, FP artery-in stent restenosis (ISR) is still a major challenge with
      endovascular therapy .

      Although the use of peripheral arterial stents brought about a dramatic improvement in
      patients' clinical and procedural outcomes, the long-term outcome of stent implantation
      remains significantly constrained by the risk of developing in-stent restenosis (ISR) over
      time.

      Advancements in endovascular stent technology have addressed limitations associated with
      conventional percutaneous transluminal balloon angioplasty in patients with chronic
      peripheral arterial disease (PAD) of the lower limbs, such as elastic recoil,residual
      stenosis and flow-limiting dissection . However, a considerable proportion of patients with
      PAD treated with stenting will require secondary interventions due to in-stent restenosis
      (ISR), which is particularly common in long and complex lesions ISR refers to loss of luminal
      volume from an ingrowth of cells, extracellular matrix, and thrombus within the cylinder of
      the stented artery and 5-mm margins proximal and distal to the stent. ISR has been reported
      to occur in 18-40% of patients undergoing stenting in the femoropopliteal segment within the
      first year of treatment .

      The treatment of ISR is one of the major challenges in endovascular therapy for PAD. The
      treatment options for ISR include standard balloon angioplasty with or without repeat
      stenting (using bare-metal stents, stent grafts or drug-eluting stents), drug-coated or
      cutting balloon angioplasty, cryoplasty and directional or laser atherectomy .
