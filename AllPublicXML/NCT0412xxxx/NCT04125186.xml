      To estimate the prevalence of nocturia due to nocturnal polyuria (NP) in the US and describe
      the demographic and clinical characteristics as well as the burden of illness in participants
      with nocturia due to NP.

    <measure>Prevalence of nocturia due to NP, NP with overactive bladder (OAB), NP with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), and NP with BPH/OAB</measure>
    <time_frame>Between July 2019 and June 2020</time_frame>
    <description>Nocturia due to NP will be derived using data of participants who completed the 3-day bladder diaries. Nocturnal polyuria was defined when nocturnal urine production proportional to daytime urine production was greater than threshold 0.33 (Nocturnal Polyuria index [NPi]). Prevalence will be calculated using number of participants with nocturia due to NP, in the numerator (overall and by relevant strata [e.g., by age/race/gender categories]), with publicly-available estimates of the US population in the denominator (overall and for relevant strata). In addition, the prevalence of NP with OAB, NP with BPH, and NP with BPH/OAB will also be estimated.</description>

    <description>The burden measures (including health-related quality of life [HRQL], work productivity, fatigue, sleep, and depression as assessed through EpiNP survey and bladder diary) in participants with nocturia due to NP, NP with OAB, NP with BPH, and NP with BPH/OAB (overall and by relevant strata [e.g., by age/race/gender categories]) will be presented.</description>

    <description>Before using 3-day bladder diary in main part, the responders of the baseline EpiNP survey were stratified by three subgroups: all respondents who report ≥2 voids/night, randomly selected cohort of respondents reporting 0 and 1 void/night. Prevalence will be calculated using number of participants with nocturia due to NP across the subgroups of respondents, in the numerator, with publicly-available estimates of the US population in the denominator.</description>

    <description>After providing consent, participants will complete web-based baseline EpiNP survey.

    <description>The survey takes approximately 20 to 30 minutes to complete, and consists of the following: Short Form Health Survey version 2.0 (SF-12v2.0); Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms (LUTS) Tool; Patient Perception of Bladder Condition (PPBC); Self-report Medical History and Current Medication Form; Nocturia Impact Diary (NID); Disease-Specific Healthcare-Seeking Behavior and Treatment; Epworth Sleepiness Questionnaire (ESS); Patient Reported Outcome Measurement Information System Fatigue-Short Form version 1.0 (PROMIS F-SFv1.0); Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-8); Work Productivity and Activity Index (WPAI-SHP); Sexual health questions; lifestyle and sociodemographic questions; additionally, only men will complete the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS).</description>

    <description>It consists of four components: measurement of waist and neck circumference, daily voiding diary (to assess voiding patterns, including frequency, volume, associated urgency, and incontinence episodes over a 24-hour period), NID (to assess nocturia impact), and assessment of morning sleepiness for 3 consecutive days and nights (including the morning of the fourth day).</description>

        The study will be conducted in two parts: (1) Pilot part: approximately 30 participants who
        have a physician diagnosis of nocturia. Participants will be recruited by one clinical site
        in the US. (2) Main part: a sample of 10,000 participants who are representative of the
        general population in the US stratified by age (≥30), gender, and race. Participants will
        be recruited by e-mail from a web-based panel of people that have previously opted in to be
        contacted for research studies.
