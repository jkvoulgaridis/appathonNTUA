  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pain remains a common and frequently debilitating symptom, particularly during adulthood of
      Fibrous Dysplasia/McCune-Albright Syndrome (FD/MAS). For many FD/MAS patients, the amount of
      pain perceived is not commensurate with the level of detectable musculoskeletal pathology.
      Using a combination of clinical and biological assessments, this investigation aims to
      understand what drives pain in FD/MAS.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In Fibrous Dysplasia/McCune-Albright Syndrome (FD/MAS), healthy bone tissue and marrow is
      replaced with pre-osteoblastic, fibrous tissue, yielding skeletal deformities and an
      increased propensity towards fracture, musculoskeletal weakness and bone pain. Despite the
      frequent use of pharmacological and non-pharmacological analgesic strategies, pain in FD
      remains common and frequently debilitating, particularly during adulthood. Moreover, for many
      patients there is a discordance between perceived pain levels and detectable musculoskeletal
      pathology. To elucidate the mechanism underlying pain in FD/MAS patients, investigators at
      the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR), National Center for
      Complementary and Integrative Heath (NCCIH) and Boston Children's Hospital (BCH) aim to probe
      three inter-related domains that are projected to underlie pain experience(s) in FD/MAS
      patients. These include (i.) the presence of maladaptive central nervous system processes
      that amplify afferent pain or somatosensory signals, and also facilitate persistent pain;
      (ii.) aberrant interplay between neurological and musculoskeletal systems; (iii.) a mental
      health status shaped by the overall burden of living with FD and (iv.) the influence of
      childhood, FD-related complications on adulthood pain phenotypes. To investigate these four
      domains hypothesized to underlie FD pain as well as inform on the disconnect between pain and
      FD disease burden, the investigators will employ methods that complement routine clinical
      evaluation and diagnostic tests (i.e., 18F-NaF PET/CT or 18F-FDG PET/CT) such as
      neuroimaging, musculoskeletal MRI and such as neuroimaging, musculoskeletal MRI and
      assessment of inflammatory and pain mediator expression in blood samples.

    <description>During evoked pain fMRI, noxious pressure and heat stimuli will be applied in the two anatomical sites noted above. During fMRI data acquisition, a total of 5 pressure stimulations and 5 heat stimulations will be delivered. Both types of pain stimuli will be applied in a 36/17-sec off/on cycle. The off-condition will correspond to a baseline temperature of 35C and the on condition will match the subject-specific and site-specific 7/10 pressure and heat pain thresholds defined during QST procedures. VAS pain ratings associated with evoked pain stimulation will be collected at the end of each scan. The investigators will also explore the structural properties of the CNS by implementing high-resolution anatomical MRI (gray matter volumes) and diffusion tensor imaging (white matter pathway integrity). All CNS imaging will take approximately 50-60 minutes to complete</description>

    <description>Musculoskeletal imaging of the affected lower extremity. Patients will be allowed to watch a movie during data acquisition. The following MRI procedures will be completed in order to identify soft tissue lesions in active or painful regions. Fast spin echo (FSE) T2 fat saturated, T1 weighted MRI, FSE proton density MRI, Short-TI Inversion Recovery (STIR), Diffusion weighted MRI (DW-MRI) and 3D Double Echo Steady State (DESS) will be collected. All musculoskeletal MRI will take approximately 30 minutes to complete.</description>

    <description>Data will be collected 30 min after the intravenous administration of 18F-FDG with an expected average dose of approximately 200 MBq. CT data will be collected at a low-dose to minimize radiation exposure. Patients will be positioned supine head-first with arms on the side. The investigators project whole body data to be collected, but in some cases, the field of view may be limited to the patient's skull to below the knees. The data acquisition period is expected to last between 15-30 minutes and total radiation dose will be ~3-4 mSv.</description>
