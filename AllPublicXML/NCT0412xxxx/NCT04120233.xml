  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      MW01-2-151SRM (=MW151), a small molecule, is being developed for the treatment of cognitive
      disorders. The development program is based on nonclinical evidence that MW151 improves
      neurocognitive outcomes in animal models of radiation-induced cognitive impairment,
      Alzheimer's disease, and other central nervous system (CNS) disorders.

      The present study will provide safety and pharmacokinetic (PK) information on single
      ascending doses to support decisions for continued clinical development.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this trial is to assess the safety and tolerability of single
      ascending doses of MW151 when administered orally to healthy adults.

      Subjects will be screened prior to inpatient admission. Subjects will be admitted to the
      inpatient clinic on the day prior to dosing (Day -1) and will remain in the unit until
      discharge on Day 3. A follow-up visit will be done on Day 7. A single dose of study drug or
      placebo will be administered on Day 1. Forty healthy adult male and female subjects will be
      randomly assigned to one of 5 dose cohorts (8 subjects each). Each subject will receive a
      single dose of MW151 (10-160mg) or placebo under fasted conditions.

      Following a review of safety and tolerability data for the first 24 hours of dosing in each
      cohort (including reported adverse events (AEs), physical examination findings, clinical
      laboratory results, vital signs, and electrocardiograms (ECGs), the remaining 6 subjects will
      be randomized in a 5:1 ratio. Dosing of the remaining subjects in a cohort may proceed after
      review of sentinel subject safety data collected during the first 24 hours of dosing and
      determination that no stopping rules are met. The remaining subjects in each cohort will be
      dosed sequentially, not simultaneously.
