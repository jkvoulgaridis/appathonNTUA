  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the MARC-2 study is to investigate the relation of the QRS area, determined by
      vectorcardiography, and response to Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy (CRT) in patients with
      a wide QRS complex and without a typical left bundle branch block; the interrelationship as
      well as the potential predictive power of this biomarker, as well as other clinical
      biomarkers on a hierarchal composite endpoint (death, heart failure hospitalizations, heart
      failure complaints and cardiac function) will be evaluated.

      The main biomarker that is studied is the QRS area, but also other electrocardiographic,
      echocardiographic markers, blood markers and clinical markers will be studied.

  <detailed_description>

      For the purpose described in the brief summary, the MARC-2 study investigators have set an
      aim of including 800 patients in 2 inclusion years, in 30 centres accross Europe and Israel.
      Inclusion will be general patients indicated for (de novo or upgrade) implantation a
      (Medtronic) CRT-pacemaker or -ICD, as according to current ESC heart failure guidelines.
      Exclusion criteria are, age below 18 years, (planning) childbearing, baseline &gt; 5% RV-pacing,
      listing for transplantation or inotropic dependency, structural heart disease for which
      invasive therapy is pending, or inability/unwillingness to sign written informed consent. All
      QRS morphologies, with duration &gt;/= 130ms are included because multiple LBBB definitions
      exist and excluding patients on one definition will leave room for questions about the
      definitions used. (Bio)markers that are collected are
      electrocardiographic/vectorcardiographic/echocardiographic/blood-/CMR/ and device-based
      parameters that have shown prior association to outcomes in CRT, with special attention to
      vectorcardiographic QRS area. The primary endpoint will be a hierarchal (Packer) score of
      collected heart failure related endpoints including death/LVAD/cardiac transpland/heart
      failure hospitalizations/echocardiographic remodelling and NYHA improvement. Follow-up for
      clinical endpoints will be 12 months; with echocardiographic follow-up at 6 months. Clinical
      endpoints are subject to adjudication committee assessment. Core-labs exist to assess
      electrocardiographic, echocardiographic and CMR-data.

        The study group to be recruited will consist of heart failure patients (NYHA I-IV), male
        and female, with a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF&lt;/=35%) and ventricular
        dyssynchrony (QRS&gt;/=130ms) as measured prior to implantation of a CRT device. Each study
        subject receives a CRT device with a class I or II indication according to the current CRT
        ESC/AHA guidelines.
