             ECOG performance status of 3 may be included if the Investigator determines that
             removal of pleural fluid would improve their performance status to 2 or better.

          4. Life expectancy of at least 8 weeks.

          5. Age ≥18 years and ≤ 75 years;.

               2. Prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time ≤1.5 times the upper
                  limit of normal (ULN);

               3. Absolute neutrophil count ≥1,500 μL;

               4. Hemoglobin ≥8 g/dL (transfusion and erythropoietic agents are allowed). In case
                  there is existence of active bleeding or other persistent condition of either
                  increased destruction or impaired production of erythrocytes, which may require
                  repeated transfusion or erythropoietic treatment, the eligibility must be
                  discussed with the Sponsor on a case by-case basis prior to randomization.

               5. Ablumin≥35g/L

          8. Adequate renal function, defined as serum creatinine ≤2.0 times ULN and creatinine
             clearance &gt;50 mL/minute.

          9. Adequate liver function, defined as:

               1. Aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase ≤2.0 times ULN for
                  patients without liver metastases, or ≤5 times ULN in the presence of liver
                  metastases;

               2. Bilirubin ≤2.0 times ULN, unless patient has known Gilberts syndrome.

         10. Female patients of childbearing potential (excluding women who have undergone surgical
             sterilization or are menopausal, defined as no menstrual periods for 1 year or more
             without any other medical reasons) are eligible if they have negative serum pregnancy
             test result 7 days before the first dose of SCB-313 and are willing to use an
             effective method of birth control/contraception to prevent pregnancy until 6 months
             after discontinuation of SCB-313.

         11. Both men and women of reproductive potential must agree to use effective contraception
             during the study and for 6 months after discontinuation of SCB 313.

         12. Note: Contraceptive methods that are considered highly effective areas follows: total

          2. Any anti-tumor drug other than the systemic anti-tumor therapy that the subject has
             stably used and any treatment that may have an effect on the control of pleural
             effusions. Prior therapy with monoclonal antibody should be stopped per Investigators
             judgement making sure delayed side effects will not interfere with the DLT evaluation
             period after SCB-313 therapy.

         10. Major surgery (open procedures) within 4 weeks prior to enrollment.

         11. Patient with ileus within 30 days prior to Screening.

         15. Previous treatment with a TRAIL-based therapy or death receptor 4/5 agonist therapy.
