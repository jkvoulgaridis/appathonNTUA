  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In two research projects a comprehensive prehospital telemedicine system was developed and
      general feasibility as well as impact on guideline adherence were evaluated. These results
      allowed stepwise implementation into medical routine care.

      All steps and milestones from the research idea to implementation were analyzed and evaluated
      descriptively in this study. Using a pre-post intervention analysis the systemic effects of
      the implementation on change in emergency medical resource utilization were analyzed.

    <textblock>
      In two interdisciplinary research projects a comprehensive prehospital telemedicine system
      was developed and general feasibility as well as impact on guideline adherence were
      evaluated. Feasibility and general safety were demonstrated. These results allowed stepwise
      implementation into medical routine care during a one year phase. During implementation
      positive effects on guideline adherence were found. Despite positive results there are many
      barriers that prevent implementation of research projects into routine medical care.
      Therefore, the current study evaluated and interpreted all steps and milestones from the
      research idea to implementation and evaluated them descriptively. Using a pre-post
      intervention analysis the systemic effects of the implementation on change in emergency
      medical resource utilization were analyzed. Resource utilization of physician staffed
      emergency medical service units was compared between a pre-implementation period (12 months,
      April 2013 - March 2014) and a post-implementation period (12 months, April 2015 - March
      2016). During the pre-implementation period only standard care was available.

      Inclusion criteria: All emergency medical service (EMS) missions in both periods.

      Data sources: Electronic health records of the EMS missions (data pseudonymity) and database
      of the regional EMS dispatch center.

        Pre-intervention period:

        Only standard care was provided. No patient data was obtained, only number of emergency
        calls and used resources were analyzed.

        Post-intervention period:

        Evaluation of conducted medical procedures in patients who received telemedical support
        (after given verbal consent). Number of emergency calls and used resources were compared to
        the pre-intervention period.
