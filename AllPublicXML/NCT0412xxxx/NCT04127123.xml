    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation is a serious public health issue that affects over 5 million Americans in
      whom it may cause skipped beats, dizziness, stroke and even death. This study seeks to
      improve our understanding of the causes of atrial fibrillation and to design new and more
      effective therapy for this heart rhythm disorder.

      This project will focus on the development of a novel paradigm for electrophysiologic data
      analysis and interpretation using cloud-based computing resources and mobile technology.
      Currently, electrophysiologic data gathered during a procedure is analyzed by the operator
      using multiple separate desk-based computer systems in the electrophysiology laboratory. The
      investigators propose that advances in cloud-based computing resources and network
      connectivity should apply a mobile paradigm to apply to invasive electrophysiologic
      procedures.

      This project will provide proof-of-concept that open-access software the investigators have
      developed and made available online could be used, via a mobile phone interface, to identify
      sites in the heart where therapy is effective. At no time will patient therapy be guided by
      this system. The investigators will pursue therapy using only clinical means. In parallel, a
      double-blinded team will analyze data in real time using our online software visualized on a
      smartphone. Only when the case is concluded will the data be unblinded, to determine if the
      mobile system was accurate in real time.

      Thus, development and testing of the cloud-based computing system is designed only to
      establish feasibility of the paradigm, followed by improvement of computational modeling
      algorithms. The data that is collected will add to the investigators' existing unique
      catalogue of multimodal (structural, clinical, and electrophysiologic) data.

      The importance of this novel paradigm is to move from analyzing large volumes of data in
      isolation to creating a mobile platform, and to allow scalability to increase access, such as
      to underdeveloped medical centers.

        Subjects will be men and women of any ethnicity aged 21-80 years undergoing ablation at
        Stanford of AF. Patients will have failed or be intolerant of ≥ 1 anti-arrhythmic drug or
        not willing to accept antiarrhythmic drug therapy. 50 patients will be enrolled at Stanford
        University over 1-2 years.
