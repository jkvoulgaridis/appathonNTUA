  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of VIB4920
      (formerly MEDI4920) in adult participants with Sjögren's Syndrome (SS).

    <textblock>
      The study will enrol 2 SS populations: Population 1 will include participants with moderate
      to high systemic disease activity defined by European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR)
      Sjögren's Syndrome Disease Activity Index (ESSDAI) &gt;= 5; Population 2 will include
      participants with moderate to severe subjective symptoms defined by EULAR Sjögren's Syndrome
      Patient Reported Index (ESSPRI) score &gt;= 5 and residual stimulated salivary flow but with
      mild systemic disease activity defined by ESSDAI score &lt; 5. This study will include 3
      periods: screening (4 weeks), treatment period (40 Weeks) and follow-up period (12 weeks). In
      the treatment period, participants from each of the populations will be randomized at 1:1
      ratio to receive intravenous (IV) dose of VIB4920 or placebo (Stage I). After completion of
      Stage I, participants randomized to VIB4920 in Stage I will receive placebo and participants
      randomized to placebo in Stage I will receive VIB4920 (Stage II). Participants who had study
      drug discontinuation will not be eligible for treatment during Stage II. All participants
      will be followed for at least 12 weeks after their last dose of study drug administration.
