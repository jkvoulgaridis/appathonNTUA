  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The LinguaFlex™ Tongue Retractor (LTR) is an investigational medical device that is inserted
      into the tongue to prevent it from moving backward during sleep. This helps to keep the
      airway open during sleep so that the tongue doesn't block the airway and stop breathing or
      narrow it enough to cause snoring. This study will monitor the effectiveness of the LTR
      device in the reduction of Obstructive Sleep Apnea over the course of a one-year treatment
      period.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study design is a multi-site, prospective, open-label, non-randomized, single-arm
      clinical study to test the efficacy of the LinguaFlex Tongue Retractor for the treatment of
      moderate to severe Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) (AHI ≥15 at baseline) in adult subjects in
      twelve (12) months of continuous use. The study will include three (3) investigational sites
      that will implant a minimum of sixty (60) subjects with the LTR. No single site is to perform
      more than 25 implants. After informed consent is obtained, eligible subjects (adults who have
      moderate to severe OSA) will be screened for study inclusion. The screening will consist of a
      Polysomnography (PSG) completed within two (2) months of inclusion in the study to confirm
      the diagnosis of moderate to severe OSA, an Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) assessment,
      Snoring Self-Assessment (SOS) with bed partner input (SBPS), assessment of pain, speech and
      swallowing, and a physical examination. The screening data will be reviewed by the Sponsor's
      designated study monitor to confirm and approve that inclusion criteria are fully met.
      Failure to meet all inclusion criteria will be designated as a screen failure and the
      subject's enrollment will be terminated. Participation in the study is voluntary. Subjects
      may withdraw at any time during the study. Reasons for the withdrawal will be recorded and
      entered into the clinical study report. Any subject who withdraws from the study for any
      reason will have the device removed and will undergo a Post Device Removal Follow-Up within
      30 days (-7/+ 15) of device removal.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Responder to Therapy</measure>
    <time_frame>One Year</time_frame>
    <description>Determine the responder rate to therapy. A responder is defined as a subject who experiences a ≥ 50% reduction in AHI from baseline and has an AHI &lt; 20 at the 12-month follow-up visit. Subjects with an AHI ≤ 20 at baseline will be considered a responder if a 50% reduction in AHI is achieved from baseline.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS)</measure>
    <time_frame>One Year</time_frame>
    <description>Determine the change in Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) from the baseline control measurement and determine the proportion of study subjects that achieve an ESS value of ≤ 10 at the twelve-month follow-up. ((ESS is a validated instrument that rates a subject's daytime sleepiness and is commonly used in clinical evaluation and management of OSA as a quality of life measurement. Scores range from 0 to 24, with lower scores indicating greater functioning. An ESS &lt; 10 is considered normal subjective sleepiness.)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Oxygen Desaturation Index (ODI) Responder</measure>
    <time_frame>One Year</time_frame>
    <description>Determine the Oxygen Desaturation Index (ODI) responder rate at the twelve-month follow-up visit. An ODI responder is defined as a subject which demonstrates at least a 25% reduction in ODI from the baseline control measurement at the 12-month follow-up visit. Change in ODI will be reported as a percentage change from baseline for each subject as well as the mean percentage change for the entire cohort.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of Life Metric - Pain</measure>
    <time_frame>At each follow-up visit over the course of 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Examine the tolerance and comfort of the implanted LTR. Pain will be assessed at each follow-up visit using a 10 point Visual Analog Scale (0 no pain - 10 worst pain) and will be compared to the baseline measurement.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of Life Metric - Speech and Swallowing</measure>
    <time_frame>At each follow-up visit over the course of 1 year.</time_frame>
    <description>Examine the tolerance and comfort of the implanted LTR. Comfort with speech and swallowing will be assessed using the Performance Status Scale for Head and Neck Cancer Patients (PSS-HN). This scale consists of three individual scores for Normalcy of Diet, Eating in Public and Understanding of Speech. In each case a score of 100 indicates normal function and 0 indicates the most limited function.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of Life Metric - Snoring</measure>
    <time_frame>At each follow-up visit over the course of 1 year.</time_frame>
    <description>Examine the change in snoring from the baseline control measurement. Snoring will be assessed using the Snore Outcome Survey (SOS) and the Spouse/Bed Partner Survey (SBPS). The SOS is a series of 8 questions with a score range of 0 - 34; with 0 representing no snoring and 34 representing the worst possible snoring. The Spouse Bed Partner Survey is a series of 3 questions with a score range of 0 - 12; with a score of 0 representing no snoring and 12 the worst possible snoring.</description>

    <intervention_name>LinguaFlex Tongue Retractor (LTR)</intervention_name>
    <description>The LinguaFlex Tongue Retractor (LTR) is a small, flexible, implanted tongue retaining device that prevents the backward movement of the tongue during sleep. The LTR's flexible shaft and a nubbed tether passes through the center of the tongue beneath the tongue blade (frenulum area) and connects to a disc (head) that rests on the external surface of the tongue base mucosa. Underneath the tongue, on the external surface of the frenulum, a small anchor secures the shaft that can be adjusted to tension the LTR to maximize therapeutic effect and maintain comfort.</description>
