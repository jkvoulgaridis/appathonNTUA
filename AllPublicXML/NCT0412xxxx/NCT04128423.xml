  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Phase 1 study is designed to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and
      preliminary efficacy of AMV564 alone and in combination with Pembrolizumab in patients with
      advanced solid tumors.

      AMV564-301 is a Phase 1, open-label, multicenter dose-escalation with expansion trial in
      patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors. In the dose-escalation portion of
      the study, cohorts of patients will receive AMV564 alone or in combination with Pembrolizumab
      at increasing dose levels to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or the
      recommended dose for expansion. In the expansion portion of the study, one or more cohorts of
      patients will receive AMV564 at the MTD or recommended dose to further evaluate safety,
      tolerability, and clinical activity.
