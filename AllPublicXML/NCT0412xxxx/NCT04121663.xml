    <textblock>
      This clinical trial compares the clinical effects of rotator cuff injury and/or shoulder
      instability surgery with the full suture anchor made by Hangzhou Ruijian Mastine Medical
      Equipment Co., Ltd. and the polyether ether ketone bone anchor system made by Arthrex, Inc.,
      USA, and evaluates the safety and effectiveness of the experimental device in clinical
      application
