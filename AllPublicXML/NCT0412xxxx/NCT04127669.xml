  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Following stroke, a recovery process is promptly initiated, which leads to a partial
      rehabilitation. However, a number of disabling residual symptoms may persist for years and
      include mental fatigue, depression, cognitive deficits, neurological problems and more. In
      the lack of an effective treatment these symptoms will lead to major consequences for the
      individual and the surrounding society. OSU6162 has in earlier clinical studies of stroke
      patients shown evidence of a favorable effect on residual symptoms, especially mental
      fatigue, together with a mild side effect profile.

      In this phase II, randomized, placebo-controlled, two-armed study, a 16 week OSU6162
      treatment will be compared to an equally long placebo treatment in patients with residual
      symptoms following stroke.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Main objectives of this study are to evaluate the efficacy and safety of OSU6162 compared to
      placebo with respect to treatment response in post stroke patients.

      Endpoints:

      Primary endpoint is Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGI-C) after 16 weeks of treatment.

      Secondary endpoints are:

      CGI-C score after 4, 8 and 12 weeks of treatment. FAI; MFS; FSS; BDI; SF-36 scores after 4,
      8, 12 and 16 weeks of treatment. Correlation between plasma concentration of OSU6162 and
      therapeutic response after 4 and 16 weeks of treatment.

      Safety variables: AE/SAE, physical and neurological examinations, vital signs (blood pressure
      and puls) and laboratory test.

      Study Design:

      The treatment period is 16 weeks, during which all patients will make 7 study visits and have
      4 telephone interviews.

      Study visits include:

      Visit 1: screening at week -2, Days -14 to -5 Visit 2: baseline at week 0 Visit 4: week 4 ± 3
      days Visit 6: week 8 ± 3 days Visit 8: week 12 ± 3 days Visit 10: week 16 ± 3 days Visit 11:
      follow up at week 20 ± 7 days

      Randomization and start of treatment with OSU6162 or placebo at baseline, visit 2, week 0.
      Study medication administered during all study visits from baseline at visit 2 to visit 8 at
      week 12.

      Physical and neurological examinations, vital signs and weight recording during all study
      visits.

      ECG recorded during visits 1 (week -2) and 10 (week 16). Blood (and urine) sampling for
      safety labs during visits 1 (week -2), visit 4 (week 4), visit 10 (week 16). Pregnancy test
      at visit 1 and 10.

      Blood sampling for analysis of plasma OSU6162 concentration at visit 4 and 10.

      Primary outcome measures and secondary outcome self-assessment tests performed during all
      study visits.

      Telephone interviews at visit: 3 (week 2 ± 3 days), 5 (week 6 ± 3 days), 7 (week 10 ± 3 days)
      and 9 (week 14 ± 3 days.

      Concomitant medication, adverse events and drug compliance are recorded during all visits and
      telephone interviews.

      Dosing:

      All patients in the OSU6162 group start with a dose of 15 mg BID. The dose is increased to a
      maximum of 30 mg BID after 4 weeks of treatment. Intermediate doses are allowed and the final
      dose is individually flexible, depending on the therapeutic response and presence of AE. In
      the placebo group patients receive tablets with identical appearance to active treatment
      tablets (OSU6162 15 mg), administered according to the same dosing regime as active
      treatment.

      Data analysis and statistics:

      Efficacy analyses will be based on Mixed Models for Repeated Measures (MMRM) analyses. The
      MMRM analyses use all the longitudinal observations at each post-baseline visit for the study
      period of interest. Significance tests will be based on estimated population marginal means
      and Type III test of fixed effects, using a two-sided test with the significance level of
      0.05. Differences in distributions of categorical variables will be tested using the
      Chi-square test or Fisher's exact test.

      Due to the large number of variables engendered, multivariate statistical evaluations will be
      performed as a complement to the above-mentioned statistical methods.

      Before unblinding of the study data, a separate Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) will be
      prepared.

      Patient and data safety:

      This study is conducted in accordance with the study protocol, the Declaration of Helsinki,
      ICH E6 GCP, the European Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC and applicable local laws and
      regulations.

      The Investigator is responsible for ensuring the accuracy, completeness, legibility and
      timeliness of the data recorded in the CRFs. Data recorded in the CRF that are derived from
      source documents should be consistent with the source documents or the discrepancies should
      be explained. Signed sections of CRFs are monitored and collected on a regular basis.

      An individual secrecy agreement is established for all Sponsor, site personnel, independent
      auditors, and representatives from Competent Authorities that will have access to the
      information in the medical records for the participating patients.

    <masking_description>Randomization done externally. IMP codes are contained in sealed envelopes (one envelope for each randomized patient) locked in a drawer at the Gottfries Clinic AB. No envelope is opened prior to the end of the study unless it is critical for the treatment/outcome of an adverse event. In the event of a medical emergency, essential for the clinical management or welfare of the patient, the Investigator may decide to break a patient's treatment code. If the blind is broken, the Investigator must notify the monitor as soon as possible without revealing the patient's study treatment assignment, unless the information is important for the safety of the patients remaining in the study. The Investigator will record the date and reason for breaking the blind for that patient in the hospital records. The coded medicine packages are distributed to the site where the study nurse/investigator are responsible for dispensing the packages to the patients according to the randomization list.</masking_description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in SF-36 Health Survey</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessment at baseline and at week 4, 8, 12, and 16.</time_frame>
    <description>Change in SF-36 score and subscores are studied by comparing baseline values with values at several assessment points throughout the study.
The SF-36 Health Survey is a 36-item, patient-reported survey of patient health. The SF-36 consists of eight scaled scores, which are the weighted sums of the questions in each section. Each scale is directly transformed into a 0-100 scale on the assumption that each question carries equal weight. The lower the score the more disability, the higher the score the less disability i.e., a score of zero is equivalent to maximum disability and a score of 100 is equivalent to no disability.
The eight sections are:
vitality
physical functioning
bodily pain
general health perceptions
physical role functioning
emotional role functioning
social role functioning
mental health</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Plasma concentrations of OSU6162</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessment at week 4 and 16.</time_frame>
    <description>Blood samples are drawn 1-2 h after tablet intake at week 4 and 16, to measure plasma concentrations of OSU6162 after end of study. Plasma concentrations will be analyzed using LC-MS/MS after clinical trial end to ensure blinding. OSU6162 concentrations give an indication of compliance and may be important in studying treatment response.</description>

    <description>Active substance treatment with OSU6162. Starting dose for all patients in the OSU6162 treatment group is 15 mg BID. The dose is taken orally as one circular coated tablet of 15 mg together with a light meal in the morning and one tablet around lunch unless otherwise agreed upon. In order to aim at optimal dosing of OSU6162, some flexibility is allowed. The investigators are able to modify the dose for individual patients based on how well the treatment is tolerated and how well the patients respond to it. In the case where there is no clear response, the dose can be increased to maximally 30 mg BID (intermediate dosage is allowed) after 4 weeks of treatment; it is also possible to decrease the dose to a lower level (even below 15 mg BID) if a higher dose is not tolerated and/or there is a perceived weakened therapeutic effect with the higher dose. All dose changes will be performed while retaining the blind.</description>
