      This phase I trial will assess primarily the safety and secondarily the anti-inflammatory and

      This phase I trial will assess primarily the safety and secondarily
      anti-inflammatory/neovascular effect of Episcleral Celecoxib in patients suffering from
      macular edema &amp; inflammatory disorders of the eye posterior pole Including sclera, choroid,
      retina, or vitreous. Celecoxib is a specific cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor that possesses
      anti-angiogenic, anti-inflammatory, and anti-fibrotic properties. Non-clinical studies have
      documented the activity of Celecoxib in reducing leakage of the blood-retina barrier as well
      as inhibiting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2)
      expression in the retina of diabetic rats. The underlying mechanisms for its
      anti-inflammatory and anti-angiogenic properties have been extensively characterized. The
      investigators hypothesize that Episcleral Celecoxib is safe, tolerable and that its
      anti-inflammatory/anti-neovascular activity will reduce macular edema and improve vision in
      patients with macular edema. Objective: to primarily assess the safety, tolerability and
      pharmacokinetics of Episcleral Celecoxib in patients with macular edema and other
      inflammatory disorders of the posterior pole including retina, choroid and vitreous to
      secondarily assess efficacy in reducing macular edema and improving visual function. Methods:
      The main outcome of the study is safety assessment. Secondary outcomes are assessment of
      visual acuity and anatomical changes in the macula as measured via optical coherence
      tomography (OCT).
