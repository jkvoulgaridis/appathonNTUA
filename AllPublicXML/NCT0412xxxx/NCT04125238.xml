  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Episodic future thinking (EFT) is based on the new science of prospection, which was first
      identified in a Science publication in 2007 and refers to pre-experiencing the future by
      simulation. Considerable evidence suggests that prospection is important for understanding
      human cognition, affect, motivation, and action. Individuals with damaged frontal areas, as
      well as individuals with alcohol use disorder (AUD), show deficits in planning prospectively.
      One systematic method to engender prospection is via EFT. EFT, as applied in our prior
      studies and in this proposal consists of having participants develop positive plausible
      future events that correspond to several future time frames (e.g., 2 weeks, 1 month, 3 months
      etc). For each of these timeframes participants are asked to concretize the events (e.g.,
      What are you doing? Who will be there? What will you see, hear, smell, and feel?). We and
      others have used EFT to decrease delay discounting (DD) in individuals with AUD and smokers,
      as well as normal weight, overweight, and obese populations when compared to the control
      condition, control episodic thinking (CET). Consistent with reinforcer pathology, EFT also
      reduces alcohol valuation in the purchase task among individuals with AUD. However, no study
      to date has examined whether EFT reduces alcohol self-administration in the laboratory.
      Moreover, the neural correlates of EFT in AUD are also unknown. In this study, we propose to
      test an intervention, EFT, which we hypothesize will decrease reinforcer pathology measures
      in a bar-like setting in the laboratory; that is, EFT will decrease delay discounting, as
      well as alcohol self-administration, demand, and craving compared to a control episodic
      thinking (CET) condition. Moreover, we hypothesize EFT will enhance activation in brain
      regions associated with prospection (e.g., hippocampus and amygdala) and the executive
      decision system (e.g., DLPFC).

      Participants will be randomly assigned to experimental or control groups, stratified by AUDIT
      scores, SES, age and sex. Based on our 8 years of experience recruiting this population, we
      expect approximately 66% retention among eligible participants. Therefore, we will enroll
      approximately 107 participants in order to conclude with 64 completers. Participants will
      complete: a baseline assessment (S1), an alcohol self-administration session (S2 or S3), an
      fMRI session (S2 or S3). The alcohol self-administration session and the fMRI session will be
      completed in counterbalanced order. At the beginning of S2 and S3, participants in both
      groups will be prompted to generate positive events and related cues through a
      researcher-administered interview-based questionnaire. EFT group participants will be asked
      to think about and describe the most positive event that could realistically happen at each
      of 7 delays in the future (1 day, 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, 1 year, 5 years, and 25 years).
      In contrast, participants randomized to the CET condition, will be asked to think about and
      describe the most positive event that occurred at each of 7 time points from the recent past
      (last night from 7pm-10pm, yesterday between 4pm-7pm, yesterday between 1pm-4pm, yesterday
      from 10am-12pm, yesterday between 7am-10am, the night before last between 7pm-10pm, and
      evening before last between 4pm-7pm). For each time point, the participant will be asked to
      integrate the event and sensory information into concise textual and/or auditory cues to be
      used in subsequent behavioral tasks. Cue generation will occur prior to both self
      administration and fMRI sessions (S2 and S3) to maximize the relevancy of cues at both
      sessions.

    <description>Delay-discounting tasks provide a measure of the temporal window and examine the devaluation of awards as a function of the delay to the receipt. These computerized assessments provide participants with hypothetical choices between smaller amounts of a reward available immediately and a larger amount of a reward after a range of delays (1 day-25 years). Discounting rates will be measured using adjusting amount delay discounting and minute delay discounting tasks. Change in discounting rates will be compared within-subjects between S1 and S2 AND S1 and S3.</description>
