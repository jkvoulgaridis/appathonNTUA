      This pilot study is a randomized controlled trial in which assault-injured 12-14 year old
      youth recruited from the emergency department (ED) are randomly assigned to standard care or
      &quot;A Fighting Chance&quot; group mentoring.

      The goal of this project is to adapt, implement and evaluate Take Charge! (a 1:1 mentoring
      intervention for assault-injured youth) for a group mentoring model.

      This pilot study is a randomized controlled trial in which assault-injured 12-14 year old
      youth recruited from the emergency department are randomly assigned to standard care or &quot;A
      Fighting Chance&quot; group mentoring that includes a violence prevention curriculum and parent
      sessions. Immediately post-intervention and again at six-month follow up, youth
      violence-related, mental health and educational outcomes using validated measures will be
      assessed.

    <description>Study participants randomized to intervention will be enrolled in a Y in Central Maryland group mentoring program that meets weekly over a three month period. Parents will participate in three parenting sessions. Youth study participants will be interviewed about the youth's thoughts and behaviors and the youth's medical and school records will be reviewed. Parents will also be interviewed to ask questions about the program. The study will last for 12 months and youth/parents will be interviewed at the time of enrollment and 4-6 months later.</description>

             comprehend questions, will be excluded.
