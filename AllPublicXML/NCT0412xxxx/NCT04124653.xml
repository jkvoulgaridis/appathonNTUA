  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be the first time PF-06842874 is administered to humans. The purpose of Part
      A of the study is to investigate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of
      PF-06842874 following administration of single oral doses as an immediate-release formulation
      to healthy adult participants. Part B of this study will evaluate the relative
      bioavailability of a modified-release formulation of PF-06842874 for its potential use in
      future clinical studies. The effect of food on PF-06842874 pharmacokinetics may also be
      evaluated in this study.
