  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis is that the music therapy intervention has a positive impact on the critical
      patients' mood as it has a reassuring effect that allows a connection with emotions, helps to
      communicate and affects the welfare of patients. It also reduces pain and the consumption of
      painkillers and sedatives, as well as vasoactive drugs in critical patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to assess the effect of a personalised music therapy intervention
      with standard treatment on critical patients' mood compared to those who just receive the
      standard treatment. Moreover, the effect of the different interventions on pain and sedative,
      analgesic and vasoactive drugs will also be assessed.

      This is a randomized, parallel and open clinical trial that will compare: a) a music therapy
      intervention combined with the standard care (experimental group), with b) standard care
      (control group), on critical patients admitted to the General, Cardiac and Coronary Intensive
      Care Unit of the Santa Creu I Sant Pau Hospital.

      The expected number of patients expected to be included in this trial is 164. Patients will
      be included and randomized the day the music therapy intervention is to take place, once a
      week. Patients' mood will be assessed with a validated questionnaire in Spanish for adults,
      the POMS (Profile of Mood States) survey that consists of a self-report built on the basis of
      a multidimensional conception of mood and has a Likert 5-points type format (0 to 4)
