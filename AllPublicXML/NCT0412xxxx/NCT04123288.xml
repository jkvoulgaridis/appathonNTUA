  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is for research purposes only and is not intended to treat any medical condition.
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of 2 different formulations of
      ACT-709478 in healthy male participants. The participants will be treated in a crossover
      design with 2 different treatment periods. Pharmacokinetics (PK) is the study of the
      absorption and breakdown of the study drug in the body.

      The duration of participation in this study is approximately 8 weeks from screening to the
      end of study visit. A screening visit is required within 21 to 3 days prior to the start of
      the study to determine whether the participant qualifies and is willing to enter in this
      research study. This study requires the participant to have two in-patient stays in the
      research clinic. Each in-patient stay is planned for 5 days (4 nights). Eleven days after
      each dose the participant will have an examination. There will be an in-between period (i.e.,
      time between the end of period 1 and study treatment administration in Period 2) of 7 to 14
      days. A safety follow-up telephone call for all participants who have received at least one
      study treatment will take place 30 to 40 days after the end of study examination or study
      discontinuation.

             study-mandated procedure.

          -  Body mass index of 18.5-28.0 kg/m2 (inclusive) at Screening.

          -  Czech citizen with the ability to communicate well with the investigator, in a
             language understandable to the subject, and to understand and comply with the
             requirements of the study.
