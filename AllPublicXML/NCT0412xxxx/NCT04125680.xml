      This Community-Based Participatory Action Research (CBPAR) aims to:

        1. Develop a community-based participatory English as a Second Language (ESL) health
           literacy curriculum for lead exposure that can be used in other locations or programs.

        2. Determine the outcomes of the curriculum, including changes in knowledge about lead,
           access to health resources, and health behavioral changes to reduce lead exposure.

        3. To evaluate the implementation of the ESL health literacy curriculum.

      This research focuses on ESL health literacy classes provided over 8-weeks to Hispanic adults
      to reduce lead exposure. This research will use an experimental design with a waitlist
      control group. The curriculum uses pedagogies that move participants from health literacy as
      functional skill to health literacy as social practice where knowledge is used for
      empowerment and meaningful change. The goals of this research are to demonstrate increased
      health literacy knowledge, improved health behaviors, increased access to health services,
      and improved English language proficiency for Hispanic residents of Flint in relation to lead
      exposure prevention.

    <description>The intervention will last 8-weeks, and the first and last classes will be devoted to survey assessments. Participants will be asked to reflect on their health knowledge and behaviors, and how they have changed since starting the program. The curriculum administered during the classes will use pedagogies for health literacy as a practice. It will focus on skills needed to learn about lead exposure in the ESL classroom: (1) vocabulary; (2) grammar; and (3) identifying risk factors, symptoms and preventive strategies. A focus on health literacy as practice will include personal engagement using language in context: (1) role-play interactions about lead exposure prevention; (2) discussing views about risk, and how to talk about it with peers and family members; (3) identifying sources of reliable health information; and (4) learning to ask for support and resources.</description>
