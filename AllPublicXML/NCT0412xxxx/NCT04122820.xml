      To evaluate, in primary care, the sensitivity of Heterophory-Vertical-Labile (HV-Labile) in
      ambulatory screening for Specific Learning Disabilities (SLD) and Developmental Coordination
      Disorder (DCD). in children aged 8 to 12 years.

    <textblock>
      General practitioners during a day of professional training on learning disabilities will be
      trained to perform the proprioceptive Maddox, to search for a HVLabile.

      Each trained practitioner will then test at least six children aged 8 to 12 years old in his
      or her practice, seen at random

      250 to 300 physicians will be trained as part of this research

      EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN

        -  Cross-sectional study with prospective recruitment.

        -  Search for a Vertical Labile Heterophory (HV-Labile).

        -  Prescription of a standardized speech and language screening assessment for HV-Labile,
           and in the same number of children without HV-Labile by secondary coupling.

        -  Delivery of symptomatic questionnaire.

        -  In case of learning disabilities, the attending physician should look for a possible
           etiology.

        -  Adapted speech therapy care for more than six months.

        -  Speech and language therapy check-up at more than six months.

    <description>The study undertaken with 100 all-view children shows a strong correlation between the presence of SDP-HV-labile and the presence of specific learning disorders. She encourages us not to neglect the proprioceptive approach in the study of the SLD.</description>
