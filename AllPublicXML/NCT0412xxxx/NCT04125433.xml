  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Working through regional Accountable Care Organizations (ACO) the sponsor will establish a
      2-year pilot project to demonstrate that early recognition and intervention in the various
      Social Determinant of Health (SDoH) domains can reduce avoidable Emergency Department (ED)
      visits by high utilizers. The regional ACO's will contract with Medicaid Managed Care Plans
      to assign traditional high ED utilizing members to the pilot project. Members will be offered
      enhanced peer facilitated care management services connecting members with available SDoH
      community based services. Members fitting our eligibility criteria will self-select by way of
      completing a pilot project consent form.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The project employs a two level intervention to include Peer Support Specialist (PSS) and
      Community Health Advocate (CHA). Contact and engagement with participating members will be
      through both direct intervention in the emergency department by Peer Support Specialist (the
      peer) as well as in the community for prevention visits and follow up by both the peer and
      Community Health Advocate. These well-positioned Peers and Community Health Advocates will
      address Behavioral and Social Determinants of Health (SDoH) concerns through a highly
      coordinated intervention supported by a common IT Medicaid member tracking platform. This
      research project will determine the feasibility of deploying a single shared IT platform that
      will include referral, appointment completion, and intervention outcome data. Project staff
      will develop a trusting relationship with the members and will improve member access and
      engagement with community-based services. The project will also seek to determine the impact
      on total cost of care through redirecting study participants to community resources that are
      more appropriate, and less expensive than return visits to the emergency department.

    <intervention_model_description>In this study a Medicaid Managed Care Plan will identify up to 400 plan members who have visited an emergency department greater than 6 time in a 12-month period. These individuals will receive enhanced integrated peer care services and will be tracked across health and social service venues using a single IT platform. This study will examine the impact of this intervention on total cost of care.</intervention_model_description>
