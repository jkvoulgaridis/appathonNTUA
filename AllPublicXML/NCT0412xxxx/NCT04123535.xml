      This is a single arm, single site, feasibility study of Magnetic Resonance Guided Focused
      Ultrasound (MRgFUS) to promote immunotherapy responses in patients with undifferentiated
      pleomorphic sarcoma
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a single arm, single site, feasibility study to evaluate the safety and
      efficacy of MRgFUS using the ExAblate 2100 System for the partial ablation of
      undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcomas. A total of 20 adult participants will be treated with
      MRgFUS through this study. A matched comparison group of archived samples from patients with
      UPS who have not received focused ultrasound will be used as a control group to further
      evaluate the secondary endpoints (stratified and matched for age, sex, and history of
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy). All patients enrolled will receive timely standard of care
      surgical resection

      Primary Objective:

      To evaluate the overall rate and severity of adverse events following pre-operative MRgFUS
      prior to surgical resection of undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma.

      Secondary Objectives

        1. To measure possible immune response effects related to MRgFUS by serial serological
           analysis with flow cytometry panels (T-cell, natural killer cell, myeloid panels).

        2. To measure possible immune response effects related to MRgFUS by multiplex
           immunohistochemistry assays of resected tumor specimens (CD3, CD4, CD8, CD19, CD68,
           FOXP3, PD-1, PD-L1, CD45) as well as RNA sequencing.

        3. To compare possible immune response effects in this group of patients receiving
           pre-operative MRgFUS prior to surgical resection of undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma
           to a comparison group of archived samples from patients who have had resection of UPS
           but did not have pre-operative focused ultrasound.

    <description>The ExAblate 2100 MRgFUS system (InSightec, Inc., Dallas, Texas, USA) is a noninvasive thermal ablation device fully integrated with an MR imaging system and used for the ablation of soft tissue and bone.14-16 The ExAblate combines a focused ultrasound surgery (FUS) delivery system and a conventional diagnostic 3T Magnetic Resonance (MR) scanner. The ExAblate systems provide a real-time therapy planning algorithm, thermal dosimetry, and closed-loop therapy control. The ExAblate transducer device is an integrated component of the MR table</description>
