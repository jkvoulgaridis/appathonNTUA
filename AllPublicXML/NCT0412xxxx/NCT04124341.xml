      Purpose: Treatment-resistant depression (TRD) is a leading cause of premature mortality and
      healthcare costs. Negative stimuli capture the attention of depressed patients. The more
      entrenched these core attentional processes are, the longer patients remain ill. The parietal
      Late Positive Potential (LPP) [an event-related potential (ERP) measured by
      electroencephalography (EEG)], reliably captures biased attention and early affective
      responses to environmental stimuli. LPP is top-down modulated by the prefrontal cortex (PFC),
      an important target for depression treatment. Using a combination of anatomical, functional
      and electric-field simulation localization methods, the investigators will stereotactically
      implant 15 TRD patients with bilateral EpCS in a 2-phase approach. The investigators will
      confirm target engagement, reduction of LPP response, as well as examine the relationship
      between reductions in LPP and changes in depressive symptoms in TRD patients.

      Significance of Research Question: TRD patients present with the inability to disengage from
      negative perceptions and memories, which further dysregulates their mood and prevents them
      from engaging the outside world with flexibility. The investigators will demonstrate that
      LPP, a measure of early emotional processes, is a valid target for treating TRD. Intermittent
      bilateral EpCS will directly engage attention allocation networks, modulate LPP and decrease
      depressive symptoms. Using Bayesian optimization tools, the investigators can explore a
      larger number of settings than otherwise possible using classic parametric permutations, and
      reliably establish a sustained effective target engagement over time. Machine learning and an
      adaptive clinical trial design will offset the relatively small sample size, enable
      individualized treatments and help demonstrate that intermittent bilateral EpCS is an
      effective antidepressant treatment option for severe and chronic depression.

      Objectives (confirm target engagement and demonstrate clinical relevance): To examine the
      relationship between reductions in LPP and clinical improvement. The investigators will
      define the optimal interval for adjusting EpCS settings over time and key design elements for
      a more definitive randomized control trial (RCT). This study also aims to explore other
      electrophysiology and behavioral measures that can add to the adaptive stimulation parameters
      adjustments method.

      Hypothesis: Severe TRD patients with chronic intermittent EpCS therapy will show a sustained
      lowering of LPP (replication of target engagement) over a 6-month period, and this change
      will be related to decreases in Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD24). This pattern
      will demonstrate that target engagement (lowering of LPP) is a key mechanism of
      antidepressant treatment with EpCS.

    <description>In order to demonstrate that sustained lowering of LPP, as a result of Bayesian optimized bilateral EpCS, change in Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD) scores will be calculated. HDRS is a 24-item interview-based tool measuring depression symptoms in the previous week. Scoring is based on only the first 17 items. Eight items are scored on a 5-point scale, ranging from 0 = not present to 4 = severe. Nine are scored from 0-2. Total scores are the sum of the 17 item scores and range from 0 (Normal functioning) to 22 (severe depression).</description>

    <description>Prior to surgery, subjects will undergo a high resolution structural scan to identify anatomical landmarks for rostral anterior and lateral prefrontal cortex. Following identification of target areas, EpCS quad leads will be projected over the anterior and lateral prefrontal cortex.Subjects will be kept in the hospital for a minimum of 72 hours for observation during which the investigators will obtain a high resolution spiral CT scan without contrast to confirm lead placements post- operatively and rule out any intra-cranial bleeds. Patients will receive analgesics which they may continue as an outpatient on as needed basis. During this 2-3 weeks recovery period, the attention to pain control and mood is critical. The research team will contact patients at least twice per week to check on their status.</description>
