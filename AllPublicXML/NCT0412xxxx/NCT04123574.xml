      A study to assess the biochemical and immunomodulatory effects of BXCL701 in pancreatic
      cancer.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 0 or &quot;window of opportunity&quot; study where paired specimen analysis, taken
      before and after drug exposure, will permit the evaluation of target modulation and
      assessment of immune effector cell infiltration into the tumor and the generation of relevant
      immune cytokines.

      In this study, BXCL701 will be administered at a dose of 0.3 mg, twice daily for a total
      daily dose of 0.6mg (the previously defined maximum tolerated dose [MTD] of the drug), to all
      patients for a short period of 14 days. This study is designed to assess the biochemical and
      immunomodulatory effects of BXCL701 in pancreatic cancer.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Has untreated (eg, no prior investigational therapies, chemotherapy, or radiation
             therapy), locally advanced or metastatic adenocarcinoma of the head, neck, uncinate
             process, or tail of the pancreas with a local or metastatic lesion that is amenable to
             biopsy before and after treatment. (Whenever possible, the before and after treatment
             biopsies should be from the same lesion.)

          -  Is able and willing to undergo tumor biopsy before and after treatment. (A
             pretreatment biopsy may not be needed if tissue is available from a biopsy conducted
             within 28 days prior to screening that is adequate for the study assessments.)

          -  Has Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 to 1.

          -  Is 18 to 75 years of age, inclusive

          -  Has adequate organ function within 28 days of treatment initiation

          -  For participants with exposure to prior agents associated with decreased left
             ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) (e.g. anthracyclines), or if clinically
             warranted, a documented LVEF &gt; 45% using a standard echocardiogram (ECHO) or
             multigated acquisition (MUGA) scan test at Screening or within 60 days prior to Cycle

             informed consent or that may influence the patient's compliance with the protocol in
             the judgments of the investigator.
