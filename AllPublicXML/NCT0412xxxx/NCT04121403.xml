  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main aim and overall objective of the study is to assess whether rituximab is
      non-inferior to cladribine for the treatment of relapsing MS. Secondly, the investigators
      will test specific blood and MRI biomarkers that may contribute to future personalized
      treatment for MS patients. Furthermore, the investigators want to evaluate the health
      economic consequences of the two therapies.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a demyelinating and neurodegenerative inflammatory disease of the
      central nervous system, affecting more than 12 000 patients in Norway and more than 2.2 mill
      patients worldwide.

      Oral cladribine is one of the first choices for highly efficient disease modulatory treatment
      (DMT), while Rituximab is used off-label as DMT in relapsing MS. Large observational studies
      indicate good tolerance and treatment effect of rituximab in MS and studies from other
      diseases indicate a good safety profile. However, no phase 3 studies have been performed to
      test whether rituximab is as efficient as established MS treatments. Formal safety data is
      also lacking for the treatment with rituximab in MS.

      The investigators will perform a prospective randomized open-label blinded endpoint
      multicenter non-inferiority study. The primary objective is to test whether rituximab is
      non-inferior to oral cladribine in the treatment of relapsing MS. 264 MS patients aged 18-65
      years with relapsing MS will be recruited from 10 centers and followed for 96 weeks. The
      primary endpoint is difference in new T2 lesions between the groups. Furthermore, the
      investigators will test novel blood sample and MRI biomarkers to provide tools for
      personalized MS treatments. Finally, the health economic consequences of these treatment
      options will be evaluated.

      This study will guide clinicians and patients in the future treatment choice for MS and can
      potentially make a huge impact on the costs of future MS treatment.
