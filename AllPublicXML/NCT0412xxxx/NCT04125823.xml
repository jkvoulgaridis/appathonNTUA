  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to investigate the feasibility and acceptability of the video game-based
      physical activity training program in the inpatient period during relapse treatment. The
      secondary aims are to investigate its effectiveness on upper extremity functions, walking,
      balance, cognitive functions, quality of life, depression, and fatigue comparing to
      conventional rehabilitation in persons with multiple sclerosis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory, demyelinating, neurodegenerative disease of the
      central nervous system. The most common clinical signs and symptoms are fatigue, spasticity,
      cognitive impairment, chronic pain, depression, decreased quality of life, and bladder and
      bowel dysfunction.

      Current medical treatment is divided into three groups: disease-modifying, symptom
      management, and prognosis and relapse management. Intravenous methylprednisolone treatment is
      generally used in the management of relapses and prognosis. It is also thought that
      physiotherapy during the intravenous methylprednisolone treatment provides better treatment
      results. Therefore, treatment planning of people with MS during hospitalization should be
      done by a multidisciplinary team.

      Studies have shown that video games based physical activity training as a non-pharmacological
      therapy may be an effective method for managing symptoms such as balance, gait, fatigue, and
      cognitive functions in people with MS, but its feasibility in the inpatient period is
      unknown.

      The primary aim of the study is to investigate the feasibility and acceptability of the video
      game-based physical activity training program in the inpatient period. The secondary aims are
      to investigate its effectiveness on upper extremity functions, walking, balance, cognitive
      functions, quality of life, depression, and fatigue in persons with MS comparing to
      conventional rehabilitation.

      Volunteers from people with MS who are in the inpatient period due to relapse in the
      Neurology Department, Faculty of Medicine, Dokuz Eyl√ºl University will participate in the
      study. In accordance with the inclusion criteria, 30 patients were randomly assigned to two
      groups: 15 patients in the game-based rehabilitation group and 15 patients in the
      conventional rehabilitation group. Based on the physical levels of the patients, appropriate
      games will be selected and video game based physical activity training will be started. Video
      games will be played with Xbox One with a motion sensor (Microsoft) and a 52'' Liquid Crystal
      Display. Depending on the prognosis of the patients, the grades and types of games will be
      changed. A conventional physiotherapy program including balance, upper extremity, and core
      stabilization exercises will be implemented. Treatments will be given by the physiotherapist
      for 45 minutes once daily during the hospital stay. Evaluations will be made before and after
      the treatment (discharge) and 4 weeks after the end of treatment. Physical and clinical
      evaluations will be made by physicians and physiotherapists, and cognitive evaluation will be
      performed by psychologists.

    <measure>Timed 25-Foot Walk</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline through Hospital Discharge, up to 10 days, and 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Timed 25-Foot Walk is a quantitative mobility and leg function performance test. The patient is directed to one end of a clearly marked 25-foot course and is instructed to walk 25 feet as quickly and safely as possible. The time is calculated from the initiation of the instruction to start and ends when the patient has reached the 25-foot mark. The task is immediately administered again by having the patient walk back the same distance. Patients may use assistive devices when doing this task. The score is the average time of the two completed trials. Higher time represents slower walking speed and more walking impairment.</description>

    <description>The Manual Ability Measurement-36 is a questionnaire on perceived ease or difficulty that a persons may experience when performing unilateral and bilateral activity of daily living tasks. During a semi-structured interview, the persons are asked to rate 36 unilateral and bilateral activity of daily living tasks using a 4-point scale. The score of the different tasks are summed up and transformed using a Rasch-derived conversion table. The Rasch-derived scores are ranged from 0 to 100. Higher scores indicate better manual ability.</description>

    <description>The Epworth Sleepiness Scale is a self-administered questionnaire with 8 questions. Respondents are asked to rate, on a 4-point scale (0-3), their usual chances of dozing off or falling asleep while engaged in eight different activities. The score (the sum of 8 item scores, 0-3) can range from 0 to 24. The higher the score, the higher that person's average sleep propensity in daily life, or their 'daytime sleepiness'.</description>

    <description>The Multiple Sclerosis International Quality of Life Questionnaire is a disease-specific, self-administered, multidimensional questionnaire, was co-developed and initially validated in 15 countries including Turkey. The questionnaire comprises 31 questions in 9 subscales: activities of daily living, psychological well-being, symptoms, relationships with friends, relationships with family, sentimental and sexual life, coping, rejection, and relationships with the healthcare system. All 9 dimensions and the index score were linearly transformed and standardized on a 0-100 scale, where 0 indicates the worst possible level of quality of life and 100 indicates the best level.</description>
