  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Successful neurosurgery to remove tumours around the base of the skull, such as a vestibular
      schwannoma, depends on achieving maximal tumour removal whilst preserving crucial
      neurological functions such as facial movement, and maintaining quality of life.

      Current techniques to direct surgery are based on the surgeon's expertise and knowledge of
      the relevant anatomy, supplemented by the use of electrical recording and stimulation of the
      facial nerve. However, it is often very difficult to visualise the nerve during surgery and
      facial nerve paralysis remains a potentially devastating complication of surgery.

      Advanced imaging methods may be used to visualise important neural connections in the brain
      and computer-assisted processing can generate tumour maps from MRI and ultrasound scans. This
      study aims to utilise these technologies to develop a 3D navigation system for skull base
      surgery.

      This study aims to develop a system that will combine MRI and intraoperative ultrasound
      imaging to enhance the surgeon's view of the tumour, facial nerve and other surrounding
      critical structures during surgery. This information will be made available in the navigation
      system in the operating room so that operations are more precise resulting in better tumour
      removal rates and fewer complications.

      The system will be assessed during the treatment of 20 patients with vestibular schwannoma at
      the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery. This feasibility study will validate
      the different parts of the new system and help us design a future research study to determine
      its effectiveness in improving patient care.

      This project will result in safer and more effective neurosurgery, with potential consequent
      financial savings for the NHS and the UK, in addition to marked improvements in the quality
      of life of patients and reduced dependency upon others.
