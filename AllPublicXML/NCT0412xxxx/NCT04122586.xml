  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diarrhea irritable bowel syndrome(IBS-D）has seriously affected health and quality of life of
      patients.It may be important pathogenesis in development and recurrence of the process of
      IBS-D,excessive endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) activated PERK(proteinkinaseR—like
      ERkinase，PERK)-eIF2a(eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 alpha,eIF2a) pathway and
      damaged intestinal mucosal epithelial Barrier. Tongxieyaofang(TXYF) had obtained satisfactory
      effect in treating IBS-D in clinic and previous study, but it is unknown that herbal formula
      how to work.This project applies metabolomics method to detect plasma,urine and stool
      metabolites for patients before and after treatment, to determine the effects of the&quot;multiple
      ingredients&quot;of TXYF in body.

    <measure>Irritable Bowel Syndrome Symptom Severity(IBS-SSS) scale</measure>
    <time_frame>IBS-SSS was evaluated by patients at 4th week</time_frame>
    <description>Patients are graded according to their own symptoms（abdominal pain，bloating，defecation satisfaction，the extent to which the disease affects the lives of patients，bowel movements）, the total score less than 75 points was considered as in remission, 75~175 as mild, 175~300 as moderate, and over 300 as severe. We will assess changes in patient scores before and after treatment to reflect the extent of disease remission.</description>

    <measure>Bristol stool form scale（BSFS）</measure>
    <time_frame>BSFS was evaluated by patients at 4th week</time_frame>
    <description>Different fecal types can reflect different intestinal transit times, the lower the score, the longer the transmission time; the higher the score, the shorter the transmission time. We will assess changes in scores before and after treatment to reflect the extent of disease remission.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>IBS-D PRO( patient reported outcomes) Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>IBS-D PRO Scale was evaluated at 4th week</time_frame>
    <description>Grading from the field of physiology, independence, and psychology，Use score changes to assess improvement in all areas of the patient.Minimum score is 0，means no symptoms，maximum score is 144，means all symptoms are severe.</description>

    <measure>SF-36(the MOS item short from health survey)Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>SF-36 Scale was evaluated at 4th week</time_frame>
    <description>Score evaluation from 8 aspects: physical function, role-physical, pain, global health status, vitality，social function,role-emotional， mental health.Use score changes to assess improvement in all areas of the patient. Maximum score is147.The higher the score, the better the status in all aspects.</description>
