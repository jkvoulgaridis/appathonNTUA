  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This observational study will follow participants who completed follow-up in the FOURIER
      OUTCOMES trial to evaluate the long-term effects of evolocumab treatment. Long-term
      post-trial (legacy) beneficial effects have been reported with statins, niacin, hypoglycemic
      therapy and fibrates. Whether similar effects are seen after LDL cholesterol (LDL-c) lowering
      by PCSK9 inhibition is currently unknown.

      Evolocumab therapy causes a profound reduction in LDL cholesterol of approximately 60%.
      Statins have shown legacy effects over 5 years post-trial, including a 7% reduction in total
      mortality in meta-analysis and 12% reduction in coronary mortality. It would therefore be
      hypothesized that additional effects beyond the trial period would be conferred by previous
      evolocumab treatment. It is also important to assess the long-term safety of prior evolocumab
      treatment.
