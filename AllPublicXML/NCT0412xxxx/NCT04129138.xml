    <textblock>
      This trial studies the attitudes and beliefs of high risk patients and caregivers regarding
      the prescription of intranasal naloxone spray for opioid overdose. Knowledge regarding high
      risk patients' and caregivers' beliefs and attitudes regarding co-prescription of naloxone
      spray with opioids may help to identify barriers to prescribing and helping tailor the
      education to better meet the needs of patients and caregivers.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To determine the proportion of high risk patients who perceive receiving a prescription of
      intranasal naloxone to be beneficial for them.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the proportion of caregivers who perceive receiving a prescription of
      intranasal naloxone to be beneficial for the patient.

      II. To determine the association between high risk patients' and their caregivers'
      characteristics (this includes cut-annoyed-guilty-eye [CAGE], screener and opioid assessment
      for patients with pain [SOAPP], age, gender, ethnicity, education, employment status,
      presence of caregiver, cancer type, cancer stage, reason for Narcan prescription, health
      insurance, and setting of Narcan prescription) and their perception that a prescription for
      intranasal naloxone is beneficial for patients.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To conduct an exploratory analysis of high risk patients' and caregivers' attitudes and
      beliefs regarding prescription of intranasal naloxone spray.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants complete a survey over 30 minutes.
