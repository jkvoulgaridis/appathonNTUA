  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to understand how dietary fat is related to cardiovascular
      disease (CVD). This study tests the effect of different dietary fats on the level of fat in
      the blood and the particles that transport fat in the blood. The researchers want to know if
      these particles change after eating meals made with different fats.

      The overall objective of this work is to discover how the lipidomic composition of
      postprandial lipoproteins responds to dietary fats of differing fatty acid composition by
      comparing meals rich in saturated fatty acid (SFA) (from dairy cream) versus polyunsaturated
      fatty acids (PUFA) (from soybean oil). The information derived from these studies will
      provide mechanistic insight into postprandial lipid metabolism and will support efforts to
      identify optimal dietary oil intakes for people.
