  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators have developed a novel pressure monitoring device that hooks to standard
      urinary catheters that are used by patients with a neurogenic bladder on daily clean
      intermittent catheterization. The device has already been demonstrated to be accurate
      compared to the gold standard in clinic urodynamics. This study will assess the patients and
      care givers ability and experience using the device in a home setting.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For patients with neurogenic bladder, regular monitoring of bladder pressure and capacity is
      a critical component of maintaining renal and urinary health. This monitoring is currently
      done by in-office urodynamics testing (UDS). This testing is done intermittently, leaving
      open the possibility of worsening of bladder function and renal deterioration between testing
      sessions.

      This study utilizes a novel pressure monitoring device which is portable and attaches to the
      end of a standard urinary catheter. The investigators will be investigating if this device
      can be used by patients or their caregivers in a home setting.

      This study will enroll patients with neurogenic bladder that currently perform clean
      intermittent catheterization on a daily basis as part of their regular care. The patients
      will be asked to use the device at least twice a day for two weeks.

    <description>The non-invasive device connects to the end of urinary catheter that the patient uses for routine daily catheterization. Once urine flows into the device the patient presses a single button in order to obtain a pressure measurement which is recorded and stored in the device along with the time and date. The measurement(s) can later be transmitted wirelessly to a smart phone that contains an app for the device.</description>
