      A window of opportunity feasibility study assessing pre-operative stereotactic ablative body
      radiotherapy followed by immediate surgery in pancreatic adenocarcinoma.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-centre, prospective, non-randomised feasibility study. This study will
      assess whether SABR can safely be given immediately prior to Whipple's resection by assessing
      the rate of post-operative complications.
