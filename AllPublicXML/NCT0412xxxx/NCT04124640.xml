  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The decrease or absence sexual desire and arousal is the alteration of the sexual sphere that
      women most commonly refer to in adulthood and old age. Many women can refer a decrease or
      absence of desire and / or arousal without having the disorder typified in the DSM-5, but
      that can cause discomfort, worry and relationship problems in their day to day. Libicare® is
      a food supplement whose ingredients could have positive effects on the improvement of sexual
      function in women with low desire and arousal levels. The main ingredients of Libicare® are:

        -  Trigonella Foenum-graecum (Trigonella) (1)

        -  Tribulus Terrestris (Tribulus) (2)

        -  Turnera Diffusa (Damiana) (3)
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The main objective is to describe the effectivity of LIBICARE® in the improvement of desire
      and sexual arousal in women between 45 and 65 years old, in real life.

      The secondary objectives of the study are:

        -  Evaluation of the every domain of the EVAS-M scale during the study period

        -  Assessment of the safety of LIBICARE® by collecting serious and non-serious adverse
           events during the study treatment.

        -  Evaluation of patient satisfaction with treatment

        -  Therapeutic compliance.

        -  Study of the hormonal variation in relation to the values of total testosterone, free
           testosterone and SHBG.

        -  To evaluate the range of utility of the EVAS-M scale
