      OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of intervention by sending short text messages with a
      reminder of the time of medication use, compared to sending educational messages, on
      adherence to drug treatment in patients with hypertension. METHODOLOGY: Prospective,
      randomized, controlled, double-blind, parallel group study that will be performed in patients
      with hypertension seen at a community pharmacy in Brazil. The following groups will be
      compared: a) intervention group 1: 70 hypertensive patients registered for access to
      medication associated with usual care, in addition to text messages via mobile phone with
      educational information b) intervention group 2: 70 hypertensive patients registered for
      access to medications that will additionally receive text messages at the times indicated in
      the prescription for use of each indicated medication, in addition to educational
      information. After the washout period, the groups will have the active interventions changed
      for an additional 90 days. The proportion of adherent and non-adherent patients with and
      without controlled BP in both groups will be compared after the periods of application of the
      different interventions.
