      The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-906. TAK-906 is being tested to evaluate
      the effect of single dose intravenous rifampin on the single-dose PK of oral TAK-906 in
      healthy adult participants.

      The study will enroll approximately 12 participants. Participants will be randomly assigned
      to one of the two treatment groups:

        -  TAK-906 25 mg + Rifampin 600 mg and TAK-906 25 mg

        -  Rifampin 600 mg and TAK-906 25 mg + TAK-906 25 mg

      This single center trial will be conducted in the United States. The overall time to
      participate in this study is 49 Days. All participants will make final visit 14 days after
      receiving their last dose of study drug for follow up assessment.

    <ipd_description>Takeda makes patient-level, de-identified data sets and associated documents available for all interventional studies after applicable marketing approvals and commercial availability have been received (or program is completely terminated), an opportunity for the primary publication of the research and final report development has been allowed, and other criteria have been met as set forth in Takeda's Data Sharing Policy (see www.TakedaClinicalTrials.com for details). To obtain access, researchers must submit a legitimate academic research proposal for adjudication by an independent review panel, who will review the scientific merit of the research and the requestor's qualifications and conflict of interest that can result in potential bias. Once approved, qualified researchers who sign a data sharing agreement are provided access to these data in a secure research environment.</ipd_description>
