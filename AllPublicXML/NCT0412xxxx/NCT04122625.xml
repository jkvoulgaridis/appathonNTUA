  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Part A (dose-optimization)- to determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) taking into
      account dose-limiting toxicity (DLT/s) in Cycle 1, overall safety/tolerability and
      pharmacokinetic (PK), by optimizing doses of Debio 1143 when combined with the standard dose
      of nivolumab, as well as treatment compliance in participants with advanced solid
      malignancies who failed prior systemic standard treatments.

      Part B (basket trial)- to evaluate the preliminary anti-tumor activity of Debio 1143 at the
      RP2D in combination with nivolumab at the standard dose, overall and in each participant
      cohort (Cohort 1: small cell lung cancer [SCLC]; Cohort 2: squamous cell carcinoma of the
      head and neck [SCCHN]; Cohort 3: gastrointestinal (GI) cancers with known microsatellite
      instability-high/mismatch repair deficiency (MSI-H/MMRd) or other deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)
      damage repair (DDR) abnormalities, including homologous recombination deficiency (HRD);
      Cohort 4: platinum-resistant epithelial ovarian cancer [EOC], endometrial cancer, primary
      peritoneal cancer (PPC) or cervical cancer, with known MSIH/MMRd, hereditary/somatic
      mutations of the breast cancer 1 (BRCA1) and BRCA2 genes or other DNA DDR abnormalities
      (incl. HRD).

             single agent or in combination with standard/approved chemotherapy, tyrosine kinase
             inhibitors (TKIs), radiotherapy (RT) or other monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that are

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Thoracic or head and neck radiation &gt;30 gray (Gy) within the 3 months prior to Cycle 1

          -  Have received, in total, more than 3 (i.e. Cohorts 1&amp;2) or 4 (i.e. Cohorts 3&amp;4) lines
             of prior systemic treatments (including adjuvant or neoadjuvant regimens if relapse
             within six months prior to C1D1)
