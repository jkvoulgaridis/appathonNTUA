  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to enable patients, who are currently receiving rogaratinib in a
      Bayer-sponsored clinical trial (incl. NCT01976741), to continue treatment after their
      respective study has been closed. Another aim is to learn if rogaratinib is safe and how it
      affects the body.

      Rogaratinib is an investigational drug that may treat different types of cancer, incl.
      non-small-cell lung cancer, small-cell lung cancer, urothelial carcinoma, head, neck and
      breast cancer. The drug may stop the growth of cancer cells by targeting different cell
      proteins called fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFR) that are needed for the survival of
      the cancer cells.

      The primary objectives of the study are the continuation of rogaratinib treatment (as
      monotherapy or combination therapy) for patients after closure of their feeder studies and
      the further assessment of the safety of the drug.

      The secondary objective is to investigate the tolerability of rogaratinib.
