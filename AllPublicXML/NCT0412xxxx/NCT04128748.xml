      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of CPX-351 in combination with
      quizartinib for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia and high risk myelodysplastic
      syndrome. CPX-351, composed of chemotherapy drugs daunorubicin and cytarabine, works in
      different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping
      them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Quizartinib may stop the growth of
      tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. The goal of this study is
      to learn if the combination of CPX-351 and quizartinib can help to control acute myeloid
      leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety and maximum tolerable dose (MTD) of liposomal cytarabine and
      daunorubicin (CPX-351) in combination with quizartinib in patients with newly diagnosed or
      relapsed refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome
      (HR-MDS).

      II. To determine the overall response rate (ORR) rate including CR (complete remission) + CRp
      (complete remission with incomplete platelet recovery) + CRi (complete remission with
      incomplete count recovery) + partial remission (PR) within 3 months of treatment initiation
      of CPX-351 and quizartinib combination.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To assess the overall survival (OS), event-free survival (EFS) and duration of response
      (DOR) of patients treated with this combination.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the ORR, EFS (event free survival) and OS (overall survival) in FLT3
      mutated/NPM1 wild-type patients versus FLT3 mutated/NPM1 mutated versus FLT3 wild-type/NPM1
      mutated patients treated with CPX-351 and quizartinib.

      II. Quantitative changes of FLT3-ITD allelic burden and longitudinal evaluation to identify
      emergence of FLT3 non-ITD mutations with time in patients treated with the combination.

      III. To determine the effect of this treatment combination on responding patients
      transitioning to hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT).

      IV. To store and/or analyze surplus blood or tissue including bone marrow, if available, for
      potential future exploratory research into factors that may influence development of AML
      and/or response to the combination (where response is defined broadly to include efficacy,
      tolerability or safety).

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of CPX-351, followed by a phase II study.

      INDUCTION: Patients receive CPX-351 intravenously (IV) over 90 minutes on days 1, 3 and 5 and
      quizartinib orally (PO) on days 6-19. Patients who do not respond to treatment during cycle 1
      receive CPX-351 IV on days 1 and 3 and quixartinib PO on days 6-19 during cycle 2. Treatment
      repeats every 28 days for up 2 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      CONSOLIDATION: Patients receive CPX-351 over 90 minutes on days 1 and 3 and quizartinib PO on
      days 4-28 of cycle 1. Treatment with CPX-351 repeats every 28 days for 2 cycles in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      MAINTENANCE: Patients receive quizartinib PO on days 1-28 in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, then every 3-6
      months for up to 5 years.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of 1) AML (World Health Organization [WHO] classification definition of &gt;=
             20% blasts, excluding acute promyelocytic leukemia [APL]), or 2) high risk MDS (&gt; 10%
             bone marrow blasts)

          -  For frontline cohort: Patients aged &gt;= 60 years old

          -  For relapsed or refractory cohort: Patients aged &gt;= 18 years old

          -  For frontline cohort: Patients must be chemonaive, i.e., not have received any
             chemotherapy (except hydrea or 1-2 doses of ara-C for transient control of
             hyperleukocytosis) for AML or MDS. They may have received transfusions, hematopoietic
             growth factors or vitamins for an antecedent hematological disorder (AHD) or for AML.
             Temporary prior measures such as apheresis, ATRA (all-trans retinoic acid), steroids
             or hydrea while diagnostic work-up is being performed are allowed and not counted as a
             prior salvage. Supportive care therapy for MDS (growth factors, transfusions) will not
             be considered as prior therapy for MDS/AML and these patients will be enrolled to the
             frontline cohort of the study if they are otherwise eligible

          -  For relapsed or refractory cohort: Patients who have received at least one prior
             therapy for AML or for MDS (with &gt; 10%) blasts will be eligible. Patients may have
             received up to 4 salvage regimens for AML and/or MDS (defined by the International
             Prognostic Scoring System [IPSS] classification). Patients who receive MDS directed
             therapies considered not purely supportive such as hypomethylating agents (HMAs),
             lenalidomide, investigational therapies, will be enrolled to the salvage cohort if
             they are otherwise eligible

          -  In the absence of rapidly progressing disease, the interval from prior treatment to
             time of initiation of protocol therapy will be at least 2 weeks for cytotoxic agents
             or at least 5 half-lives for cytotoxic/noncytotoxic agents (whichever is shorter). The
             half-life for the therapy in question will be based on published pharmacokinetic
             literature (abstracts, manuscripts, investigator brochure's, or drug-administration
             manuals) and will be documented in the protocol eligibility document. The use of

             following exceptions: (1) intrathecal (IT) therapy for patients with controlled
             central nervous system (CNS) leukemia at the discretion of the principal investigator
             (PI). (2) Use of cytarabine (up to 2 g/m^2) or hydroxyurea for patients with rapidly
             proliferative disease is allowed before the start of study therapy and for the first
             four weeks on therapy. These medications will be recorded in the case-report form
