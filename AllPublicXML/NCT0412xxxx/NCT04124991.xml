      Safety and Efficacy Study of Radioembolization with Yttrium-90 Microspheres in Combination

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single arm, open-label study to evaluate safety and efficacy of Radioembolization
      with Yttrium-90 Microspheres in Combination with Durvalumab in Locally Advanced and
      Unresectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma which to be implemented at a single site in Korea.

      Transarterial radioembolization (TARE) with yttrium-90 microspheres will be employed in
      combination with an intravenous (IV) durvalumab until PD. TARE will be performed before the
      first dose of durvalumab. Exploratory biomarker testing will be done on tumor tissues prior
      to treatment and plasma samples prior to treatment and at the time of PD.

If additional TARE is performed, the interval between additional TARE treatments and administration of durvalumab should be at least 1 week.</intervention_model_description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosed with unequivocal HCC confirmed histologically or diagnosed radiologically

          -  Locally advanced HCC

          -  Must have at least 1 untreated measurable disease

          -  Child-Pugh score ≤7 points

          -  Adequate normal organ and marrow function.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Eligible for potentially curative treatment (surgical resection, radio-frequency
             ablation or immediate liver transplantation)

          -  Prior treatment with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, anti-PD-L2, anti- Cytotoxic
             T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 (anti-CTLA-4) antibody

          -  Any other concurrent malignancy, except for adequately treated basal cell or squamous
             cell skin cancer, in situ cervical cancer, papillary thyroid cancer, early gastric
             cancer, or other cancer for which the patient has been disease-free for at least five
             years.

          -  Evidence of extrahepatic metastasi(e)s, except for regional lymph node(s) involvement

          -  History of leptomeningeal carcinomatosis , History of active primary immunodeficiency

          -  Current or prior use of immunosuppressive medication within 14 days before the first
             dose of durvalumab.

        Exclusion Criteria Specific to Radioembolization:

        •The screening angiogram and technetium-99m macroaggregated albumin (99mTc-MAA) scan are
        used to determine lobar liver volume from CT or MR images, to identify vascular shunting to
        the GI tract requiring use of angiographic occlusion techniques and to determine the lung
        shunt fraction.

        Patients who are ineligible to radioembolization meeting the following criteria will not be
        included in the study. Additional patients will be screened to replace those patients.

          -  Deposition of yttrium-90 microspheres to the GI tract that cannot be corrected by
             placement of the catheter distal to collateral vessels or the application of standard
             angiographic techniques, such as coil embolization to prevent deposition of yttrium-90
             microspheres in the GI tract.

          -  Exposure of radiation to the lungs exceeds 30 Gray (Gy) for a single infusion or 50 Gy
             cumulative for all infusions of yttrium-90 microspheres.
