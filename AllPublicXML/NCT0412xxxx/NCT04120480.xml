  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the clinical and economic effectiveness of a
      pharmacogenomic (PGx) approach to prescribing medications in patients with high-risk
      polypharmacy in an integrated healthcare delivery system.

      Investigators hypothesize that patients who receive the RightMed® PGx test from OneOme, LLC
      with subsequent counseling of their prescribers by a study pharmacist, as needed, on the
      appropriateness of their prescribed medications will experience lower one-year follow-up
      healthcare utilization and expenditures compared to control patients who receive usual care.

      The purpose of this study is to determine the clinical and economic effectiveness of a
      pharmacogenomic (PGx) approach to prescribing medications in patients with high-risk
      polypharmacy in an integrated healthcare delivery system.

      Investigators hypothesize that patients who receive the RightMed® PGx test from OneOme, LLC
      with subsequent counseling of their prescribers by a study pharmacist, as needed, on the
      appropriateness of their prescribed medications will experience lower one-year follow-up
      healthcare utilization and expenditures compared to control patients who receive usual care.

      Primary Objectives:

        1. Healthcare expenditures: 6- and 12-month changes in total healthcare expenditures from
           the Kaiser Permanente Colorado (KPCO) perspective

        2. Healthcare utilization: 6- and 12-month changes in hospitalizations, emergency room
           visits, medical office visits, and telephone encounters

      Secondary Objectives:

        1. Medication changes: Counts of 6-month medication and/or dose adjustments in targeted
           medications

        2. Medication congruence: Description of counts of RightMed test recommendations accepted
           by prescribers

        3. Medication adherence: 6- and 12-month changes in percent of days (PDC) covered for
           targeted medications

        4. Pharmacy expenditures: 6- and 12-month changes in outpatient prescription medication
           expenditures from the KPCO perspective

    <description>Participants randomized to this arm will be sent a kit to collect a genetic sample from a swab of their mouths. The kit will have instructions on how to collect the genetic sample and how to send it in a postage-paid envelope to the testing laboratory (OneOme). OneOme will process the sample and The study pharmacist will scan the results and enter any related information into the participant's KPCO electronic health record. If any changes to the participant's medication(s) are recommended (for example: a dose decrease or increase, stop taking your current medication and start another), the study pharmacist will contact the participant's KPCO prescriber directly to discuss the recommendations. The prescriber may contact the participant to change the participant's medication(s).</description>

    <description>The RightMed test is an end-to-end solution which includes sample collection, PGx testing services, data analysis, and clinical interpretation that helps prescribers select treatments based on evidence-driven predictions of patient drug response and tolerance. Genetic components of an individual's drug response are well established and often included on FDA medication labels. The RightMed test has incorporated existing evidence to classify the risk and likelihood of an antidepressant working for different patients. Patient results for each medication can fall into one of three categories: 1) Green - use as directed; 2) Yellow - use with caution; and 3) Red - adjust dose or choose alternative mediation.</description>
