      A randomized, double-blind, two-group parallel, placebo-controlled clinical Phase III trial

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, two-group parallel, placebo-controlled clinical Phase III
      trial.

      The primary objective is to evaluate the effect of QL1206 treatment compared with placebo in
      Chinese postmenopausal women with osteoporosis at high risk of fracture.

      The secondary objective is to evaluate the clinical safety, immunogenicity and
      pharmacokinetic (PK) characteristics of QL1206 in women with osteoporosis at high risk of
      postmenopausal fracture

      The exploratory purpose is to evaluate the effect of ADA on the characteristics of QL1206 PK
      and the relationship between QL1206 exposure and pharmacodynamic endpoints, efficacy and
      adverse events

      Subjects would sequentially enrolled according to the protocol in one of two cohorts.Subjects
      would receive a single 60mg of QL1206 or placebo every 6 month for1 year(twice for one,
      subcutaneous injection) ,meanwhile taking 500 mg of calcium and 1000IU of vitamin D daily

    <measure>Percent Change in Bone Mineral Density (BMD) at the Lumbar Spine from Baseline up to 12 months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Month 12</time_frame>
    <description>Bone mineral density (BMD) is the amount of bone mineral in bone tissue. BMD scan was done using dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA). It is used to identify osteoporosis, determine risk for fractures, and measure response to osteoporosis treatment. The percentage change from Baseline for BMD was calcuated as the value at the indicated time point minus the Baseline value multiplied by 100 and divided by the Baseline value. The analysis was performed by Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) model adjusted for treatment, region and Baseline BMD for the skeletal site under consideration as a continuous covariate for assessment. Region and treatment by region interaction was included in the model. Screening visit was considered as Baseline for BMD. For participants who withdrew early, the missing BMD assessments was estimated by the Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF), provided the assessment was taken on or after at least three month on-therapy.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline 、 Month 6 and Month 12</time_frame>
    <description>s-CTX is biomarker of bone resorption and formation. s-CTX was assessed during Screening, Month 6 and Month 12 in the Double-blind Treatment Phase. The value during Screening was considered as the Baseline value. Percent change from Baseline was assessed as the value at the indicated visit minus the Baseline value divided by the Baseline value x 100.
s-PINP is biomarker of bone resorption and formation. s-PINP was assessed during Screening, Month 6 and Month 12 in the Double-blind Treatment Phase.
