  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is among the most common malignancies in women in the United States. Over the
      years breast cancer management have dramatically developed from the extensive surgical
      approach toward the breast conservative approach. This was mainly due to the introduction of
      chemotherapy and hormonal therapy. Hormonal therapy in particular has been shown to improve
      the oncological outcomes of the breast cancer. However, while this is well documented in the
      clinical outcomes. Little is known in regards what happens on the genetic level. As such in
      this study the investigators would like to study the genetic and molecular outcomes that
      results after a short term neoadjuvant hormonal therapy on patients with breast cancer.

      The hypothesis of this study is that short-term, preoperative hormonal treatment will induce
      genetic changes associated with reduced proliferation, including lower Ki67 expression, and
      changes in Estrogen Receptor (ER) and Progesterone Receptor (PR) expression. The data from
      such investigation will be very helpful in advancing the individualized care to women with
      breast cancer.
