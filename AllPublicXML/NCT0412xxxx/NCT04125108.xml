  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inhalation burn injury and lung complications caused by large surface burns occurring during
      a fire remains a serious problem. Pulmonary rehabilitation has been used successfully to
      improve pulmonary function(PF) in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. But
      there were no studies that pulmonary rehabilitation induce improvements in PF in patient with
      large surface burn and inhalation injury.

      The investigators will performe pulmonary function and respiratory muscles strength
      evaluation in 40 patients with thermal injury in order to evaluate the effects of pulmonary
      rehabilitation in patients with thermally injury.

      The investigators will performe pulmonary function and respiratory muscles strength
      evaluation in 40 patients with thermal injury in order to evaluate the effects of pulmonary
      rehabilitation in patients with thermally injury.

      The investigators will study 40 patients who had burn injury. Burned patients will be
      randomized into two groups. The experimental group(EG) will participate in a 12-week
      pulmonary rehabilitation program daily for 60 minutes. The control group(CG) will participate
      in a 12-week conventional exercise program daily for 60 minutes. Spirometer will be done to
      evaluate pulmonary function. Pulmonary function tests include forced vital capacity(FVC), 1
      second forced expiratory volume(FEV1), forced expiratory flow rate between 25 and 75% of the
      FVC(FEF 25-75) FEV1/FVC ratio expressed as a percentage(FEV1/FVC %) and peak expiratory
      flow(PEF). Maximum voluntary ventilation(MVV) and respiratory muscles strength(MEP[maximal
      expiratory pressure], MIP[maximal inspiratory pressure]) will be measured by mouth
      pressure-meter in sitting position. Pulmonary function tests will be performed for all groups
      at baseline and after 12 weeks programs. A 6-minute walk test and health-related quality of
      life will be also evaluated.

    <description>Pulmonary rehabilitation programs were designed to include both 30 minutes resistance and 30 minutes aerobic exercises. Eight basic resistnace exercises were used incorporating, bench press, leg press, leg curl, leg extension, toe raises, biceps curl, triceps curl, shoulder press. Additionally each exercise training session also included aerobic conditioning exercises ona treadmill or cycle ergometer. Aerobic exercise training was carried out 5 days per week, with each session lasting 30 minutes. All exercise sessions were preceded by a 5-minutes warm up period on a treadmill set.</description>
