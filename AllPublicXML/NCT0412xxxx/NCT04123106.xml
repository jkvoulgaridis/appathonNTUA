  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative pain still represents an important perioperative issue, affecting more than 80%
      of patients undergoing surgery. A suboptimal pain management doesn't just affects quality of
      life, but can compromise rehabilitation plan, increase morbidity and determine the
      development of chronic pain. Last but not least, far from being just an obligation for
      physicians, a good analgesia is a fundamental right of every patient.

      In order to meet these important demands, a great number of guidelines has been provided, all
      of these underlying that the centerpiece of postoperative analgesia lies in the multimodality
      management, thereby combining different medications and different ways of delivering them,
      with the aim of targeting distinct receptor systems and improving efficacy, while limiting
      side effects.

      In 2018, the investigators conducted a case-series analysis on 17 patients undergoing lumbar
      surgery to find out the role of Sublingual Sufentanil Tablet System (SSTS) in a multimodal
      analgesia regimen. Patients expressed a good pain relief, with most benefit during
      physiotherapy sessions and early discharges, in absence of side effects. Since then, SSTS has
      been part of regular clinical practice in our hospital.

      The aim of this randomized trial is to examine the analgesic efficacy and the opioid sparing
      role in spine surgery of a recently developed regional anesthesia technique, the Erector
      Spinae Plane block (ESP block), as opposed to Local Anaesthetic (LA) wound infiltration.

      The latter is a widespread, simple and unexpensive mean of providing postoperative analgesia.
      On the other hand, ESP block is an ultrasound-guided interfascial plain block, in which LA is
      injected below the erector spine muscle, closer to costotransverse foramina and origin of
      dorsal and ventral rami. It does provide an efficient multidermatomal sensory blockade
      (according to craniocaudal LA spread), with the advantage of being simple and safe.

    <time_frame>At the end of surgery, at PACU arrival.</time_frame>
    <description>NRS scale is a 11-point scale (0-11), with which patients self-report and rate level of breakthrough pain, where 0 is no pain and 10 the worst pain imaginable.</description>

    <measure>Difference in Pain Intensity Difference (PID) at PACU arrival, at 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 60 minutes, 2 hours, 6 hours from PACU arrival.</measure>
    <time_frame>At the end of surgery, at PACU arrival; at 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 60 minutes, 2 hours, 6 hours from PACU arrival</time_frame>
    <description>PID summarizes treatment response over a clinically relevant period. It represents a raw difference in pain intensity (i.e. the difference between the NRS value at each time point from the NRS at PACU arrival) and it is based on NRS data. It ranges from 0 to 10. The higher the value, the better the pain relief, since the greater is the pain intensity difference.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Difference in Sum of Pain Intensity Difference (SPID) at 12, 24, 48, 72 hours from PACU arrival.</measure>
    <time_frame>12 hours, 24 hours, 48 hours, 72 hours from PACU arrival.</time_frame>
    <description>SPID is calculated multiplying the PID score at each time point by the duration (in hours) since the preceding time point, and then summing the values over the relevant time period. SPID represents the sum of the absolute difference in pain intensity. It ranges from 0 to an undefined value, variable according to the time weighted sum. The higher the value, the better the pain relief, since the greater is the pain intensity difference.</description>
