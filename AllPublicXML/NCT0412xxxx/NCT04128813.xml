  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to compare the effectiveness of two types of body vibration
      platform, one vertical and one rotational, through a 12-week training in patients with
      fibromyalgia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single blind randomized controlled trial. Sixty patients of FM will be assigned
      randomly to 3 study groups: 20 patients will be part of the vertical whole body vibration
      experimental group in the EG1, that will perform a neuromuscular treatment using the vertical
      whole body vibration platform, another 20 will constitute the rotational whole body vibration
      experimental group in the EG2, that will perform a neuromuscular treatment using the
      rotational whole body vibration platform, and another 20 will constitute the control group
      (CG). All these subjects will sign the corresponding informed consent for their participation
      in the study, according to the ethical criteria established in the Helsinki Declaration. The
      study will take place between January and December 2016. Three groups of variables were
      analyzed in the present study three times: before, after and follow-up after three months of
      the intervention.

    <description>In the present study, we analyzed the oscillatory body movements during the test performance. Participants were situated below a cam situated above the ground and regulated to be placed at a mean distance of 50 cm. from the participant's head. They were asked to remain in orthostatic position with feet parallel at shoulder height, arms extended along the body and eyes closed for 1 minute.</description>
