  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study compares traditional follow-up of gynaecological cancer patients to an alternative
      follow-up model. In the alternative follow-up model the patients will meet a nurse at every
      second consultation. The nurse will focus on psychosocial health and educate the patients in
      the use of a study specific smartphone-application.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal is to improve follow-up of past and present cancer patients to have the best quality
      of life possible, despite having a serious illness. Todays' survivors differ from the
      survival population for whom the traditional follow-up was designed. Improvements in
      treatment assure that many cancer patients survive longer after diagnosis often with
      age-related comorbidities. Consequently, new evidence-based models for follow-up after cancer
      treatment with focus on techniques to improve coping with and management of late effects
      without increasing the costs are warranted. The chronic care model, which uses
      self-management interventions, is used for many chronic diseases—such as diabetes and asthma
      and is a valid model to consider for cancer follow-up care(1). Another relevant model is the
      risk stratified model where patients are stratified into low, moderate, or high-risk on the
      basis of expected recurrence rate and late-effects(2). Gynecological cancer patients
      constitute an underrepresented group in clinical cancer research.

      The research group has developed a follow-up model based on the principles of the
      risk-stratified model and the chronic care model with one or three year's hospital follow-up
      for low- versus medium/high-risk patients. Physicians will be replaced by nurses in 50% of
      the consultations. The nurses will use evidence-based behavior change techniques to coach the
      cancer patients on how to take an active role in management of their physical and mental late
      effects. These techniques will be further reinforced with a multifunctional smart
      phone-application (app). The &quot;Lifestyle and Empowerment Techniques in Survivorship of
      Gynecologic Oncology-app&quot; (LETSGO-app) has three main functions: 1) Self-evaluated symptoms
      (on recurrence or late effects) regularly reported through the app; 2) Targeted information
      on treatment, signs of recurrence, and late-effects on each cancer type and 3) Facilitation
      of early rehabilitation through physical activity instructions, goal-setting and electronic
      reminders.

      The investigators will conduct a multicenter study including 754 cancer survivors in Norway.
      Ten Norwegian hospitals will participate whereof five hospitals are intervention hospitals
      and five are control hospitals.

    <description>Evaluating the immediate effects of self-management interventions in cancer follow-up. It contains the following domains: Health-directed activities, Positive and active engagement in life, Emotional distress, Constructive attitudes and approaches, Self-monitoring and insight, Skill and technique acquisition, Social integration and support, Health service navigation. Individuals are asked to indicate their level of agreement with 42 statements across the eight domains on four-point Likert scales (1 &quot;strongly disagree&quot; to 4 &quot;Strongly agree&quot;). Higher scores indicate greater performance of specific self-management behaviors. Higher scores on the emotional well-being domain denote higher levels of negative affect. Data from each domain will be used individually and the results reported as mean domain score. The primary outcome is the change of the insight subscale scores of the HEI-Q from right after treatment (baseline) to 12 months after treatment.</description>

    <measure>Patients' score on the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30), measuring ´Health related quality of life (HRQL)</measure>
    <time_frame>Questionnaires are administered at end of treatment, 3, 6, 12, 24 and 36 months after treatment, respectively</time_frame>
    <description>The EORTC QLQ-C30 uses for the questions 1 to 28 a 4-point scale. The scale scores from 1 to 4: 1 (&quot;Not at all&quot;), 2 (&quot;A little&quot;), 3 (&quot;Quite a bit&quot;) and 4 (&quot;Very much&quot;). Half points are not allowed. For the raw score, lower scored are considered a better outcome. The EORTC QLQ-C30 uses for the questions 29 and 30 a 7-points scale. The scale scores from 1 to 7: 1 (&quot;very poor&quot;) to 7 (&quot;excellent&quot;). Half points are not allowed. Firstly, raw score has to be calculated with mean values. Afterwards linear transformation is performed Higher transformed scores are considered a better outcome. We will analyze change in Global Health Status and other subscales of the C30 questionnaire from end of treatment to 12, 24 and 36 months, respectively.</description>

    <measure>Changes in physical activity level based on International Physical Activity Questionnaire - Short Form (IPAQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to 12, 24 and 36 months after completion of primary treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Physical activity level will be measured using the short-form of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ). The measure uses open-ended questions covering an individual's last 7-day recall of physical activity. There are no subscales. IPAQ-SF quantifies physical activity during the last seven days divided into four categories: vigorous intensity, moderate intensity, walking and sitting. In addition to intensity, frequency and duration of physical activity are assessed. Using the instrument's scoring protocol, weekly physical activity will be estimated by weighting time spent in each activity intensity with its estimated metabolic equivalent (MET) energy expenditure. The scoring protocol assigns the following MET values to walking, moderate, and vigorous intensity activity: 3.3 METs, 4.0 METs, and 8.0 METs, respectively.</description>

    <description>Cost-effectiveness from the health care perspective using the EuroQol five-Dimensional (EQ5D) measure. EQ5D measures individual generic health status using 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression, and each dimension has 5 levels depending on severity of symptoms (1 no problems, 5 extreme problems) and a VAS (visual analogue scale ranging from 0-100). The scores can then be converted into a single index number. The index value will be used for calculation of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) for a health economic analysis of the intervention. Crude differences between groups will be assessed.</description>
