  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In recent years, with the improvement of the material living standards of the investigators
      residents and the change of working lifestyle, the prevalence and mortality of coronary heart
      disease (CHD) in urban and rural residents in China have increased year by year. According to
      statistics, the number of patients with coronary heart disease in China is currently 11
      million. Coronary heart disease has become a major health problem in China. At present, it is
      found that inflammatory reaction and oxidative stress factors are involved in the occurrence
      and development of coronary heart disease, and their indicators such as heart rate
      variability are related to the prognosis of coronary heart disease. Fastigial nucleus
      stimulation (FNS) has been widely used in the treatment of various diseases such as
      cerebrovascular disease, migraine, and eye diseases. The study found that FNS can reduce
      inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress factors in ischemic myocardium and improve heart
      rate variability in rats with myocardial infarction. The aim of this study was to investigate
      whether FNS can improve the aforementioned indicators and clinical outcomes in patients with
      coronary heart disease.
