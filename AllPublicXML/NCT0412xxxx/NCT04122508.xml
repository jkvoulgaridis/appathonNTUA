    <textblock>
      Neglect insidiously affects a child's overall health in all aspects. The aim of this study
      was to determine whether the presence of siblings caused dental neglect, and whether there
      was a relationship between dental neglect and anxiety.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dental neglect is an intentional failure of parents or caregivers to take precautions and
      fulfil necessary dental treatment, and has a close relationship with dental caries and
      anxiety. Oral health status of the children was evaluated using the DMFT/dmft, PUFA/pufa, and
      OHI-S indices. In addition, the parents completed the Dental Neglect Scale (DNS) and a
      questionnaire, and the Modified Child Dental Anxiety Scale (MCDASf) was administered to the
      children to assess their dental anxiety.

    <description>The effects of presence of siblings on oral health and dental neglect was assessed using dental neglect scale. The dental neglect scale for children was originally composed of seven statements, using a Likert scale ranging from one to five . The total score of DNS can range from 7 to 35, with higher scores representing greater dental neglect.</description>

    <description>the effects of presence of siblings on oral health and dental neglect was assessed using oral hygiene index . The OHI-S has two elements, the Debris Index and the Calculus Index. The Debris Index and the Calculus Index can range from 0 to 3, the oral hygiene index values from 0 to 6.</description>

    <description>the effects of presence of siblings on oral health and dental neglect was assessed using, DMFT/dmft index. caries (D/d), missing due to caries (M/m), filling (F/f) teeth were recorded using DMF-T indices for permanent teeth and dmf-t indices for primary teeth.</description>

    <description>the effects of presence of siblings on oral health and dental neglect was assessed using pufa index. The index recorded the presence of visible pulp involvement (P/p), mucosal ulceration due to root fragments (U/u), fistulae (F/f) and/or abscessess (A/a). Higher scores represents worse oral health.</description>

    <measure>to evaluate whether there was a correlation between dental neglect and anxiety in children</measure>
    <time_frame>for eight months from the beginning of the study</time_frame>
    <description>the relationship between dental neglect and anxiety was evaluated using Modified Child Dental Anxiety Scale (MCDASf). MCDASf, which is a validated and reliable indicator for the measurement of dental anxiety in children was used. Children in this study were asked to complete the MCDASf, which covers eight multiple choice statements with five faces ranging from 1 (not anxious), to 5 (extremely anxious). The total score on the MCDASf was calculated for each subject (ranging from 5: little or no dental anxiety, to 40: severe dental anxiety.</description>
