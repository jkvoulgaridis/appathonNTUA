  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading neurodegenerative disease of aging characterized by
      multiple cognitive impairments. Given the recent failures of disease-modifying drugs, the
      current focus is on preventing or mitigating synaptic damage that correlates with cognitive
      decline in AD patients. Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) is a safe,
      non-invasive, non-painful electrical stimulation of the brain that is shown to act as a
      primer at the synaptic level when administered along with behavioral therapy, mostly
      involving language, learning and memory. Previous studies have shown that tDCS over the left
      angular gyrus (AG) improves language associative learning in the elderly through changes in
      functional connectivity between the AG and the hippocampus. The investigators' previous
      clinical trial on the effects of tDCS in neurodegenerative disorders has also shown augmented
      effects of lexical retrieval for tDCS. In the present study the investigators will compare
      the effects of active vs. sham tDCS over the AG—an area that is part of the default mode
      network but also a language area, particularly important for semantic integration and event
      processing—in two predominant AD variants: probable AD with amnesic phenotype
      (amnesic/typical AD) and probable AD with non-amnesic (language deficit) phenotype also
      described as logopenic variant PPA with AD pathology (aphasic/atypical AD). The investigators
      aim to: (1) determine whether active high-definition tDCS (HD-tDCS) targeting the left AG
      combined with a Word-List Learning Intervention (WordLLI) will improve verbal learning; (2)
      identify the changes in functional connectivity between the stimulated area (AG) and other
      structurally and functionally connected areas using resting-state functional magnetic
      resonance imaging; (3) identify changes in the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA at the
      stimulation site using magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Furthermore, the investigators need
      to determine the characteristics of the people that may benefit from the new neuromodulatory
      approaches. For this reason, the investigators will evaluate neural and cognitive functions
      as well as physiological characteristics such as sleep, and will analyze the moderating
      effects on verbal learning outcomes. Study results can help provide treatment alternatives as
      well as a better understanding of the therapeutic and neuromodulatory effects of tDCS in AD,
      thus improving patients' and caregivers' quality of life.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigation implements a double-blind, sham-controlled, within-subject, cross-over
      design that allows for the evaluation of the cognitive and neural effects of word-list
      learning as modulated by tDCS compared to sham stimulation. Participants in all groups will
      receive word-list learning intervention (WordLLI)+ High-Definition tDCS (HD-tDCS) or WordLLI+
      sham in Period 1 or 2, randomized for the Period 1 stimulation condition. Each learning
      Period will last 2 weeks, with 5 learning sessions per week (for a total of 10 learning
      sessions per Period) with a 3-month (stimulation-free) wash-out period between the two
      Periods. The intensity, total number of learning sessions and number of learning items is
      consistent with most other tDCS studies in neurodegenerative disorders and the investigators
      have used this design successfully over the past 7 years in neurodegenerative disorders (PPA,
      mild AD). Stimulation is implemented every weekday to take advantage of the long-term
      potentiation induced by tDCS as found in early multi-session studies. A tDCS-only condition
      (without any intervention) is not implemented in this design because no study to date has
      shown improvement on motor, cognitive, or language performance after anodal tDCS-only for 2
      or even more weeks. After each period the investigators will perform 1-month and 3-month
      follow-up sessions for evaluation purposes. For those participants who are long-distance, at
      the 1-month time point only the investigators may use a video conferencing tool such as
      GoToMeeting to administer the assessments. This is to mitigate the costs of travel for a
      short appointment.

    <description>Stimulation will be delivered by a battery-driven constant current stimulator. The electrical current will be administered to a pre-specified region of the brain (angular gyrus). The stimulation will be delivered at an intensity of 2 milliamperes (mA) (estimated current density 0.04 mA/cm2; estimated total charge 0.048 Coulombs/cm2) in a ramp-like fashion for a maximum of 20 minutes.</description>

    <description>Participants will receive a word list learning intervention (WordLLI) of semantically related and unrelated word lists. Word lists are presented across 10 trials, with an additional trial after a 10-minute delay to assess delayed recall. Immediately following verbal presentation of word lists during each trial, participants will be instructed to recall as many of the words from the list as possible. Participants may use the written modality as a strategy during recall. Word lists include 12 words matched based on psycholinguistics attributes (e.g., imageability, frequency). This task is designed to help participants improve memory via enhancing list learning capabilities.</description>

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        For the aphasic/atypical AD participants:

          -  Must be between 50-75 years of age.

          -  Must be right-handed.

          -  Must be proficient in English.

          -  Must have a minimum of high-school education.

          -  Must be diagnosed as logopenic variant Primary Progressive Aphasia (PPA) with
             Alzheimer's Disease (AD) biomarkers. Other possible diagnosis for the 'aphasic AD'
             variant would be Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) or 'possible AD' according to 2011
             guidelines with AD biomarkers (CSF or positron emission tomography (PET) amyloid-beta
             or fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET) with unihemispheric
             atrophy).

          -  Participants will be diagnosed from PPA and early dementias clinics at Johns Hopkins
             University or other specialized centers in US using current consensus criteria.
             Diagnosis will be based on neuropsychological testing, language testing (most commonly
             the Western Aphasia Battery), MRI and clinical assessment. The investigators will also
             use two new variant classification tests the investigators have developed at the lab
             which discriminate PPA variants with great accuracy (above 80%): a spelling test and a
             speech production test (i.e.,Cookie Theft picture description task).

        For the amnesic/typical AD participants:

          -  Must be between 50-75 years of age.

          -  Must be right-handed.

          -  Must be proficient in English.

          -  Must have a minimum of high-school education.

          -  Must be diagnosed with 'probable AD' in specialized diagnostic centers with
             neuropsychological (e.g., RAVLT) and AD biomarkers according to 2011 guidelines.

          -  The investigators will also perform extensive testing in the investigators' test
             battery including the Mnemonic Similarity Test (MST) that discriminates and measures
             the most salient hippocampal deficit-pattern separation (PS).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  People with previous neurological disease including vascular dementia (e.g., stroke,
             developmental dyslexia, dysgraphia or attentional deficit).

          -  People with hearing loss (&gt; 25 decibel, using audiometric hearing screen).

          -  People with uncorrected visual acuity loss.

          -  People with advanced dementia or severe language impairments (MMSE &lt; 15, or Montreal
             Cognitive Assessment &lt;10, or language Frontotemporal Dementia-specific Clinical
             Dementia Rating (FTD-CDR) = 3).

          -  Left handed individuals.

          -  People with pre-existing psychiatric disorders such as behavioral disturbances, severe
             depression, or schizophrenia that do not allow these people to comply or follow the
             study schedule and requirements such as repeated evaluation and therapy.

        Exclusion Criteria for MRI Participation:

          -  People with severe claustrophobia.

          -  People with cardiac pacemakers or ferromagnetic implants.

          -  Pregnant women.
