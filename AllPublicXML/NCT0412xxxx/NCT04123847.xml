  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will determine the level of functional gain, below the injury for voluntary
      control of movements, and recovery standing and stepping function as a result of activation
      of spinal circuits with scES in humans with severe paralysis. Training will consist of
      practicing stepping, standing and voluntary movements in the presence of specific scES
      configurations designed specific for stepping (Step-scES), specific for standing (Stand-scES)
      and for the voluntary movements of the legs and trunk (Vol-scES). Ability to step, stand,
      move voluntarily, as well as cardiovascular, respiratory, bladder, bowel and sexual function
      will be assessed in these individuals with chronic severe spinal cord injury.
