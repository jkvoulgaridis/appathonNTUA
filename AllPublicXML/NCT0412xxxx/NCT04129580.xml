  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This randomized controlled trial research study will enroll 200 subjects, where half will be
      randomly assigned to treatment as usual (TAU) and the app, reSET-O (n = 100), and half will
      be assigned to TAU only (n = 100), in order to evaluate treatment retention rates in
      individuals with opioid use disorder after initiating medication assisted treatment. All
      subjects will participate in the study for a total of six months, and all subjects will
      attend five research appointments across the six months. Participants assigned to TAU +
      reSET-O will be expected to engage with the app, reSET-O, for the full six months. The app
      works as an extension of cognitive behavioral therapy as it provides psychoeducation related
      to opioid dependence and use, and is designed as an adjunctive treatment with medication
      assisted treatment for opioid use disorder.

    <measure>Retention in treatment on MAT for 6 months after enrolling in the study</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>reSET-O is a mobile app designed to provide extended cognitive behavioral therapy for patients initiating medication assisted treatment (MAT) for opioid use disorder (OUD). The first outcome being measure is treatment retention. We want to examine if participants enrolled in the study will maintain on MAT for 6 months after enrollment. This will be evaluated based on the number of appointments attended by the research participants. Data mining through our systems electronic medical record (EMR) will be conducted in order to count the number of attended appointments for study participants to gauge their treatment retention.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Opioid and other substance abuse as assessed through participant self-report</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Part of this study is looking at the effect of reSET-o on substance use. This will be measured by participant self-report on the Timeline Follow Back Questionnaire (TLFB). The TLFB is a self-report measure that gages the participant's memory by using a calendar to assess drug use within a specific period of time. The number of endorsed drugs used (as indicated by the participant) will be counted and recorded for each research visit.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cravings to use drugs as assessed by the reSET-O app</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Part of this study is looking at the effect of reSET-O on 6 month adherence and mediation of improvements in quality of life outcomes such as cravings to use drugs. This is captured in the reSET-O app as part of the programmed surveys that participants are asked to complete once pinged by the app. These surveys utilize a likert scale to ask the participant if they have experienced any cravings and the severity of said cravings (1 = mild cravings; 4=severe cravings). These ratings will assess total number of cravings and severity of cravings for the duration of the study (24 weeks) or up until the participant stops using the app; whichever comes first.</description>
