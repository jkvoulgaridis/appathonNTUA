  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to understand the efficacy of PTNS versus a placebo in the
      treatment of female sexual dysfunction syndrome.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of PTNS in treating patients with FSD. We
      will be recruiting 66 patients, who will be randomized (1:1) to either the PTNS group or the
      Sham group. The patients in the PTNS group will receive one PTNS treatment per week for 12
      weeks. The patients in the Sham group will receive one sham treatment per week for 12 weeks.
      Patients in both groups will be asked to complete questionnaires before the start of the
      treatment, as well as after 12-weeks of treatment to assess the changes in the severity of
      their symptoms

      Aim 1: To evaluate the effect of percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation (PTNS), compared to a
      validated sham, on sexual functioning in women with female sexual dysfunction (FSD).

      Aim 2: To compare the effect of PTNS on lower urinary tract symptoms versus sexual
      functioning in patient with FSD.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, at week 6 and at week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) is a 19-item questionnaire used to assess female sexual function. Minimum score is 1.2 and maximum score is 36. A score of 26.55 or lower is classified as sexual dysfunction</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Arizona Sexual Experiences Scale (ASEX)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, at week 6 and at week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Arizona Sexual Experiences Scale (ASEX) is a 5-item rating scale that quantifies sex drive, arousal, vaginal lubrication/penile erection, ability to reach orgasm, and satisfaction from orgasm. Possible total scores range from 5 to 30, with the higher scores indicating more sexual dysfunction.</description>

    <measure>Change in Prolapse/Urinary Incontinence Sexual-12 (PISQ-12 ) Function Questionnaire (PISQ- 12)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, at week 6 and at week 12</time_frame>
    <description>PISQ-12 is a 12-item questionnaire used to assess sexual function in women with pelvic organ prolapse or urinary incontinence. Possible total scores range from 0 to 48, with the lower scores indicating more sexual dysfunction.</description>

    <measure>Change in Urinary Distress Inventory (UDI-6)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, at week 6 and at week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Urinary Distress Inventory (UDI-6) is a 6-item questionnaire used to assess lower urinary tract symptoms in women. Possible total scores range from 0 to 18, with the higher scores indicating more urogenital distress.</description>

    <description>The PTNS treatments will be given in 30 min sessions. The PTNS treatment consists of inserting a 34-gauge needle electrode approximately 5 cm cephalad to the medial malleolus and, as well as placing a PTNS surface electrode on the ipsilateral calcaneus. To keep the electrode placement consistent with the sham treatment, 2 inactive transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) surface electrodes are also added, 1 placed under the little toe and 1 on the top of the foot. The PTNS lead set is connected to the Urgent PC stimulator, and a current level of 0.5 to 10 mA at 20 Hz is delivered until the flexion of the big toe is observed or the patient reports a radiating sensation at the sole of the foot.</description>

    <intervention_name>Sham procedure</intervention_name>
    <description>The sham treatment, involves simulating the sensation of the PTNS needle insertion at the same location using a Steritberger placebo needle. This is a blunt tip needle which simulates the sensation of a needle prick when touched to the skin, however, the blunt tip retracts into the handle when pressed into the skin. This creates the illusion of the needle entering the skin, without breaking the skin's surface. An inactive PTNS surface electrode is also placed on the ipsilateral calcaneus. The two TENS surface electrodes, placed in the same location as the PTNS treatment, are active and deliver stimulation mimicking the sensory effects of the PTNS. However, since no electrode needles were inserted near the tibial nerve, there will be no tibial nerve stimulation</description>
