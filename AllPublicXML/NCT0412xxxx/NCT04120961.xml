  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Since the development of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in patients with coronary
      heart disease (CHD), unfractionated heparin (UFH) and low molecular weight heparin (LWMH)
      have been the preferred anticoagulants in peri-operative period. However, UFH has some
      defects, such as incomplete and unstable inhibition of thrombin, large individual
      differences, multiple monitoring of activated coagulation time (ACT), ineffective thrombin
      binding to fibrin, non-specific protein binding and induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). Compared
      with UFH, LWMH has lower non-specific protein binding rate, but it is not superior to UFH in
      efficacy, hemorrhage and HIT.

      Bivalirudin can bind specifically to thrombin catalytic site and anionic external binding
      site, directly inhibit thrombin activity, thereby inhibiting thrombin-catalyzed and induced
      reactions. At the same time, thrombin can also inactivate it by enzymatic hydrolysis of
      bivalirudin. Therefore, the inhibition of bivalirudin on thrombin is reversible and
      transient, and the risk of bleeding after drug withdrawal is relative small. It has been
      reported that bivalirudin can significantly reduce the risk of peri-operative bleeding during
      PCI period compared with UFH. Clopidogrel had not yet played a role in most patients after
      emergency PCI, and there was a &quot;blank period&quot; for 2-4 hours without effective antithrombotic
      concentration, which was also the peak period of acute stent thrombosis. Han and coworkers
      have shown that for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients undergoing emergency PCI,
      whether or not glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors were added, delayed peri-operative injection
      of bivalrudin was significantly better than UFH in terms of net clinical adverse event.
      However, for patients with elective PCI (ePCI), delayed bivalirudin injection was only used
      in some patients in REPLACE-2 and ISAR-REACT-3 studies, and the delayed time of bivalrudin
      use after ePCI was not definite.

      Therefore, in the current study we aim to explore the efficacy and safety of delayed
      bivalirudin injection 4 hours after elective PCI in patients with CHD.

      The current study is designed as a single-center, randomized and prospective study aiming to
      evaluate the safety and efficacy of delayed continuous use of bivalirudin 4 hours after ePCI
      for the treatment of peri-operative myocardial injury (PMI) compared with bivalirudin use
      during ePCI. Based on previous study reported and estimated 10% loss follow-up of these
      patients in each arm, a total of 330 patients with CHD were required in our study, and with
      165 patients per group as a ratio of 1:1 randomization.
