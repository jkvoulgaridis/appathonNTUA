      The patients who applied to the hospital for orthodontic treatment were asked various
      questions to evaluate their oral health related quality of life, malocclusions and self
      reported temporomandibular joint problems. For this purposes Oral Health Impact Profile-14,
      and Helkimo's indexes were used.The relationship between these results were investigated.

    <description>To evaluate the Oral Health-related Quality of Life, Turkish version of Oral Health Impact Profile-14 was used. Responses were made on a scale 0 (never), 1(hardly ever), 2 (occasionally), 3 (fairly often),and 4 (very often).Oral Health-related Quality of Life impairment was characterized by the Oral Health Impact Profile-14 summary score (the sum of all 14 items, potential range 0-56). Higher Oral Health Impact Profile-14 scores mean worse Oral Health-related Quality of Life and vice versa.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Helkimo's anamnestic dysfunction index</arm_group_label>
    <description>As a method based on patient feedback for the determination of the degree of temporomandibular disorders, anamnestic index was used. For this purpose eight questions were asked to the patients that includes answers as 'yes' or 'no'. (Table 2) The analyses of the questionnaire was done according to anamnestic scale as 0: no symptoms; I: mild symptoms (sensation of the jaw fatigue, jaw stiffness, and temporomandibular joint sounds as clicking or crepitus) and II:severe symptoms (included one or more of the following: Difficulty in the mouth opening, jaw locking, mandible dislocation and its painful movement and painful temporomandibular joint region and/or masticatory muscles)</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Visual analog scale (VAS) for facial pain:</arm_group_label>
    <description>Facial pain was measured by asking the patients if they had had any pain during last 12 months and made them mark the intensity of the pain on a visual analog scale which had the anchor points at the left (no pain) and right (worse pain) ends of a 10 cm horizontal line. The analyses of the facial pain was done as fallowing: if the patient marked no facial pain the Visual analog scale value was accepted as 0 and if the patient marked any level of facial pain Visual analog scale value was accepted as 1.</description>
