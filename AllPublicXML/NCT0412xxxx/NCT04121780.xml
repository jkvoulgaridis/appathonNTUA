  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial with an
      open-label extension to evaluate the efficacy of growth hormone (GH) on cognitive functions
      of retired professional football players with growth hormone deficiency (GHD).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      GHD is the most common anterior pituitary abnormality after traumatic brain injury (TBI). It
      can occur as a result of either direct pituitary or indirect hypothalamic injury.
      Sports-related repetitive head trauma might induce pituitary dysfunction, and in particular,
      isolated GHD. Growth hormone replacement therapy (GHRT) has long been known to have a
      beneficial effect on body composition and exercise capacity. However, it has recently been
      shown that GHRT also benefits the brain. The primary objective of the current study is to
      assess the effect of GH on memory, executive function and attention domains of cognitive
      function in GHD- professional football players with TBI. The study will also utilize the
      adult growth hormone deficiency assessment (AGHDA) questionnaire, quantitative
      electroencephalogram (QEEG) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques, respectively, to
      measure the quality of life (QoL), electrical activity and structural changes in the brain
      that may correspond to cognitive deficits.

    <measure>Cognitive functions- Working Memory</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to 1-year post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>To assess change in working memory from base line to 1 yr post-treatment. Working memory will be reported as an index score based on scaled scores for the digit span subtest and symbol span subtest. Index scores have a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 15. The typical range of index score is 45 to 155. Higher scores reflect better functioning. The scaled scores have a mean of 10 and a standard deviation of 3. Scores range from 1 to 19. Higher scores reflect better functioning.</description>

    <measure>Cognitive functions- Processing Speed</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to 1-year post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>To assess change in Processing Speed from baseline to 1 yr post-treatment. Processing speed will be reported as an index score based on scaled scores of digit symbol subtest and symbol search subtest. Index scores have a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 15. The typical range of index score is 45 to 155. Higher scores reflect better functioning. The scaled scores have a mean of 10 and a standard deviation of 3. Scores range from 1 to 19. Higher scores reflect better functioning.
Trail Making Test A will also be used to assess processing speed. Reported as T-score. Higher scores reflect better performance.</description>
