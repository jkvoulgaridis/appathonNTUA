  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to assess the prevalence and severity of dementia in an established cohort of
      community-dwelling older adults living in three neighboring rural Ecuadorian villages
      (Atahualpa, El Tambo, and Prosperidad), as well as to evaluate clinical and neuroimaging
      correlates of dementia in the study population. By the use of the Clinical Dementia Rating
      Scale (CDRS), the study also aims to assess the lower cutoff of the MoCA that better
      correlates with the occurrence of dementia in the study population. In addition, this study
      will provides grounds for the initiation of a prospective cohort study to assess factors
      influencing the development of dementia in the follow-up.

      The Three Villages Study is a population-based prospective cohort study designed to reduce
      the increasing burden of cognitive decline and dementia in rural Ecuador. Before the study,
      our Executive Committee met with community leaders to explain the aims of the study and to
      learn about the culture and traditions of villagers. Field personnel were trained to assure
      uniformity in data collection. With the aid of satellite view (Google Earth, Google Inc.,
      Mountain View, CA), updated sketches of the villages were performed to identify blocks and
      houses.

      The study initially will follow a 3-Phase cross-sectional design. During Phase I, Atahualpa,
      El Tambo, and Prosperidad residents aged 60 years or more will be identified by means of a
      door-to-door survey and interviewed with validated questionnaires to identify those with
      relevant risk factors and suspected conditions of interest. In Phase II, certified
      neurologists will examine suspected cases as well as random samples of negative individuals,
      to assess reliability of field instruments and to determine prevalence of the investigated
      conditions. In Phase III, enrolled individuals will be invited to undergo complementary
      tests. Thereafter, incoming residents will be recruited and followed-up by means of yearly
      door-to-door surveys and other overlapping sources to estimate incidence of the disorders of
      interest.

    <description>The MoCA was mainly designed to separate normal individuals to those with MCI. However, a major limitation of the MoCA is its lack of accuracy for identifying persons with dementia. Therefore, the use of more complex field instruments (yet, feasible to apply in individuals living in rural settings) is needed to determine the burden of dementia and its cerebrovascular correlates in rural communities. In this regard, the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale (CDRS) is a useful tool to assess people living in these settings for establishing the burden and severity of dementia as well as to further assess clinical and neuroimaging correlates of this condition.</description>

        Atahualpa, el Tambo and Prosperidad are representative of rural villages of Coastal
        Ecuador, and were selected because they achieve several requisites to be considered optimal
        settings for the practice of epidemiological studies. The villages have a low index of
        migration rate. Inhabitants are homogeneous regarding race/ethnicity, lifestyles and diet,
        which is rich in oily fish. Residents are Ecuadorian natives with little evidence of
        cross-breading (Amerindians). Almost all men belong to the blue-collar class and most women
        are homemakers.
