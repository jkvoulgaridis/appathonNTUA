  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is being done to learn what effect 12 months of treatment with oral
      hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) will have on the retina in people with retinitis pigmentosa (RP).
      The hypothesis is that treatment with HCQ is safe and tolerable in patients with autosomal
      dominant retinitis pigmentosa (adRP) caused by P23H-RHO, and may arrest progression of
      retinal degeneration by altering the autophagy pathway in photoreceptors.

      Participants that meet eligibility and agree to the study will be asked to take the study
      medication (HCQ) for 12 months and have evaluations for up to approximately 18 months from
      the baseline visit. There will be a total of 6 visits (1 is a phone visit) and will include
      general examinations, blood work, electrocardiograms, along with special testing of the
      retina.
