      To evaluate the safety and efficacy of the Chinese domestic endoscopic instrument control
      system in clinical treatment.This clinical trial is a prospective, multi-center, randomized,
      single-blind, parallel-controlled study. The system used in the experimental group is the
      endoscopic instrument control system developed by WEGO Surgical Robot Co., Ltd., and the
      system used in the control group is the da Vinci endoscopic instrument control system
      developed by Intuitive Surgical. Before patients are enrolled in this clinical study, the
      researchers will do a detailed screening of the subjects based on the inclusion criteria and
      the exclusion criteria to determine if the patients are appropriate for the clinical study.
      Patients who meet the conditions of the study will be required to sign an informed consent
      form. Then they will be randomly assigned to the experimental group or the control group. To
      evaluate the primary outcome measures and secondary outcome measures and to observe the
      incidence of organ and vascular injury. Finally, we evaluate the safety and efficacy of the
      test product through the comparison of the data obtained from the experimental group and the
      control group during the treatment.

    <measure>Comprehensive Complication Index (CCI)</measure>
    <time_frame>an average of 5 days after operation</time_frame>
    <description>CCI is calculated using online tools provided by http://cci.assessurgery.com. Based on the Clavien-Dindo complications grade system (appendix.1), all complications and adverse events after surgical intervention are taken into consideration. The overall incidence is measured on a scale ranging from 0 (no complication) to 100 (death).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Operative time</measure>
    <time_frame>within 12 hours after operation</time_frame>
    <description>The length of time from the beginning of the operation after the robot installation to the end of the suture of the incision.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Intraoperative bleeding</measure>
    <time_frame>within 12 hours after operation</time_frame>
    <description>The total bleeding volume from the beginning of the operation to the end of the suture of the incision. It can be calculated by measuring the blood volume in the vacuum suction device and weighing the gauze after using them to wipe the bleeding.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Postoperative pain</measure>
    <time_frame>within 24 hours after operation</time_frame>
    <description>Postoperative pain is assessed by visual analogue scale (VAS) 24-26 hours after the operation, ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (maximum pain).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Surgeon's satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>within 12 hours after operation</time_frame>
    <description>After the operation, surgeons fill a questionnaire to score the flexibility, intuition and stability of the products, as well as their sense of delay and fatigue when using the products. Each question in the score ranges from 1 to 5 points and the total score is 100.</description>
