  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to compare the efficacy and safety between moisturizing cream containing 12%
      ammonium lactate and 10% urea in geriatric with xerosis cutis. A double-blind randomized
      controlled trial with matching paired subject was conducted on 40 residents of a nursing home
      in Jakarta. Specified symptom sum score (SRRC), skin capacitance (SCap), transepidermal water
      loss (TEWL), and side effects were measured at baseline, week-2 and week-4 after therapy, and
      week-5 one week after therapy cessation. After a week of preconditioning, each subject
      received two different moisturizing creams to be applied on separate lower limbs.

    <textblock>
      Dry skin or xerosis cutis is widely known skin health issue in geriatric population with
      prevalence rate ranges between 29.5 - 85.5%. One of the internal etiological factors is
      decreased production of natural moisturizing factor as a humectant. Application of
      moisturizer is the mainstay treatment. Moisturizer with humectant property, like lactate and
      urea, could restore skin hydration and barrier dysfunction. This study aims to compare the
      efficacy and safety between moisturizing cream containing 12% ammonium lactate and 10% urea
      in geriatric with xerosis cutis.
