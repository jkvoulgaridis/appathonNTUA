      The aim of this study to investigate the effectiveness of trigger point treatments (ischemic
      compression) on pain intensity, chronic pain severity, range of motion(ROM), pain pressure
      threshold (PPT) and functionality on patient with temporomandibular joint dysfunction.(TMD)

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      TMD is most common of pain and functional limitations of jaw. The ischemic compression and
      the exercises (Rocabado's 6x6 exercises and posture exercises) each relieve pain and increase
      funcitonality on TMD but which one has the more effect should be investigated.

      The ROCABODO's 6x6 exercise program, which is a special for temporomandibular joint, includes
      repetitive movements that include patient education, patient self-care, lifestyle
      modifications, and recognizing which actions have the effect of increasing the symptoms of an
      individual's active participation. The repetitive movements relax the chewing muscles and
      reduce pain by helping the synovial fluid move along the joint surfaces, increasing
      circulation, removing joint nutrition, and removing the metabolites of articular cartilage.

      Postural exercise is commonly used for pain/tension in neck or back, but can also be applied
      in the orofacial region, aiming to relief muscle symptoms such as pain, tension, stiffness,
      and tiredness ,by improving the position of the head or the mandibular. It is believed that
      wrong head position can cause muscle pain due to acceleration of muscle activity in the neck
      and jaw muscles, as well as postural reflex. Postural exercise includes head posture
      correction and myofascial release.

      Ischemic compression, that is a frequently used manual pressure technique, is a pressure
      application that is applied with the thumb to the maximum tolerable pain point on the trigger
      points. With this application, the sense of pain signals reduce pain by inhibiting the sense
      of touch signals.

      The aim of this study to investigate the effectiveness of trigger point treatments (ischemic
      compression) on pain intensity, chronic pain severity, ROM, PPT and functionality on patient
      with TMD. 42 patients were randomized into 2 groups : Group 2 (n:21) received only exercises
      (Rocabado's 6x6 exercises and posture exercises) as treatment, Group 1(n:21) received
      exercises (Rocabado's 6x6 exercises and posture exercises) and ischemic compression as
      treatment.The rest, activity and night pain in activity were assessed by visual analog scale,
      ROM assessed by a ruler and PPT assessed by a digital algometer at baseline (before
      treatment), after 1week treatment, after 2 week treatment and after 4 week treatment. Chronic
      pain severity were assessed by Graded Chronic Pain Scale version 2 and functionality were
      assessed by Jaw Function Limitation Scale-8 at baseline (before treatment) and after 4 week
      treatment. The efect size was calculated for the assessments used in the study.

    <intervention_model_description>Individuals included in the study were randomized into two groups ; Group 1 : Exercises + ischemic compression Group 2 : Exercises
Rocabado's 6x6 jaw exercises are shown to be applied to both groups for 4 weeks. After 1 week, posture exercises are added to the exercise programs of the patients.
In addition to the exercises, Group 1 is given a total of 4 sessions of trigger point treatment after the initial evaluation, 1 week later, 2 weeks later and 4 weeks later.</intervention_model_description>

    <measure>Visual Analog Scale (VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>The rest, activity and night pain in activity were assessed by VAS at before and after 1 week of treatment, before and after 2 weeks of treatment, before and after 4 weeks of treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>Pain intensity was assessed using the VAS; each patient was asked the pain during the rest, activity and at night (on a 0-10 numerical pain rating scale with zero corresponding to no pain and 10 corresponding to terrible pain). The rest, activity and night pain in activity were assessed by VAS at before and after 1 week of treatment, before and after 2 weeks of treatment, before and after 4 weeks of treatment.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Graded Chronic Pain Scale version 2 (GCPS v2)</measure>
    <time_frame>Chronic pain severity was assessed by GCPS v2 at before and after 4 weeks of treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>Chronic pain severity was assesed using the GCPS v2. Scores are calculated for 3 subscales: the characteristic pain intensity score, which ranges from 0-100, is calculated as the mean intensity ratings for reported current, worst, and average pain; the disability score, which ranges from 0-100, is calculated as the mean rating for difficulty performing daily, social, and work activities; and the disability points score, which ranges from 0-3, is derived from a combination of ranked categories of number of disability days and disability score. The 3 subscale scores are used to classify subjects into 1 of the 5 pain severity grades: grade 0 for no pain, grade I for low disability-low intensity, grade II for low disability-high intensity, grade III for high disability-moderately limiting, and grade IV for high disability-severely limiting. Chronic pain severity was assessed by GCPS v2 at before and after 4 weeks of treatment.</description>

    <measure>Jaw Range of Motions (ROM)</measure>
    <time_frame>ROM were assessed by a ruler at before and after 1 week of treatment, before and after 2 week of treatment, before and after 4 week of treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>Jaw ROM measurements of unassisted painless mouth opening, maximum unassisted opening, maximum assisted opening, right lateral excursion and left lateral excursion were taken using a ruler. ROM were assessed by a ruler at before treatment, 1 week after start of treatment, 2 week after start of treatment and 4 week after start of treatment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Jaw Functional Limitation Scale-8 (JFLS-8)</measure>
    <time_frame>The functionality was assessed by JFLS-8 at before and after 4 weeks of treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>The functionality was assessed using JFLS-8. The JFLS-8 was developed as an 8-item global scale for overall functional limitation of the masticatory system. All items are evaluated between 0 and 10. (0: no restrictions, 10: maximum restrictions) JFLS-8 are calculated as the mean of the available items. The functionality was assessed by JFLS-8 at before and after 4 weeks of treatment.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain Pressure Threshold (PPT)</measure>
    <time_frame>PPT was evaluated by a digital algometer at before and after 1 week of treatment, before and after 2 weeks of treatment, before and after 4 weeks of treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>PPT was assessed using the digital algometer. Assessment was performed massater, temporalis, lateral of the temporomandibular joint, sternocleidomastoideus and trapezius. PPT was evaluated by a digital algometer at before and after 1 week of treatment, before and after 2 weeks of treatment, before and after 4 weeks of treatment.</description>
