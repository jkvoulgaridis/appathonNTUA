  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation (AF) is one of the most common arrhythmias. Its repeated fluctuations in
      ventricular rate and irregular heart rhythm not only reduce exercise tolerance and quality of
      life, but also cause hemodynamic changes. The incidence of stroke is increased by 5 times or
      more compared with the average person. According to statistics, the annual mortality rate
      from stroke due to atrial fibrillation is about 20%-25%. Of course, like other cardiovascular
      diseases, atrial fibrillation occurs in a large proportion of the elderly population.
      According to statistics, 80% of patients with atrial fibrillation are 65 years of age or
      older. With the aging of the world's population, especially in the 21st century, the
      proportion of patients with atrial fibrillation has increased year by year. The treatment of
      atrial fibrillation involves many aspects such as switching to sinus rhythm, controlling
      heart rate and anticoagulant therapy, which is a long course affecting the adherence of AF
      patients. AF is a kind of disease that can be preventable and controllable. The
      out-of-hospital care for AF patients has been proved to reduce the mortality and unexpected
      readmission rate, but there are still high costs, poor compliance, low management efficiency
      and etc. Telemedicine was believed to solve these problems to further reduce the mortality of
      AF patients. The latest ESC Heart Failure Guidelines emphasis the significance of
      telemedicine in AF, however, it didn't provide a standardized AF remote management system.

      Subjects with Hospital-Community-Family-Care Management Platform online and those with the
      clinic follow up. In the program, participants were educated on the use of smart
      health-tracking devices and mobile application (APP) to collect and upload comprehensive data
      elements related to the risk of AF self-care management. They were also instructed to send
      text messages, view notifications, and receive individualized guidance on the mobile APP. The
      general practitioners viewed index of each participant on mobile APP and provided primary
      care periodically, and cardiologists in regional central hospital offered remote guidance and
      management if necessary. Outcomes assessed included accomplishments of the program, usability
      and satisfaction, engagement with the intervention, and changes of AF-related health
      behaviors.
