  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: The outcome of ischemic stroke is related to the brain lesion volume and this
      volume of infarction is directly related to the time to reperfusion, which therefore depends
      on the time to initiation of therapy. Acute ischemic stroke is treated medically with the
      administration of intravenous rtPA, but recent randomized controlled trials have shown the
      efficacy of mechanical thrombectomy and is now the new gold standard in ischemic stroke. This
      new therapeutic strategy has created two possibilities for pre-hospital decision-making: i/
      transport the patient directly to the nearest stroke unit to receive alteplase and then if
      indicated perform a thrombectomy (drip and ship) or ii/ bypassing thrombolysis centres in
      favour of endovascular thrombectomy (mothership).

      Objective: To compare cost/effectiveness of transfer to the closest local stroke centre or
      telemedicine hub to direct transfer to the comprehensive stroke cent(CSC) in patients acute
      stroke with suspected large vessel occlusion.

      Medical and economic expected impact: We hypothesize that direct transportation to CSC is
      associated with better clinical outcome in case of acute ischaemic stroke due to intracranial
      large vessel occlusion. However, we have to demonstrate that this approach is not associated
      with time from onset harm in patients not eligible to mechanical thrombectomy.

      Design: Multicenter, two-arm, prospective, open, blinded end-point (PROBE), randomized,
      clinical trial

      Primary endpoint: Incremental cost-utility ratio at 12 months. Secondary endpoints: modified
      Rankin scale and EuroQoL5D scale at 3 months.

      Eligibility criteria: A call to the emergency medical assistance service, 18 years and older,
      severe acute stroke symptoms, transportation time from scene to the CSC longer than time to
      go to the nearest stroke unit or telemedicine hub, transportation time from scene to the CSC
      compatible with IV thrombolysis, known time from onset, RACE score (assessed by medical
      emergency technicians) ≥5.

      Experimental arm: direct transportation to the CSC. Control arm: transfer to the closest
      local stroke centre or telemedicine hub.

      Sample size: 800 patients, 400 for each arm.

    <description>is a commonly used scale for measuring the degree of disability or dependence in the daily activities of people who have suffered a stroke or other causes of neurological disability. The scale runs from 0-6, running from perfect health without symptoms to death. Modified Rankin Scale score will be evaluated through a structured telephone-based interview performed by a central assessor who is blinded to group assignment</description>

    <time_frame>90 days</time_frame>
    <description>EQ-5D is a standardized instrument for measuring generic health status. In the description part, health status is measured in terms of five dimensions (5D); mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression.
EuroQol5D scale will be evaluated through a structured telephone-based interview performed by a central assessor who is blinded to group assignment</description>
