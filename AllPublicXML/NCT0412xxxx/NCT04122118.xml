    <textblock>
      This trial studies how well pharmacist-led transitions of care works in the outpatient
      oncology infusion center for patients with solid tumor. Having a pharmacist in the outpatient
      oncology infusion center may help to identify and correct medical related problems and
      improve overall patient and staff satisfaction. Patients receiving education may benefit from
      gaining a better understanding of their antineoplastic therapy. Understanding the side
      effects associated with the therapy may also help patients better be prepared to manage any
      adverse effects they may experience.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To demonstrate the effectiveness of a clinical oncology pharmacist in the outpatient
      infusion center through education, and the identification and correction of medication
      related problem (MRP)s.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To evaluate overall patient and staff satisfaction with the added clinical oncology
      pharmacy education.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Estimate the cost avoidance utilizing the pharmacy services provided in the prospective
      trial.

      OUTLINE:

      PHASE I: Patients' medical records are reviewed.

      PHASE II: Patients receive pharmacist-led education on antineoplastic therapies including
      what to expect during infusion, general drug facts, common adverse effects, side effect
      management, and when to contact provider.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up periodically.

    <measure>Number of medical related problem (MRP)s identified by the pharmacist through retrospective chart reviews (Phase I)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>MRPs will be assigned to a specific category and the total number of MRPs in each category will be recorded. Categories include but are not limited to: incorrect dose, therapeutic duplication, drug not indicated, drug interaction, monitoring recommendation, drug allergy, or potential for adverse event.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Percent of MRPs corrected as a result of the clinical oncology pharmacist services (Phase II)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>In phase 2 (prospective) MRPs will also be recorded and categorized, but in addition the outcomes relating to each MRP pharmacist intervention will be recorded. MRPs found by the pharmacist will be communicated to the patient's oncologist or primary care provider, and the pharmacist will follow-up to see if changes were made.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient and provider satisfaction with the pharmacist-led education</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The survey results will help determine the need for a clinical oncology pharmacist in the outpatient infusion center. Satisfaction will be assessed using a Likert-scale survey. Scale ranges from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Estimate of Cost avoidance utilizing pharmacy services</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>In order to determine cost avoidance the type of interventions made and the time associated with each intervention will be recorded. The cost per intervention will be calculated by multiplying the pharmacist salary in minutes by the time for each intervention. The intervention types will be assigned cost avoidance values based on previous literature and these will be used to determine the cost benefit for the interventions made during the study period.</description>
