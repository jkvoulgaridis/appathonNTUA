  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The dual antiplatelet therapy based on aspirin plays an important role in the treatment of
      patients with coronary heart disease. Although aspirin is widely used and effective, it has
      many limitations in the long-term including increased risk of bleeding. In patients with
      coronary heart disease and gastroesophageal reflux disease, the symptoms of gastroesophageal
      reflux are usually aggravated after the application of aspirin. As an antiplatelet drug,
      indobufen can reversibly and selectively inhibit platelet cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1), thereby
      blocking the synthesis of thromboxane B2 (TXB2) and exerting its antiplatelet effect, and it
      does not affect the production of prostaglandins and endothelial prostacyclins in
      gastrointestinal mucosa. It has less gastrointestinal injury and lower risk of bleeding. This
      project is to study the effects of indobufen or aspirin on gastric acid secretion and
      gastroesophageal reflux in patients with coronary heart disease and gastroesophageal reflux
      disease treated with dual antiplatelet therapy.
