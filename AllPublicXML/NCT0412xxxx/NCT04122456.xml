  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test how the skin of night shift workers responds to
      artificial sunlight (ultraviolet B radiation; UVB) at two different times of the day in
      comparison to normal day shift workers. After the skin biopsies are obtained, they will be
      brought to the laboratory to be exposed to UVB radiation and to measure UVB responses.
