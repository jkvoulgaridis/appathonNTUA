  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An autograft is a piece of skin taken from a healthy area of the body to be used to treat
      severe burns on another part of the same body.

      StrataGraft skin tissue is an investigational tissue that can be used as an alternative to an
      autograft.

        -  StrataGraft skin tissue is in late stage clinical development for deep partial-thickness
           burns.

        -  There have been no safety concerns reported to date

      The sponsor submitted a treatment protocol to FDA for experienced doctors to keep using
      StrataGraft before it is marketed (expanded access).

      The main purpose of the study is to allow patients to receive StrataGraft prior to approval
      by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of deep partial-thickness burns. The
      primary outcome measure will be the number of participants with adverse events and safety
      concerns.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this trial is to provide expanded access to StrataGraft for thermally
      induced deep partial-thickness burns that contain intact dermal elements and for which
      surgical excision and autograft would normally be part of the clinical management.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        To be considered for inclusion, a patient must:

          -  Provide written informed consent

          -  Have enough healthy skin to reserve as donor site(s), in case autografting becomes
             necessary

          -  Have protocol-defined thermal burn(s) on the torso, upper extremities and lower
             extremities:

               1. that are the right size for treatment areas,

               2. with intact dermal elements for which excision and autografting are clinically
                  indicated, and

               3. have not been previously excised and grafted.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        A patient must be excluded from participation if he/she:

          -  Is pregnant, a prisoner, or expected to live less than 3 months

          -  Has any other condition that, per protocol or in the opinion of the investigator, may
             compromise the participant's safety or the study objectives

          -  Has participated in an investigational study within 90 days before enrollment
