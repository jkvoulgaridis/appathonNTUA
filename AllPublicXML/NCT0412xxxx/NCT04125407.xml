  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The flatfoot is one of the most common diagnosis in foot. The main goals of its orthotic
      intervention in adult population are the control of the rearfoot and midfoot movement, the
      affection of the forefoot position and the minimalization of painful deformities. However,
      only low-level evidence exists proving the positive effect of orthotic insoles in these
      patients. The concept of sensorimotor insoles describes besides the simple mechanical
      correction also the targeted modulation of activity of muscles participated on the correct
      foot function. The aim of the project is to assess the influence of customized sensorimotor
      insoles on the lower limbs' kinematics and the activity of lower limbs' muscles in people
      with diagnosed flexible flatfoot.

      The study is designed as a crossover interventional study with experimental and control group
      (allocation ratio 1:1). Participants' lower limbs' kinematics and muscles activity will be
      assessed on the baseline measurement, immediately after and 3 months after the intervention
      with sensorimotor insoles in the experimental group. Also, the subjective perceived effect of
      intervention will be assessed through the research. After a washout period, experimental and
      control group will swap their roles and another period of 3 months will follow. Same
      parameters will be assessed both at the beginning and in the end of each period.

    <description>The interventional group will receive one customized pair of sensorimotor insoles and will be instructed for their using on a daily bases for the period of 3 months. The duration of using the insoles was established as 1 hour at the day after receiving the insoles. After that, the insoles' tolerance will be assessed based on the email correspondence and further adjustments of insole will be consulted with manufacturer if necessary. Recommended progression in time of using the insoles was established as +1 hour per each day (if possible) with no maximal limit. After 3 weeks, control examination will take place for the control of subjective effect of insoles. Consulting will be offered to the participants through the duration of research. Participants will not undergo any other supplementary treatment (physiotherapy, â€¦) focusing on the flatfoot deformity.</description>
