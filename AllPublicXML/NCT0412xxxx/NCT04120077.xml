    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the combined effects of diabetes self-management
      education (DSME) and nutritional supplementation on visual function and retinopathy incidence
      &amp; progression in patients with type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes and pre-diabetes.

      This will be an investigator initiated, multi-center, double-blinded prospective study of
      150-200 adult subjects with established prediabetes or diabetes. Subjects will be identified
      and enrolled with informed consent from 4 private optometric practices in the Southeastern
      and Central United States. Enrollment in the diabetes self-management education (DSME)
      component of the study will be requisite for participation in the trial and DSME will be
      provided by designated study investigators trained to deliver AADE7™ curricula in individual
      and/or group settings. Subjects will be randomized to DSME in isolation or in combination
      with one of two nutritional supplementation arms of the trial (described below). Supplements
      will be provided by ZeaVision, LLC of Chesterfield, MO.

      Subjects will undergo initial KNOC out Diabetes™ visits with assessment of current diabetes
      status and provision of DSME curriculum, with follow-up DSME assessments and goal reporting
      at 1-month, 3-months, 6-months, 9-months and 12-months. Subjects will receive comprehensive
      dilated eye examinations with additional tests of visual function (described below) at
      baseline, 3 months, 6 months and 12 months.

      KNOC out Diabetes™ is a 10-session, diabetes self-management education program designed to
      improve patient behaviors and blood glucose over a 12 month period and delivered by doctors
      of optometry. KNOC is an acronym for &quot;Knowledge, Nutrition, Ocular Health and Coaching. The
      program features weekly internet learning, experiential learning focused on solving specific,
      individualized patient diabetes management problems, weekly phone coaching Test nutritional
      supplements will be: (1) a multi-component formula (EyePromise DVS™) (2) a high-potency
      marine-sourced omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid supplement (EyePromise EZTears™).

    <masking_description>Bottle sets (three bottles per set) of the two nutritional supplements and identically packaged placebo will be coded by number and randomly assigned by the supplement manufacturer (ZeaVision, LLC, Chesterfield, MO) to enrolled subjects and distributed at co-investigators' offices. All investigators and enrolled subjects will be naïve as to subjects' supplement/placebo status throughout the study period and during all data analysis by an independent bio-statistician. Subjects will be randomly assigned to take either placebo (group 1), EyePromise DVS™ (group 2) or EyePromise DVS™ combined with EyePromise EZTears™ (group 3) in a ratio of 1:1:1.</masking_description>
