      The results of treatment, examination and follow-up of patients with recurrent cervical
      cancer after radiotherapy who recieved imaging guided three dimensional printing personalized
      template assisted with 192Ir high dose rate interorganizational braided therapy were

    <description>All patients underwent computed tomography (CT) 3-5 days before surgery. The collimation is 2.5 mm and CT Planning System.
Delineation of the gross tumor volume (GTV) and adjacent organs at risk (OARs);
Determination of the needle tract of the implanted insertion direction, distribution, and depth. Then calculation of the dose distribution of the target volume and OARs.
Depending on B-TPS data, we establish a digital model for the individual template.
Local anesthesia or intraspinal anesthesia was induced in all patients. The three-dimensional printing noncoplanar templates (3D-PNCT) was placed on the surface of the treatment area of the patient. The 3D-PNCT was aligned accurately with the outer-contour features. Through the guide hole of the 3D-PNCT, we inserted to pre-planned depths.
Delineation of the GTV and design planning .
Connect the source tube and 192Ir high dose rate interorganizational brinotherapy
At the end pressed to stop bleeding.</description>
