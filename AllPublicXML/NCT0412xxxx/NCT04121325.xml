  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To conduct a pilot study to evaluate the effects of new GES programming settings on abdominal
      pain in patients with gastroparesis and existing GES devices, whose abdominal pain has so far
      been refractory to drugs and/or devices.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eligible patients will undergo detailed pain assessments as well as non-invasive physiologic
      assessment. Patients existing GES devices will be reprogrammed to new setting for 4 week and
      their GI symptoms including pain will be evaluated by a daily diary. At the end of 4 weeks
      detailed pain assessments and noninvasive physiologic assessments will be repeated.
