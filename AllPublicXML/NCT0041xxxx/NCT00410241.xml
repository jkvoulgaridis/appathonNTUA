  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine genome sequencing in clinical research. Genome sequencing is a
      process in which researchers analyze (or sequence) part or all of the genome from a single
      person. The human genome is the material in cells that includes thousands of genes. Gene
      changes that cause or contribute to disease can be passed on from one generation to the next.
      This study first focuses on heart disease. Later, researchers hope to study other conditions
      and genes, with the eventual goal of sequencing most or all of participants genes.

      Participants ages 45 to 65 years of age and who do not smoke, may be eligible for this study.
      Patients will come to the NIH Clinical Research Center for an initial study to last about
      half a day. They will donate a blood sample and complete a short survey. Then they will meet
      the genetic counselor to learn more about genome sequencing. Those who join the study will
      undergo the following procedures and evaluations:

        -  Family history and medical history.

        -  Measurement of height and blood pressure.

        -  Noninvasive heart tests, including electrocardiogram and echocardiogram.

        -  Drawing of about 3 ounces of blood (5 to 6 tablespoons); part of the blood sample will
           be used for research and another part for clinical testing.

        -  Multidetector computed tomography (CT), a test to measure coronary artery calcification,
           that is, condition of inflexibility.

      Each patient will receive a letter with results of the clinical laboratory values and
      evaluations. There will be recommendations for follow-up with the patient s doctors. Risks in
      this study include exposure to radiation from the CT test. The radiation amount used is about
      the same that a person normally receives from natural sources, such as from the sun, outer
      space, and radioactive materials found naturally in the earth s air and soil. Another slight
      risk involves reactions to a contrast agent that may be used in the echocardiogram. Side
      effects can be headache, nausea or vomiting, a warm sensation, and dizziness.

      With the samples that patients provide, researchers will start by sequencing about 400 genes
      related to heart disease. Analysis will take months to complete. Genome sequencing is
      difficult to do, and researchers have much to learn about the genes they sequence and the
      gene changes they find. If the researchers find gene changes that are important to the health
      of a participant, they will contact that participant and give him/her the choice of learning
      such results.

      This study may or may not have a direct benefit for participants. Patients would get free
      clinical testing for cholesterol, diabetes, and other conditions, as well as information
      about gene changes. Knowledge gained will benefit people in the future as researchers learn
      about the relationship between gene changes and health.

      The purpose of ClinSeq is to pilot large-scale medical sequencing (LSMS) in a clinical

      research setting. By conducting LSMS and returning individual results to participants, we
      will investigate some of the technical, medical, and genetic counseling issues that accompany
      the implementation of LSMS in the clinical setting.

      A cohort of ~2,000 individuals selected from the surrounding general population is being
      evaluated at the NIH Clinical Research Center (CRC) for a common set of cardiovascular
      phenotypic features, including, but not limited to, coronary artery calcification, lipid
      profiles, and blood pressure. During their initial visit, participants undergo a brief
      clinical evaluation, and have blood samples collected for genomic analysis. Additionally,
      they are asked to provide baseline information about pertinent health behavior and a family
      history. During their initial visit and as the study progresses, participants may be asked to
      complete surveys related to various socio-behavioral aspects of their participation, such as
      their attitudes toward learning individual results or health behaviors related to receipt of
      results.

      Most participants have exome sequencing (ES), and selected participants will have genome
      sequencing (GS). We have developed analytic algorithms to distinguish potentially pathogenic
      genetic alterations from normal variation (Gonsalves et al., 2013; Johnston et al., 2012; Ng
      et al., 2013) and will test for associations of genomic variants with a variety of
      phenotypes. Sequence variants deemed clinically relevant are validated in a CLIA-certified
      laboratory and the results offered to that subject. ClinSeq is designed to provide the
      long-term potential for pursuing many different clinical projects.

      Relatives of ClinSeq participants may be invited to enroll in the project for more

      limited studies if their participation aids our understanding of the gene variants detected
      in the

      probands. For example, these relatives may undergo genetic testing for co-segregation of
      known or suspected disease-causing variants, and/or phenotyping relevant to the disease in
      question.

      We aim to utilize the procedures and infrastructure we have developed for generating and
      analyzing data to address some of the logistic,biomedical, and counseling challenges related
      to LSMS.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Group A

        We plan to recruit a cohort whose risk to develop coronary artery disease will range from
        less than 5 percent, based on the 10-year-risk provided by the Framingham risk score, to
        greater than 10 percent, and including those with known coronary artery disease. The
        10-year-risk will be measured by the Framingham risk score based on LDL cholesterol levels.

        Individuals eligible for Bins 1-3 of this study will be 45 to 65 years of age, and
        individuals eligible for Bin 4 must be 35-65 years of age. We selected this cutoff as we
        are interested in recruiting a cohort whose coronary artery calcification (CAC)
        measurements range from normal to diseased, and it has been shown that abnormal CAC is
        infrequent below this age. Also, individuals eligible for this study will be required to
        have a primary care physician or equivalent with whom we can communicate in the event we
        uncover a condition that merits follow-up. The exception to this includes individuals in
        Group A2 who are recruited through the community outreach being done by Ms. Sandra Epps.
        These individuals will not be required to have a primary care physician, although we will
        strongly recommend that they attend a community health clinic for follow-up on clinical
        recommendations from the study. Additionally, individuals eligible for this study will be
        required to be non-smokers at the time of enrollment, for our purposes defined as someone
        who has not smoked regularly during the previous 12 months.

        Due to the large number of individuals to be recruited and the intention to follow this
        cohort longitudinally, we will focus our efforts on the metropolitan DC and Baltimore areas
        (in order to minimize reluctance to participate because of travel limitations). If
        recruitment is below anticipated levels, we may seek additional subjects from the Richmond,
        VA metropolitan area. Individuals who are not local to these areas may be considered for
        participation if they are part of other protocols within NHLBI, and travel to the NIH
        Clinical Research Center on a regular basis for follow-up, or if they are willing to travel
        to the NIH as needed for protocol participation (at their own expense). Bin 4 participants
        will be eligible to have the cost of their transportation, meals and lodging covered if
        they must travel &gt;500 miles for their clinical visits.

        An eligibility screen will be performed by telephone to ascertain age, basic demographics,
        smoking history, and presence or absence of known cardiovascular disease. We intend to
        recruit persons of both sexes, of diverse ethnic and racial categories, and from various
        socio-economic backgrounds.

        Group B

        The eligibility for Group B is distinct from Group A. Group B eligibility requires:

          1. relative enrolled in Group A

          2. age over 18 years, unless the phenotype under study affects children

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Individual excluded from participating in the study include: (1) first-degree relatives of
        enrolled ClinSeq participants (unless they fall into Group B); and (2) individuals who are
        directly involved with gathering data and analyzing the clinical and genotyping data,
        including the Principal Investigator, the Associate Investigators, the ClinSeq staff
        involved with the subjects at the clinical level (such as the Nurse Practitioner, Genetic
        counselor, etc.), and the staff at NISC involved with generating and analyzing the sequence
        data ; and (3) individuals who request access to their raw sequence data for analysis
        outside of ClinSeq ; and (4) individuals who are already enrolled in another study that
        provides genome or exome sequencing, such as the GENE-FORECAST Study (14-HG-0048).
