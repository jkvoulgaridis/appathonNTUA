  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the side effects and how well cladribine and rituximab work in
      treating patients with hairy cell leukemia. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cladribine,
      work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells either by killing the cells, by
      stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Immunotherapy with
      monoclonal antibodies, such as rituximab, may help the body's immune system attack the
      cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving
      cladribine together with rituximab may kill more cancer cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To demonstrate the efficacy in achieving complete response of combination of cladribine
      administered intravenously over 2 hours for 5 days followed by rituximab weekly for 8 weeks
      in patients with untreated or previously treated hairy cell leukemia.

      II. To examine the efficacy of rituximab to eradicate minimal residual disease (MRD) after
      cladribine therapy (as assessed by immunophenotyping of bone marrow and peripheral blood).

      III. To examine the effect of addition of rituximab to cladribine on the long term
      disease-free (DFS) and overall survival (OS) (as compared with historical controls).

      IV. To evaluate potential predictors of outcome including molecular and flow evaluations of
      MRD, as well as other potential molecular predictors such as v-raf murine sarcoma viral
      oncogene homolog B1 (BRAF).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive cladribine intravenously (IV) over 2 hours once daily (QD) on days 1-5 and
      rituximab IV once weekly for 8 weeks beginning on day 28 in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 1 year.
