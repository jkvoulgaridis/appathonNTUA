      To evaluate the efficacy of sirolimus by estimating the overall response rate (ORR) as
      assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1) in
      patients with metastatic dMMR solid cancer after immunotherapy (either due to disease
      progression or to inability to tolerate treatment).

    <textblock>
      Despite recent therapeutic strategies, including immunotherapy, treatment alternatives for
      patients with metastatic mismatch-repair deficient (dMMR) solid tumors remain scarce.
      Pre-clinical data suggests that dMMR tumors are susceptible to rapamycin (sirolimus), a mTOR
      inhibitor. In these tumors, characterized by higher levels of oxidative stress, sirolimus can
      exert a cytotoxic effect, led by the failure to repair DNA damage by inhibition of
      antioxidant enzymes such as FOXO3a triggered by Akt hyperactivation.

      This proposal presents a phase 2 clinical trial designed to evaluate the efficacy of
      sirolimus in patients with dMMR solid tumors after immunotherapy. The investigators
      hypothesize that sirolimus will increase the overall response rate (ORR) by 20%.

    <description>Sirolimus (oral) will be started at 2 mg daily. Sirolimus dosing will be titrated to meet serum trough levels of &gt;8 ng/ml, assayed at 7 days after starting a new dose, by chromatography/nmass spectrometry. Once adequate serum levels are met (≥8 ng/ml), the same dosing will be continued until progression of disease as evidenced by imaging, or unacceptable toxicity.</description>
