  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the study is to evaluate palatability (primary objective) and perceived
      satiating effects (secondary objective) of two Oral Nutrition Supplements (ONS) prototypes
      and six commercially available ONS products. The products are matched on calorie content per
      portion.

      The study is a single-blind intervention with a within-subjects design. In total 104
      apparently healthy and independently living older adults aged 65 will be recruited to
      participate. Participants will visit the research facilities eight times in a period of one
      month. On each test-day participants will consume and evaluate a single product.
