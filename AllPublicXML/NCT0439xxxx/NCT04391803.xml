      The VANTAGE study is a prospective, multi-center, single-arm trial of the Pipeline™ Vantage
      Device for the treatment of adults with acutely ruptured intracranial aneurysms. The primary
      objective of the VANTAGE study is to assess the safety and effectiveness of treatment with
      the Pipeline™ Vantage Device of acutely ruptured intracranial aneurysms that are not amenable
      for clipping and coiling.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject has a previously untreated, wide neck, intradural aneurysm that is deemed
             unfavorable for surgical clipping and/or endovascular coiling, as confirmed on DSA.

          2. Subject has a ruptured intradural aneurysm with vessel diameter suitable for treatment
             with study device.

          3. Subject has an acutely ruptured aneurysm with Hunt and Hess Scale 1, 2 or 3.

          4. Complete Informed Consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject's vessel characteristics that preclude safe endovascular access to the
             aneurysm treatment.

          2. Subject has aneurysm vessel characteristics (e.g., parent vessel stenosis, irregular
             morphology) that would preclude the device from fully conforming to the parent vessel
             to reduce any risk of embolic complications, retreatment, or device movement.

          3. Subject has true bifurcation (aneurysms arising at a terminus) or aneurysms with
             vessels that cannot be separated from the fundus with placement of the Pipeline™
             Vantage Device.

          4. Subject has an inter-cerebral hemorrhage.

          5. Subject is unable to undergo nasogastric tube placement prior to device placement.

          6. Subject has a pre-morbid mRS &gt;2.

          7. Subject requires treatment of another aneurysm (with another treatment modality)
             within the affected territory of the target aneurysm.

          8. Subject has a target ruptured aneurysm that is thought to be mycotic, including those
             caused by left atrial myxoma, or subject has an active systemic bacterial infection.

          9. Subject with a requirement for continuous anti-coagulation.

         10. Subject has a malignant brain tumor or vascular malformation (e.g. arteriovascular
             malformation).

         11. Subject's target ruptured aneurysm has not been determined by the treating physician
             to be the source of SAH.

         12. Subject with known allergy to platinum or cobalt chromium alloy (including the major
             elements platinum, cobalt, chromium, nickel or molybdenum).

         13. Subject has a contraindication to ticagrelor or aspirin

         14. Subject is unable to undergo DSA or DSA is determined unsuitable by the treating
             physician.

         15. Subject has a serious or life-threatening comorbidity that could confound study
             results.

         16. Subject is at high risk of noncompliance due to a history of substance abuse.

         17. Subject is unable to complete scheduled follow-up assessments due to comorbidities,
             geographical limitations, or a life expectancy of less than 24 months.

         18. Subjects who are pregnant, lactating or planning to become pregnant during the course
             of the study.

         19. Subjects who are participating in another clinical trial at the time of enrollment.
