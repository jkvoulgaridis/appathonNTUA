  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      High doses of intravenous (iv.) glucocorticoids (GCs) are commonly used as a treatment for
      many autoimmune and inflammatory disorders. According to the European Group on Graves'
      Orbitopathy (EUGOGO) guidelines, intravenous methylprednisolone (IVMP) is an accepted
      first-line agent for active, moderate-to-severe and very severe Graves' orbitopathy (GO).
      This treatment is proven to be more efficient and safer than oral GCs. However, some patients
      may experience adverse cardiovascular effects during the administration of iv. GCs, which in
      rare cases may even be fatal. There are limited data, mostly obtained from case reports,
      reporting the occurrence of cardiac arrhythmias, acute myocardial infarction or heart
      failure. Increased heart rhythm (HR) has drawn attention of researchers as a possible adverse
      effect correlated with IVMP. During this study, investigators performed 72-hours of Holter
      ECG and ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) to evaluate the impact of IVMP on
      patients with moderate-to-severe GO, concerning HR and blood pressure (BP) changes. In order
      to elucidate possible mechanism of observed changes, researchers investigated the level of
      potassium in serum and urine and catecholamines (epinephrine, norepinephrine) in serum. All
      patients were treated routinely according to EUGOGO recommendations with standard doses of
      methylprednisolone with standard recommended schedule. Inclusion criterion for the therapy
      was according to EUGOGO guidelines active, moderate-to-severe and active GO (12 pulses of
      IVMP 6x0.5g followed by 6x0.25g every week).

      The clinical status of patients was evaluated before each pulse, including blood pressure
      monitoring, glucose level monitoring and symptoms of infection. HR and BP was measured
      continuously for 3 consecutive days (the day before, the day of IVMP and the day after IVMP)
      during 1st, 6th and 12th IVMP pulse, using 24-hour Holter ECG and ABMP. Serum laboratory
      tests for potassium, epinephrine and norepinephrine were measured 3 times the day before and
      the day of first IVMP pulse and 1 time the second and sixth day after 1st IVMP. Additionally,
      urine samples for potassium were collected 5 times the day of first IVMP pulse and 1 time the
      second and sixth day after 1st IVMP.

      All assays were performed in sera obtained from venous blood samples and analysed immediately
      after blood sampling in The Endocrinology Research Laboratory in the hospital. All samples
      were centrifugated for plasma immediately after delivery (15 min; 1000 xg) and separated for
      both categories (EDTA and heparin) - 2 x 400 ul for test tubes with protease inhibitors and 4
      x 500 ul with no additives. Then all assays were frozen immediately to -70°C.
