    <textblock>
      AuriNovo provides a patient-specific, biological construct for use in the surgical
      reconstruction of the external ear in people born with microtia Grades II-IV. This Phase 1 /
      2A study is being conducted to collect preliminary safety data on microtic ear reconstruction
      using AuriNovo, fine-tune technical, logistical, surgical, and post-surgical care aspects
      related to implantation, and to gather preliminary efficacy data including short- and
      longer-term in vivo duration and biological status of the implant.

    <description>AuriNovo is a patient-specific, biologically natural, supportive base for surgical reconstruction of the external ear (auricle) in people born with microtia Grades II-IV. The construct is a 3D-bioprinted collagen hydrogel scaffold encapsulating the patient's own auricular cartilage cells (chondrocytes). The construct is printed in a size and shape that matches the contralateral ear for implantation into the patient.</description>
