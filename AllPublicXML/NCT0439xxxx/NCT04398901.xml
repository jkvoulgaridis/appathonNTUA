    <textblock>
      In this study we will follow the neurodevelopmental outcome of children with in utero ZIKV
      exposure who do not have microcephaly or severe abnormalities consistent with Congenital Zika
      Syndrome. The ZIKV-exposed children will be compared to non-ZIKV exposed controls. Children
      will be assessed at age 3 and 4 years using standardized neurodevelopmental assessments.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Zika-virus (ZIKV) infection in pregnancy can result in severe brain damage in 4-12% of cases.
      Children exposed to ZIKV in utero during the years of 2015-2017 are now in early childhood.
      Children with severe neurologic injury (Congenital Zika Syndrome; CZS) have a poor
      developmental outcome, however the developmental outcome of apparently normal infants
      following in utero ZIKV-exposure is not well known. The incidence of abnormal
      neurodevelopmental outcome in apparently normal children with in utero ZIKV-exposure is not
      known.

      We will determine if neurodevelopmental assessment scores in children exposed to ZIKV in
      utero who are normal appearing differ from norms. We hypothesize that ZIKV-exposed normal
      appearing children will have lower multi-domain developmental assessment scores compared to
      normative samples. We hypothesize that the presence of mild postnatal non-specific cranial US
      findings is associated with persistent lower developmental assessment scores compared to
      ZIKV-exposed children who had normal cranial US and quantitative imaging will find structural
      and functional brain differences between ZIKV-exposed children and controls..

      We will perform a prospective developmental outcome study at 2 sites: 1) Department of
      Atlántico, Colombia through collaboration with BIOMELAB, the research center of Dr. Carlos
      Cure, and 2) Children's National, Washington, DC.

      The objective of the study is to determine whether children who were exposed to ZIKV in utero
      and who do not have CZS have abnormalities in neurodevelopment during early childhood.

      The primary outcome will be neurodevelopmental assessment scores at age 3 and 4 years. Scores
      will be compared between Zika-exposed children and controls.

    <description>Children in Colombia were previously enrolled as part of a fetal-neonatal neuroimaging study in 2016-2017 and were from Department of Atlantico, Colombia on the Caribbean coast. Eligible children had prior normal fetal MRI and fetal US, normal birth head circumference, normal clinical exam, no more than mild non-specific postnatal imaging findings, and are thus without findings of CZS.</description>

    <description>We will enroll 70 non-ZIKV exposed children, age 4 years, in Department of Atlántico, Colombia with birth dates prior to August 31, 2015. Based on the arrival of ZIKV to Colombia in November 2015, this date would ensure a control cohort without congenital ZIKV exposure or infection in the first 3 months of age.</description>
