  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is aimed at evaluating the role of the activity of the key hemostatic parameters of
      endothelial dysfunction (nitric oxide II (NO) metabolites, plasmin activator inhibitor-1
      (PAI-1), von Willebrand factor (vWF), coagulation factor VIII (FVIII), soluble endothelial
      protein C receptors (sEPCR)) in the development of disease progression, thrombotic
      complications and restenosis in subjects with atherosclerotic peripheral artery disease.

      The study will involve patients with atherosclerotic peripheral artery disease (Rutherford
      category 3-5). The subjects are to be divided into three groups:

      Group A: patients who undergo bypass surgery with a synthetic graft on aorto-iliac or
      femoro-popliteal segment; Group B: patients who undergo endovascular balloon angioplasty and
      stenting on aorto-iliac or femoro-popliteal segment; Group C: patients who undergo standard
      of care conservative treatment.

      Decisions on revascularization or conservative treatment alone is to be made by a team of
      vascular specialists in accordance with the severity of the disease, previous treatment,
      anatomy, possible need for repeat procedures in the future, and patient's preferences.

        A prospective study is aimed at enrolling 200 patients with atherosclerotic peripheral
        arterial disease, Rutherford category 3-5. The patients with PAD are scheduled to undergo
        either open or endovascular reconstructive procedures on aorto-iliac and femoro-popliteal
        segment or conservative treatment alone. The subjects of similar age, sex, and ethnicity
        are to be divided into three groups, respectively.
