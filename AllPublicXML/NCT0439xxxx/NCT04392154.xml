  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Participants must meet all the following criteria to be eligible for this study:

          1. Received treatment in a lebrikizumab study, NCT04146363, NCT04178967, NCT04250337,
             NCT04250350 and have adequately completed the study treatments and last patient visit
             of the parent trial.

          2. Willing and able to comply with all clinic visits and study-related procedures.

          3. For women of childbearing potential: agree to remain abstinent (refrain from
             heterosexual intercourse) or use a highly effective contraceptive method during the
             treatment period and for at least 18 weeks after the last dose of lebrikizumab or
             placebo.

             NOTE: A woman of childbearing potential (WOCBP) is defined as a postmenarcheal female,
             who has not reached a postmenopausal state (â‰¥12 continuous months of amenorrhea with
             no identified cause other than menopause) and has not undergone surgical sterilization
             (removal of ovaries and/or uterus).

             NOTE: The following are highly effective contraceptive methods: combined (estrogen and
             progestogen containing) hormonal contraception (oral, intravaginal, transdermal)
             associated with inhibition of ovulation, progestogen-only hormonal contraception
             (oral, injectable, implantable) associated with inhibition of ovulation, intrauterine
             device (IUD), intrauterine hormone-releasing system (IUS), bilateral tubal occlusion,
             vasectomized partner, or sexual abstinence. The reliability of sexual abstinence
             should be evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical trial and the
             preferred and usual lifestyle of the participant. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar,
             ovulation, symptothermal, or postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable
             methods of contraception.

          4. Male participants must agree to use an effective barrier method of contraception
             during the study and for a minimum of 18 weeks following the last dose of study drug
             if sexually active with a female of child-bearing potential.

          5. Provide signed informed consent/assent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Participants meeting any of the criteria below will not be included in this study:

          1. Participants who, during their participation in the parent trial, developed a serious
             adverse event (SAE) deemed related to lebrikizumab, which in the opinion of the
             investigator or of the medical monitor could indicate that continued treatment with
             lebrikizumab may present an unreasonable risk for the participant. *

          2. Participants who, during their participation in the parent trial, developed an AE that
             was deemed related to lebrikizumab and led to study treatment discontinuation, which
             in the opinion of the investigator or of the medical monitor could indicate that
             continued treatment with lebrikizumab may present an unreasonable risk for the
             participant. *

          3. Conditions in the previous parent study consistent with protocol-defined criteria for
             permanent study drug discontinuation, if deemed related to lebrikizumab or led to
             investigator - or sponsor-initiated withdrawal of participant from the study (e.g.,
             non-compliance, inability to complete study assessments, etc.). *

          4. Pregnant or breastfeeding women, or women planning to become pregnant or breastfeed
             during the study.

        Note for exclusion criteria # 1, 2, and 3: In studies that are still blinded, conditions
        deemed related to the study treatment will be considered related to lebrikizumab.
