  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Based on data from the US Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Result Program (SEER), the rates
      of nipple-sparing mastectomy (NSM) have risen 202% since 2009. In spite of the increasing
      popularity of IRMA, limited research has been done to identify complications in patients
      undergoing these procedures. Of particular importance is to assess the effects of combining
      the procedure with radiotherapy, and undergoing a one- versus two-step surgical procedure.

      Active monitoring and periodic assessment of IRMA patients are needed to establish the safety
      of these different techniques in terms of complications and recurrence rates. Identifying an
      optimal strategy for IRMA may lead to the development of clinical guidelines, which are
      currently lacking.

      This is a multicenter observational, cohort study. The study is designed to serve a similar
      purpose as a disease registry. The only study-specific intervention will be the completion of
      the BREAST-Q quality-of-life (QoL) form. Only quantitative data will be collected. The
      rationale for this study design is to identify and describe the type and frequency of
      complications related to IRMA. No hypothesis is being tested. Although group comparisons
      based on surgical techniques will be made, conclusions based on these findings will be
      limited by the observational nature of the design.

      Data from patients will be collected using a series of pseudonymized case report forms,
      including the validated quality-of-life questionnaire: BREAST-Q. These data will be entered
      into the web-based data collection system, SecuTrial. A precise description of the surgical
      procedure will be required, as specified on the case report forms (e.g., implantation of a
      mesh, resection margins), to allow for subsequent multivariate analyses.

      During the first year of follow-up, data from routine clinical assessments and the QoL forms
      will be gathered at baseline (within 90 days after mastectomy), 6 and 12 months. Thereafter,
      data will be collected from annual clinical assessments and completion of the QoL form will
      be done for an additional four years (24, 36, 48 and 60 months postoperatively).
      Consequently, a total of five years of postoperative follow-up data will be collected to
      allow sufficient time for the development of the majority of foreseeable complications.
