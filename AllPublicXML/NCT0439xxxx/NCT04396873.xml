      Background:

      About 5 million adults in the U.S. have Alzheimer s disease or another adult-onset
      neurodegenerative disorder. Many studies have found that inflammation in the brain
      contributes to these diseases. Researchers want to find a better way to measure this
      inflammation.

      Objective:

      To learn if two new radiolabeled drugs, [11C]PS13 and [11C]MC1, can measure inflammation in
      the brain using positron emission tomography (PET) imaging.

      Eligibility:

      Adults age 18 years and older in good general health who have an adult-onset
      neurodegenerative dementia, and healthy adult volunteers enrolled in protocols 01-M-0254 or
      17-M-0181

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with medical history, physical exam with vital signs, and lab
      tests. They will have a neurological exam and neuropsychological testing. Their heart
      function will be measured.

      Participants will have a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. The MRI scanner is a metal
      tube surrounded by a strong magnetic field. Participants will lie on a table that slides in
      and out of the tube. The machine makes noise. Participants will get earplugs.

      Participants will have 2 PET scans. They will be injected with the study drugs through an
      intravenous catheter placed in an arm vein. The PET scanner is shaped like a doughnut.
      Participants will lie on a bed that slides in and out of the scanner. A plastic mask will be
      molded to their head to keep them from moving. A thin plastic tube will be put into an artery
      at the wrist or elbow crease area. This will be used to draw blood during the scan.

      Participants will have 2-3 study visits. Participation lasts 1 week to 4 months, depending on
      scheduling.

      Study Description: This pilot/exploratory study will examine whether cyclooxygenase 1 (COX-1)
      and COX-2 are elevated in the brain of individuals with dementia compared to healthy
      volunteers.

      Objectives: Primary Objective: To determine whether COX-1 or COX-2 is elevated in the brains
      of individuals with dementia compared to healthy volunteers.

      Endpoints: Primary Endpoint: Measurement of COX-1 and COX-2 density in brain after PET scans
      with [11C]PS13 and [11C]MC1, respectively.

      Study Population: Four groups of 16 subjects each will be studied: 1) Alzheimer s disease
      (AD), 2) frontotemporal dementia (FTD) 3) other dementias, and 4) healthy volunteers.
      Subjects may be male or female. They must be greater than or equal to 18 years old, but most
      are expected to be 60 to 80 years old. Subjects may be recruited from anywhere, but most are
      expected to come from the Washington DC metropolitan area. Patients must be in good medical
      health but may be unable to provide informed consent because of cognitive impairment. In that
      case, the Legally Appointed Representative (LAR) must provide consent, and the patient must
      provide assent.

      Phase: 1

      Description of Sites/Facilities Enrolling Participants: Screening and PET imaging will be
      performed at the NIH Clinical Center.

      Description of Study Intervention:

      Subjects will be intravenously injected with 20 mCi of each of two radioligands: [11C]MC1 and
      [11C]PS13. Subjects will also have a radial artery catheter(s) inserted to measure the
      concentration of radioligand (either one insertion (if both scans are performed on the same
      day) or two insertions (if the scans are performed on two different days). Subjects will also
      have a brain MRI to provide anatomic orientation for the PET scans.

      Study Duration: 36 months

      Participant Duration: One week to four months, depending on the patient s availability and
      access to MRI and PET cameras.
