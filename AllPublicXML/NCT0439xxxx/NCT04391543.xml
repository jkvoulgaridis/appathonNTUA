  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One of the most common and stressful side effects of the disease and associated treatments is
      cancer-related fatigue. It deeply disrupts quality of life and can have a negative impact on
      patient survival. However, cancer-related fatigue is largely underestimated by patients and
      poorly taken into account by clinicians. One of the reasons for its poor management is a lack
      of knowledge of the underlying mechanisms and risk factors.

      Although a multiplicity of factors are associated with the appearance of cancer-related
      fatigue, we do not know their respective share, nor the nature of their interactions. The
      phenomenon studied reveals complex and systemic interactions between the biological,
      psychological and social dimensions. Recent systematic reviews clearly identify 2 locks
      currently preventing a better understanding of the mechanisms of cancer-related fatigue: i)
      lack of longitudinal studies, ii) lack of interdisciplinary studies. It is precisely these
      two challenges that the BIOCARE FActory project wishes to respond to.
