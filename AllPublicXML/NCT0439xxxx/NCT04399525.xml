  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In order to validate the accuracy and reliability of the histamine skin prick model for
      histaminergic itch and vasodilation, the dermal blood flow response induced by a histamine
      skin prick will be evaluated after the administration of certain H1-antihistamines. Besides,
      the influence of these H1-antihistamines on the dermal blood flow response induced by the
      topical application of cinnamaldehyde and capsaicin will be evaluated. Changes in dermal
      blood flow will be measured with laser speckle contrast imaging.
