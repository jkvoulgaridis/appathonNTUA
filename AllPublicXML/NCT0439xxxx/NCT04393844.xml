      In pediatric patients under the age of 18 who undergo surgery under general anesthesia, when
      inserting peripherally inserted central venous catheterization, the group that inserts the
      catheter with the obturator and the group that inserts the catheter without the obturator is
      inserted into the appropriate position.

    <textblock>
      In pediatric patients under the age of 18 who undergo surgery under general anesthesia, when
      inserting peripherally inserted central venous catheterization, the group that inserts the
      catheter with the obturator and the group that inserts the catheter without the obturator is
      inserted into the appropriate position.

      There is no study confirming the probability of being placed in the central vein at a time
      when the catheter is inserted without the obturator, and there is no study comparing the
      clinical effect by dividing the case with the obturator and the obturator. In children, the
      blood vessels are small and there is a high probability that they cannot be located in the
      central vein when the peripheral vein is inserted.

      Therefore, when a peripheral implanted central venous tube is inserted into a pediatric
      patient under general anesthesia under 18 years of age, the probability that the catheter is
      inserted without using an obturator will be located in the central vein at a time rather than
      using an obturator to insert the catheter. It could help pediatric patients to manage
      anesthesia and post-surgical care by reducing potential complications from using obturator.
