  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      E-cigarette (EC) use continues to increase among youth, and EC may be detrimental to youth
      respiratory health. Public health officials and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) can
      now regulate ECs. The proposed study uses an in-laboratory and naturalistic assessments
      called ecological momentary assessment to understand how ECs use may impact the respiratory
      health of youth and young adult users compared to never-using peers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Using a 1-year, prospective longitudinal design, 150 youth and young adults aged 15-21 years
      (100 exclusive-EC users; 50 never-users) will complete 5 laboratory visits (baseline, 3-,6-,
      9-, and 12-months) following &gt;12 hours of abstinence, which will include laboratory-based
      respiratory assessments of airway reactivity, inflammation, and spirometry. All participants
      will also provide salivary samples for bio-confirmation of nicotine (cotinine). To assess
      acute changes in pulmonary functioning related to tobacco product use, participants will
      complete twice daily EMA &quot;bursts&quot; and home-based spirometry for the 2-weeks prior to each
      follow-up laboratory visit. EC users' puff topography will also be assessed at all laboratory
      visits during a 30-minute ad libitum EC puffing session, to examine the association between
      total inhaled volume and self-reported nicotine dependence and respiratory health.
