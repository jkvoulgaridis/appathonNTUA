  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Temporary mechanical circulatory support devices are increasingly used for short-term support
      in patients with decompensated cardiogenic shock. Recently, a new axial flow pump has become
      widely available with the Impella System. The Impella has been FDA approved for short term
      usage. Hemolysis, however, has been a common complication that has increased morbidity and
      mortality in this patient population.

      It is hypothesized that a major source of hemolysis in this patient population is shear
      stress experienced by red blood cells (RBC) as they travel through the pump device. In
      addition to causing RBC loss and potential anemia, the hemolysis has multiple other
      downstream consequences including creation of a pro-thrombotic environment leading to clot
      formation and potential device failure and secondary end organ dysfunction (renal and liver
      failure). Due to the significant effects of hemolysis in this population, a great deal of
      interest has been recently focused on addressing this problem, but as of yet no durable
      solutions exist.

      Pentoxifylline improves red blood cell deformability and reduces blood viscosity. It is
      hypothesized here that administering Pentoxifylline to patients in CS who require temporary
      MCS will decrease the amount of shear stress related hemolysis through the improved
      deformability and durability of RBCs. We propose to perform a double-blinded randomized
      controlled trial in patients who undergo an axillary Impella 5.0 insertion for acute
      decompensated heart failure. There will be a control group who receives a placebo and the
      treatment group who receives pentoxifylline. Labs will be drawn to monitor hemolysis which is
      our current standard protocol for the life of the device to determine the efficacy of
      pentoxifylline in decreasing hemolysis in this patient population.

      Subjects will be screened prior to Impella device implant for eligibility. Informed consent
      will be obtained from eligible subjects. After implant of their Impella Device (5.0/5.5),
      results of laboratory tests (plasma free hemoglobin &amp; lactate dehydrogenase levels) every 12
      hrs for the first 3 days and then daily thereafter. Subjects will receive study medication
      every 6 hrs from device implant until device explant, death or Day 30 occurs. Impella
      therapy, concomitant medications and adverse events will be collected until the same.
      Subjects that don't qualify or opt out of participating will not receive the study
      medication. The data being collected for the study is based on routine standard of care. The
      difference between the SOC Impellas subjects and the study patients is the addition of
      Pentoxifylline being administered along with their SOC medications.
