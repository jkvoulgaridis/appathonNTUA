  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study seeks to define the role of CD4+ and CD8+ T cell memory responses in the
      immunologic failure of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) to clear infections. In a normal
      host, the immune system clears pathogens upon re-infection more swiftly and efficiently than
      during an initial infection, in great part due to the recall and effector functions of memory
      T cells. In CF, far less is understood regarding the response of T cell memory when hosts
      reencounter antigens, otherwise known as pulmonary exacerbations. Pulmonary exacerbations are
      pivotal events that lead to a decline in health status among CF patients, with many never
      recovering to baseline health. CF patients will be recruited from patients followed by the
      Adult CF Program at National Jewish Health. Following enrollment at the time of antibiotic
      initiation, blood will be collected at two different time points. The first samples will be
      collected within 24 hours of starting IV antibiotic therapy. The second blood specimen will
      be collected at the end of hospitalization, after a minimum of 5 days. At the time of each
      blood draw, complete blood counts, a sputum sample, and simple spirometry will be measured as
      part of the standard care of a CF exacerbation. Isolated PBMCs will be stained with
      antibodies to designate cell surface phenotype. They will then be sorted to identify the T
      cell population. These cells will be tested on their ability to clear pathogens. The
      relationship between cellular immune responses and clinical indicators of pulmonary status
      will be examined by fitting linear mixed models.
