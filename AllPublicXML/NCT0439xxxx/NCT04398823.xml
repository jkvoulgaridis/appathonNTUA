  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      &quot;Internal hemorrhoid&quot; affects the quality of life due to hemorrhage and prolapse as a common
      and frequently-occurring disease. Endoscopic sclerosing agent injection has replaced
      traditional surgery and become the most commonly used treatment method in developed
      countries. At present, how to reduce the side effects of sclerosing agent and accurately
      determine the injection site and depth has become a difficult clinical problem. The research
      group creatively put forward the theory of foam sclerosing agent to treat internal
      hemorrhoids in the early stage. With the aid of transparent cap, the visibility of surgical
      field of vision can be improved. The mini probe ultrasound (MPS) is proposed to effectively
      evaluate the submucosal in
