  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, open-label, single arm study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of
      niraparib in ovarian cancer patients who have received three or four previous chemotherapy
      regimens. Niraparib is an orally active PARP inhibitor. Niraparib will be administered once
      daily continuously during a 28-day cycle. Health-related quality of life will be measured by
      Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG). Safety and tolerability will be
      assessed by clinical review of adverse events (AEs), physical examinations,
      electrocardiograms (ECGs), RECIST tumor assessments and safety laboratory values.

    <time_frame>Up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence that occurs in a participant or clinical investigation participant administered a pharmaceutical product, and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with study treatment.
