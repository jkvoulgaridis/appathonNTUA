    <description>Participants will be diagnosed and treated by Chinese medicine practitioners (CMPs) with at least 5 years of clinical experience. CMPs will differentiate syndrome and prescript herbs in a semi-standardized protocol, which consists of a base Chinese medicine decoction, BXD, and the additional syndrome-specific herbs.
The modified decoction will be prepared in a conventional decocting method at the Chinese medicine pharmacy in the clinic (HKBA-HKU CMCTR) and will be packaged into bags by the auto-decocting machines. Participants will take the decoction twice per day, 5 days per week, for 3 weeks.</description>
