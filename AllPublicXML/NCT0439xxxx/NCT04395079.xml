    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the side effects and how well brachytherapy with durvalumab or
      tremelimumab work for the treatment of gynecological malignancies that is resistant to
      platinum therapy (platinum-resistant), does not respond to treatment (refractory), has come
      back (recurrent), or has spread to other places in body (metastatic). Brachytherapy, also
      known as internal radiation therapy, uses radioactive material placed directly into or near a
      tumor to kill tumor cells. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as durvalumab and
      tremelimumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the
      ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. This trial is being done to see whether
      brachytherapy with durvalumab or tremelimumab works better in treating patients with
      gynecological malignancies.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety of the treatment combination consisting of brachytherapy and
      tremelimumab. (Safety lead-in) II. To determine the median progression-free survival with
      brachytherapy and checkpoint inhibition with either durvalumab or tremelimumab. (Dose
      expansion)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the efficacy of brachytherapy and durvalumab or brachytherapy and tremelimumab
      in terms of:

      Ia. Local control of the irradiated tumor. Ib. Overall response rate. Ic. Response at
      non-irradiated lesions in subjects with multiple sites of disease subjects.

      Id. Duration of response. Ie. Disease specific survival. If. Overall survival. II. To further
      determine the safety and tolerability of brachytherapy with durvalumab and brachytherapy with
      tremelimumab (expansion cohorts).

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To explore the immunologic changes associated with the combination of brachytherapy with
      durvalumab and brachytherapy with tremelimumab.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive durvalumab intravenously (IV) on day 1. Treatment repeats every 28
      days for 13 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients
      then undergo brachytherapy on day 8. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 3 fractions in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients receive tremelimumab IV on day 1. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 2-4
      cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients then undergo
      brachytherapy on day 8. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 3 fractions in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 12 weeks.

    <description>PFS will be estimated in each study arm by Kaplan-Meier estimate, where PFS is a composite endpoint based on radiologic progression, clinical deterioration or death. Furthermore, log rank test will be used to test if there is significant difference in PFS between two arms.

    <description>ORR will be as determined by RECIST v 1.1. The ORR will be defined as the number (%) of subjects with at least 1 visit response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR). Data obtained up until progression, or the last evaluable assessment in the absence of progression, will be included in the assessment of ORR. Subjects who go off treatment without progression receive a subsequent therapy, and then responds will not be included as responders in the ORR.

The end of response should coincide with the date of progression or death from any cause used for the RECIST 1.1 PFS endpoint. The time of initial response will be defined as the latest of dates contributing towards the first visit response of CR or PR. If a subject does not progress following a response, then their DoR will be censored at the PFS censoring time.

                  agent with pro-arrhythmic potential or where effect of the combination on QT is
                  not known if this criterion should be retained. Subject safety and the cardiac

                  premedication)

          -  Receipt of live attenuated vaccine within 30 days prior to the first dose of IP. Note:
             Subjects, if enrolled, should not receive live vaccine whilst receiving IP and up to
             30 days after the last dose of IP

             excipients

          -  Prior randomization or treatment in a previous durvalumab and/or tremelimumab clinical
             study regardless of treatment arm assignment

          -  Determined by the investigator that the subject is unsuitable to participate in the
