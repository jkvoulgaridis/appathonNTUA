      methyltransferase activity .This is A First-in-Human, Open Label, Phase I Study to Evaluate
      the Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics and Clinical Activity of HH2853, an EZH1/2
      Inhibitor, in Patients with Relapsed/Refractory Non-Hodgkin's Lymphomas or Advanced Solid
      Tumors,in the Phase I Dose Escalation The accelerated titration (ATD) incorporated with
      Bayesian Optimal Interval design (BOIN) will be used to assess the DLT, safety, tolerability,
