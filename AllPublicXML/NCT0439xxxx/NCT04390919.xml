    <textblock>
      According to ESC Guidelines for the diagnosis of acute heart failure 2008, patients with ADHF
      were diagnosed, and their medical history, laboratory examination and treatment plan were
      retrospectively analyzed, and the patients were followed up for 1 year. The 1-year outcomes
      of patients were analyzed to explore the prognostic indicators for patients with ADHF
