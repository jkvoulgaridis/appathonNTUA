        The study will include adult patients 18 years or older, diagnosed with HR+/HER2- A/MBC who
        initiated palbociclib combination therapy with AI as the first-line therapy on or after 03
        February 2015 up to and including 31 July 2019.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Female or male sex.

          -  Diagnosis (confirmed by clinical review) of A/MBC, defined as breast cancer at stage
             IIIB, stage IIIC, stage IV or identified as having distant metastasis.

          -  Age â‰¥18 years at A/MBC diagnosis.

          -  Initiated palbociclib in combination with an AI as first-line therapy after A/MBC
             diagnosis on or after 03 February 2015 through 31 July 2019. Note that the date of the
             start of the inclusion period reflects the month of palbociclib US FDA approval.

          -  Evidence of ER or PR positive disease, or absence of any indication of ER and PR
             negative disease closest to A/MBC diagnosis (ie, patients are eligible without
             affirmative indication of ER/PR+ status as long as ER/PR- indication is not present).

          -  Evidence of HER2 negative disease, or absence of any indication of HER2 positive
             disease closest to A/MBC diagnosis (ie, patients are eligible without affirmative
             indication of HER2- status as long as HER2+ indication is not present).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Enrollment in an interventional clinical trial for A/MBC during the study observation
             period.

          -  Evidence of prior treatment with any CDK4/6 inhibitor in the adjuvant setting.

          -  Evidence of another primary cancer within 3 years prior to the initial line containing
             palbociclib.
