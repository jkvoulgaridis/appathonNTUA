  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inguinal hernia is one of the most-common surgical conditions. Incidence is about 27% in
      males and 3% in females.The treatment of this condition is inguinal hernia repair operation
      which can be approached with several techniques; open hernia repair, laparoscopic hernia
      repair and robotic hernia repair. The current guidelines recommend the hernia repair
      operation with mesh placement either Lichtenstenstein operation or laparoscopic technique;
      transabdominal preperitoneal technique (TAPP) and totally extraperitoneal technique (TEP). In
      the laparoscopic approach, one of the complications that can occur is post-operative pain
      from the mesh fixator. So the self-gripping mesh becomes another option to decrease this
      incidence.However the adhesive property of the mesh is still challenging for many surgeons.
      Several techniques of self-gripping mesh placement were introduced. One of the popular
      techniques is bilateral vertical folding of self-gripping mesh which still causes some
      adhesive problems when introduced to the target area. This research's aim is to present a new
      technique of the self-gripping mesh placement which is more effective, more convenient, and
      decreases the time taken to place the mesh at the surgery site.

      A randomized control trail comparing the duration of mesh placement and surgeon satisfaction
      of self-gripping mesh with plastic sheath and with non-plastic sheath covering mesh. Patients
      with groin hernia who planned for elective laparoscopically repair hernia with self-gripping
      mesh at Ramathibodi Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, Mahidol University will are informed of
      the details of research at the outpatient department before admission. 1:1 open label
      randomization trail was designed dividing the patients into two groups by the study number.
      The operation will be done with the standard laparoscopic hernia repair technique by
      experienced surgeons.
