  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the effects of gestational age and other factors on maternal attachment
      relationship. There are different results in studies examining the effects of birth type on
      postpartum depression and mother-infant interaction. The aim of this study was to evaluate
      factors which affected mother-infant bond (MIB) using maternal attachment inventory (MAI).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Maternal Attachment Inventory (MAI) measure maternal love attachment (9). Muller tested
      the MAI questions in two phases; maternal adaptation and maternal attachmentEach item is
      evaluated by a 4-way to 26-point Likert-type scale ranging from &quot;always&quot; to &quot;never&quot;. Always
      is calculated as (a) = 4 points, often (b) = 3 points, sometimes (c) = 2 points and never (d)
      = 1 point. The lowest score which could be obtained from the scale that measures maternal
      emotions and behaviors indicating love is 26, the high score is 104, and a high score
      indicates a high maternal attachment (12).
