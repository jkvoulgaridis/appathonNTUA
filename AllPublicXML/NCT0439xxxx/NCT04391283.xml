  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The results of phase III FLAURA study showed a significant PFS benefit for first-line
      Osimertinib versus standard EGFR-TKIs in patients with EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC, the
      median PFS was 18.9 months and 10.2 months, respectively. However, only 136 Chinese patients
      were enrolled in FLAURA study. The objectives of this study are to assess the efficacy and
      safety of Osimertinib in a real world setting in Chinese patients with locally advanced or
      metastatic, treatment naïve, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation-positive
      Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Total of ~30 study sites are selected for conducting this observational study. Eligible
      patients will be prospectively and consecutively included. Therefore, the clinical practice
      in the selected patients group can represent the &quot;real-world&quot; situation in China, and the
      patient's medical record will be well documented and archived in those hospitals. All data
      defined in the protocol will be collected during the study and entered in the Electric Data
      Capture (EDC), being consistent to the patients' medical records.

      The most important bias of the study is that patients' characteristics will affect the
      treatment duration, efficacy and safety, such as, higher proportion of patients with WHO PS
      2~3 enroll in the study will result in shorter TTD, poorer effectiveness and higher
      toxicities than expected. The ~30 sites are not randomly selected and potential selection
      bias exists. To minimize enrolment bias, the patients who are eligible and consent to
      participate in the current study will be enrolled consecutively as per protocol and without
      personal preference from investigators.

      The self-selection bias may exit for the willingness and non-willingness participants. We'll
      try our best to discuss with the non-willingness participants to make sure the
      consistency/comparative between the willingness and non-willingness participants.

      There could be a certain percentage of patients who would lost to follow up, it is
      unavoidable in clinical study, and is more common in real world study. We can minimize the
      bias by selecting the hospitals with normative and high-quality clinical practice, trying to
      collect the reason of lost to follow up and enhancing patient management during the follow
      up. The above bias is acceptable as this is a &quot;real-world&quot; study. Only descriptive analysis
      will be performed for the primary, secondary and exploratory objectives. No statistical
      comparisons between subgroups will be done.

    <description>Progression-free survival (PFS), is defined as the time from the date of first dose of Osimertinib in this study until the date of disease progression as recorded in CRF or death (by any cause in the absence of progression) regardless of whether the subject withdraws from therapy or receives another anti-cancer therapy prior to progression, which usually refer to Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumours (RECIST) in clinical practice. Subjects who have not progressed or died at the time of analysis will be censored at the time of the latest date of assessment. If the subject has no evaluable visits after the baseline visit, they will be censored at 0 days unless they die before the planned visit after the baseline visit. Lost to follow-up patients who have not progressed will be censored at last documented contact with patient status &quot;non-progression&quot;.

      Blood Sample Collection and Retention: about 10 mL Whole human blood samples will be
      collected using streck tube, sent to the NGS lab and plasma will be extracted for storage at
      -80℃. until test.

      Tissue Sample Collection and Retention At baseline, fresh tissue samples (or cytological
      samples) will be collected or 6 slices of tissue sample olefin resections obtained from
      surgery or 10 slices of tissue samples olefin resection obtained from puncture biopsy will be
      provide to central laboratory for biomarker analysis. Before tissue sample olefin resection
      sent to central laboratory, a pathological quality should be conducted to ensure the
      percentage of tumor cells is greater than 10%. Tissue sample olefin resection will be labeled
      and put in a box and store at room temperature

        The patients with locally advanced/metastatic, EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC who are intent
        to be prescribed Osimertinib as the first line treatment are eligible to be the study
        target population.

        Base on the current clinical practice, it is estimated that the brain scans could be
        performed to approximately 350 patients at the baseline, approximately 200 patients' tissue
        or blood sample could be available at the baseline for de novo T790M analysis, and few
        patients with uncommon EGFR mutation, and/or patients with PS 2-3 could be included base on
        the current CSCO lung cancer guideline and clinical practice.
