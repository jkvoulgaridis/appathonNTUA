    <textblock>
      This randomized controlled trial aims to determine the effects of 12-weeks of wheelchair
      user-modified upper-body rowing on both traditional (insulin resistance, obesity,
      dyslipidemia (including low HDL-C and elevated TG and blood pressure) and novel (inflammatory
      status, autonomic nervous system function, vascular structure and function, and
      cardiorespiratory fitness level) cardiometabolic risk factors in SCI manual wheelchair users.
      As secondary objectives, this trial will investigate the effects of the exercise intervention
      on free-living physical activity, shoulder pain, and indices of quality of life.

      Men and women, aged 18-65 years; chronic SCI (â‰¥1 year since injury); individuals with
      sufficient sparing of arm function to participate in upper-body rowing; using a manual
      wheelchair as a primary tool for mobility will be included in the trial.

      The exercise training will be conducted as wheelchair-modified upper-body ergometer rowing.
      The training will be performed for up to 30 min, 3 times per week with moderate-to-vigorous
      intensity, with at least one rest day between sessions.

      Outcome measurements will be performed immediately before (baseline), after (post) 12 weeks
      of training, and 6 months after the termination of the intervention period (follow up). This
      approach allows for assessment of the short term effects of exercise training as well as any
      residual effects from the training intervention on cardiometabolic risk, shoulder pain,
      indices of quality of life, and free-living physical activity
