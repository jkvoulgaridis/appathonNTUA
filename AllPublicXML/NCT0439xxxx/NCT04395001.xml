  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is is to determine if the combination of non-opioid medication
      (duloxetine) and web-based pain-coping skills training (PCST) is beneficial for individuals
      with chronic musculoskeletal pain (CMP).

      With this study, the study team hopes to address two important unanswered questions: (1) Does
      combination treatment consisting of duloxetine and web-based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy
      (CBT) optimize treatment outcomes? (2) Would adherence-focused guidance delivered by nurse
      clinician using motivational interviewing (MI) techniques enhance treatment effectiveness?
      This study is significant because the study team aims to optimize pain-related treatment
      outcomes at the primary care level where most patients with pain are managed. Importantly,
      the use of nurse clinician providing adherence-focused guidance (as opposed to
      content-focused guidance) on the continued practice (or use) of pain coping skills increases
      the likelihood that the study's intervention is scalable in the future. Effective, accessible
      and scalable psychoeducational treatments are needed to manage CMP in real world clinic
      settings.

    <measure>Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS)</measure>
    <time_frame>week 13 of treatment phase, week 25 of treatment phase</time_frame>
    <description>Adult Self-Reported Measures on physical health (fatigue, pain intensity, pain interference, physical function, sleep disturbance, pain behavior and sleep-related impairment) and social health (ability to participate in social roles and activities). The values of the response to each question will be summed in order to determine the raw score. This must then be converted to the T-score. T-scores are standardized with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10. I.e. a T-score of 40 would be one standard deviation lower than the mean. A higher PROMIS T-score represents more of the concept being measured. For positively-worded concepts like Physical Function a T-score of 60 is one standard deviation better than average. By comparison, a Physical Function T-score of 40 is one SD worse than average.</description>
