  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Researchers are gathering information on the safety and effectiveness of proton radiation
      therapy in reducing the number of ventricular tachycardia (VT) episodes in subjects who
      continue to experience VT despite treatment with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator
      (ICD) and undergoing a previous catheter ablation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Proton therapy has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for cancer
      patients, including tumors in the heart, but not for treating heart rhythm disorders. The use
      of proton radiation therapy to treat heart rhythm disorders including VT and ventricular
      fibrillation (VF) is new and investigational; however, the FDA has approved proton therapy to
      treat abnormal rhythm disorders for this study. The development of a proton radiation therapy
      approach could be of substantial value in providing alternative therapy to either drug
      therapy or catheter-based ablation. With appropriate development, this therapy may be
      successful in the primary or secondary elimination of arrhythmias.

      Participants will be followed at 1 and 2 weeks, 1, 3, 6, 12 and 24-month intervals following
      treatment throughout the trial.

      Participant involvement will last approximately two years from the time of the proton
      radiation therapy procedure or until the last subject enrolled completes a 24 month
      follow-up.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior myocardial infarction or non-ischemic disease resulting in myocardial
             dysfunction

          -  A left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) &lt;50%

          -  An implanted ICD device as secondary prevention for monomorphic VT/VF. This includes
             patients who receive a device for primary prevention and then have recurrent sustained
             monomorphic VT or VT

          -  Have failed a prior catheter-based ablation for VT/VF after device implantation or
             have a contraindication to repeat ablation and and have failed reasonable drug options
             over the 3 months prior to consideration of particle therapy

          -  Repeat ablation from an epicardial venue in the absence of prior cardiac surgery, or
             where such an ablation if felt to be inappropriate in the view of the primary
             investigator

          -  Electrocardiographic documentation of 2 additional episodes of recurrent, sustained
             monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (MMVT) and/or pre-ventricular contraction (PVC)
             induced VT or VF that are terminated by ATP or ICD shocks by device interrogation over
             the past 3 months, since the sentinel ablation (see criteria #4).

          -  Age â‰¤ 80 yrs.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  VT in the absence of cardiomyopathy

          -  Reversible causes of VT including thyroid disorders, acute alcohol intoxication,
             recent major surgical procedures, trauma, or VT clearly produced by recurrent ischemia

          -  Multiple (e.g. &gt;3) clinical VT morphologies, that are thought to originate from widely
             disparate right ventricular (RV) or left ventricular (LV) areas.

          -  Recent cardiac events including myocardial infarction (MI), percutaneous coronary
             intervention (PCI), or valve or bypass surgery in the preceding 3 months, or
             anticipated in the next 3 months

          -  Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy &gt; Class IV

          -  Progressive Class IV angina or Class IV congestive heart failure (CHF) (including past
             or planned heart transplantation)

          -  Heritable arrhythmias or increased risk for torsade de pointes with class I or III
             drugs

          -  Prior surgical interventions for VT such as an encircling ventriculotomy procedure

          -  Contraindication to appropriate anti-coagulation therapy after ablation

          -  Renal failure requiring dialysis

          -  Prior therapeutic radiation therapy to the left chest that would preclude safe
             ablation of the cardiac target in the judgment of the radiation oncologist

          -  Medical conditions limiting expected survival to &lt;1 year

          -  Women of childbearing potential (unless post-menopausal or surgically sterile)

          -  Participation in any other clinical mortality trial (Participation in other
             non-mortality trials should be reviewed with the clinical trial management center)

          -  Unable to give informed consent
