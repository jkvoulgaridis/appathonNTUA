  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Colorectal cancer is the third most frequent neoplasm after prostate and lung in man and
      breast and lung cancers in woman from Western Countries. The intensive study of predictive
      factors has strongly ameliorated the therapeutic flow-chart of metastatic colorectal cancer
      (mCRC) by allowing the selection of patients who benefit from specific therapies. In this
      context, the assessment of RAS (N- and K-) oncogene mutations is able to predict the response
      to anti-EGFR agents being mutated RAS mCRC patients resistant to these drugs. In this group
      of patients the use of anti-angiogenic drugs (bevacizumab and aflibercept) is predominant.
      Still to date there are no studies to guide oncologists in the selection of the best
      anti-angiogenic drug (bevacizumab beyond progression vs aflibercept) after failure of the
      first-line chemotherapy in RAS-M mCRC patients. The present is the first observational,
      pragmatic, prospective study aimed to report outcomes of mCRC patients treated with folfiri
      plus bevacizumab versus folfiri plus aflibercept in second-line treatment of mRAS mCRC.
      Furthermore, the serum levels of angiopoietin-1 (Ang-1), angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2), vascular
      endothelial growth factor-A and C (VEGF-A and C), stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1),
      platelet-derived growth factor beta (PDGF-β), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF),
      interleukin-8 (IL-8), chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2), and chemokine (C-C motif) ligand
      5 (CCL5) and Placental Growth Factor (PlGF), will be evaluated before starting second-line
      chemotherapy with bevacizumab or aflibercept in order to evidence any pattern related to
      response and/or prognosis. The hypothesis is that knowledge of eventual unbalance of these
      factors could help to select the best anti-angiogenic drug in second-line treatment of mRAS
      mCRC patients.
