      Care Partner Assisted Intervention to Improve Oral Health for Individuals with Mild Dementia
      is a randomized control trial (RCT) based in New York City and North Carolina. The
      intervention includes both a tailored oral care plan and a behavioral component using the
      Adaptive Leadership Framework for Chronic Illness that the team introduced to manage symptoms
      associated with chronic conditions, such as dementia. Objective 1 is to evaluate the efficacy
      of an intervention to improve oral hygiene clinical outcomes (i.e. plaque index and gingival
      index) by improving oral hygiene behavior (i.e., frequency and duration of toothbrushing) and
      oral health skills among individuals with mild dementia. Objective 2A is to determine whether
      effects of the intervention on oral hygiene behavioral outcomes, are mediated by the
      following variables from the care partners' perspective: 1) oral care self-efficacy; 2) care
      partner self-efficacy; 3) use of cueing methods; 4) and FOCUSED Communication. Objective 2B
      is to determine whether effects of the intervention on oral hygiene clinical outcomes, are
      mediated by the following variables from the care partner's perspective: 1) oral care
      self-efficacy; 2) care partner's self-efficacy; 3) use of cueing methods; 4) and FOCUSED
      Communication. Objective 3A is to determine whether effects of the intervention on oral
      hygiene clinical outcomes are mediated by oral hygiene behavioral outcomes. Objective 3B is
      to determine whether effects of the intervention on oral hygiene clinical outcomes are
      mediated by the care partner's factors, which then mediate the oral hygiene behavioral
      outcomes on oral hygiene clinical outcomes. This innovative care partner-assisted oral care
      behavior intervention will assist participants and care partners in implementing a
      cooperative oral hygiene care plan to prevent deterioration of oral health, which in turn,
      will help the targeted population maintain independence in completing daily activities and
      quality of life for an extended period of time.

      Dyads that each consist of an individual with mild dementia and his/her care partner will be
      enrolled at two sites, Duke University in Durham, North Carolina and New York University in
      New York, New York. This is an unblinded, randomized trial to assess the acceptability and
      effectiveness of the oral health intervention among individuals with mild dementia (MD). The
      study will utilize qualitative and quantitative methods to learn about the oral health
      outcomes in individuals with mild dementia.

      The study lasts 6 months. The first three months is the active intervention phase in which
      coaching and educational modules are delivered. The second three months is the maintenance
      period in which no coaching or educational modules are presented to participants. As a team,
      the study coordinator, the oral health evaluator (a dental hygienist), and the
      interventionist will conduct three visits with the participants and their care partners;
      baseline, 3-month (end of the active intervention phase), and 6-month (end of three-month
      maintenance phase).

      The intervention protocol will include three groups; two treatment groups and one control
      group. All participants will receive oral health education material at the baseline visit.
      Treatment Group 1 and Treatment Group 2 will be given a smart electronic toothbrush. Only
      Treatment Group 2 will receive the in-home and telephone coaching throughout the duration of
      the study and will be instructed to record daily brushing habits. The coaching sessions
      include individualized instruction on oral hygiene technique, cueing strategy development, or
      oral hygiene monitoring and coaching. Treatment Group 1 and the Control Group will not
      receive the coaching sessions.
