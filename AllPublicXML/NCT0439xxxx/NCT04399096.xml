      Sound and Vision: A collaboration between service-users, artists and the public to explore
      the lived experience of hallucinations
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sound and Vision will pair local artists with patients who have had hallucinations to create
      art pieces that represent their hallucinatory experiences. Patients with diagnoses of
      schizophrenia and Parkinson's disease will be invited to take part in participating National
      Health Service (NHS) clinics, to capture and compare a wide range of hallucinatory
      experiences. Patients will meet with artists on several occasions who will then develop the
      piece, which may be a painting, drawing, or other media that the artist and service-user
      jointly select.

      Completed artworks will be the centrepiece for an exhibition at United Kingdom (UK) science
      festivals and a digital (on-line) presentation. The exhibition will be accompanied by
      researchers explaining the brain science of hallucinations, recordings of patients and
      artists describing their experience with hallucinations and the process of developing the
      artworks, booklets cataloguing the exhibition, and art materials available for artistic
      expression of their own experiences. A digital compendium of the artworks and supporting
      material will be publicly available alongside the opportunity to complete an online survey
      exploring the themes of the artworks and collecting information on personal experiences. The
      objectives are to engage the public in an appreciation of the experience of hallucinations
      and their prevalence across many common mental health and neurodegenerative disorders, as
      well as an experience many people will share without ever being diagnosed. The exhibition
      will also encourage the public to share their own experiences through the online
      questionnaires creating a platform to begin to improve the understanding of the diversity of
      hallucination-like experiences in the general population.

    <measure>University of Miami Parkinson's disease Hallucinations Questionnaire (UM-PDHQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The University of Miami Parkinson's disease Hallucinations Questionnaire (UM-PDHQ) is composed of 6 quantitative and 14 qualitative items to define the key characteristics of hallucinations in Parkinson's Disease. The first 6 questions score the severity of hallucinations with a minimum score is zero and a maximum of 14, with greater score indicating greater severity. The remaining 14 questions have qualitative answers.</description>

    <measure>The Multi-Modality Unusual Sensory Experiences Questionnaire (MUSEQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The Multi-Modality Unusual Sensory Experiences Questionnaire (MUSEQ) is a 43-item self-report measure with each item rated on a five-point Likert scale, and assesses unusual sensory experiences in six modalities: auditory, visual, olfactory, gustatory, bodily sensations, and sensed presence. The minimum score is zero, the maximum score is 173 with a greater score indicating a higher frequency of unusual sensory experiences.</description>
