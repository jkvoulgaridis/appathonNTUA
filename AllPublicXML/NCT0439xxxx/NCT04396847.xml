  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Heavy-drinking smokers, including those with alcohol use disorder (AUD), are at increased
      risk for numerous negative health outcomes relative to those who use alcohol or cigarettes
      only. Although heavy-drinking smokers are recognized as an important subgroup for clinical
      and public health interventions, there are presently no approved medications for the joint
      indication of alcohol reduction and smoking cessation. Based on evidence that the serotonin
      system plays a role in alcohol and nicotine consumption and relapse, this study aims to
      examine whether a serotonin medication alters alcohol and nicotine responses in smokers with
      AUD, informing its potential utility as a candidate therapy for this clinical subgroup.

    <textblock>
      Pharmacotherapy development remains a critical objective for reducing health and societal
      burdens associated with alcohol use disorder (AUD). Developing targeted treatments for
      specific AUD subgroups is a key objective. Among those with AUD, cigarette smokers comprise a
      sizable and critical subgroup with disproportionally high long-term health risks, making it a
      key priority to advance therapies for concurrent AUD and cigarette smoking. The serotonin
      (5-hydroxtytryptamine; 5-HT) system is broadly implicated in addictive behaviors, in part
      reflecting the role of 5-HT in modulating dopamine function. Preclinical studies of 5-HT
      receptor drugs have shown that targeted modulation of the 5-HT2C receptor (implicated in
      5-HT-related inhibition of DA function) alters the consumption and reinstatement of addictive
      drugs, including alcohol and nicotine. Of the selective 5-HT2C receptor agonists, lorcaserin
      has superior near-term potential for repurposing as an AUD therapy, having been approved by
      the Food and Drug Administration for weight management. Human laboratory medication trials
      offer a time- and cost-effective option for validating preclinical findings prior to larger
      randomized controlled trials, and for testing candidate treatment mechanisms. This Phase II
      human laboratory screening trial will evaluate lorcaserin as a novel candidate therapy for
      smokers with AUD. Effects of lorcaserin vs. placebo will be evaluated in a double-blind,
      within-subjects, crossover study with human laboratory endpoints. This study will provide
      early human data on the effects of a 5-HT2C receptor agonist in relation to alcohol-related
      outcomes, informing its potential for further evaluation as a candidate treatment for AUD.
