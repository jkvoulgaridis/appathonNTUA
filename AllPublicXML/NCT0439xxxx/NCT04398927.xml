      This study were designed to verify the better method of survival for metastatic ICC.

      Since the traditional method for metastatic ICC was GEMOX(recommended from NCCN guideline),
      our previous study found better results from Folfirinox over GEMOX.

      Our current study were conducted for further investigation to verify the better method for
      metastatic ICC.

    <textblock>
      ICC(Intrahepatic CholangioCarcinoma) patients with metastasis has a short survival time and
      poor prognosis after diagnosis. Treatment methods was few and far from satisfaction. The
      treatment recommended from NCCN guideline was GEMOX(Systemic Chemotheray) and clinical
      trials. Our previous study has demonstrate Folfirinox(Systemic Chemotheray based on
      Oxaliplatin，5-fluorouracil and Irinotecan) has a survival and tumor response advantage of
      GEMOX.

      Further study was needed to intensive confirmation of the result. We designed this study to
      demonstrate the hypothesis. Metastasis ICCs were recruited and screened by our criteria. All
      patients were treated with Folfirinox(Systemic Chemotheray based on
      Oxaliplatin，5-fluorouracil and Irinotecan) plus PD1(Sintilimab).

      The progression free survival and overall survival were our primary and secondary endpoint.

      Our study were designed to verify the better method of survival for metastatic ICC.
