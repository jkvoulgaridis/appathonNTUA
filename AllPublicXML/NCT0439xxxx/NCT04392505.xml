      The main aim is to identify and describe biomarkers in different sample types related to
      chemoradiation followed by durvalumab treatment for stage III PD-L1 negative and positive
      non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients' eligible for curatively intended chemoradiation.

      The hypothesis is that clinical differences in course of disease reflect underlying
      biological characteristics.

      This is an open, multinational, phase 2 trial to investigate the Properties of cancer cells
      before, during and after treatment with the investigational study drug durvalumab in patients
      with locally advanced non-small celled lung cancer (NSCLC). Both patients with high and low
      PD-L1 expression are allowed to participate. Durvalumab (PD-L1 inhibitor) will be
      administered after a period with standardtreatment with chemotherapy and radiationtherapy
      (chemoradiotherapy) for around 7 weeks. After maximum 5 weeks break after chemoradiotherapy,
      durvalumab will be given in the same dose to all patients for up to 12 months. The follow-up
      include a safety follow-up for up to five years, followed by a survival follow-up for up to a
      total of ten years.

      The main aim is to identify and describe biomarkers in different sample types related to
      chemoradiation followed by durvalumab treatment for stage III PD-L1 negative and positive
      non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients' eligible for curatively intended chemoradiation.
