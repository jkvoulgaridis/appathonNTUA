  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Previous studies have suggested that prophylactic muscle coverage in high-risk patients
      undergoing revascularization procedures through a groin incision have the potential to reduce
      rates of complications and re-operation. This is a prospective randomized control trial to
      test this hypothesis at the University of Wisconsin Hospitals and Clinics.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of graft infections after groin dissection for lower limb revascularization is
      estimated to be between 2 and 20%. Infection requiring re-operation and muscle flap coverage
      for salvage is estimated to be between 11 and 13%. Retrospective studies have endeavored to
      create risk calculators to better predict patients at high risk of need for muscle flap
      salvage. Fischer et al. suggest that in high-risk patients, prophylactic muscle flaps can
      reduce complications from 70% to 10%, rates of infection from 70% to 3% and wound breakdown
      from 48% to 5%. Cost-savings of around $400,000 per year with the use of prophylactic muscle
      flaps are estimated. Unfortunately, the retrospective nature of the Fischer et al. study,
      lack of standardization of patients receiving prophylactic muscle flaps, and use of the same
      cohort for the risk calculator as for the outcomes analysis all reduce the generalizability
      and reproducibility of these results.

      At the University of Wisconsin Hospitals and Clinics, muscle coverage is routinely used in
      cases of infection or lymph leak but is not systematically used in prophylactic settings.
      This is because it is generally left to surgeon preferenceâ€”if they feel like a muscle flap is
      needed (for a variety of non-standardized anatomic/surgical or patient factors) then it is
      performed. Muscle coverage of vascular grafts in and of itself is not an experimental
      procedure and has been performed for decades.

      The goal of this study is to determine whether prophylactic muscle flaps in high-risk
      patients can a) reduce the rates of infection requiring re-operation, and b) reduce the
      significant morbidity associated with other non-operative complications. This will be the
      first prospective, randomized control trial to address this issue.

    <description>A &quot;muscle flap&quot; refers to taking an expendable muscle with its vascular supply and moving it to a new area. In this case, the investigators will take a muscle from the leg or abdomen that is redundant (other muscles perform the same function) and moving it to cover vascular grafts to provide healthy tissue to prevent infection.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Open lower extremity arterial revascularization

          -  Groin incision

          -  &quot;High-risk&quot; patients based on risk calculation

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnant or breast-feeding

          -  Any person with diagnosis of an active groin infection preoperatively

          -  Incarcerated patients

          -  Unstable patients going directly to the OR for whom the study consent process would
             delay care, and those who cannot give informed consent to participate in the research
             study will be excluded

          -  If a surgeon feels that a patient should or should not receive a flap based on
             intra-operative or pre-operative characteristics, those patients will be excluded from
             the study

          -  Prior to a scheduled groin intervention case a prior authorization will be sent to the
             participant's insurance company. If the groin flap is denied, which would be highly
             unusual, then the participant would be excluded from the study.
