    <textblock>
      This trial is an open-label, multicenter, Phase 0/2 trial that will enroll up to 50
      participants with recurrent glioblastoma which are schedule for resection. In the lead-in
      cohort, a total of 10 participants will be enrolled into the proposed phase 0 clinical trial.
      Participants will be administered LY3214996 plus Abemaciclib prior to surgical resection of
      their tumor. If positive PK results are demonstrated in ≥50% of Phase 0 participants and at
      least 5 participants are enrolled into Phase 2, up to approximately 40 additional
      participants will be enrolled in the dose expansion cohort in order to achieve a total of 25
      participants enrolled into Phase 2 (lead-in cohort + dose expansion).

          8. Participant has serious and/or uncontrolled preexisting medical condition(s) that, in
             the judgment of the investigator, would preclude participation in this study (for

         11. Have a mean QT interval corrected for heart rate (QTc) of ≥470 milliseconds on
             screening electrocardiogram (ECG) as calculated using the Bazett's formula.

         12. The patient has a personal history of any of the following conditions: syncope of
