      The objective of the study is to detect the state of clinical and instrumental factors
      related in fighter pilots with non-specific mechanical neck pain.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A prevalence study (descriptive, observational, cross-sectional) was carried out, in which
      clinimetric variables (range of active cervical movement, motor control and electrical
      activity), perceived pain (using NSMNP and algometry) and disability were evaluated. The
      sample (n = 18) is divided into instructors (n = 7) and students (n = 11). The objective of
      this study is to characterize descriptively at the sociodemographic level and to know the
      state of health in relation to clinimetric variables of the fighter pilots of the Talavera la
      Real air base (Badajoz) to determine the risk of developing an neck injury.

    <time_frame>1 week</time_frame>
    <description>For the evaluation of cervical ROM, we will use a conventional two-branch goniometer, from the EnrafNonius® brand. Subjects will be placed in a sitting position on a stool, with a neutral neck and head position. The range of active cervical mobility presented by the patients was measured in reference to the three planes of the space. In the sagittal plane, the degrees of mobility to flexion and extension were measured, in the frontal plane the right and left inclinations, and in the transverse plane both rotations.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Disability</measure>
    <time_frame>1 week</time_frame>
    <description>The degree of cervical disability involvement was measured through the Neck Disability Index (NDI), translated into Spanish, presenting optimum reliability and internal validity. It consists of 10 sections, 4 of them are related to subjective symptoms and the other 6 are related to basic activities of daily life.
Each of the sections presents 6 possible responses, scoring these from 0 to 5 according to progression of functional disability.
Scores less than 5 points indicate non-disability, between 5-14 points indicates mild disability, values between 30-48 points moderate disability, between 50-64 points severe disability and those that exceed 70 points represent complete disability.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pressure pain thresholds</measure>
    <time_frame>1 week</time_frame>
    <description>A mechanical pressure Fisher algometer (Force Dial model FDK 40) with a 1 cm² area contact head was used to measure the pressure pain threshold. The reliability of pressure algometry has been found to be high [intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.91 (95% confidence interval, 0.82-0.97)]. With the participant in supine, the pressure pain threshold of the the myofascial trigger point nº2 of the upper trapezius muscle according to Travell and Simons and the central trigger point of the sternocleidomastoid muscle was bilaterally evaluated. Also, in sitting position the pressure pain threshold of the myofascial trigger point of the scapula elevator muscle was bilaterally evaluated. The minimal clinically important difference (MCDI) is 1.2 Kg/cm2.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Surface electromyographic</measure>
    <time_frame>1 week</time_frame>
    <description>The electromyography (EMG) signal of the upper trapezius muscle was recorded during 3 step contractions of shoulder elevation force (15%-30% maximal voluntary contraction). Se tomo el valor más alto de las tres contracciones. The signal of the sternocleidomastoid muscle was recorded during 3 billateraly step contractions of neck flexión and antepulsion neck force. Both contractions were performed in a combined and simultaneous movement, recreating the movement produced by the reaction forces in the takeoff and landing of the fighter jet. Both movements were made at 15%-30% maximal voluntary contraction, as used by Calamita et al on the same musculature in subjects with nonspecific neck pain.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Kinesophobia</measure>
    <time_frame>1 week</time_frame>
    <description>The Spanish version of the TSK-11 was used to measure fear of movement. Higher scores indicate greater fear-avoidance behaviors. The TSK-11 has demonstrated acceptable internal consistency and validity.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Catastrophic pain</measure>
    <time_frame>1 week</time_frame>
    <description>The Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS) is a self-administered scale of 13 items and one of the most used to assess catastrophism of pain. The subjects take their past painful experiences as a reference and indicate the degree to which they experienced each of the 13 thoughts or feelings on a 5-point Líkert scale ranging from 0 (never) to 4 (always). The theoretical range of the instrument is between 13 and 62, indicating low scores, little catastrophism, and high values, high catastrophism.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Numerical pain rating scale. Participants rated the intensity of their neck pain at
             rest on an 11-point Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS), where 0 was no pain and 10
             maximum pain .The pilots airforce were asked to indicate the pain levels that they
             experienced when they wake up in the morning. Cleland et al reported that the minimal
             detectable change (MDC) and minimal clinically important difference (MCID) for the
             numeric pain rating scale were 1.3 and 2.1 points, respectively, in patients with
             mechanical neck pain.

          -  Joint Position Sense. This test assesses the ability to relocate the head to its
             natural posture, and is a test of cervical proprioception. It consists of a visual
             measurement of error in moving the head to the initial neutral position after active
             cervical rotation. If the average difference between the initial and final position is
             equivalent to an error of 4.5 degrees, it is considered abnormal and the subject could
             be included in the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Cervical pain that occurs with irradiation to the upper limbs and / or radiculopathy.

          -  Cervical spine surgery.

          -  Have received physical therapy treatment six weeks prior to data collection.

          -  Being involved in an on-going medico-legal dispute.
