  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The BioVAT-HF trial will test the hypothesis that cardiomyocyte implantation via engineered
      heart muscle (EHM), the proposed investigational medicinal product (IMP; designated
      &quot;Biological Ventricular Assist Tissue&quot; or BioVAT), results in sustainable remuscularization
      and biological enhancement of myocardial performance in the failing heart. EHM are
      constructed from defined mixtures of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived
      cardiomyocytes and stromal cells in a bovine collagen type I hydrogel. Comprehensive
      preclinical testing confirmed the rationale for the clinical translation of the myocardial
      remuscularization strategy by EHM implantation. The patient target population for EHM therapy
      is patients suffering from advanced heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF; EF:
      ≤35%) and no realistic option for heart transplantation.

    <description>Target heart wall thickness (HWT) as determined by high resolution echocardiography and/or CINE-mode MRI (17-segment model). Primary efficacy analyses are based on the changes in HWT between baseline and 2 weeks, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months and 12 months after implantation. To test for a time effect a one-way Repeated Measures ANOVA will be performed for the primary endpoint. In case of detecting a time effect this is followed by Dunnett-type pairwise comparisons to baseline using paired t-Tests. Due to the explorative character of the efficacy analysis testing will be performed at a 10% two-sided significance level. Mean differences will be reported along with 90% confidence intervals.</description>
