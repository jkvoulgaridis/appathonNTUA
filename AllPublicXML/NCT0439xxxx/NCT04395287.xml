      The aims of this study are as follows:

        -  The primary aim is to investigate the relationship between changes in screen media use
           with changes in non-sedentary time (time, min/day, spent in activities other than lying
           and sitting) during leisure (outside nursery) from baseline to 18-month follow-up.

        -  The secondary aim is to investigate the relationship between changes in screen media use
           and time (min/day) spent in specific daily activities (lying, sitting, moving, standing,
           walking, and running) and changes in moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity
           during leisure.

      The current study is a secondary, observational investigation of data from The Motor Skills
      in PreSchool (MIPS) study. The MIPS study was initiated in 2016 and included preschool
      children (3-6 years of age) attending public preschools in the Municipality of Svendborg, in
      Denmark. A subset of the preschools included an intervention component, whose aim was
      optimization of motor skills. In this study, the children's screen media use was assessed via
      questionnaire and physical activity was assessed using two Axivity AX3 (Axivity Ltd.,
      Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom) triaxial accelerometers - one placed at the hip and one
      at the lower back - at both baseline and at 18-month follow-up. Time spent in distinct
      activity types (sitting, moving, standing, biking, running, walking, and lying down) are
      determined from the acceleration measured with the thigh worn device. In addition, data on
      relevant covariates was also collected. Having data on both exposure and outcome at baseline
      and follow-up renders detailed longitudinal assessments possible. Furthermore, daily schedule
      (proxy based on reporting by parents and pedagogical personnel) information on the children
      introduces the possibility of domain-specific analyses of physical activity, as we can time
      annotate the data into different sections of the children's daily routine.

    <description>Questionnaire-based assessment of typical amount of time per week spent using screen-based media devices during leisure, assessed at two time points. Continuously scaled in main analyses; a difference is computed (18-month follow-up value minus baseline value). Additionally, screen time amount at the two time points will be scaled categorically, according to being classified as low or high according to WHO criteria for preschool children (Low (recommended): &lt;=1 hour/day, high: &gt;1 hour/day): High-high, high-low, low-high, and low-low.</description>
