  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Primary objective is to demonstrate the efficacy of dupilumab treatment compared with
      placebo in pediatric patients with active eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) based on histologic
      improvement meeting validated histologic criteria.

      The Secondary objectives are:

        -  To demonstrate the efficacy of dupilumab compared to placebo in pediatric patients with
           active EoE after 16 weeks of treatment as assessed by endoscopic visual measurements of
           disease activity using the Eosinophilic Esophagitis-Endoscopic Reference Score
           (EoE-EREFS) and histologic abnormalities as measured by the EoE Histology Scoring System
           (EoE-HSS)

        -  To evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of dupilumab treatment for up
           to 16 weeks in pediatric patients with active EoE

        -  To evaluate the effects of dupilumab on transcriptomic signatures associated with EoE
           and type 2 inflammation

        -  To study the effects of dupilumab on the type 2 inflammation gene expression signature

        -  To evaluate the concentration-time profile of functional dupilumab in serum in this
           population

        -  To assess efficacy of long-term (52 weeks) dupilumab treatment

        -  To assess safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of long-term (52 weeks) dupilumab
           treatment

        -  To evaluate the impact of dupilumab treatment on EoE signs and symptoms

PESQ-C is an observer-reported outcome measure intended to be completed independently by caregivers. The PESQ-C will measure occurrence of signs of EoE and will be completed once daily via an electronic diary. Data from a 14-day period preceding the baseline visit and a 14-day period preceding the week 16 visit will be used to calculate the proportion of days or total time segments within a day (night, morning, afternoon, evening) with 1 or more EoE signs.</description>

    <description>For patients aged ≥1 to &lt;12 years
PEESSv2.0-caregiver version assesses the frequency and severity of EoE symptoms among pediatric patients (Franciosi, 2011). The PEESSv2.0 consists of 20 items and has a one-month recall period. The total score ranges from 0 to 100; higher scores indicate greater symptom burden of among pediatric EoE patients</description>

    <measure>Normalized Enrichment Scores (NES) for the relative change in the EoE diagnostic panel (EDP) transcriptome signature</measure>

    <description>NES reflects the degree to which the activity level of a set of transcripts is overrepresented at the extremes (top or bottom) of the entire ranked list of transcripts within a sample and is normalized by accounting for the number of transcripts in the set (Barbie, 2009)(Subramanian, 2005). NES scores will be calculated for each transcriptome signature for each sample for statistical analyses.</description>
