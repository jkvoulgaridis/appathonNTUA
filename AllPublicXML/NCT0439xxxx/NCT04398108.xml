  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, Single-arm, Phase I clinical study to evaluate the pharmacokinetics,
      tolerability and safety of margetuximab plus chemotherapy in Chinese patients with advanced
      HER2+ breast cancer who have received standard anti-HER2 directed therapy in the metastatic
      setting (mandatory including trastuzumab).

      The primary endpoint of this study is PK parameters of margetuximab.

      Approximately 16~20 Chinese subjects will be enrolled. Eligible subjects are HER2 positive,
      metastatic breast cancer who has received standard anti-HER2 directed therapy in the
      metastatic setting in Chinese patients. Subjects should have received treatment with at least
      one, and no more than four lines of therapy overall in the metastatic setting.

      Eligible subjects will receive margetuximab plus chemotherapy. The dosage and administering
      of margetuximab is 15 mg/kg IV Q3W. Investigators selected one of three backbone chemotherapy
      regimens given at standard doses: capecitabine, vinorelbine or gemcitabine. Subject will
      receive the treatment until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of
      consent, initiation of subsequent anti-tumor treatment therapy, or death (whichever occurs
      first).
