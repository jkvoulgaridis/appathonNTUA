  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Utilization of public health care mirrors the older individual's overall health, and
      increased need for health care may precede more clear symptoms of acute disease. In a
      previous retrospective study, we found a significant increase in municipal home care service
      (minutes/week) in a 12-month period prior to acute hospitalization. This PhD-study aims at
      examining the effect of a software algorithm monitoring older citizens utilization of
      municipal home care. When home care increases the community nurse is notified and special
      attention is paid to the individual's current health situation. Pro-active health care
      initiatives may be launched in collaboration with the primary care physician. The
      intervention is the algorithm.
