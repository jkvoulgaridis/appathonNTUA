    <textblock>
      This pilot study aims to measure the effects of an intervention of 22.5 grams of freeze-dried
      whole blueberry powder in water drunk daily. Measures are on outcomes of depression,
      biological markers of inflammation and oxidative stress, and microbial populations in the
      intestines.

      A 29 week double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover intervention assessing the effect of a
      blueberries on behavioral symptoms related to depression, biological markers of inflammation
      and oxidative stress, and gut microbiome measures. A total of 45 participants will be
      randomly assigned to either a blueberry-first or placebo-first group; participants will take
      22.5 grams of either freeze-dried blueberry powder or matched placebo powder mixed with water
      daily for 12 weeks. This period is followed by a 4 week washout period at the beginning of
      which all participants will stop the assigned intervention. After this washout the
      participants will start their crossover intervention.

    <intervention_model_description>This study will utilize a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design. 60 participants with depression will be randomized into either the placebo first or blueberry first group. Randomization will be based on outcomes from behavioral measures (Major Depression Inventory and GAD-7) and a physiological measure (C-reactive protein levels) in appointment 0. The first arm will consist of 12 weeks of daily treatment and baseline (pre-intervention), mid-intervention and post-intervention assessments. Next there will be a four week washout period, after which patients will switch treatments, and the second arm will commence--identical to the first in structure. Further, the study is a repeated measures design with each participant's baseline measures serving as her or his own control.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking>Quadruple (Participant, Care Provider, Investigator, Outcomes Assessor)</masking>
    <masking_description>The blueberry treatment and placebo powders have been supplied by the U.S. Highbush Blueberry Council; packets are labeled either alpha or omega. The treatment powder is a freeze-dried whole blueberry powder, and the placebo is a color- and flavor-matched powder which has been used in previous trials. Only an unblinded research assistant will have knowledge of which label corresponds to blueberry or placebo. That research assistant will be in charge of: (1) Before each appointment, distributing appropriate treatment or placebo packets into closable boxes with a number corresponding to each participant. Care-providers will give closed boxes to participants at the time of assessment. (2) Re-labeling all collected data and samples with a participant code number, and sorting into appropriate groups for analysis by blinded researchers.</masking_description>
