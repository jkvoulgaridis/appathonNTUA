  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acetabular fractures are articular fractures involving the hip joint that needs anatomical
      reduction and a strict long follow up after fixation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The percentage of patients with lost follow up is significantly high. Previously all other
      studies mainly focused on the radiographic outcome after acetabular fractures and rarely on
      patient reported functional outcomes and quality of life. The use of patient-reported outcome
      measures (PROMs) is increasing and may lead to modifications of treatment. Recent technologic
      advances, namely smartphones, capable of measuring outcomes after acetabular fractures are
      now very important in quantifying value-based care. This was previously accomplished through
      office assessments and surveys with variable follow-up but this strategy lacks continuous and
      complete data. Studies show that these remote modes of follow-up are safe and that patients
      are as equally satisfied with them as they are with in-person follow- up care
