  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, we will study 129Xe-MRI and LCI as tools for diagnosis of BOS in pediatric
      patients who have received Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT) and have been
      identified as eligible for this study. Participants will be required to have vital signs
      collected, complete breathing tests and complete an MRI. The MRI will require participants to
      perform breath holds in the MRI scanner with xenon gas while being coached by a research
      assistant.

        Two groups of participants will be recruited. Group 1 will be participants who meet the
        screening criteria for the development of BOS according to the NIH criteria. Group 2 will
        be participants who may or may not have abnormal spirometry; however they do not fulfill
        the NIH criteria for the development of BOS.
