  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this phase II trial study is to determine whether a positron emission
      tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) scan using 18F-DCFPyL affects the clinical
      management plan in Veterans.

      In this study, the management plan prior to and after 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT will be recorded by
      specific questionnaires and corresponding changes in management will be analyzed. The scan
      will be used to see how the disease has spread. Both the treatment strategies and probable
      disease outcomes as relevant to clinical endpoints will be assessed. This study is open to
      Veterans only.

    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>To determine the impact of 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT on initial and subsequent treatment strategies of patients with prostate cancer. This study uses questionnaires completed by the referring physician. A pre-scan questionnaire , a post-scan questionnaire and a follow-up questionnaire will be used to determine whether 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT affected intended treatment strategies and whether these intended treatment strategies were finally implemented.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants who fulfill criteria for initial staging or restaging as outlined below:

               1. Initial treatment strategy decisions (initial staging)

                  All participants with histologically proven prostate cancer or strong suspicion
                  of prostate adenocarcinoma based on very high PSA levels (&gt;50 ng/mL) who require
                  an initial treatment/management decision who may be candidate for any of the
                  following strategies:

                  A) Surgery B) External radiation therapy (RT) C) Other focal therapies D)
                  Systemic medical treatment E) Watchful waiting

               2. Assessment for Subsequent treatment strategy (restaging), any of the following:

        A) Participants with biochemical recurrence who are potential candidates for any salvage
        treatment. Biochemical recurrence is defined by rising PSA after definitive therapy with
        prostatectomy or radiation therapy, as any of the following:

          1. Post radical prostatectomy (RP): PSA equals to or greater than 0.2 ng/mL measured more
             than 6 weeks after RP

          2. Post-radiation therapy : Nadir + greater than or equal to 2 ng/mL rise in PSA B)
             Participants with known prostate cancer who undergo restaging because of new symptoms
             C) Participants with known metastatic prostate cancer who undergo restaging because of
             rising PSA with negative or inconclusive conventional imaging D) Participants with
             known prostate cancer who are treated medically or with RLT in whom response to
             treatment is assessed

               -  Capability to provide written informed consent

               -  Able to remain still for duration of each imaging procedure (about 30 minutes) *
                  Participants may be reenrolled in the study, if 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT is performed
                  for subsequent management decision.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Less than 18 years-old at the time of radiotracer administration

          -  Inability to complete the needed investigational and standard-of-care imaging
             examinations due to other reasons (severe claustrophobia, radiation phobia, etc.)

          -  Any additional medical condition, serious concurrent illness, or other extenuating
             circumstance that, in the opinion of the Investigator, may significantly interfere
             with study compliance.

          -  Inability to provide written informed consent
