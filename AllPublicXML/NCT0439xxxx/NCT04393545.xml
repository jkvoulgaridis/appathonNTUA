  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of splinting, exercise and
      electrotherapy on the hallux valgus (HV) angle, and foot-specific health-related quality of
      life. Sixty women (120 feet) with bilateral HV deformity were randomly assigned to one of
      three groups - an HV night splint (SP) group, an exercise (EX) group, and a high-voltage
      galvanic stimulation (EL) group. Angular degrees (hallux interphalangeal, HV, and
      intermetatarsal angles expressed as angles A, B and C, respectively) were determined before
      enrollment (t0) and three months after treatment (t2). Foot-specific quality of life was
      assessed using the Manchester-Oxford Foot Questionnaire (MOFQ) at t0, after one month (t1),
      and at t2. All groups exhibited significant changes in the A, B, and C angles and outcome
      measures (p ≤0.001). Decreases in the A and C angles, and MOFQ-Pain subscale scores, were
      higher in the SP group than in the other two groups (p&lt;0.05). C angle at t2, MOFQ-Walking
      score at t1 and t2 and MOFQ-Pain subscale score at t1 were lower in the SP group (p&lt;0.05).

    <description>Antero-posterior radiographs of patients' bilateral feet were taken before treatment and at three-month follow-up controls (in a standing position). HV, intermetatarsal, and hallux interphalangeal angles were measured on the radiographic images. These angles were abbreviated to angles A, B and C respectively.</description>

    <description>MOFQ Foot health-related quality of life was evaluated using the MOFQ. This consists of three categories - pain, walking/standing, and social interaction. The MOFQ contains 16 items, each scored on a Likert scale between 0 and 4. Possible scores for each domain range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating the most severe conditions</description>

    <description>The HV night splint holds the hallux in abduction in order to provide a correct position. The SP group was given splints consisting of a rigid polyethylene bar along the medial of the hallux, and soft polyform and Velcro fastener parts.</description>

    <description>Two self-adhesive electrodes were used. One was placed over the medial distal end of the first metatarsal and the other was attached to the motor point of the AbdH (inferior and posterior to the navicular tuberosity).21 The stimulation intensity was increased until a contraction was observed without causing discomfort and pain. Twenty-minute HVPGS was applied in total over three weekly sessions for four weeks.</description>
