  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Study evaluates safety of intracameral injection of Fydrane (tropicamide 0.02%, phenylephrine
      0.31% and lidocaine 1%) on corneal endothelium, and efficiency in maintaining pupillary
      dilatation during phacoemulsification surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      in this prospective randomized controlled study, 30 eyes of 30 patients undergoing
      phacoemulsification with intraocular lens (IOL) implantation, were assigned into 2 groups. 15
      eyes (Fydrane group) received 0.2ml of Fydrane just after the first incision. While 15 eyes
      (Reference group) received a topical regimen of one drop of each of cyclopentolate
      hydrochloride 1% and tropicamide 1 %, every 15 min for 1 hour preoperatively. The main
      outcome measures were safety on corneal endothelium, by comparing the preoperative and 3
      weeks postoperative corneal endothelium cell count in the two groups. Efficacy was also
      evaluated by measuring pupil size using surgical caliper at certain timings during surgery:
      before capsulorhexis and before intraocular lens (IOL) implantation, in both groups.
