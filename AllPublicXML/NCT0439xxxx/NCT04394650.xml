  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, multicenter, open-label study of CC-98633, BCMA-Targeted NEX-T Chimeric
      Antigen Receptor (CAR) T Cells, in subjects with relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma.

      The study will consist of 2 parts: dose-escalation (Part A) and dose-expansion (Part B). The
      dose-escalation part (Part A) of the study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of
      increasing dose levels of CC-98633 to establish a recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D); and the
      dose-expansion part (Part B) of the study is to further evaluate the safety,
      pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics, and efficacy of CC-98633 at the RP2D.

    <description>Subjects will undergo leukapheresis to isolate peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) to produce CC 98633.
During CC 98633 production, subjects may receive bridging chemotherapy for disease control. Upon successful generation of CC 98633 product, subjects will receive treatment with CC 98633 therapy.
Study treatment will include lymphodepleting chemotherapy followed by one dose of CC-98633 administered by intravenous (IV) injection.</description>
