  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic hemodialysis is often associated with a reduction in the quality of life of patients
      and a reduction in physical activity, due to the repeated frequency of sessions.

      Various studies conducted in hemodialysis patients have shown the beneficial effects of
      physical exercise during hemodialysis sessions on reducing cardiovascular risk, the number of
      hospitalizations and improving quality of life. It also contributes to improved patient
      adherence to care.

      Finally, it has been shown that exercise during the hemodialysis session is safe for the
      patient and does not disrupt dialysis parameters.

      Nevertheless, there are no data on the medico-economic impact of such a program.

      Based on the investigators' experience, the investigators have developed a specific protocol
      linking the different types of physical activity that have provided evidence of their
      efficiency and used in standard practice in the investigators' institutions. From tests and
      questionnaires assessing the physical abilities of patients have already validated for this
      population in this pathology.

      The objective of this project is to show the medico-economic interest of an adapted physical
      activity program for hemodialysis patients.
