  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a nationwide, multicenter and retrospective cohort study. The purpose of this study
      is to evaluate the synergistic effect and safety of Elemene plus TKIs in EGFR-mutated
      advanced non-small cell lung cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      About 9.2%-45.8% of Chinese patients with Non-small cell lung cancer were positive for EGFR
      gene mutation. Gefitinib, Erlotinib, Icotinib, Afatinib showed efficacy superior to that of
      chemotherapy in the treatment of EGFR mutation positive advanced NSCLC, and lower rates of
      serious adverse events. However, after a median of 8 to 13 months of disease control,
      patients ultimately progress due to acquired resistance of EGFR-TKIs. Elemene, a
      chemotherapeutic isolated from the Chinese medicinal herb Rhizoma Zedoariae, has been shown
      to have a comprehensive anti-tumor effect and the potential effect on reversing drug
      resistance.

      The study is a real-world study and the case records of patients with advanced non-small cell
      lung cancer who visited the research centers from January 2014 to December 2017 and met the
      inclusion criteria will be collected. Medical data including patient demographic, tumor
      characteristics, laboratory examination, history of treatments, adverse reactions, and so on
      will be extracted to evaluate the synergistic effect and safety of Elemene plus TKIs in
      EGFR-mutated advanced non-small cell lung cancer.

    <description>Any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment.
A serious adverse event (experience) or reaction is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: results in death, is life-threatening, requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or is a congenital anomaly/birth defect.</description>
