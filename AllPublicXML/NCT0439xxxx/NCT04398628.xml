  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In parallel with the growth of American Thrombosis and Hemostasis Network's (ATHN) clinical
      studies, the number of new therapies for all congenital and acquired hematologic conditions,
      not just those for bleeding and clotting disorders, is increasing significantly. Some of the
      recently FDA-approved therapies for congenital and acquired hematologic conditions have yet
      to demonstrate long-term safety and effectiveness. In addition, results from well-controlled,
      pivotal studies often cannot be replicated once a therapy has been approved for general
      use.(1,2,3,4) In 2019 alone, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued
      approvals for twenty-four new therapies for congenital and acquired hematologic
      conditions.(5) In addition, almost 10,000 new studies for hematologic diseases are currently
      registered on www.clinicaltrials.gov.(6) With this explosion of potential new therapies on
      the horizon, it is imperative that clinicians and clinical researchers in the field of
      non-neoplastic hematology have a uniform, secure, unbiased, and enduring method to collect
      long-term safety and efficacy data. As emphasized in a recently published review, accurate,
      uniform and quality national data collection is critical in clinical research, particularly
      for longitudinal cohort studies covering a lifetime of biologic risk.(7)

      The overarching objective of this longitudinal, observational study is to characterize the
      safety, effectiveness and practice of treatments for all people with congenital and acquired
      hematologic disorders in the US.

      This is a longitudinal, natural history observational cohort study being conducted at
      approximately 150 ATHN-affiliated sites. Participants will be followed for a minimum of 15
      years. Harmonized data elements will be collected at time of enrollment, quarterly, ad hoc,
      and annually. Base data to be collected for all participants. Specific data will be collected
      for participants enrolled in cohort-specific Arms and Modules.

      Each participant will be assigned in a single cohort: Hemophilia, Von Willebrand Disease,
      Congenital Platelet Disorder, Rare Bleeding Disorders, Bleeding not otherwise specified
      (NOS), Thrombosis/Thrombophilia, or Non-Neoplastic Hematologic Conditions. The cohort for
      which a participant qualifies will be determined by the site Investigator.

      Study Arms and study Modules may be developed to provision disease and/or disease specific
      insights related to stakeholders, including but not limited to pharmaceutical companies,
      ATHN, and Hemophilia Treatment Centers (HTCs). Arms may branch off into product-specific data
      collection via Modules to be collected during the study, in conjunction with planned study
      assessments.

    <description>This cohort includes three Arms:
PUPs Arm:
This Arm is for previously untreated patients (PUPs) with congenital hemophilia A or B. This is a longitudinal, observational, prospective and retrospective Arm of PUPs with moderate or severe congenital hemophilia. Participants will be followed to assess inhibitor development within 50 exposure days (ED).
Hemophilia Natural History Arm:
This Arm is investigating a natural history of the safety, effectiveness, and practice of treatment for people with hemophilia. It is a longitudinal, observational, prospective Arm for participants with acquired or congenital hemophilia A or B.
Hemophilia Gene Therapy Outcomes Arm:
This Arm is investigating the safety and effectiveness of gene therapy in people with hemophilia. It is a longitudinal, observational cohort Arm following participants prospectively and retrospective for 15 years after vector infusion.</description>

      All participants will have specimens drawn (about 5mL each) at baseline to be stored in the
      ATHN Research Biorepository (ARB).

      Inhibitor testing is required for this study as follows:

        -  Baseline Visit (not required if no product has ever been given)

        -  At each Annual Visit (optional if no product given in interval from last test)

        -  At time of product switch

        -  At time of suspected inhibitor development

        -  At time of confirmatory test for previously elevated result

        -  At Study Exit

        -  Additional as per any modules

      Genetic testing will be optional and provided by central labs, as funding allows, across all
      cohorts. Genetic testing will be performed once, for applicable participants.
