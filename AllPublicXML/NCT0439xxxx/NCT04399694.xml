  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to identify and characterize novel non-coding and splicing variants
      that may contribute to genetic disorders. We will particularly focus on patients with a
      diagnosed genetic disorder that has inconclusive genetic findings.

  <detailed_description>

      To perform this study, we will use patient DNA and RNA that is isolated from blood samples.
      DNA will be sequenced (targeted capture and/or whole genome DNA sequencing (WGS)) to identify
      any non-coding single nucleotide variants (SNVs), smaller insertions/deletions (indels), or
      larger structural variants (SVs). RNA will be sequenced (RNA-seq) to identify genes that are
      expressed in a differential and/or allele-specific manner, which may indicate a functional
      non-coding or splicing variant. We will test the function of non-coding variants using
      high-throughput reporter assays and CRISPR based methodologies.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patients (probands) diagnosed with an autosomal recessive genetic disorder, but genetic
        results:

          1. detects zero pathogenic coding variants in known disease gene, OR

          2. detects only one pathogenic coding variant on one allele in known disease gene, OR

          3. detects identical coding and/or splicing variants between patients, but those patients
             display highly diverse phenotypes
