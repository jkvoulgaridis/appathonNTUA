  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For several years, the prevalence of people living with diabetes (pDT) has been steadily
      increasing. It was estimated by the health insurance in 2016 at 5 %, or more than 3.3 million
      people in France. By different physiological mechanisms, diabetes is associated with
      immunodeficiency. As a result, several vaccines are recommended in pDT.

      The vaccination policy is drawn up in France by the French Minister of Health, who makes
      public the vaccination schedule after the opinion of the High Authority of Health.

      Currently according to the 2019 immunization schedule, the dTP vaccine is the only mandatory
      in the general population with recalls in adults aged 25, 45, 65 and every 10 years. This
      vaccine is especially indicated for this segment of the population because diabetes is a risk
      factor for tetanus. In 2011, the Ministry of Health estimated that only 50.5% of the general
      population was up to date against dTP.

      Two vaccines are recommended for pDT according to the current vaccine schedule: the flu
      vaccine and the pneumococcal vaccine. In fact, influenza and pneumococcal disease are more
      frequent and more serious for these patients compared to the general population. Influenza
      vaccine has to be done annually in the early winter period. The vaccine coverage for winter
      2018/2019 was estimated at 46.8 % of the target population. The vaccination scheme for
      pneumococcal vaccine is more complex: it involves a primary vaccination with a vaccine with
      13 valences followed by another with 23 valences at least eight weeks later. Thereafter, a
      recall is to be carried out every five years with the 23 valences vaccine. Vaccination
      coverage was estimated in France in 2011 at 8.1 % in the population at risk.

      According to several studies, the shingles virus has a greater impact and is more aggressive
      in pDT than in the general population. Similarly, the virus would tend to unbalance diabetes.
      There is currently a vaccine against shingles that is recommended and reimbursed in the
      population aged 65 to 74 years.

      In our practice, a pharmaceutical team has been carrying out medication reconciliation for
      several years at the hospital admission and discharge of the patient in the
      endocrinology-nutrition department of the university hospital of Montpellier.

      During this medication reconciliation, a pharmaceutical interview on the management of drug
      treatments is carried out . Since May 2019, we added to this interview an assessment of the
      vaccination coverage and feelings of people regarding vaccination. Following this assessment,
      a report is made during an interview with the doctor responsible for the patient. During this
      interview, the update of mandatory and recommended vaccinations are discussed between the
      doctor and the pharmacist.

      In this context, it seems interesting to us to make an assessment of our practices and the
      investigator make the following assumptions:

        -  There is a defect in the mandatory and recommended process of vaccination for pDT

        -  A synthesis of pDT vaccine status between the physician and the pharmacist at the time
           of hospitalization would allow optimization of vaccine management in accordance with
           current recommendations and practices.

      The main objective of the study is to assess vaccine coverage for mandatory and recommended
      pDT vaccines at hospital admission.

      The secondary objectives are:

        -  Description of pDT experience with vaccination;

        -  Description of the management of vaccination within the Department of
           Endocrinology-Nutrition-Diabetes during and after the patient's hospitalization in terms
           of (intra-hospital vaccination, hospital prescriptions of a vaccine after
           hospitalization and number of vaccination recommendations in the hospitalization
           report).

        -  Description of transmission of vaccination status of patients to their treating
           physician
