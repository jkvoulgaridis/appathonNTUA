  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Orthostatic hypotension is a highly prevalent deficit in the aging population especially when
      coupled with stroke, frailty, diabetes, Parkinson's disease or spinal cord injuries. This
      population has difficulty with the autonomic regulation of blood pressure and experiences
      elevated risks of falls. The fall risk is greatest when the person transitions from supine or
      sitting to standing as this is when blood has a tendency to pool in the legs preventing
      adequate blood circulation to vital organs. This is a safety concern and limiting factor for
      rehabilitation of patients with orthostatic hypotension in the inpatient rehabilitation
      setting. There is low-quality evidence that compression garments such as abdominal binders
      and compression stockings can be helpful to manage orthostatic hypotension and the associated
      fall risk. However, many people with orthostatic hypotension perceive the treatment approach
      with compression stockings to be largely unacceptable.

      Aquatic immersion may provide better advantages to compression garments because hydrostatic
      pressure exerts a little over 22 mmHg pressure for every foot of water. Therefore, an
      individual standing in 4 ft depth water will have roughly 90 mmHg pressure on their feet and
      about 56 mmHg at their knees. These amounts of pressure are more than those induced by
      typical compression stockings, which provide 30-40 mm Hg pressure. In addition, immersion at
      level of xiphoid process or higher is known to translocate blood from the lower to the center
      of the body and act to increase cerebral blood flow which may be beneficial for preventing
      orthostatic hypotension symptoms.

      No studies have looked at the physiologic response to immersion and aquatic exercise for
      people with orthostatic hypotension. Since this population is known to have difficulty with
      autonomic regulation of blood pressure, it is unclear if they will experience a similar
      hemodynamic response during immersion than the healthy population during or after aquatic
      therapy due to orthostatic hypotension.

      Anecdotal evidence suggests that patients with orthostatic hypotension do not exhibit adverse
      effects due to orthostatic hypotension when standing in water or participating in aquatic
      exercise independent of compression garments use. They often have improved standing tolerance
      in the pool compared with prolonged standing on land. Steps to manage orthostatic hypotension
      when out of the pool, such as hydration during pool session, placing compressive garments
      prior to exit of pool and slow transitions out of pool setting has been adequate to prevent
      symptoms of orthostatic hypotension in the post exercise period in this population.

      The primary aim of this study is to look at heart rate and blood pressure response when going
      from sit to stand during physical therapy sessions on land compared to in the pool for people
      who have orthostatic hypotension (defined as a drop in systolic blood pressure of at least 15
      mmHg or 7 mmHg drop in diastolic blood pressure from sitting to standing). The secondary aim
      of this study is to evaluate tolerance for physical activity during physical therapy sessions
      in the pool compared to on land for people with orthostatic hypotension. The third aim of the
      study is to investigate heart rate and blood pressure response for 3 hours following the
      physical therapy sessions.

      We hypothesize that orthostatic hypotension will be reduced and standing exercise tolerance
      will be increased when in the pool compared to on land. In addition, we hypothesized that
      there will not be a significant difference in heart rate or blood pressure response in the
      3-hour post exercise period of aquatic vs. land exercise.
