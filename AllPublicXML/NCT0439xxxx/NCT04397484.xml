  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sciatic nerve block at the popliteal fossa is indicated for foot or ankle surgery, and the
      introduction of ultrasound guidance (USG) has improved the ease and accuracy of the
      performance of this block. Recent studies proved that subparaneural injection is associated
      with faster block onset, higher block success rate, and prolonged block duration suggesting
      subparaneural compartment of the sciatic nerve is a desirable site for local anaesthetic
      injection. Data from an ongoing trial in the investigator's institution comparing the block
      dynamics of subparaneural injection of 30ml 0.5% levobupivacaine (Chirocaine) above and below
      the bifurcation of the sciatic nerve at popliteal fossa has also shown that the time to
      'readiness for surgery' was faster when the injection was performed below the bifurcation of
      the sciatic nerve. Lidocaine (Xylocaine) has a better pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics
      profile than levobupivacaine and is also widely used as local anaesthetic agent in clinical
      practice. Since there is no data comparing the block dynamics of lidocaine and
      levobupivacaine, this study aims to study and compare the block dynamics of lidocaine and
      levobupivacaine when given as a subparaneural injection below the bifurcation of the sciatic
      nerve at the popliteal fossa. In this study, the investigator hypothesizes that the use of
      lidocaine as the sole agent for this block will fasten the time to 'readiness for surgery' as
      compared to levobupivacaine when given as a subparaneural injection below the bifurcation of
      the sciatic nerve at the popliteal fossa.

      This study will involve performing ultrasound guided subparaneural popliteal sciatic nerve
      block for 40 patients by using either Lidocaine or Levobupivacaine. Both are commonly used
      local anaesthetics for regional anaesthesia in daily clinical practice. Patients will be
      enrolled from the elective orthopaedic surgical list at Prince of Wales Hospital after
      informed consent.

    <intervention_model_description>The randomization sequence will be generated using online randomization software. The randomization sequence will be assigned as Group 1 =0.5% Chirocaine (levobupivacaine) and Group 2 =1.5% Xylocaine with adrenaline 1:200,000, and the group allocation will be sealed within an opague envelop by a research assistant, who is not involved in this study. After recruitment, patients will be randomly allocated to receive ultrasound guided subparaneural popliteal sciatic nerve block below bifurcation using either 0.5% Chirocaine (levobupivacaine) (Group 1) or 1.5% Xylocaine with adrenaline 1: 200,000 (Group 2).</intervention_model_description>

The needle is then redirected to place its tip into the paraneural sheath of the common peroneal and tibial nerve through the same skin puncture and 15ml of study drug will be injected at each site (total 30ml).</description>
