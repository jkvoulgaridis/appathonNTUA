    <textblock>
      The objective of this protocol is to obtain a better match between the actual staging and the
      proposed treatment in order to avoid inadequate treatments at risk of complications. In
      patients with HCC classified as BCLC A to C, the combination of 18F-FDG and 18F-Fluorocholine
      PET- TomoDensitoMetry (TDM) with conventional imaging would clinically significantly modify
      the therapeutic strategy initially planned by conventional imaging alone. This change in
      therapeutic strategy would be from curative to palliative treatment or from loco-regional
      palliative to systemic palliative treatment. 18F-FDG and 18F-Fluorocholine PET-CT scans will
      be performed after inclusion of the patient in the study and prior to multidisciplinary
      consultation meeting for treatment discussion.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the leading causes of death from cancer worldwide,
      developing on cirrhosis in 90% of cases. The prognosis of patients with HCC remains poor with
      an overall survival of around 10% at 5 years for all tumor stages combined. The diagnosis of
      HCC relies on non-invasive conventional imaging criteria (computed tomography [CT] and/or
      magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) and/or histology. Conventional imaging (liver CT and/or MRI
      and lung CT) enables HCC staging according to the Barcelona Clinical Liver Cancer (BCLC)
      system, linking each stage to therapeutic modalities. Accurate staging with reliable imaging
      methods is therefore crucial to determine the best treatment strategy. The principal
      objective is to demonstrate that the identification of new tumor lesions by an experimental
      procedure combining 18F-FDG and 18F-Fluorocholine PET-CT scans in patients with HCC, modifies
      the initially planned therapeutic strategy of a curative treatment palliative treatment, from
      locoregional palliative treatment to systemic palliative treatment.
