  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this research study, is assessing the feasibility of using an MR-guided implantable
      microdevice to measure tumor response to chemotherapy and other clinically relevant drugs in
      participants that have prostate cancer and are scheduled for a radical prostatectomy.

      The name of the study intervention involved in this study is:

      - Implantation of a MR-guided microdevice

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is assessing the feasibility and safety of implanting and retrieving a
      'microdevice' that releases up to 20 drugs directly within the prostate cancer lesion as a
      possible tool to evaluate the effectiveness of several approved cancer drugs against prostate
      cancer.

      Participants will be identified with confirmed prostate cancer whose treatment plan includes
      surgery as a component of standard-of-care treatment.

      The name of the study intervention involved in this study is:

        -  Implantation of a MR-guided microdevice .

        -  It is expected that about 35 people will take part in this research study; 5 in the Ex
           Vivo Cohort and 30 in Surgery Cohort.

             -  Ex Vivo Cohort will undergo placement of microdevice in the prostate after its
                surgical removal.

             -  Surgery Cohort will undergo percutaneous placement of several microdevices in a
                selected tumor prior to surgery.

      This research study is a Pilot Study, which is the first-time investigators are examining
      this study intervention. The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved the
      implantation of the microdevice for this specific disease, but usage of this has been
      approved for other uses.

    <description>Feasibility of microdevice placement based on the ability in the Surgical Cohort to percutaneously place and surgically retrieve the device with sufficient tissue, of sufficient quality, for downstream histopathology analysis and interpretation.
In the Surgical Cohort, if not more than 1 IMD per patient fails to be percutaneously placed and surgically retrieved with sufficient tissue of sufficient quality for downstream histopathology analysis and interpretation, we would consider this procedure to be a success. If at least 23/30 Surgical Cohort patients have successful procedures, as previously defined, we would consider this approach feasible. The 90% CI for 23 out of 30 successes is (60.6%, 88.5%) and thus excluding a 60% success rate which is considered as too low.</description>

    <description>Participant eligibility for intervention and selection of lesion for device placement
- Surgery Cohort will undergo percutaneous placement of several microdevices in a selected tumor(s) prior to surgery. The microdevice in the surgery cohort will dwell in the tumor tissue for approximately 48 hours to allow time for tissue effects of the drugs in the microdevice reservoirs.
Placement of at least 1, and up to 6, microdevices depending on the number of lesions, size and accessibility
Extirpative surgery will proceed according to standard-of-care procedures. The microdevice(s) will be removed surgically along with surrounding tumor tissue.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Eligibility Criteria Ex Vivo Cohort

               -  Participants must have the ability to understand and the willingness to sign a
                  written informed consent document.

               -  Planned Radical Prostatectomy for Prostate Cancer.

               -  Participants must be 22 years of age or older.

          -  Eligibility Criteria for Surgical Cohort

               -  Participants must have the ability to understand and the willingness to sign a
                  written informed consent document.

               -  Participants must present with prostate cancer falling into an intermediate or
                  high risk category to include features: Gleason score 3+4 or higher, greater than
                  3 biopsy cores positive and &gt;50% of 1 core positive for carcinoma, and an
                  MRI-visible lesion concerning for PCa in the region of the positive biopsy.

               -  Participants must be 22 years of age or older.

               -  Participants must be evaluated by a urologic oncologist who will determine the
                  clinically appropriate treatment strategy based on clinical history and extent of
                  disease.

               -  Participants must be deemed medically stable to undergo both percutaneous
                  procedures and standard-of-care surgical procedures by their treating surgeon.

               -  Participants will undergo laboratory testing within 30 days prior to the
                  procedure (or within 72 hours if there has been a change in the clinical status
                  since the initial blood draw). Participants must have absolute neutrophil count
                  ≥1,500/mcL, platelets ≥50,000/mcL, PT (INR) 0.8-1.2 and PTT within the normal
                  range of the institution.

               -  Participants must have undergone multi-parametric prostate MRI that both assesses
                  the extent of disease and allows the research team to assess for study
                  eligibility. This will have been done as part of the standard-of-care. Abnormal
                  imaging will be correlated with the biopsy findings to maximize the likelihood of
                  the device being put in the lesion. If the images are not adequate, the MRI scan
                  will be repeated at BWH/DFCI, again as part of standard-of-care management.

               -  The participant's case must be reviewed by representatives of urologic oncology
                  and interventional radiology to assess the following factors:

                    -  Participant is clinically stable to undergo biopsy procedure(s) and surgical
                       procedures

                    -  Participant has sufficient volume of disease as shown by MRI to allow
                       implantation of the microdevice

                    -  A lesion can be selected where the microdevice is to be implanted that is a)
                       amenable to percutaneous placement, and b) amenable to removal at the time
                       of primary surgery -- Participants must be willing to undergo
