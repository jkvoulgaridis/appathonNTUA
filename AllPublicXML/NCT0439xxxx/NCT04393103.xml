      Aim of the study:

      To assess the role of intralipid emulsion in the acute man-agement of organophosphorus
      toxicity and its benefits in de-creasing mortality rates among victims.

    <textblock>
      Organophosphates (OPs) are cholinesterase inhibitors that are widely used as pesticides and
      organophosphate (OP) poisoning is an important public health concern in Egypt especially in
      the rural farming population. Organophosphate toxicity lead to a characteristic toxidrome
      that includes muscarinic, nicotinic and central nervous system signs and symptoms and,
      without proper and early antidotal treatment, death. A new antidote is the need of the hour.
      Lipid emulsion being inexpensive, easily available and effective in management of other lipid
      soluble toxins may be a novel option. The exact mechanisms by which ILE exert their
      beneficial effects are not fully understood, and several have suggested synergistic effects
      of several mechanisms. The mechanisms of action can be divided into intravascular, membrane,
      and intracellular effects. The original theory explaining the mechanism of lipid rescue was
      that of &quot;lipid sink&quot;, suggesting sequestration of lipophilic compounds to an expanded
      intravascular lipid phase, extracting the offending agent from the target tissue, and
      reversing the toxicity. Other hypotheses relate to the mechanism by which ILEs facilitate
      cardiac rescue from drug poisoning. These include:

        1. increasing myocardial energy substrate delivery and a direct cardiotonic effect of ILE
           on the poisoned heart.

        2. an effect of ILE on calcium ion channels through high levels of long-chain fatty acids,
           leading to increased cardiomyocyte calcium and positive inotropic effect.
