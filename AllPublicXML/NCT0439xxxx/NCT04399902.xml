  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the feasibility of using thermal blankets to actively warm massively
      bleeding trauma patients at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre. It is hypothesized that either
      full thermal blankets or half thermal blankets will be a feasible intervention to implement
      for the care of massively bleeding trauma patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hypothermia (core body temperature of &lt;36˚C), is a strong risk factor for mortality and poor
      outcomes in trauma patients due to its negative hemostatic, cardiovascular, respiratory, and
      renal effects. Current evidence has reported that massively bleeding hypothermic trauma
      patients have higher odds of mortality in the first 24 hours of hospital admission, increased
      length of stay, and increased need for transfusion. Standard hospital blankets are used to
      passively warm patients through resuscitation and treatment until arrival to the ICU.
      Interventions such as active heating through thermal blankets should be considered to prevent
      and treat hypothermia upon arrival of patients than standard warmed hospital blankets to
      prevent deleterious outcomes in this population.

    <description>Upon activation of a massive hemorrhage protocol, a standard warmed hospital blanket will be placed on top of the patient and the study blanket(s) on top of the standard warmed blanket. The blanket will remain on the patient through their path of care, and removed from the patient at arrival to the ICU/final phase of care, or if the patient temperature exceeds 38˚C at any point.</description>
