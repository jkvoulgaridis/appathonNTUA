    <textblock>
      This is a single center , single arm, phase II study. All eligible patients with the de novo
      metastatic NPC are treated with chemotherapy plus subsequent loco-regional radiotherapy
      combined with toripalimab. The primary objective of this study is to assess objective
      response rate of chemotherapy plus subsequent loco-regional radiotherapy combined with
      toripalimab in de novo metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma . The secondary objective is to
      assess progression free survival, and Adverse events.

    <description>Chemotherapy:
The PF regimen included 5 g/m2 5-fluorouracil via a continuous intravenous infusion over 120 h and an intravenous administration of 100 mg/m2 cisplatin on day 1 for a maximum of six cycles.
Radiotherapy, intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), PTVnx:66-70Gy/30-33F; PTVnd:66～70Gy/30～33F; PTV1:60～64Gy/30～33F; PTV2:50～54Gy/30～33F, 5 fractions per week, for 6 weeks
Toripalimab 240mg every three weeks (Q3W) began on the first day of radiotherapy until an intolerable toxicity, or disease progression, or withdrawal of consent, or the investigator determines that he or she has to withdraw from treatment, or has been treated for up to 2 years.</description>
