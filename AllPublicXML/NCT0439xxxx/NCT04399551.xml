  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      CAB LA + RPV LA is an investigational HIV-1 treatment regimen administered as two individual
      intramuscular injections every 2 months following an oral lead-in (OLI) period. The overall
      objective of the CAB LA + RPV LA clinical development program is to develop a highly
      effective, well-tolerated, two-drug, LA injectable regimen which has the potential to offer
      improved treatment convenience, compliance and improved quality of life for people living
      with HIV compared to current standard of care. This study will examine different
      implementation strategies in different clinic settings across European countries to identify
      strategies which best meet the needs in each local context and involve both participants
      receiving study treatment CAB LA + RPV LA (patient study participants [PSP]) as well as the
      healthcare providers at the investigator site level (staff study participants [SSP]). SSPs
      consists of 2 groups: standard and enhanced arm. Standard arm represents the traditional
      provider support by a medical science lead and product materials. Enhanced arm models a
      higher level of provider support with added face to face meeting, trainings, and additional
      touchpoints for administration of CAB LA + RPV LA. The study will evaluate both qualitative
      and quantitative measures across arm, clinic type, provider type and country to determine the
      most effective implementation strategies and to identify barriers and facilitators (including
      solutions). Approximately 450 participants will be enrolled in this study and the total
      duration of the study will be around 12 months.

               -  Participants negative for anti-HBs but positive for anti-HBc (negative HBsAg
                  status) and positive for HBV DNA are excluded.

          -  Participants who are anticipated to require Hepatitis C virus (HCV) treatment within
             12 months must be excluded. Asymptomatic individuals with chronic HCV infection will
             not be excluded; investigators must carefully assess if therapy specific for HCV
             infection is required. (HCV treatment on study may be permitted, following
             consultation and approval of the DAA based therapy being considered with the medical
             monitor).

          -  Participants with HCV co-infection will be allowed entry into this study if:

               1. Liver enzymes meet entry criteria.

               2. HCV disease has undergone appropriate work-up, and is not advanced. Additional
                  information (where available) on participants with HCV coinfection at screening
                  should include results from any liver biopsy, Fibroscan, ultrasound, or other
                  fibrosis evaluation, history of cirrhosis or other decompensated liver disease,
                  prior treatment, and timing/plan for HCV treatment.

               3. In the event that recent biopsy or imaging data is not available or inconclusive,
                  the Fib-4 score will be used to verify eligibility:

                    -  Fib-4 score more than (&gt;)3.25 is exclusionary.

                    -  Fib-4 score 1.45-3.25 requires Medical Monitor consultation Fibrosis 4 score
                       formula:

        (Age x AST) / (Platelets x (square [Alanine aminotransferase]{ALT}).

          -  Unstable liver disease (as defined by any of the following: presence of ascites,
             encephalopathy, coagulopathy, hypoalbuminemia, esophageal or gastric varices, or
             persistent jaundice or cirrhosis), known biliary abnormalities (with the exception of
             Gilbert's syndrome or asymptomatic gallstones or otherwise stable chronic liver
             disease per investigator assessment).

          -  History of liver cirrhosis with or without hepatitis viral co-infection.

          -  Ongoing or clinically relevant pancreatitis.

          -  Clinically significant cardiovascular disease, as defined by history/evidence of
             congestive heart failure, symptomatic arrhythmia, angina/ischemia, coronary artery
             bypass grafting (CABG) surgery or percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty
             (PTCA) or any clinically significant cardiac disease.

          -  Ongoing malignancy other than cutaneous Kaposi's sarcoma, basal cell carcinoma, or
             resected, non-invasive cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, or cervical intraepithelial
             neoplasia; other localized malignancies require agreement between the investigator and
             the Study medical monitor for inclusion of the participant prior to inclusion.

          -  Any condition which, in the opinion of the Investigator, may interfere with the
             absorption, distribution, metabolism or excretion of the study drugs or render the
             participant unable to receive study medication.

          -  History or presence of allergy or intolerance to the study drugs or their components
             or drugs of their class. Current or anticipated need for chronic anti-coagulation with
             the exception of the use of low dose acetylsalicylic acid (&lt;=325 mg per day) or
             hereditary coagulation and platelet disorders such as hemophilia or Von Willebrand
             Disease

          -  Any evidence of primary resistance based on the presence of any major known Integrase
             inhibitor (INI) or Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)
             resistance-associated mutation, except for K103N, by any historical resistance test
             result.

          -  ALT &gt;=3 x upper limit of normal (ULN).

          -  Any verified Grade 4 laboratory abnormality. A single repeat test is allowed during
             the Screening phase to verify a result.

          -  Participant has estimated creatinine clearance &lt;50 milliliters per minute
             (mL/min)/1.73 m^2 via the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI)
             equation.

          -  Exposure to an experimental drug or experimental vaccine within either 28 days, 5
             half-lives of the test agent, or twice the duration of the biological effect of the
             test agent, whichever is longer, prior to Day 1 of this study.

          -  Treatment with any of the following agents within 28 days of Day 1:

               -  Radiation therapy.

               -  Cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents.

               -  Tuberculosis therapy except for isoniazid (isonicotinylhydrazid [INH]).

               -  Anti-coagulation agents.

               -  Immunomodulators that alter immune responses such as chronic systemic
                  corticosteroids, interleukins, or interferons.

          -  Treatment with an HIV-1 immunotherapeutic vaccine within 90 days of screening.

          -  Use of medications which are associated with Torsade de Pointes must be discussed with
             the Medical Monitor to determine eligibility.

          -  Participants receiving any prohibited medication and who are unwilling or unable to
             switch to an alternate medication.
