  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, MRI of the lungs of healthy volunteers and participants with cystic fibrosis
      (stable and participants initiating CFTR modulator treatment) will be performed over a period
      of 6 months to determine if lung MRI is able detect structural and functional
      abnormalities/changes in early cystic fibrosis disease. During the 6 month period, 3 study
      visits will occur. 70 subjects aged 6 and older will participate in this study. Xenon MRI is
      a non-invasive imaging technique that does not involve x-rays or ionizing radiation. Rather,
      this imaging method utilizes the same hardware and software principles that are used for
      conventional proton MRI of patients in a hospital.
