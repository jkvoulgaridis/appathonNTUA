    <textblock>
      The SBS NEEDS Study is a qualitative transversal study aiming to describe and understand the
      needs and knowledge of patients with Chronic Intestinal Failure as well as the
      representations of their practitioners

      Chronic Intestinal Failure (CIF) is the long-lasting reduction of gut function, below the
      minimum necessary for the absorption of macronutrients and/or water and electrolytes, such
      that intravenous supplementation is required to maintain health and/or growth. CIF is the
      rarest organ failure. Home parenteral nutrition (HPN) is the primary treatment for CIF.

      Semi-structured interviews will be conducted with patients in two nutrition unit and
      specialized in the small bowel diseases in two French region. 20 situations will be included.

      After analysing the data of the individual interviews, focus groups will be conducted with
      health professionals from an accredited home parenteral nutrition department.
