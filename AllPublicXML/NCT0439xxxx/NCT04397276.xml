    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the recommended Phase 2 dose(s) (RP2D[s]) and
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of JNJ-70218902 in Part 1, and to determine the safety of
      JNJ-70218902 RP2D(s) in Part 2.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      JNJ-70218902, the investigational drug, has been shown in pre-clinical studies to work by
      attaching to cancer cells and activating immune cells to kill these cancer cells.This study
      will be conducted in 2 parts: dose escalation (Part 1) and dose expansion (Part 2) and will
      enroll adult men with Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer (MCRPC). Study
      evaluations will include safety, pharmacokinetics, biomarkers and immunogenicity evaluations.
      This study is divided into 3 periods: screening, treatment and post-treatment. The total
      duration of the study will be 2.5 years approximately.
