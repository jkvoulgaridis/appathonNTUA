  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Abnormal fetal size includes fetal growth restriction and fetal macrosomia. Onset is closely
      related to maternal nutrition metabolism. The specific correlation and mechanism is unclear,
      and there are no effective measures for early diagnosis and treatment. Previous study found
      that maternal gut microbiota participates in the material metabolism throughout the
      pregnancy. Insulin sensitivity in pregnant women, and intrauterine environment under abnormal
      blood glucose and lipid metabolism are important for the gut microbiota of newborns and even
      they grow up. However, changes in gut microbiota are the cause of the disease or the outcome
      is not yet clear. Short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are produced from soluble dietary fibers in
      the diet by colon bacteriolysis. Studies have found that gut microbiota can regulate insulin
      sensitivity and glucose and lipid metabolism disorders through SCFAs. Therefore, this
      research group uses the gut microbiota as a new idea to studythe relationship of gut
      microbiota characteristics and level's change of SCFAs with glucolipid metabolism and insulin
      sensitivity in pregnant women with abnormal fetal size and their newborns through 16S-rRNA
      high-throughput sequencing, pyrosequencing, and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, so we
      can reveal the role of gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of abnormal fetal size and explore
      targeted rational dietary adjustment and SCFAs reconstruction of gut microbiota to improve
      maternal and neonatal pregnancy outcomes.
