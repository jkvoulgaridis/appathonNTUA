  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Early childhood caries (tooth decay, ECC) affected 55% 5-year-old Hong Kong
      children, and 70% of these children had gross destruction of the upper anterior teeth with
      negative long-term impacts on health and quality of life. The existing standard of care for
      prevention of ECC, topical application of 5% sodium fluoride (NaF) varnish, is inadequate. In
      Hong Kong and other parts of the world, 38% silver diamine fluoride (SDF) solution, applied
      topically to cavities, is used to arrest ECC. Work published by our research group suggests
      it likely also has a preventive effect of ECC. Moreover, SDF has been shown to be preventive
      in tooth decay in permanent teeth. Nevertheless, no pivotal clinical trial has been performed
      to support a change in usual practice.

      Aim: This is a Phase II single-centre randomized, double-blind, active-controlled,
      parallel-group pragmatic trial with two arms to assess the effectiveness of 38% SDF to
      determine if it is superior to 5% NaF in preventing new caries lesions in primary anterior
      teeth. Methods: Approximately 700 three-year-old kindergarten children who are healthy will
      be recruited, stratified by school, and block randomized to receive either 38% SDF (treatment
      group) or 5% NaF (standard treatment group) therapy on primary upper anterior teeth. This
      sample size is sufficient for a superiority trial with power at 90%, allowing for a 15%
      dropout rate. The primary outcome is the number of sound tooth surfaces that become cavitated
      caries per child at 12-month follow-up. The secondary outcome is the number of carious tooth
      surfaces developed after baseline that become arrested at 12-month for each child. Dental
      examinations for the status of caries (active or arrested) will be conducted by the same
      calibrated examiner. The examiner, children and children's parents will be blind to treatment
      allocation. Parents will be surveyed to study the children's oral health-related behaviours
      and socioeconomic backgrounds, which will allow the adjustment for effect modification.
      Possible results and implications: If the results are as anticipated, it will help change the
      standard of care for caries prevention. If adopted in Hong Kong, SDF therapy will prevent
      20,800 (13% of the 160,000) kindergarten children from having caries developed in their
      anterior teeth, thus reduce significantly the burden of ECC of the children and related
      stress of their family. Moreover, the results will be widely available and increase adoption
      of SDF in other countries to reduce the global burden of ECC among children.
