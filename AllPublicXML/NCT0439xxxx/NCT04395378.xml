  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators wish to explore the use of the CGMS Dexcom G6速 in pilots with
      insulin-treated diabetes, who are flying commercial aircraft with Class 1 and flying
      instructors or private pilots with class 2 certificates.

      The aim of this study is to explore the severity and number of hypoglycaemic episodes
      recorded with rtCGMS compared to the results from other self-glucose monitoring following the
      current protocol of the UK Civil Air Aviation (UKCAA), and to explore the possibility of the
      use of rtCGMS during flight and free living.

      This will involve using CGM Dexcom G6速 for continuous glucose monitoring for 6 months in
      flight time and during free living. The participants will be blinded for the results for the
      first month but will be encouraged to use the data from the CGMS Dexcom G6 速 for the
      following 5 months during the trial.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      People with diabetes sometimes consider that they are subjected to unfair discrimination in
      the occupational or work environment. These include safety-critical activities such as
      operating machinery and driving. Some occupations preclude the use of medications that lower
      blood glucose, particularly insulin. Safety regulators, occupational health physicians and
      national organisations frequently have to balance the competing priorities of individual
      rights against public safety.

      Modern treatment, with advances in insulin therapy and glucose monitoring, combined with
      rigorous clinical assessment and review, has allowed stereotypical attitudes to be
      challenged, and advocated individual assessment with respect to safety criteria. Several
      national authorities (Australia, Canada, UK, and USA) have, over recent years, allowed
      private pilots to fly for recreation while receiving treatment with insulin Canada (in 2002)
      was the first country to allow commercial pilots, treated with insulin, to fly commercially
      and have granted licences to a small number of insulin-treated pilots on a case-by-case basis
      and subject to close supervision.

      In 2010 the UK Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) convened an expert committee to review current
      scientific knowledge and international policies concerning flying. The committee advised that
      a protocol for safe flying could be developed and produced the first iteration with
      subsequent refinement. In 2012 the UK CAA started issuing Class 1 medical certificates for
      commercial flying to pilots with insulin-treated diabetes, having published a rigorous
      protocol and started collecting data systematically. Ireland and Austria have subsequently
      joined the protocol. The protocol has been shown to be feasible, practical and to date no
      safety concerns have arisen. The results from the first 26 pilots have been presented at the
      annual EASD conference and published in The Lancet Diabetes &amp; Endocrinology .
