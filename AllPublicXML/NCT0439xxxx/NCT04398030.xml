  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study has been designed as a prospectively enrolled, randomized sequence, 2-way
      crossover study of device performance, tolerability and safety of an investigational insulin
      infusion set using a coil-reinforced soft polymer indwelling cannula versus a commercial
      insulin infusion set using a soft Teflon indwelling cannula, during two 7-day home use
      periods with 4 in-clinic euglycemic clamp sessions during each of the 7-day periods. After a
      wash-out period, subjects will cross over into the investigational or control group,
      respectively.

          6. Participant has documented history in last 6 months of severe hypoglycemia associated
             with cognitive dysfunction sufficiently severe to require third party intervention or
             a history of impaired awareness of hypoglycemia.

          7. Participant has a history of diabetic ketoacidosis in the last 6 months

               6. SGLT2 inhibitors

         13. Participant has significant history of any of the following, that in the opinion of
             the investigator would compromise the participant's safety or successful study
             participation:

               1. Alcoholism,

               2. drug abuse

         14. Significant acute or chronic illness, that in the investigator's opinion, might
             interfere with participant safety or integrity of study results

             during wear periods

         16. Current treatment with systemic (oral or IV) corticosteroids, monoamine oxidase (MAO)
             inhibitors, non-selective beta-blockers, growth hormone, herbal products that, in the
             opinion of the investigator, may alter insulin sensitivity or confer undue risk to the
             participant's participation in the study or non-routine vitamins. Furthermore, thyroid
             hormones are not allowed unless the use of these has been stable during the past 3
             months.

         17. Current participation in another clinical drug or device study

         18. Inability of the participant to comply with all study procedures or to understand the
             participant instructions
