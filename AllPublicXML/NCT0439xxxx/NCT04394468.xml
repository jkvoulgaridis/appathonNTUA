  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endometriosis is a condition where functional endometrial tissue is present outside the
      uterus. It usually locates in the pelvis, which often includes the ovaries. One of the main
      concerns when performing surgery is to maintain fertility.

      Nevertheless, a disadvantage of using monopolar and bipolar instruments for laparoscopic
      excision or coagulation of endometriosis lesions is the energy / thermal distribution that
      can cause damage to the surrounding healthy tissue. Therefore, the use of ultrasound, laser
      or plasma energy can potentially reduce damage to surrounding tissues and prevent adhesion
      formation. In addition, ablation of the internal surface of endometriomas can be an effective
      alternative to cystectomy.

      The PlasmaJet system uses argon plasma which is released as kinetic, light and / or thermal
      energy. In this way the instrument can be applied within three functions, namely cutting,
      vaporizing and coagulating. Moreover, plasma will dissipate very quickly upon contact with
      tissue which consequently allows a controlled depth of tissue penetration. Thirdly, pure
      plasma energy differs from conventional electrosurgery since no electrical current will be
      spread through the tissue and therefore the thermal effect at surrounding tissues remains
      minimal.

      The aim of this pilot study is to investigate the feasibility, effectiveness and safety of
      plasma energy in the treatment of endometriosis.
