  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well lenvatinib and pembrolizumab before surgery work in
      treating patients with kidney cancer that has spread from its original site of growth to
      nearby tissues or lymph nodes but has not spread to other places in the body
      (non-metastatic). Lenvatinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the
      enzymes needed for cell growth. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as
      pembrolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with
      the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving lenvatinib and pembrolizumab before
      surgery may kill more tumor cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To assess the objective response rate (complete and partial responses), following the
      administration of lenvatinib and pembrolizumab for a total of 4 cycles (12 weeks) in patients
      with locally-advanced, biopsy-proven non-metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC)
      prior to undergoing nephrectomy (partial or radical).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the safety and tolerability of neoadjuvant lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab in a
      presurgical population.

      II. To determine the clinical outcomes including disease-free survival (DFS) and overall
      survival (OS) of patients with non-metastatic ccRCC treated with neoadjuvant lenvatinib and
      pembrolizumab.

      III. To evaluate surgery-related complications and outcomes as per the Clavien-Dindo
      classification system.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate changes in biomarkers of immune activation and gene expression before, during
      and after treatment.

      II. To assess the quality of life, frailty and sarcopenia of patients before and after
      treatment.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive lenvatinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21 and pembrolizumab
      intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatments repeat every 21 days for up to 4
      cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up within 14 days, then every 12
      weeks thereafter.
