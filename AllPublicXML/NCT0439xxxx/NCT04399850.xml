  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pain during ICU stay remains one of the major complaints for patients. Beside pain intensity,
      well described by patients' self reports, pain distress, which is an emotional experience,
      cannot be treated with usual analgesia. The aim of the study is to analyze the impact of
      hypnosis on pain intensity and distress on short and long term outcomes in non-sedated ICU
      patients.

    <description>The HAD scale is a self-assessment scale for detecting states of depression and anxiety in the setting of an hospital medical outpatient clinic.
HADS is a self-administered scale of 14 items which assessed levels of depression and anxiety, divided into 2 subscales of 7 items (Anxiety or HADS-A, Depression or HADS-D). Each item is scored on a scale of 0 to 3. A score is generated for each of the two sub-scales (sum of the 7 items, ranging from 0 to 21). A higher score indicates worse outcome.</description>
