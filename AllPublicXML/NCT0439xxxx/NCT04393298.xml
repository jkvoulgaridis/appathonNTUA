    <description>An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical study participant, temporally associated with the use of investigational medicinal product (IMP), whether or not considered related to the IMP. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of IMP.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Participants are eligible to be included in the escalation module of the study only if all
        of the following criteria apply:

          -  Participant must be at least 18 years of age inclusive, at the time of signing the
             informed consent

          -  Participant has a histologically and/or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of one of
             the selected advanced solid tumor types

          -  Participant has advanced disease (ie, locally recurrent or metastatic) and had access
             to approved therapies

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Participants are excluded from the escalation module of the study if any of the following
        criteria apply:

          -  Participant has any medical or psychiatric condition that, in the opinion of the
             investigator, could jeopardize or would compromise the study participant's ability to
             participate in this study

          -  Participant has a history of severe allergic, anaphylactic, or other hypersensitivity
             reactions

          -  Participant has a known hypersensitivity to any components of the study medication or
             comparable drugs

          -  Active and clinically significant bacterial, fungal, or viral infection, known
             infections with hepatitis B, hepatitis C, known human immunodeficiency virus, or
             acquired immunodeficiency syndrome related illness

          -  Chronic underlying infection or disease that, in the view of the investigator, should
             preclude the participant from enrolling in the study

    <ipd_description>Data from this trial may be requested by qualified researchers six months after product approval in the US and/or Europe, or global development is discontinued, and 18 months after trial completion. Investigators may request access to anonymized individual patient-level data and redacted trial documents which may include: analysis-ready datasets, study protocol, annotated case report form, statistical analysis plan, dataset specifications, and clinical study report. Prior to use of the data, proposals need to be approved by an independent review panel at www.Vivli.org and a signed data sharing agreement will need to be executed. All documents are available in English only, for a prespecified time, typically 12 months, on a password protected portal. This plan may change if the risk of re-identifying trial participants is determined to be too high after the trial is completed; in this case and to protect participants, individual patient-level data would not be made available.</ipd_description>
