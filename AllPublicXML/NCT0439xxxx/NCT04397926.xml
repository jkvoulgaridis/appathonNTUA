  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neoantigen vaccine is a new field of research in tumor immunotherapy, and some studies have
      been conducted with success on Melanoma and glioblastoma. Nearly 80% of lung cancers are
      diagnosed in an advanced stage (IIIB, and IV) and EGFR mutant non-small cell lung cancer will
      be resistant after targeted drug treatment. Neoantigen vaccine is a new treatment method for
      lung cancer, especially for patients with drug resistance.

      This is a phase I clinical study of individualized neoantigen peptides in the treatment of
      EGFR mutant non-small cell lung cancer aimed to evaluated the safety and immune response of
      the neoantigen vaccine treatment.

             chemotherapy or clinical research drug treatment.

          4. The first neoantigen treatment is more than 4 weeks away from the previous
             radiotherapy or EGFR-TKI treatment.

          5. At least one measurable disease according to RECIST v1.1.

          6. 18 years of age or older

          7. Life expectancy of at least 3 months.

          8. ECOG Performance Status 0 or 1.
