  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this implementation study is to compare the effect of tailored training and
      support (T&amp;S) for general practioners with T&amp;S and alcohol community actions and the impact
      it has on early identification of hazardous and harmful drinking and brief intervention.

    <textblock>
      A quasi-experimental three-arm implementation study will be undertaken in Flanders (Belgium)
      to assess the effects of tailored training and support to general practitioners (GPs) alone
      or in an area context of alcohol community actions and compared to 'support as usual' on GP's
      performance in terms of early identification of hazardous and harmful drinking and brief
      intervention.

      The study will last 18 months and will take place in three cities of comparable size. In each
      area at least 28 GPs will be recruited.

      The primary outcome will be the proportion of consulting adult patients screened for
      hazardous and harmful alcohol use at the end-point of an 18-month implementation period. The
      secondary outcomes will be the screening rate as assessed at 3, 6, 9, 12 and 15 months and
      the proportion of patients screening positive for hazardous and harmful alcohol use that
      receive a brief intervention at 3,6,9, 12, 15 and 18 months. Furthermore, the relation
      between GP's views and needs and practices' contexts, and EIBI performance will be explored.

      Data regarding screening and brief intervention activities will be collected from the
      electronic health records (EHR).

    <description>There will be no interventions, only support as usual. All GPs receive an information package by post or via e-mail containing:
Belgian guidelines on the management of hazardous and harmful alcohol use
A summary card about EIBI for hazardous and harmful alcohol consumption.
Internet links to documentation of the medical association and the Flemish centre of expertise on alcohol and drugs(31).
An EHR-update allows the use of an extra e-form permitting standardised introduction of screening results from the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (-Consumption) (AUDIT(-C)), alcohol-related diagnoses and actions including provision of oral brief advice/intervention, referral to a digital-based system for advice and/or referral to another health care provider.</description>

There shall be tailored training and support for the general practioners. At the start of the study, this group receives two face-to-face educational trainings of two hours each. Another two face-to-face booster sessions will follow at 6 and at 12 months.</description>
