      This would be a phase II prospective single arm mono-institutional study conducted in Queen
      Mary Hospital (Hong Kong) assessing the efficacy and safety of bintrafusp alfa in previously
      treated patients with recurrent and metastatic (R/M) non-keratinizing nasopharyngeal
      carcinoma (NPC).

      All the patients must be registered with the Investigator(s) prior to initiation of
      treatment. The registration desk will confirm all eligibility criteria and obtain essential
      information (including patient number). Patients shall receive Bintrafusp alfa treatment
      through intravenous therapy every two weeks up until disease progression, unacceptable
      toxicity or for a maximum of 2 years. Survival Follow-up till 2 years will also be performed.
