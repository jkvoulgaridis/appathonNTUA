  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial studies the side effects of partial brain radiation therapy, temozolomide,
      chloroquine, and tumor treating fields therapy for the treatment of newly diagnosed
      glioblastoma. Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays to kill tumor cells and shrink
      tumors. Chemotherapy drugs, such as temozolomide, work in different ways to stop the growth
      of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping
      them from spreading. Chloroquine is normally used to treat strains of malaria and prior
      preclinical and clinical data suggests that it may increase the efficacy of both radiation
      and tumor treating fields therapy. Tumor treating fields therapy uses electric fields tuned
      to specific frequencies to disrupt cell division, inhibiting tumor growth and potentially
      causing cancer cells to die. The purpose of this study is to determine the safety of partial
      brain radiation therapy, temozolomide, chloroquine, and tumor treating fields therapy in
      patients with gliobastoma

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To determine the safety of partial brain radiation therapy plus temozolomide and
      chloroquine followed by tumor treating fields (TTFs) plus temozolomide and chloroquine,
      specifically grade 3 or higher dermatitis within the first 3 months of the adjuvant therapy
      phase.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To measure treatment effect via advanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and
      alpha-[11C]methyl-L-tryptophan (AMT)-positron emission tomography (PET).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo 30 fractions of 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3D CRT) or
      intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and receive temozolomide orally (PO) and
      chloroquine PO daily from day 1 for the duration of radiation therapy up to day 49. Treatment
      continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ADJUVANT TREATMENT: Beginning 4 weeks after the last day of radiation therapy, patients
      receive temozolomide PO once daily (QD) on days 1-5 and chloroquine PO daily on days 1-28.
      Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 6 cycles in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients demonstrating continued benefit may continue to receive
      temozolomide and chloroquine for up to 12 cycles. Patients also undergo TTF therapy over 18
      hours or longer per day.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up monthly for 3 months.
