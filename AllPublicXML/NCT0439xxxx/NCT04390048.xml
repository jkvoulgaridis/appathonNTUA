  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to examine the efficacy of non-invasive brain
      stimulation in addition to balance exercise for chronic ankle instability (CAI), a condition
      that develops following an initial ankle sprain, usually because of loose or unstable ankle
      joints.

    <measure>Static postural balance as quantified by center of pressure parameters (COP)</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Static postural balance will be assessed by the displacement from COP on the anteroposterior and mediolateral axes using a force platform during quite single and double leg standing. The average of three trials for each standing position will be reported.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Cortical excitability as evaluated by Active Motor Threshold (AMT)</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The soleus active motor threshold will be measured by TMS using a computation program, Parameter Estimation by Sequential Testing (PEST).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Self-reported functional scores</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The percentage score of the Foot and Ankle Ability Measure (FAAM) will be used for the self-reported function. The total percentage score will be ranging from 0-100. The higher score indicates a better ankle function.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Spinal reflex excitability as evaluated by H-reflex and M-wave ratio (Hmax/Mmax ratio)</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>H-reflex is a refractory muscle response which results from electrical stimulation over the peripheral nerve. M-wave is a compound muscle action potentials which results from supra-maximal electrical stimulation. Maximal H-reflex and M-wave ratios will be measured.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Corticospinal excitability as evaluated by the peak-to-peak amplitude of Motor Evoked Potential (MEP)</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The soleus active muscle response, due to transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) pulses over the motor cortex, will be used for quantifying the motor evoked potential.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cortical activation as measured by electroencephalogram (EEG)</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The electroencephalogram (EEG) signal will be decomposed into its frequency components. Power spectral density (PSD) value will be calculated for the cortical activation.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Dynamic postural control as measured by the reach distance</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The reach distance (cm) will be measured by Star Excursion Balance Test (SEBT).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Dynamic postural balance as measured by the time to complete the lateral hop</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The completion time (seconds) for the lateral hop will be measured. Each trial consists of 10 lateral hops. The average completion time of 3 trials will be reported. The completion time will be recorded using a stopwatch in seconds.</description>

    <description>An anodal surface electrode will be attached to the contralateral motor cortex (M1) of the CAI-involved side and the reference electrode will be placed on the ipsilateral side of the supraorbital ridge. Anodal tDCS will deliver a low electrical current stimulation at 2 milliamps (mA). Participants will undergo 3 sessions per week for a total of 12 sessions and each session will last approximately 20 minutes.</description>
