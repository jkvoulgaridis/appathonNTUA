    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is assess the: (a) incidence of severe uterine bleeding (SUB)
      following exposure to individual direct oral anticoagulant (DOACs) (rivaroxaban, apixaban,
      dabigatran) and warfarin, (b) individual DOACs (rivaroxaban, apixaban, dabigatran)
      association with risk of SUB compared with warfarin, and (c) individual DOACs (rivaroxaban,
      apixaban, dabigatran) associated with risk of SUB compared with other individual DOACs -
      among women with prior diagnoses for DOAC and warfarin indications (non-valvular atrial
      fibrillation [NVAF], venous thromboembolism [VTE], total hip replacement [THR] or total knee
      replacement [TKR]).

        The study population will include adult women aged 18 years and older who are newly exposed
        to DOACs or warfarin with greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 183 days of prior continuous
        database observation between 19-Oct-2010 and 31-Dec-2018 will be assessed for severe
        uterine bleeding.
