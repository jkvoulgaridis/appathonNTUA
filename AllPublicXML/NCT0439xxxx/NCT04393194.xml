  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this two-arm randomized clinical trial is to determine if in women
      desiring use of a pessary for pelvic organ prolapse (POP) and are successfully fit, if 1-year
      use and patient impression of improvement is superior in women using vaginal estrogen cream
      versus those using a vaginal placebo cream.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a multi-center, randomized trial of women with symptomatic utero-vaginal or
      post-hysterectomy vaginal vault prolapse desiring non-surgical treatment with a pessary. This
      study will compare outcomes in women randomized to vaginal estrogen cream or vaginal placebo
      cream.

      Women who meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria will be evaluated. A pessary (ring with
      support) will be fit by an experienced physician. After successful pessary fitting, they will
      be randomly divided into experimental active medication and control groups. The experimental
      group will start intravaginal estrogen cream, and the control group will start intravaginal
      estrogen-free cream. Then patients will be followed every 3months until 1year.

      The purpose of this trial is to evaluate the effect of intravaginal estrogen use on pessary
      treatment for pelvic organ prolapse, including short-term and long-term use rate, patient
      impression of improvement, improvement in symptom-specific quality of life and complication
      incidence.

    <description>Sustained wearing with satisfaction: continuous wearing is defined as the use of the pessary after successful fitting test. The continuous wearing time interval is from the start of wearing the pessary to cessation of pessary use.
PGI-I （patient global impression of improvement））is used to evaluate patient impression of improvement. PGI-I is divided into seven levels: very much better, much better, a little bit better, no change, a little bit worse, much worse and very much worse. The patient's response of&quot; very much better&quot; and&quot; much better&quot; is defined as a successful impression of improvement.</description>

    <description>Patients with symptomatic POP will be assigned as outpatients. After the initial pessary fitting, the patients will be followed up in 2 weeks. If the prolapse is supported, no discomfort, and the patient decides to continue to use the pessary, the pessary fitting is successful. Patients with successful ring pessary fitting, who agree to participate and sign written consent, will be randomized into the vaginal estrogen group and the placebo group. The patients will be followed up every 3 months after wearing pessary combined with vaginal medication, until 1 year after wearing the pessary.</description>
