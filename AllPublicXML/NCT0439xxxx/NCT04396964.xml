  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The process of surgery is a controlled trauma to the body. Trauma induces changes in
      metabolic function that have evolved to help the body survive injury. The normal balance
      among use of sugar, fat, and protein for energy production is thought to change during trauma
      and surgery. This altered metabolic function may contribute to adverse outcomes from surgical
      procedures especially in the setting of patients with obesity or Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.
      However, very little is known about the specific changes in metabolism that occur during
      surgical procedures.

      The main objective of this project is to describe the metabolic changes that occur during a
      typical surgical procedure in detail. In order to measure the alterations in the balanced use
      of sugar, fat, and protein during surgery we will collect blood samples from patients before,
      during, and after spinal surgical procedures. Subjects will be enrolled in the pre-operative
      hold area, give informed consent, and have a dedicated peripheral IV catheter placed. We will
      recruit patients who are normal weight without diabetes, obese without diabetes, and obese
      with diabetes. The first specific aim is to characterize the metabolic changes in sugar, fat,
      and protein balance during surgery in metabolically normal subjects. The second specific aim
      to examine if there are differences in these changes in subjects who are obese or have
      diabetes. The final specific aim is to measure the changes in metabolism at high resolution
      using a method called metabolomics, which is analogous to genome profiling. This method
      measures hundreds of compounds produced in different amounts as metabolic balance changes.

      The major impacts that may be derived from these data range from a more thorough
      understanding of metabolism under trauma to identification of new markers for risk
      stratification and intervention to improve clinical outcomes. These data will help build the
      foundation for new approaches to understanding the physiological and metabolic responses to
      stress and trauma.

      We will conduct a cross-sectional study in a cohort of patients undergoing spinal surgery for
      discectomy, laminectomy, or vertebral fixation. We will recruit a cohort of subjects in
      groups with metabolic phenotypes defined by body mass index (BMI) and glycemic control. We
      are choosing to use spinal surgeries as they utilize inhaled anesthetics, run hours in
      length, do not involve ischemic tourniquet time, and use basic elements of the anesthetic
      pharmacopeia including anti-emetics, opioid analgesics, and paralytics. Further the increased
      surgical stress of entering the thorax or peritoneum are avoided. These features provide a
      long steady-state of surgical intervention with minimal additional maneuvers allowing for a
      controlled examination of surgical metabolism.

      The categorical criteria for the groups will be body type: lean (BMI&lt;25), overweight (BMI
      &gt;25, &lt;30), and obese (BMI &gt;30 but &lt;40), and glycemia: normoglycemic (fasting blood glucose;
      FBG &lt;100 mg/dL or HbA1c &lt;5.5%), impaired fasting glucose (FBG &gt;100 mg/dL and &lt;126 mg/dL, or
      HbA1c &gt;5.5% and &lt;6.5%), Type 2 Diabetes (FBG &gt;126 mg/dL or HbA1c &gt;6.5%).

      Subjects will be screened, enrolled, give informed consent, and have a dedicated peripheral
      IV line placed in pre-operative hold. A baseline blood sample will be collected in
      pre-operative hold, after transfer to the table in the operating room, and immediately prior
      to induction of anesthesia. Following induction blood samples will be collected at 15'
      intervals for the initial 2 hours of each case, then at 30' intervals for the remainder of
      the case and for 2 hours in the post-anesthesia care unit. Samples will be processed and
      stored at -80C until analyzed. Intra-operative data from the anesthesia record will be
      collected and included in the study database.
