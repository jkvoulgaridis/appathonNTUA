  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Osteoporosis is a common complication of AS even in the early stages of disease. Yet, AS is
      also characterized by new bone growth that leads to syndesmophytes formation and subsequent
      vertebral ankyloses.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Accordingly, previously-published studies have demonstrated large discrepancies in the
      reported incidence of osteoporosis, based on measurement of bone mineral density (BMD), in
      patients with AS ranging from 18.7% to 62%. Measurement of trabecular bone score (TBS) is a
      novel tool used to evaluate bone microarchitecture. Aim of the work: to compare bone quality
      using TBS between AS patients and healthy controls and to evaluate factors associated with
      TBS in patients with AS. Patients and methods: A total of 40 male AS patients recruited from
      Outpatient Clinic of Rheumatology, Mansoura University Hospital. 40 age-matched healthy males
      as matched control. TBS was analyzed using DXA images over exactly the same region as the
      lumbar BMD assessment (L1-L4). Lumbar spine DXA images were reanalyzed using TBS iNight
      software version 2.1 (Med-I maps, Merignac, France). Patients were divided in 3 TBS groups
      according to guidelines for fracture risk: any TBS &gt;1.31 was considered as normal; TBS values
      between 1.23 and 1.31 were consistent as partially degraded structure; and any TBS &lt;1.23 was
      considered as degraded structure

    <description>structural damage in the cervical and lumbar spine was scored according to the modified Stoke AS Spinal Score (mSASSS) which yielded a final summation score ranging from zero to 72.
BMD was measured using DXA (Lunar Prodigy densitometer, GE Healthcare, Madison, WI, USA).
BMD was measured at the lumbar spine (L1-L4) and the left hip (femoral neck and total proximal femur).
TBS was analyzed using DXA images over exactly the same region as the lumbar BMD assessment (L1-L4). Lumbar spine DXA images were reanalyzed using TBS iNight software version 2.1 (Med-I maps, Merignac, France). Patients were divided in 3 TBS groups according to guidelines for fracture risk [22]: any TBS &gt;1.31 was considered as normal; TBS values between 1.23 and 1.31 were consistent as partially degraded structure; and any TBS &lt;1.23 was considered as degraded structure.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  A total of 40 consecutive male AS patients were invited to participate in this study.
             Patients were recruited from Outpatient Clinic of Rheumatology, Mansoura University
             Hospital, between January and September 2019. AS was diagnosed according to modified
             New York criteria. During the same period, 40 age-matched healthy males were invited
             to participate in the study as a control group.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  patients or controls with thyroid or parathyroid disorders, presence of chronic renal
             or liver disease, and use of any medication that could potentially interfere with bone
             metabolism including bisphosphonates, teriparatide, anticonvulsants, anticoagulants,
             calcium and corticosteroids. None of the participants was using vitamin D supplements.
