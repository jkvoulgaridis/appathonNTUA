  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the safety and performance of the Mitral Touch System to treat mitral
      insufficiency in patients who are to undergo cardiac surgery with either a sternotomy or
      thoracotomy who present with moderate to severe ischemic or functional mitral regurgitation.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Mitral Touch Systems is intended to epicardially reshape the mitral valve annulus and
      left ventricle without the need for cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and open-heart access
      (atriotomy), in patients with left ventricular dilation and mitral valve insufficiency in
      patients with ischemic or functional MR.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Moderate or greater (2+) ischemic or functional Mitral regurgitation by 2D
             echocardiography using an integrative method

          2. Patient is scheduled for cardiac surgery (e.g. CABG including patients on the waiting
             list for Heart Transplantation)

          3. Within 90 days patients should be on stable optimally uptitrated medical therapy
             recommended according to current guidelines23 as standard of care for heart failure
             therapy in the United States

        Exclusion Criteria:

        1. Any evidence of structural (chordal or leaflet) mitral valve disease 2. Inability to
        derive ERO, LVESVI or LVEDVI by TTE 3. Prior surgical or percutaneous mitral valve
        intervention 4. Contraindication to cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) 5. Clinical signs of
        cardiogenic shock 6. Treatment with chronic intravenous inotropic therapy 7. Severe,
        irreversible pulmonary hypertension in the judgement of the investigator 8. ST segment
        elevation requiring intervention within 7 days prior to randomization 9. Congenital heart
        disease (except PFO or ASD) 10. Evidence of cirrhosis or hepatic synthetic failure 11.
        Renal insufficiency (eGFR &lt; 30 ml/min) 12. History of endocarditis or current endocarditis
        13. Ejection fraction &lt;25% 14. NY heart class IV 15. MV diameters &gt; 7cm 16. Any coronary
        artery calcification at site of placement as determined by angiogram 17. Myxomatous mitral
        regurgitation 18. Women who are pregnant (by history of menstrual period or pregnancy test
        if history is considered unreliable) 19. Abnormal cardiac anatomy discovered prior to
        surgery or during procedure 20. Pericardial adhesions 21. Insufficient clinical signature
        reduction of mitral regurgitation during device sizing and placement. (No device remains,
        patient moved to only 30-Day follow-up.)
