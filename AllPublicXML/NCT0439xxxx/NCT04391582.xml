      This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of Nile tilapia skin as a xenograft for the
      treatment of partial-thickness burn wounds in children.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, monocentric, randomized phase II pilot study conducted in Fortaleza,
      Brazil. The study population consisted of 30 children between the ages of 2 and 12 years with
      superficial &quot;partial-thickness&quot; burns admitted less than 72 hours from the thermal injury. In
      the test group, the tilapia skin was applied. In the control group, a thin layer of silver
      sulfadiazine cream 1% was applied.

    <measure>Complete burn wound healing</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 11</time_frame>
    <description>The number of days to complete burn wound healing (≥95% reepithelialization), calculated via clinical judgment from the consultant.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Assessment of pain via the Faces Pain Scale-Revised (FPS-R).</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 11</time_frame>
    <description>The pain evaluation via the FPS-R was performed by the patient himself or herself if aged 5 years or more, or by their caregiver in patients under 5 years of age. The scale consists of six faces, presented horizontally, that depict different degrees of pain, from &quot;no pain&quot; to &quot;most pain possible&quot;. A numerical value from 0 to 10 is assigned to each face.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Assessment of pain via CONFORT-B scale.</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 11</time_frame>
    <description>The pain evaluation via CONFORT-B Scale was performed by the physician responsible and assessed the pain based in a behavioral that consisted in six factors: alertness, calmness/agitation, respiratory response (or crying), physical movement, muscle tone, and facial tension.Each factor was scored with values ranging between 1 and 5, generating scores between 6 and 30 points.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Assessment of pain via FLACCr scale.</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 11</time_frame>
    <description>The pain evaluation via FLACCr scale was performed by the physician responsible and answered five evaluation categories based on behavioral parameters with combined scores ranging from zero to ten (classified the scores as follows: zero to three (mild pain); four to six (moderate pain) and seven to ten (severe pain).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of dressings performed.</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 11</time_frame>
    <description>In the test group, a dressing change was defined as the act of replacing the tilapia skin that did not adhere properly and/or replacing gauze and bandage that is full of exudate, after an evaluation of the dressing (performed every 48 hours). In the control group, a dressing change was defined as the daily act of cleaning the wound and reapplying the silver sulfadiazine cream 1%, which is then covered with new gauze and bandage.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Total amount of anesthetics and analgesics required throughout the treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 11</time_frame>
    <description>To audit anesthetics and analgesics intake, nurses were trained to register on the patient's clinical record all analgesic and anesthetic medications used</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Evaluation of burn improvement via the Clinical Global Impression Scale-Improvement (CGI-I).</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 3, day 5, day 7, day 9 and day 11</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI-I was evaluated by the physician responsible and answers the following question: &quot;Compared to the patient's condition at admission to the project, this patient's condition is: 1 - very much improved since the initiation of treatment; 2 - much improved; 3 - minimally improved; 4 - no change from baseline; 5 - minimally worse; 6 - much worse; 7 - very much worse since the initiation of treatment&quot;</description>

    <time_frame>Day 1, day 3, day 5, day 7, day 9 and day 11</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI-I was evaluated by the physician responsible and answers the following question: &quot;Compared to the patient's condition at admission to the project, this patient's condition is: 1=very much improved since the initiation of treatment; 2=much improved; 3=minimally improved; 4=no change from baseline (the initiation of treatment); 5=minimally worse; 6= much worse; 7=very much worse since the initiation of treatment.&quot;</description>
