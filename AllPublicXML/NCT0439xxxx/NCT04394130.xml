  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to study the analgesic efficacy of a continuous infusion of local
      anaesthetics for interscalene brachial plexus block after major shoulder surgery in the
      setting of multimodal analgesia, in order to determine whether the use of a catheter is still
      necessary in a contemporary practice.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis of this study is that in contemporary practice, comprising the administration
      of multimodal analgesia, the continuous infusion of local anesthetic via a catheter remains
      superior in terms of analgesia at 24 h compared to a single-shot injection at the level of
      the interscalene brachial plexus after major shoulder surgery.

      This prospective randomized monocentric superiority study will include two parallel groups: a
      SS (single-shot injection) group and a CI (continuous infusion) group.

      All patients will have a preoperative ultrasound-guided interscalene brachial plexus block
      with 20 ml of lidoca誰ne 1% and epinephrine 1:100,000, followed by the insertion of a
      catheter. In the post-operative period, after clinical assessment of motor recovery in the
      operated limb (flexion of the forearm possible) in order to exclude any neurological damage
      of surgical origin, ropivacaine 0.5% 20 ml will be injected through the catheter. In the SS
      group, the catheter will be removed. In the CI group, a continuous infusion of ropivacaine
      0.2% at a flow rate of 6 ml.h-1 will be running for 48h after the bolus administration of
      ropivacaine 0.5%.

      In both groups, patients will receive during surgery multimodal analgesia inclusive of iv
      dexamethasone 8 mg, iv magnesium sulfate 40 mg.kg-1, iv ketorolac 30 mg, and iv acetaminophen
      1000 mg, according to the current practice in our institution.

      Assignment to one of these two groups will be done according to a computer-generated list of
      random numbers, and the sealed envelopes method will be used.

      In the postoperative period, patients will be prescribed an iv pca of morphine.
