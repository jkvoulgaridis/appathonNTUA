  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Belantamab mafodotin (GSK2857916) is an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) containing humanized
      anti- B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA) monoclonal antibody (mAb). Renal impairment is a major
      complication of multiple myeloma (MM) and majority of MM participants either are at risk or
      already have renal dysfunction at initial diagnosis. The purpose of this study is assess the
      pharmacokinetics (PK), safety, and tolerability of belantamab mafodotin monotherapy in
      participants with Relapsed/Refractory Multiple Myeloma (RRMM) who have had at least 3 lines
      of prior treatment and have either normal or impaired renal functions. The study will consist
      of two parts: part 1 will include participants with normal renal function and severe renal
      impairment and part 2 will include participants with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) where
      participants are either not undergoing or require hemodialysis. Participants will be
      administered GSK2857916 at a dose of 2.5 milligram per kilogram (mg/kg) intravenously in Part
      1 and in Part 2, dose will depend on the evaluation of pharmacokinetic and safety data of
      Part 1. However, dose in Part 2 will not exceed 2.5 mg/kg. Participants will be treated with
      GSK2857916 monotherapy until confirmed disease progression, death, unacceptable toxicity,
      withdrawal of consent, or end of study, whichever occurs first. This study will include a
      screening phase, treatment phase, and follow-up phase. The total duration of the study is
      approximately up to 48 months.

          -  Female participants: Contraceptive use by women should be consistent with local
             regulations regarding the methods of contraception for those participating in clinical

             breastfeeding, and not a woman of childbearing potential (WOCBP) or is a WOCBP and
             using a contraceptive method that is highly effective (with a failure rate of &lt;1% per
             year), preferably with low user dependency, during the intervention period and for at
             least 9 months after the last dose of study intervention and agrees not to donate eggs
             (ova, oocytes) for the purpose of reproduction during this period. The investigator

             first dose of study intervention. A WOCBP must have a negative highly sensitive serum
             pregnancy test within 72 hours of dosing on Cycle 1 Day 1 and agree to use highly
             effective contraception during the study and for 9 months after the last dose of study
             medication. The investigator is responsible for review of medical history, menstrual
             history, and recent sexual activity to decrease the risk for inclusion of a woman with
             an early undetected pregnancy.

          -  Male participants: Contraceptive use by men should be consistent with local
             regulations regarding the methods of contraception for those participating in clinical
             studies. Male participants are eligible to participate if they agree to the following
             from the time of first dose of study until 6 months after the last dose of study
             treatment to allow for clearance of any altered sperm: Refrain from donating sperm and
             either; Be abstinent from heterosexual intercourse as their preferred and usual
             lifestyle (abstinent on a long term and persistent basis) and agree to remain
             abstinent; or must agree to use a male condom even if they have undergone a successful
             vasectomy and female partner to use an additional highly effective contraceptive
             method with a failure rate of &lt;1% per year as when having sexual intercourse with a
             WOCBP (including pregnant females).
