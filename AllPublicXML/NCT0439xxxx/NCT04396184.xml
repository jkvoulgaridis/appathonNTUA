    <textblock>
      This study is being done to compare a new, continuous illumination and short Incubation time
      regimen of aminolevulinic acid photodynamic therapy#ALA-PDT) to a conventional regimen for
      treatment of Actinic Keratosis. The hypothesis is that the continuous illumination approach
      will be less or even no painful, but equally efficacious, as the old regimen.
