  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Limited/poor weight loss and weight regain are concerns following bariatric surgery, and
      weight regain may increase the risk for relapse of comorbidities related to obesity.
      Medications for weight reduction may assist further weight loss, and support weight
      maintenance, with positive effects on comorbidities. This pilot study will examine the effect
      of naltrexone/bupropion and lifestyle advice versus lifestyle advice alone for 7 months in
      patients with a suboptimal weight trajectory (either little weight loss or weight regain) 2
      years or later following bariatric surgery.

      Study aim and endpoints The aim of this pilot study is to evaluate the effect of Mysimba in
      patients with suboptimal weight loss or weight regain after bariatric surgery. The primary
      endpoint is body weight.

      Objective The study objective is to understand whether patients with suboptimal weight loss
      or weight regain 2 years or more following bariatric surgery achieve better weight loss with
      Mysimba and dietary counselling compared with a control group treated with dietary
      counselling alone.

      This is a phase IV, open label randomized controlled study conducted over 7 months with a
      3-month post-intervention follow-up. The study will be conducted in accordance with good
      clinical practice. Patients meeting eligibility criteria will be randomized into one of two
      groups: an intervention group treated with Mysimba and lifestyle and a control group treated
      with lifestyle. The intervention group will be prescribed Mysimba gradually titrated to the
      maximum tolerated dose (maximum dose is 32 mg/360 mg divided in 4 tablets) with 2 week
      intervals. Both groups will receive the same follow up including dietary counselling during
      the course of the study. Randomization will be done using a standard internet-based program
      where group assignment cannot be anticipated. The study is not blinded.
