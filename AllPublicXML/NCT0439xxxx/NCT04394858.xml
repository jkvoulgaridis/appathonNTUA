    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well the addition of olaparib to the usual treatment,
      temozolomide, works in treating patients with neuroendocrine cancer (pheochromocytoma or
      paraganglioma) that has spread to other places in the body (metastatic) or cannot be removed
      by surgery (unresectable). PARPs are proteins that help repair DNA mutations. PARP
      inhibitors, such as olaparib, can keep PARP from working, so tumor cells can't repair
      themselves, and they may stop growing. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as temozolomide, work
      in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping
      them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving olaparib with temozolomide may
      shrink or stabilize the cancer in patients with pheochromocytoma or paraganglioma better than
      temozolomide alone.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To compare the progression-free survival (PFS) of patients with advanced pheochromocytoma
      and paraganglioma (APP) receiving temozolomide (dose dense) and olaparib to that of patients
      receiving temozolomide (pulse dose) alone.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare the overall survival (OS) of patients with APP receiving temozolomide (dose
      dense) and olaparib versus (vs.) temozolomide (pulse dose) alone.

      II. To compare the objective response rate (ORR) associated with temozolomide (dose dense)
      and olaparib vs. temozolomide (pulse dose) alone in patients with APP.

      III. To evaluate and compare the toxicity profile of temozolomide-based combinations
      (temozolomide [dose dense] and olaparib vs. temozolomide [pulse dose]) in patients with APP
      using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) and Patient-Reported Outcomes
      (PRO)-CTCAE.

      OTHER OBJECTIVE:

      I. Results of the primary analysis will be examined for consistency, while taking into
      account the stratification factors and/or covariates of baseline quality of life (QOL) and
      fatigue.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess biochemical response: serum catecholamines and metanephrines; urine
      catecholamines and metanephrines.

      II. To assess biomolecular markers associated with clinical outcome: germline succinyl
      dehydrogenase (SDH) mutations and tumor status of the repair enzyme
      methylguanine-deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) methyltransferase (MGMT).

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive temozolomide orally (PO) once daily (QD) and olaparib PO twice daily
      (BID) on days 1-7. Treatment with temozolomide repeats every 21 days for up to 13 cycles in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cycles of olaparib repeat every
      21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients receive temozolomide PO QD on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 28 days for
      up to 13 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients discontinuing treatment due to reasons other than disease progression are followed
      every 8 weeks until disease progression, then every 6 months until 5 years after start of
      treatment. Patients discontinuing treatment due to disease progression are followed every 6
      months for 5 years after start of treatment.

    <description>Will be compared between treatment arms using the un-stratified log-rank test at one-sided level of 0.11 and the p-value will be used for decision making. The hazard ratio will be estimated using a Cox proportional hazards model and the 95% confidence interval for the hazard ratio will be provided. Results from a stratified analysis will also be provided. Kaplan-Meier methodology will be used to estimate the median PFS for each treatment arm, and Kaplan-Meier curves will be produced. Brookmeyer-Crowley methodology will be used to construct the 95% confidence interval for the median PFS for each treatment arm.</description>

    <description>Patients who are alive will be censored at last follow-up. The distribution of survival time will be estimated using the method of Kaplan-Meier. OS will be compared between treatment arms using the log-rank test. OS medians, survival rates and hazard ratio will be estimated along with 95% confidence intervals.</description>

    <measure>Objective response</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Will be assessed by RECIST version 1.1 criteria. Will be estimated using objective response rate where objective response rate is defined as the number of evaluable patients achieving a response (partial response or complete response per RECIST version 1.1) during treatment with study therapy divided by the total number of evaluable patients. Rates of response will be compared across arms using a Chi-Square Test for Proportion. Point estimates will be generated for objective response rates within each arm along with 95% binomial confidence intervals.</description>

    <time_frame>Up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Will be assessed per National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0. The term toxicity is defined as adverse events that are classified as possibly, probably, or definitely related to study treatment. Toxicities will be evaluated via the ordinal Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events standard toxicity grading. Similarly, scores (0-4) and the maximum score for each Patient-Reported Outcomes-CTCAE item will be recorded for each patient.</description>

    <time_frame>Up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Levels of chromogranin A, urine and/or plasma catecholamines and metanephrines may predict response to therapy. The proportion of patients with a biochemical response of partial response or better, as determined by plasma and/or urine catecholamines and metanephrines, will be calculated, and a 95% confidence interval will be placed on this proportion. For each factor, we will calculate the mean +/- standard deviation, minimum, maximum, and quartiles; in addition, we will generate box and whisker plot.</description>
