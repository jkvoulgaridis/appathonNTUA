  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To improve the safety of diagnosis and therapy for a set of conditions and undifferentiated
      symptoms for hospitalized patients, the investigators will employ a set of methods and tools
      from the disciplines of systems engineering, human factors, quality improvement,and data
      analytics to thoroughly analyze the problem, design and develop potential solutions that
      leverage existing current technological infrastructure, and implement and evaluate the final
      interventions. The investigators will engage the interdisciplinary care team and patient (or
      their caregivers) to ensure treatment trajectories match the anticipated course for working
      diagnoses (or symptoms), and whether they are in line with patient and clinician
      expectations. The investigators will use an Interrupted time series (ITS) design to assess
      impact on diagnostic errors that lead to patient harm. The investigators will perform
      quantitative and qualitative evaluations using implementation science principles to
      understand if the interventions worked, and why or why not.

      The goal of this study is to improve the safety of diagnosis and therapy for a set of
      conditions and undifferentiated symptoms for hospitalized patients. The investigators will
      employ a set of methods and tools from the disciplines of systems engineering, human factors,
      quality improvement, and implementation science to thoroughly analyze the problem, design and
      develop potential solutions that leverage the current technological infrastructure, and
      implement and evaluate the final interventions.

      The aims of this study are to:

        1. Analyze the problem of diagnostic error over the acute episode of care, identifying
           system and cognitive factors for a set of morbid, costly common conditions and
           undifferentiated symptoms by using system engineering and human factors methods, as well
           as electronic health record and administrative data review.

        2. Design, develop, and iteratively refine intervention components using lessons learned
           from problem analysis and a participatory process that involves patients, clinicians,
           and institutional stakeholders.

        3. Implement an intervention for patient and clinician subjects on general medicine units.
           Using a pre-post, interrupted time series study design, the investigators will evaluate
           the effect of the intervention primarily on diagnostic and therapeutic errors. The
           investigators will use mixed methods to understand barriers and facilitators of
           implementation.

    <description>A Diagnostic Uncertainty Educational Curriculum will consist of an interactive, one-hour &quot;teach-the-teacher&quot; workshop delivered to resident-attending pairs early on during their inpatient medicine rotation. During the workshop, we will discuss the motivation behind teaching diagnostic uncertainty, review factors that may predict risk of diagnostic error during hospitalization, introduce the framework. Each resident-attending pair will work through a case-based exercise focused on managing learners' diagnostic uncertainty during rounds. Our research team will also conduct Training for clinical staff working on intervention units and will provide &quot;at-the-elbow&quot; support during the intervention period of the main trial.</description>

    <description>A &quot;Diagnostic Timeout&quot; is a structured &quot;pocket guide&quot; that clinicians may use to address uncertainty in a step-wise approach for patients who have risk factors for diagnostic error. This tool can be used during or after clinical rounds, inside or outside of a patient's room if the patient is agreeable. The &quot;Diagnostic Timeout&quot; will be introduced as part of the Diagnostic Uncertainty Educational Curriculum as well as Training.</description>

    <intervention_name>Patient Diagnostic (Dx) Questionnaire</intervention_name>
    <description>We will administer a survey, the Dx Questionnaire, to patients which asks a series of questions on communication regarding diagnosis with the care team. Patients admitted to inpatient units within the prior 24 hours will be approached after asking the patient's nurse to determine whether it is the appropriate time to approach for enrollment. Upon explaining the objectives of the survey and obtaining verbal informed consent, patients will be asked to complete the Dx Questionnaire via REDCap on an iPad. Alternatively, the research assistant administering the survey will go through the Dx Questionnaire with the patient and record their answers in REDCap on their behalf. If patients' answers indicate a gap in communication (i.e., an answer of &quot;No&quot; on a question), the Research Assistant will ask for permission to follow-up within the next few days and will relay the gap in communication to the patients' care team (i.e., nurse).</description>
