      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of healthy Chinese
      volunteers after oral administration of SHR1459 tablets in new and old formulations.

      The secondary objective of the study is to evaluate the safety after single dose of SHR1459
      orally in healthy Chinese subjects.

      The PK parameters (AUC0-t, AUC0-inf, Cmax, Tmax, T1/2z, CL/F and Vz/F etc.) will be
      calculated to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of healthy Chinese volunteers after oral
      administration of SHR1459 tablets in new and old formulations.

      During the study, the safety will be assessed by vital signs, physical examination,
      laboratory examination (hematology, blood biochemistry, urinalysis, coagulation examination),
      12-lead electrocardiogram. The incidence and severity degree of adverse events and severe
      adverse events will be evaluated based on CTCAE 5.0.
