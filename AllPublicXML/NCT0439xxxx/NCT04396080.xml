    <textblock>
      A record of the type of onlay will be made with respect to its extension, tooth or teeth to
      be treated, the material of clothing and the substrate on which the adhesion and cementing
      method, as well as the type of antagonist. To complete it, a complete clinical oral
      examination will be performed with oral mirrors, examination probes, joint paper, disposable
      gloves, masks, paper napkins, plastic cups, dental equipment lighting lamp, cold spray ,
      photogrammed camera, including an intraoral scan to have a 3D file of the patient's condition
      on the day of embedding placement.

      Once treatment is complete, the patient should go to routine check-ups in which a full
      intraoral exploration and data collection intended to be carried out analyze the following
      variables (USPHS modificated): possible decemented and fractured, decay and marginal
      integrity, sensitivity or loss of vitality, as well as the degree of patient satisfaction
      (VAS).

        -  1 month.
