  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of our study; to investigate the effects of EMG-induced ES treatment on hand
      functions, muscle strength, and quality of life in patients with hemiplegic CP.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Upper limb spasticity greatly affects the hand functions of patients with cerebral palsy (CP)
      and impairs quality of life. The most important goal in rehabilitation; despite the existing
      deficiencies, the highest level of functional independence of the patient is to increase the
      quality of life. EMG-triggered biofeedback electrical stimulation (EMG-triggered-BF-ES)
      increases the patient's active participation and motivation in rehabilitation, creates visual
      or auditory BF, provides muscle reeducation, decreases spasticity, prevents atrophies and
      increases joint mobility and increases muscle functionality by increasing the patient's
      functionality. There are areas of use the EMG-triggered-BF-ES such as cerebrovascular disease
      (CVO), spinal cord injury, and CP. When the literature is examined; studies were found to be
      few, and no study evaluating the upper extremity was found in children with CP. The purpose
      of our study is the investigation of the effects of EMG-triggered-BF-ES treatment applied on
      hand functions, muscle strength, and quality of life in patients with CP.

    <measure>The Cerebral Palsy Quality of Life Questionnaire (CPQoL)</measure>
    <time_frame>within 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Health condition-specific questionnaire designed for measuring QOL in children with cerebral palsy (CP). It consists of a caregiver and a child survey. It is used for the evaluation of Sp cases between the ages of 4-12.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Action Research Arm Test (ARAT)</measure>
    <time_frame>within 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The ARAT consists of four subscales: grasp, grip, pinch, and gross movement. It contains 19 tasks, and each task is scored on a four-point scale (0, can perform no part of the test; 1, performs test partially; 2, completes test but takes abnormally long time or has great difficulty; and 3, performs test normally).</description>

    <description>Task-oriented EMG-triggered ES treatment will be applied to the experimental group 2 days a week for 5 weeks and will continue with conventional physiotherapy.

    <description>All treatments were planned as 2 sessions per week, for a total of 10 sessions for 5 weeks. For EMG-trigger-ES application, dual-channel Nu-Tek® brand, Maxi plus 2 Model EMG-trigger-BF-ES Device in our clinic was planned to be used. With EMG-triggered-ES application, while the patient is in a sitting position, shoulder adduction, and the elbow is 90 degrees of flexion and pronation, the patient will extend to the ball of 5 cm in diameter, which is placed as far as the distance between the acromion and the 3rd toe, and then the finger-wrist active extension will be stimulated and then It was planned to apply the ball to be grasped. One of the two 5x5 cm superficial square electrodes of the device was planned to be placed on the extensor carpi radialis and extensor digitorum Communis and the other 2 cm distal.</description>
