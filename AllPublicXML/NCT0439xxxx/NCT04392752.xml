  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The experimental participant group (n=15+15) includes male and female fitness athletes during
      their ~25 week competition preparation in fall 2019 for the Finnish national championships.
      Participants must have at least two years of goal-oriented gym training and their health
      status will be determined before measurements via an online pre-study questionnaire. The
      control group (n=15+15) will maintain their normal training and diet without competing during
      the study period. Otherwise, the control group is matched with the athletic group based on
      age, height, weight and training experience. Participants selected for the study will
      complete an additional questionnaire to be reviewed by the study physician to confirm that
      participants meet the health status inclusion criteria. This study includes four laboratory
      testing sessions over the 50-week period. Time points include testing before the diet or the
      control period start (PRE), one week before the competition (MID), after the competition
      (COMP) and after a recovery period (POST). During COMP-POST the participants are advised to
      continue training, but to stop competition dieting.&quot;Measurements will include body
      composition (fat mass and fat free mass by bioimpedance, DXA and skinfolds), resting
      metabolic rate (indirect calorimetry), vastus lateralis and triceps brachii muscle-cross
      sectional area, subcutaneous fat thickness from ultrasonography and circulating hormone
      analysis. Also, whole blood will be analyzed for hemoglobin and hematocrit and systems
      biology approach: e.g. serum metabolome and possibly also other analysis. Lower body maximal
      voluntary isometric force will be measured via knee extension machine device. Average weekly
      physical activity will be determined with a wrist-worn uni-axial accelerometer. Training and
      dietary data (nutrient intake, volume, intensity etc.) will be collected via nutrition and
      training diaries. Psychological questionnaires will be conducted via an online survey.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of competition preparation and recovery
      period on body composition, the endocrine system, metabolic rate, physical activity and
      performance, dietary and training habits and mood state in fitness athletes.

      Metabolic and hormonal adaptations due to weight loss oppose further weight loss and pose
      challenges for maintaining reduced body weight. Fitness competition preparation (i.e., a
      substantial decrease in body fat mass without notable decreases in muscle mass) is
      accomplished by restricting total daily energy intake and increasing dosage of aerobic
      exercise dosage while maintaining high levels of resistance training and dietary protein.
      There is sparse research regarding the effects of the competition preparation and the
      recovery period afterwards the competition on body composition, neuromuscular performance,
      hormone balance, and metabolic rate. Additionally, the effects of preparation on mood states
      and on systems biology is not well studied.

      The present study will help us understand the degree to which adaptations are due to the
      preparation and recovery process, or as a consequence of reaching the desired body
      composition (or some combination thereof). In turn, the findings may serve to help develop
      coaching guidelines for fitness athletes which minimize unfavorable adaptations to
      preparation and minimize the stress of the process. Participants will be notified of the
      research procedures, requirements, benefits and risks before providing written informed
      consent. The study will include one doctoral thesis and four scientific research articles
      during 2020-2024. Measurements of the study will be conducted during the spring of 2019 and
      2020. Analyzing the results will occur during the year 2021 and the scientific publications
      will be reported by the end of 2024. The study is funded externally by the Finnish Fitness
      Sports Association and we will apply to additional, appropriate research grants. A large
      amount of data will be collected and processed which requires good management and leadership.
      In order to avoid risks, a comprehensive data management plan will be made for the study.

    <intervention_model_description>This study includes four laboratory testing sessions over the 50-week period. Testing sessions will be performed over one week. Time points include testing before the diet or the control period start (PRE), one week before the competition (MID), after the competition (COMP) and after a recovery period (POST), during which the participants are advised to continue their normal training regimen, but to stop competition dieting. Participants will spend three hours in the laboratory between 0700-1300. The control group will be advised to maintain their normal physical activity diet throughout the study. The participants will be given identification numbers and the research group is blinded so that they do not know which group participants belong to. All measurements will be conducted at the same time (always within max ±1 hour) due to the importance of standardizing the time of the day of measurements.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Mean weekly physical activity (MET) will be monitored using a wrist-worn uni-axial accelerometer Polar Active (Brugniaux et al. 2008). The participants are to wear the Polar Active continuously during a 3-week periods. The activity measurement last for 21 days. During the activity measurement, the wrist-worn accelerometer is worn at all times, except in sauna or bath. Polar Active uses sex, age, body mass, and height as an input to convert the measured acceleration signal to METs with the epoch length of 30 s. Polar Active has been found to correlate well (R2 = 0.74) with the doubly labeled water technique while assessing energy expenditure during a 7- day period of military training (Kinnunen et al., 2012). Data will be collect every month. There will be 14 measurements.</description>

    <description>Resting metabolic rate (J/h·kg) will be measured with indirect calorimetry via respiratory quotient (RQ) assessments. Measurement is performed in a supine position over a 10-min period in a dark, thermos-neutral and quiet laboratory space. Expired gases during the tests are continuously analyzed over the 10 min period (Compher et al. 2006). There will be 3 measurements.</description>

    <description>A high-throughput serum Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) metabolomics platform will be used for the absolute quantification of serum lipids and metabolite profile. The NMR metabolome assay yields a total of 228 different metabolites, including an array of lipoprotein subclasses (e.g., VLDL, LDL, HDL), apolipoproteins, A-1 and B-100, serum free fatty acids, and a wide variety of small molecules such as glycolysis precursors, amino acids and inflammation biomarkers. In the platform, lipoproteins are divided into subclasses according to particle size. Serum metabolics will be quantified from acquired fasting blood samples by Brainshake (Finland) company, specializing in metabolomics quantification. Further, statistical analysis of provided data will be handled at Genomics and biomarkers unit, Institute for Health and Welfare (THL, Finland). There will be 4 measurements.</description>
