  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well gemcitabine works in preventing urothelial cancer from
      coming back within the bladder (intravesical recurrence) in patients with upper urinary tract
      urothelial cancer undergoing radical nephroureterectomy. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as
      gemcitabine, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the
      cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Instilling
      gemcitabine into the bladder during surgery, may reduce the chance of recurrence of upper
      urinary tract urothelial cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To determine the efficacy of a single intraoperative intravesical instillation of
      gemcitabine hydrochloride (gemcitabine) at time of radical nephroureterectomy (RNU) for
      clinically localized upper tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC) in preventing intravesical
      recurrence of urothelial cancer (UC) at one year.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess time to recurrence for entire duration of follow-up. II. To assess the
      qualitative and quantitative toxicities.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To stratify intravesical UC recurrence free survival by tumor grade, neoadjuvant
      chemotherapy, tumor stage, ureteral tumor location, and history of bladder cancer.

      II. To assess incidence and time to development of muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride intravesically for at least 1 hour at the time of
      RNU.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 2 weeks, and 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24
      months.
