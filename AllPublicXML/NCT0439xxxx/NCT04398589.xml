  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Suprascapular nerve block (SSNB) is most commonly used for relieving postoperative pain of
      arthroscopic rotator cuff repair and it can be used in combination with axillary nerve block
      (ANB). Dexmedetomidine (DEX) is known as a type of alpha agonist which can elongate the
      duration of regional block. The aim of this study was to compare the results of
      dexmedetomidine combined with SSNB and ANB with SSNB and ANB alone on postoperative pain,
      satisfaction, and pain-related cytokines within the first 48 hours after arthroscopic rotator
      cuff repair.

      Forty patients with rotator cuff tears who had undergone arthroscopic rotator cuff repair
      were enrolled in this single center, double-blinded randomized controlled trial study. Twenty
      patients were randomly allocated to group 1 and received ultrasound-guided SSNB and ANB using
      each mixture of 0.5 ml (50 μg) of DEX and 9.5 ml of 0.75% ropivacaine preemptively. The other
      20 patients were allocated to group 2 and underwent ultrasound-guided SSNB and ANB alone
      using a mixture of 0.5 ml of normal saline and 9.5 ml of ropivacaine. The visual analog scale
      (VAS) for pain and patient satisfaction (SAT) scores were checked within 48 h
      postoperatively. The plasma interleukin (IL)-6, -8,-1β, cortisol, and serotonin levels were
      also measured within 48 h postoperatively.
