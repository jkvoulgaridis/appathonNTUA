  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim is to study the effect of a dietary supplement on stress and pain through
      questionnaires and follow-up of physiological parameters, and functional Magnetic Resonance
      Imaging (fMRI) in stressed healthy subjects versus stressed healthy subjects without
      treatment.

    <textblock>
      The MAGRITTE monocentric study conducted at Clermont-Ferrand University Hospital is a
      parallel, randomized, and controlled versus placebo performed in stressed subjects.

      The main outcome of this study is to demonstrate on stress the effectiveness of a dietary
      supplement based on magnesium (Mg), vitamins, rhodiola and L-Theanine, compared to placebo,
      in subjects with chronic stress and free from other pathologies.

      The secondary objectives are to evaluate the action of Mg dietary supplement on:

        1. pain by the Numerical Scale and fMRI,

        2. stress by the Numerical Scale and fMRI,

        3. anxiety, depression and sleep with questionnaires,

        4. selected biological parameters,

        5. heart rate variability,

        6. microbiota,

        7. safety of the product.

    <intervention_model_description>After pre-selection (Day-14 to Day 0), participants will receive one of the two products in random order (Mg or placebo).
Treatment allocation will follow a randomization plan and will be carried out by a Clinical Research Associate totally independent from the protocol. The randomization list and a copy will be edited, placed in a sealed envelope, and submitted to the Pharmacy of the University Hospital of Clermont-Ferrand and the Clinical Pharmacology Centre of Clermont-Ferrand which is the coordinating centre.
For a 5% risk of bilateral species error and a 90% power, it is necessary to include 50 subjects per group to highlight such an effect size. In addition, fMRI examinations will be offered to the first 20 subjects included per group, i.e. 40 subjects, an usual and relatively consensual number for fMRI work.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The Pittsburg Sleep Questionnaire Index is a self-questionnaire including 19 items. It was developed to measure the quality of sleep over the month before the patient interview. This questionnaire includes 7 components: subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, sleep efficiency, sleep disturbance, hypnotic medication use and daytime dysfunction. In scoring the PSQI, seven component are evaluated from 0 (no difficulty) to 3 (severe difficulty). The component scores are summed to produce a global score (range 0 to 21). Higher scores indicate worse sleep quality. A score &gt; 5 indicates a sleep disturbance.</description>

    <description>Heart rate variability (HRV / HRV) is a measure of changes in heart rate that will provide an estimate of stress. It is usually calculated by analyzing time series of beat-by-beat intervals of the electrocardiogram or blood pressure plots (using Codesna®).</description>

    <description>Stress Resist® (dietary supplement) is composed of Mg (150 mg), Vitamin B6 (0.7 mg), Vitamin B9 (100µg), Vitamin B12 (1.25 µg), rhodiola (222mg), and green tea/L-théanine (125 mg). Oral supplementation. All subjects in the MAGRITTE study will receive either a dietary supplement or a placebo for 28 days (morning intake). The effects on stress will be studied both with questionnaires, biological samples (blood, urine and stool), with a Heart Rate Variability test. 40 subjects (20 subjects per group) will have an fMRI exam.</description>
