  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this randomized pilot study is to collect preliminary data on the impacts of
      lavender essential oil aromatherapy on the patient-reported quality of pain management
      provided for the vascular surgery patient population. The investigators hypothesize that
      individuals who use a lavender aromastick as a part of their pain management plan will report
      improved perceptions of the quality of their pain management as measured by the Revised
      American Pain Society Patient Outcome Questionnaire (APS-POQ-R).

      Subjects will be randomized to the control (empty aromastick) and intervention group
      (aromastick infused with lavender oil), and will use this device as an addition to their pain
      management plan.

      Additionally, this pilot study will allow the researchers to evaluate the feasibility of a
      larger randomized control trial, assess the validity of the survey tool, and collect feedback
      from patients on the acceptability of the aromatherapy intervention as a complementary
      therapy during their hospital stay.

    <description>Measured using the Revised American Pain Society Patient Outcome Questionnaire (APS-POQ-R) survey tool. The APS-POQ-R has 18 primary questions with continuous rating scales from 0 - 10 or from 0% - 100%. This study, with permission from the original authors, uses a modified survey, with 10 questions evaluating the subject's pain levels and degree to which pain interferes with various aspects of their quality of life. In these questions, higher numbers indicate higher levels of pain and distress. Four additional Likert style questions evaluate subjects' satisfaction with pain management, with higher numbers indicating higher levels of satisfaction.</description>

    <description>Survey questions will also be asked about use of the aromastick to evaluate acceptability of the intervention device. These are yes/no questions, and questions measuring the frequency of device use.</description>
