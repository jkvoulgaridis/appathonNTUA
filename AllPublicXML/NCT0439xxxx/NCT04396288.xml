  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Blood circulation within bone is thought to have a key role in bone growth, in fracture
      healing and in the development of bone diseases like osteoporosis. Current medical imaging
      techniques such as conventional ultrasonography fail to detect blood circulation within bone.
      The investigators propose to develop a new type of ultrasonography called intraosseous
      functional ultrasonography that will enable the detection and the characterization of blood
      circulation in solid bone tissue, marrow and soft tissues surrounding bone (muscle for
      instance). Because most soft tissues are essentially made of water, the speed of sound in
      soft tissues is close to that in water and it varies only a little between different types of
      soft tissues. For this reason, clinical ultrasound scanners used for ultrasonography assume
      that the speed of sound in the human body is the same for all types of soft tissues. This
      assumption is reasonable in soft tissues, but it does not hold in bone because solid bone
      tissue is much stiffer than soft tissues. Seismologists have extensive experience in
      producing images of the structure of the Earth based on the analysis of elastic waves which
      follow the same laws of Physics as ultrasound waves. The subsurface of the Earth contains
      layers of solid materials and liquids, consequently it is very similar to a region of the
      human body containing bone and soft tissues. Therefore the investigators will first work on
      the adaption of time-tested seismic imaging methods to make ultrasonography of bone possible.
      Once a correct image of bone is obtained, the investigators will use an ultrasound scanner
      dedicated to research to repeat this image hundreds of times per second, very much like a
      slow motion video. Because blood is moving while bone is still, the intensity in the image is
      being slightly changed where blood is moving. Thus the analysis of these changes makes it
      possible to detect and characterize blood flow within bone. In this way the investigators
      expect to be able to detect blood flowing with a speed as low as a few millimeters per
      second. Finally the sensitivity of the technique to detect and characterize blood circulation
      in bone will be evaluated in patients at the hospital and in healthy volunteers. The success
      of this work will help gaining knowledge on the role of blood circulation within bone. In the
      long term, it may help in the diagnosis of bone diseases.
