  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) comprise a heterogeneous group of clonal bone marrow
      neoplasms that predominate in the elderly, with a median age at diagnosis of 70 years. The
      diagnosis of MDS relies on peripheral blood cytopenia and morphologic dysplasia for one or
      more hematopoietic cell lineage. Cytopenia is evidenced with hemogram while dysplasia
      requires bone marrow aspirate, which is an invasive procedure .

      Considering the low prevalence of disease among subjects referred for suspected MDS, many
      patients are exposed to unnecessary bone marrow aspiration-related discomfort and harms.
      Therefore, an objective assay based on a peripheral blood sample that accurately
      discriminates MDS from other cytopenia etiologies is highly desirable.

      We have previously developed and refined a flow cytometric analysis protocol for quantifying
      neutrophil MPO expression in peripheral blood at three university-affiliated hospitals (i.e.,
      Clermont-Ferrand, Saint-Etienne, and Grenoble) (Raskovalova et al, Hematologica 2019). We
      found that the robust coefficient of variation (RCV, computed as the robust standard
      deviation divided by the median) within an individual subject was the best parameter in
      discriminating patients with versus without MDS.

      Although promising, flow cytometric analysis of neutrophil MPO expression in peripheral blood
      is technically complex, time consuming, and not standardized. Hence, its performance requires
      specific expertise and the results show substantial variability. A single ready-to-use tube
      with lyophilized antibodies would have the potential to standardize the measurement of
      neutrophil MPO expression in peripheral blood across laboratories, with results available
      within 30-60 min in routine practice.

      In this study, the investigators hypothesize that a standardized and semi-automatic flow
      cytometric assay of neutrophil MPO expression in peripheral blood could accurately rule out
      MDS and obviate the need for bone marrow aspiration and biopsy, with sensitivity and negative
      predictive value estimates approaching 100%.

      In this observational diagnostic accuracy study, burden will be null for recruited patients.
      No specific intervention is assigned to participants. All diagnostic testing, procedures, and
      medication ordering are performed at the discretion of attending physicians. A test result
      will have no impact on patient management. .Compliance with current guidelines disseminated
      by the French Haute Autorité de Santé (HAS) will be advocated for the diagnostic work-up of
      patients with suspected MDS. No follow-up visits are planned in this cross-sectional study.

      The primary objective of MPO-MDS-develop study is to estimate the discriminative accuracy
      (i.e., area under the ROC curve along with 95% CI) of a standardized and semi-automatic flow
      cytometric assay of neutrophil MPO expression in peripheral blood for the diagnosis of MDS in
      adult patients.

      The secondary objectives are to assess:

        1. intra-laboratory reproducibility (intra- and inter-assay precision) for intra-individual
           RCV measurement of neutrophil MPO expression in peripheral blood;

        2. specimen stability for intra-individual RCV measurement of neutrophil MPO expression in
           peripheral blood at different time points in comparison with H0 (stored at 4°C and at
           room temperature);

        3. inter-laboratory reproducibility for intra-individual RCV measurement of neutrophil MPO
           expression in peripheral blood;

        4. the negative predictive value for intra-individual RCV measurement of neutrophil MPO
           expression in peripheral blood (with a prespecified threshold of 30.0%) in ruling out
           MDS in consecutive adult patients.

      The MPO-MDS-Develop project is a multicenter, cross-sectional, diagnostic accuracy study of
      an index test by comparison with a reference standard, in unselected consecutive patients.

      Screening: All consecutive patients referred to the immuno-hematology lab at the study sites
      for suspicion of MDS will be screened for eligibility. A lab physician will review inclusion
      and exclusion criteria, using computerized medical and laboratory records.

      Recruitment: Participants will be included in the study once all the screening activities
      have been conducted and only if the patient meets all inclusion and none exclusion criteria.
      The consent for flow cytometry analysis of peripheral blood sample and data collection
      through chart review will be sought under a regime of &quot;non-opposition&quot; (opt-out): after
      appropriate written information is delivered, cross-sectional data will be collected except
      in case of opposition from the patient. All patients included in the study will be assigned a
      unique patient identification number. This number will be used to identify the patient
      throughout the study.

      Index test: Flow cytometry analysis of neutrophil myeloperoxidase expression in peripheral
      blood will be performed using a single ready-to-use tube with lyophilized antibodies
      developed in partnership with Becton Dickinson France SAS and blinded to the reference
      standard.

      Reference standard: The diagnosis of MDS will be established according to the World Health
      Organization (WHO) classification, based on clinical data, peripheral blood cytopenia,
      cytomorphology of peripheral blood and bone marrow aspirate, and cytogenetic analysis. The
      criteria for MDS diagnosis are 1) the presence of ≥10% dysplastic cells in any hematopoietic
      lineage, 2) the exclusion of acute myeloid leukemia (defined by the presence of ≥20%
      peripheral blood or bone marrow blasts), and 3) the exclusion of reactive etiologies of
      dysplasia. Cytopenia is defined by hemoglobin concentration &lt;10 g/dL, platelet count
      &lt;100x109/L, and/or absolute neutrophil count &lt;1.8 x109/L. Yet a diagnosis of MDS could be
      made with milder levels of cytopenia. Idiopathic cytopenia of uncertain significance (ICUS)
      is defined by unexplained mild persistent cytopenia for at least 6 months and the failure to
      establish the diagnosis to MDS according to published guidelines. Consistent with WHO
      classification, MDS subcategorization will rely on the degree of dysplasia (unilineage versus
      multilineage), blast percentages, presence of ring sideroblasts, and cytogenetic analysis
      (del(5q)). The criteria for CMML diagnosis are 1) the presence of persistent peripheral blood
      monocytosis ≥1 x109/L, and 2) monocyte accounting for more than 10% of the white blood cell
      differential count. Evaluation of bone marrow cytomorphology will be performed prospectively
      by experienced hematopathologists who are blinded to the index test results.

      Patients with confirmed suspicion of MDS: Participants for whom the diagnosis of MDS (or
      CMML) is confirmed by the reference standard will be categorized as patients with confirmed
      suspicion of MDS.

      Patients with unconfirmed suspicion of MDS: Participants for whom the diagnosis of MDS (or
      CMML) is ruled out by the reference standard will be categorized as patients with unconfirmed
      suspicion of MDS. This latter subgroup will include patients with ICUS, as defined in
      accordance with published guidelines.

      Follow-up: No follow-up visit is planned in this cross-sectional diagnostic accuracy study.

    <description>Flow cytometry analysis of neutrophil myeloperoxidase expression in peripheral blood samples will be performed within 24 h of MDS diagnostic evaluation and blinded to the reference standard. Peripheral blood samples will be collected in 5 ml (EDTA) anticoagulant plastic tubes and processed within 24 h maximum of collection.
Blood sample will be stained according to the manufacturers' recommendations with a lyophilized cocktail (&quot;LyotubeTM ready-to-use&quot;, BD Bioscience).
At least 10,000 neutrophils will be acquired on a 3-laser, 8-color BD FACSCanto-II TM flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, San José, CA).
Each marker will be expressed as median, geometric and arithmetic mean, regular and robust coefficient of variation.</description>
