  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will compare the outcome of single visit retreatment and multi-visit retreatment
      in cases of failed root canal treated teeth.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Retreatment is defined as a procedure to remove root canal filling materials from the tooth,
      followed by cleaning, shaping and obturating the canals.Although initial root canal therapy
      has been shown to be a predictable procedure with a high degree of success, failures can
      occur after treatment. Recent publications have reported failure rates of 14%-16% for initial
      root canal treatment. In order to prevent tooth loss in such cases, nonsurgical retreatment
      or apical surgery is often indicated.

      In this study subjects will be assigned to either the single-visit and multi-visit
      nonsurgical endodontic retreatment. The allocation will be performed once the chemomechanical
      preparation is completed.

      Clinical and radiographic success rate will be considered as primary outcome. Follow up will
      be carried out every 3 months, till 12-month period.

      Pain intensity will be considered as secondary outcome.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient willingness to participate in the study.

          -  Previously root filled Permanent teeth with post-treatment apical periodontitis
             requiring nonsurgical root canal retreatment.

          -  Failure of previous root canal treatment will be determined based on clinical and
             radiographic findings. Clinical indicators of failure will include pain, tenderness to
             palpation/percussion, swelling, sinus tract.Radiographic criteria will include
             persistent periapical radiolucent lesions in teeth in which initial treatments were
             performed at least 4 years previously.

          -  Root canal fillings no more than 4mm short of the apex.

          -  Patients showing no significant systemic disease

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who are pregnant, diabetic, immunocompromised, serious medical illness or
             requiring antibiotic premedication.

          -  Patient under 18 years of age.

          -  Patient under corticosteroid use.

          -  Patients with history of antibiotic use in last 3 months or analgesic use in last one
             week will also be excluded.

          -  Multiple teeth that require treatment to eliminate the possibility of pain
             referral.Patients with unrestorable carious lesions, fractures involving the
             periodontium, and/or periodontal pockets â‰¥ 4mm deep or having marginal or furcal bone
             loss due to periodontitis .

          -  Teeth with the procedural errors preventing access to apical third and missed canals
             will be excluded.

          -  Teeth that are not suitable for rubber dam isolation.

          -  Teeth with intraradicular post.
