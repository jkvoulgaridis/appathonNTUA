  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the inter-arm and inter-period reproducibility of the dermal blood flow response
      induced by a skin prick of histamine, subjects will receive histamine (10 mg/ml) and negative
      control skin pricks on the volar surface of both forearms during two subsequent study visits
      to allow an intra-individual comparison. Changes in dermal blood flow will be measured during
      the hour after the skin pricks with laser Doppler and/or laser speckle contrast imaging.

          -  Subject is a white male ≥ 18 and ≤ 45 years of age at the time of screening

          -  Subject is a nonsmoker for at least 6 months prior to the study start

          -  Subject has a body mass index ≥ 18 and ≤ 30 kg/m2

          -  Subject has a clear increase in histamine-induced dermal blood flow

          -  Subject is judged to be in good health on the basis of medical history, physical
             examination and vital signs

          -  Subject understands the procedures and agrees to comply with them for the entire
             length of the study by giving written informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has excessive hair growth on the volar surface of the forearm

          -  Subject has a past or present history of diffuse dermatological conditions including
             eczema, scleroderma, psoriasis, urticaria, dermatographism and dermatitis

          -  Subject has any abnormality on the skin of the forearm, possibly interfering with the
             study assessments including tattoos, keloids, tumors, ulcers, burns, flaps and grafts

          -  Subject cannot avoid excessive tanning (any exposure to sunlight or a tanning bed
             which would cause a sunburn reaction) throughout the study and cannot cover the
             forearms 24 hours before and after each study visit

          -  Subject currently uses lotions, oils, depilatory preparations, makeup or other topical
             treatments on the arms and on a regular basis which cannot be discontinued for the
             duration of the study; subject has used any topical treatments within 7 days of the
             start of the study

          -  Subject has a history of severe allergic reactions to food or drugs or adverse
             experiences of a serious nature related to the administration of either a marketed or
             investigational drug, including histamine

          -  Subject currently uses any prescription or nonprescription drugs on a regular basis
             which cannot be discontinued for the duration of the study; subject has used any

             24 hours before the study visit;

          -  Subject has any of the following vital sign measurements at screening: heart rate ≤ 40
             or ≥ 100 beats/min, diastolic blood pressure ≤ 50 or ≥ 89 mmHg and/or systolic Blood
             Pressure ≤ 90 or ≥ 139 mmHg

          -  Subject has been involved in testing an investigational drug in another clinical study
             within the last 4 weeks or 5 half-lives

          -  Subject has evidence of a clinically significant active infection, fever of 38°C or
             above at the time of the study visits

          -  Subject has a history or current cardiovascular, respiratory, hepatic, renal,
             gastrointestinal or neurological disorders capable of significantly altering the
             absorption, metabolism or elimination of drugs
