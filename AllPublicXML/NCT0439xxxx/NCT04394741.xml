    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether application of Dry Needling (DN) is
      effective for reduced on Stiffness in Latent trigger point (LTrP) of upper trapezius. The
      secondary purposes are to determine the correlation on two elastography for stiffness measure
      (Shear-wave elastography and Strain elastography). Randomized controlled trial, in parallel
      with cross-control design. Two groups with LTrP in upper trapezius, and will be randomly
      selected to DN group or Sham-Dn group.

    <description>Shear-wave Elastography (SWE) as assessed using an Logiq S8 US system (GE Healthcare).
The stiffness was determined with measuring velocity of shear waves in trapezius muscle on SWE exam.
Strain elastography (SEL) as assessed using an Logiq S8 US system (GE Healthcare).
The stiffness was determined by applying light repetitive compression with the hand-held transducer</description>
