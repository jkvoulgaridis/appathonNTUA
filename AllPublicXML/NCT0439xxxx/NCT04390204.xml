  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Urinary incontinence is defined by the International Continence Society as &quot;any involuntary
      loss of urine complained by the patient&quot;. UI is a debilating condition affecting 25% to 45%
      of the female population. It is a recognized factor impairing the women's quality of life in
      women. Age, type and severity of UI as well as stress, fears and beliefs are variables that
      significantly affect the quality of life scores . Its costs are estimated at 2% of the health
      budget in European countries. Stress urinary incontinence (SUI) is characterized by a loss of
      urine that occurs with increased intra-abdominal pressure, such as coughing, laughing,
      sneezing, jumping, running, lifting loads or any other physical activity

      . SUI accounts for 50% of UI types. For HAS (Haute Autorité de Santé), the first-line
      treatment is a conservative, non-medicinal and non-surgical treatment. Hay Smith's 2010
      literature review concludes that pelvic floor muscle rehabilitation (PMP) must be the
      first-line treatment for SUI. However, there is a lack of evidence to define the best
      treatment regimen for PFM rehabilitation.

      For 25 years, we have been performing assessment and rehabilitation programs for urinary
      incontinence. We see daily, as literature suggests, a link between continence and postural
      control. Previous studies, such as that we carried out within our service, tend to confirm
      the positive impact of reflex postural control on continence. Our team has already shown the
      feasibility of such a program and its effectiveness on stress urinary incontinence. Foam
      surfaces are devices used in the rehabilitation of reflex postural control. Several studies
      have shown that rehabilitation programs on foam surfaces improve reflex postural control
      better than the same exercises on stable ground. Smith et al. have shown impaired motor
      control of MPP on foam surfaces in women with stress urinary incontinence. However, the
      effect of a rehabilitation program with foam surface on urinary symptoms has never been
      evaluated.

      For our main outcome, we propose to follow the recommendations of L. Rimstad in his recent
      prospective study of SUI assessment in 147 subjects aged 36 to 63 years, wich seems more in
      accordance with postural control disorder than the &quot;gold standard&quot; supine cough test wich has
      been found to have low sensitivity. The test pad on a trampoline allows to object a SUI in
      91% of the negative patients to the test pad on firm surface. It therefore makes it possible
      to object stress urinary incontinence without invasive urodynamic investigations. It
      therefore seems justified for the comfort of our patients and the relevance of our results.
      The preliminary assessments and the skills of the physiotherapist make it possible to assess
      the patient's ability to perform this test. Our experience of carrying out trampoline tests
      or exercises for 25 years, as of the Rimstad team in the context of the treatment of SUI for
      10 years, allows us to carry out this test in good conditions of efficiency , comfort and
      safety. Thus, we hypothesize that a rehabilitation program by supervised reflex postural
      control exercises on a foam surface can reduce the volume of urinary leakage in women. This
      study will also show the influence of such a program on symptoms and quality of life in women
      with urinary incontinence.

      Innovative nature of our study We do not find in the literature any evaluation of the
      effectiveness of exercises on foam surface on stress urinary incontinence Our protocol, by
      its minimally invasive nature, would promote a better emotional experience for our patients
      Most studies in the context of incontinence are based on a semi-objective outcome assessment
      with symptoms questionnaire. We suggest using the short stress pad test, a more objective
      test for women, recommended by several authors We will observe the impact of our protocol on
      pelvic and low back pain, quality of life and any restrictions on social participations We
      hope to confirm the best acceptance of non-invasive treatments, without intravaginal probe in
      continence rehabilitation

      Our protocol goes in the direction of:

        -  Literature reviews on urinary incontinence through supervised group sessions

        -  WHO's recommendations on the maintenance of balance and physical functions, and also the
           prevention of falls in adults
