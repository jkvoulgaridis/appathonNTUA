      Researchers are evaluating the safety of allogeneic Adipose Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells
      (AMSC) use during hemodialysis arteriovenous fistula and arterial bypass creation and its
      efficacy on improving access maturation and primary anastomotic patency.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient between 18 and 85 years old

          -  Patient currently planned for creation of an upper extremity AV fistula with suitable
             anatomy

          -  Ability to communicate meaningfully with investigative staff, competence to give
             written informed consent, and ability to comply with entire study procedures

          -  Life expectancy of at least 24 months

          -  If female, must be post-menopausal or not able to have children.
             Post-menopausal/non-child bearing status must be clearly documented in the medical
             record. If documentation of post-menopausal/non-child bearing status is not available
             then a pregnancy test must be performed.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Malignancy or treatment for malignancy within the previous 6 months

          -  Immunodeficiency including AIDS / HIV or Active autoimmune disease

          -  Documented hypercoagulable state or history of 2 or more DVTs or other spontaneous
             intravascular thrombotic events

          -  Treatment with any investigational drug/ device within 60 days prior to study entry or
             Any other condition which in the judgment of the investigator would preclude adequate
             evaluation of the safety and efficacy of AMSCs and the AVF

          -  History of failed organ transplant on immunosuppression.

          -  Subjects with known active infection (infection which is being treated)
