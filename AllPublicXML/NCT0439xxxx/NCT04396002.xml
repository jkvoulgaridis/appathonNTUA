  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mobility refers to a person's purposeful movement through the environment from one place to
      another and can be conceptualized as a continuum from bed bound (immobility) on one extreme
      to making excursions to distant locations on the other extreme. Primary open-angle glaucoma
      (POAG) is a chronic, progressive optic neuropathy that can lead to gradual loss of vision in
      the peripheral field and central vision. Older adults with POAG have an increased risk for
      motor vehicle collisions and falls. Moreover, existing studies suggest that patients with
      POAG exhibit more postural sway while standing as measured by a balance platform and also
      tend to walk more slowly than those who are normally sighted and free of ocular disease.
      While these disturbances likely influence mobility, there has been little research directly
      assessing the impact of POAG on mobility. This study will assess the impact of POAG on life
      space (one aspect of mobility) and will determine whether difficulties with life space are
      associated with difficulties experienced under conditions of dim lighting.

      Aim 1: To determine whether differences exist between people with healthy eyes and patients
      with POAG in seeing under dim illumination (Low Luminance Questionnaire) and to determine
      whether such differences are associated with life space.

      Aim 2: To determine whether differences exist between people with healthy eyes and patients
      with POAG in seeing under dim illumination (objective measures of visual function) and to
      determine whether such differences are associated with life space.

    <measure>Assessment of life space measured with the Life Space Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The Life Space Questionnaire is a 9-item questionnaire that assesses how much a person gets out and about and the spatial extent of the person's typical life space, i.e., what is the usual range of places in which the person engages in activities within the designated time frame. Patients are asked to respond either Yes or No.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Assessment of vision under low luminance conditions</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The Low Luminance Questionnaire is a 32-item questionnaire that assesses how participants see under dim illumination and how well they can perform different tasks (e.g. reading, driving). Patients are asked to select a response among different choices on a Likert scale that ranges from 1 to 5, 1 to 6, 1 to 7, or 1 to 8 depending on the question. A response of &quot;1&quot; indicates that the participant experiences no difficulty while increasingly higher numbers indicate increasing amounts of difficulty.</description>

    <measure>Differences in dark adaptation between controls and patients</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Once participants have adapted to a dark environment, they will be exposed to a bright flash of light. The time needed to recover their visual sensitivity will be measured (rod-intercept time).</description>

    <measure>Differences in visual sensitivity under dim illumination between controls and patients</measure>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Differences in Macular Pigment Optical Density between controls and patients</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will fixate on a target while their MPOD is assessed. The MPOD is measured using the Heidelberg optical coherence tomography (OCT) MPOD module. Two different light sources are directed to the back of the eye. The light is reflected back and the OCT/MPOD computes the difference in the reflectance of the two lights which is an estimate of the density of macular pigment.</description>
