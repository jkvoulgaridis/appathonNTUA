    <measure>To evaluate the efficacy and safety of a new artificial tear formulation in participants with signs and symptoms of DED compared with Systane Ultra MD</measure>
    <time_frame>90 Days</time_frame>
    <description>The change from baseline in total staining score at Day 90.The total staining score will be the sum of corneal and conjunctival staining score using modified NEI grading scale.
The modified NEI/Industry Workshop guidelines will be used for grading the scale of corneal and conjunctival damage. The cornea is divided into five sectors and each of which is scored on a scale of 0-5, with a maximal total corneal staining score of 25. The conjunctiva is divided into six sectors and each of which is scored on a scale of 0-5, with a maximal total conjunctival staining score of 30.</description>

    <time_frame>90 Days</time_frame>
    <description>A self-assessed 6-item visual analog scale (VAS) survey that assesses various symptoms of DED disease.

                  results

               -  Keratoconjunctivitis sicca secondary to the destruction of conjunctival goblet
                  cells, such as occurs with vitamin A deficiency or scarring such as that with
