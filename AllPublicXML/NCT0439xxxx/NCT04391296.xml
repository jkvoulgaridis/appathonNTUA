    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to prospectively compare and analyze the incidence of
      complications in patients undergoing postmastectomy radiation therapy after breast
      reconstruction with subpectoral and prepectoral placement of implant. Investigators
      hypothesized that immediate acellular dermal matrix-assisted implant-based breast
      reconstruction with prepectoral implant placement would result in lower risk of capsular
      contracture after postmastectomy radiation therapy(PMRT) compared with acellular dermal
      matrix(ADM)-assisted implant-based breast reconstruction with subpectoral implant placement.

      OUTLINE: This is a single center randomized clinical trial. Participant recruitment and
      enrollment will occur at Gangnam Severance Hospital Breast Cancer Center for 4 years,
      followed by one year of follow up data collection and analysis.

      Arm I (Prepectoral): immediate ADM-assisted implant-based breast reconstruction with
      prepectoral implant placement.

      Arm II (Subpectoral): immediate ADM-assisted implant-based breast reconstruction with
      subpectoral implant placement.

      This clinical study is aimed at patients who have been diagnosed with breast cancer and who
      have undergone a total mastectomy for the therapeutic indication, and who are planning to
      undergo implant based reconstruction and postmastectomy radiotherapy.

      It will be carried out prospectively in a single institution, and the study will be divided
      into two groups, subpectoral implant and prepectoral implant, according to the reconstruction
      method.

      A total of 96 patients or 48 patients per arm will be recruited. Randomization will be
      accomplished using randomly permuted blocks, and randomization will be stratified on the
      basis of reconstruction method. (tissue expander insertion or direct-to-implant)

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for 1 year for observation of
      capsular contracture and patient reported outcomes.

    <description>Arm I (Prepectoral)De-epithelialized skin flaps are made from the inferior pole of breast skin and soft tissue. The implant pocket is shaped by fixing a sufficiently large amount of ADM to the medial surface of the mastectomy pocket, the upper edge of the pectoralis major muscle and the de-epithelial skin flap. The implant is located in the prepectoral mastectomy pocket and the ADM anchored to the chest wall, serratus fascia, and de-epithelial skin flaps. The pectoralis major muscle is located in the anatomical location behind the ADM.
Arm II (Subpectoral)The pectoralis major muscle is dissected from the thorax to create sufficient space for the implant to be placed behind the pectoralis major muscle. Implant pockets are made by suturing the lower part of the elevated pectoralis major muscle to the top of the de-epithelial skin flap and the ADM patch to the skin flap, the pectoralis major muscle, and the lateral thoracic fascia.</description>
