      Primary Objective:

        -  To assess the safety profile of each SP0202 formulation and Prevnar 13 in toddlers and
           infants (after each and any injection).

        -  To assess the immune response (serotype specific IgG concentration) of the SP0202
           formulations and Prevnar 13 1 month after the administration of one dose in toddlers
           (Groups 1-4)

        -  To assess the immune response (serotype specific IgG concentration) of the SP0202
           formulations and Prevnar 13 1 month after the administration of 3 doses in infants
           (Groups 5-8)

        -  To assess the immune response (serotype specific IgG concentration) of the SP0202
           formulations and Prevnar 13 1 month after administration of a 4-dose schedule in infants
           (Groups 5-8)

      Secondary Objective:

        -  To assess the immune response (serotype specific OPA titer) of the SP0202 formulations
           and Prevnar 13 1 month after the administration of one dose in toddlers (Groups 1-4)

        -  To assess the immune response (serotype specific OPA titer) of the SP0202 formulations
           and Prevnar 13 1 month after the administration of 3 doses in a subset of infants
           (Groups 5-8)

        -  To assess the immune response (serotype specific OPA titer) of the SP0202 formulations
           and Prevnar 13 1 month after administration of a 4-dose schedule in a subset of infants
           (Groups 5-8)

        -  In toddlers: to describe the Ab responses against DTaP-IPV// Hib vaccine antigens before
           and 1 month following injection of DTaP-IPV// Hib vaccine

        -  In infants: to describe the Ab responses against antigens of the routine pediatric
           vaccines (DTaP-IPV// Hib vaccine, Rotavirus vaccine and hepatitis B vaccine, MMR
           vaccine, varicella vaccine) when administered concomitantly with either SP0202 or
           Prevnar 13 (at pre-Dose 1, at post-doses 3 and 4)

      For toddlers, the duration of each participant's participation in the study will be
      approximately 6 months for subjects enrolled in Groups 1, 2, 3, and 4.

      For infants, the duration of each participant's participation in the study will be
      approximately 16 to 19 months for subjects enrolled in Groups 5, 6, 7, and 8.

    <masking_description>The study will be performed in a modified double-blind fashion:
Investigators and study staff who conduct the safety assessment and the participant will not know which vaccine is administered
Only the study staff who prepare and administer the vaccine and are not involved with the safety evaluation will know which vaccine is administered This study will be observer-blinded between any SP0202 formulation and Prevnar 13 and double-blind across the 3 SP0202 formulations</masking_description>
