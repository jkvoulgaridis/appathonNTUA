  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is evidence of the interdependence between the diaphragm and the C4 vertebral level
      with regard to nerve, fascial and muscular connections. The purpose of this study is to
      evaluate the influence of cervical bilateral manipulation (C3/C4) on the thoracoabdominal
      kinematics in healthy young adults.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Due to respiration the thoracoabdominal kinematics is considered a complex mechanism that
      evolves the movement of the ribs and fascia, the diaphragmatic function, the respiratory
      muscles and the mechanical properties of the airways that includes a coordinated reflex
      neural activity. The phrenic nerve (C3 to C5) is responsable for the motor and sensory
      innervation of the diaphragm.

      The High Velocity Low Amplitude (HVLA) vertebral manipulation stimulates the corresponding
      spinal nerves. It is well known that when this manipulation is applied to cervical region
      induces vasomotor cutaneous and cardiorespiratory modifications in autonomic nervous system.

      The sample composed of healthy young adults (aged 18-40 years) will be assigned randomly in
      three groups: experimental group (bilateral C3/C4 HVLA manipulation), sham manipulation group
      (passive cervical mobilization) and control group (no intervention). The thoracoabdominal
      kinematics measures will be assessed at baseline, right after the intervention and five
      minutes after the second measure using the Qualisys Motion Capture System.

    <description>The Qualysis Motion Capture System will measure the variation of the tridimensional movement of the abdomen through the positioning of two reflectors that will be placed in standardized points: in the umbilicus and the spinal process of L3.

    <description>The investigator will apply an anterior and lateral translation associated with extension, homolateral inclination and contralateral rotation of the cervical. This procedure will increase the tension of the soft tissues to reduce the remaining slack and, finally, the thrust will be applied in pure rotation. Subsequently the head of the volunteer will be repositioned in the neutral position without applying any pressure and will wait 10 seconds in this position. Finally, the previous procedure will be repeated to the opposite side.</description>
