  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A total of 60 patients with atrial fibrillation were scheduled to receive left atrial
      appendage occlusion combined with radiofrequency ablation, which were divided into two
      groups. The operation was performed under the guidance of intracardiac echocardiography and
      transesophageal echocardiography respectively (allocation ratio 1:1). During the operation,
      the total amount of contrast medium injected, the fluoroscopy time and the time from femoral
      vein puncture to transseptal puncture to closure were recorded in all patients. All patients
      underwent transesophageal echocardiography before and 3 months after operation, and the
      results were explained by two experienced ultrasound doctors to measure the presence of left
      atrial thrombus, residual shunt and device-related thrombus. All patients were examined by
      transthoracic echocardiography 3 months after operation to evaluate new pericardial effusion,
      pericardial tamponade, instrument embolization / displacement and so on. The baseline
      clinical and surgical features and hospitalization outcomes of patients guided by ICE and TEE
      were recorded and compared. Clinical endpoints include death, new pericardial effusion that
      does not require pericardiocentesis, tamponade with pericardiocentesis, instrument embolism /
      displacement, bleeding at the entry site, thromboembolic events (stroke / transient ischemic
      attack [TIA]), and renal failure requiring dialysis. The purpose of this study was to
      evaluate the feasibility, safety and effectiveness of intracardiac echocardiographic
      (ICE)-guided and transesophageal echocardiographic (TEE)-guided left atrial appendage
      occlusion combined with radiofrequency ablation. And try to analyze whether intracardiac
      echocardiography can be used as an alternative to transesophageal echocardiography in
      transcatheter closure of left atrial appendage. The average follow-up time was 1 year.
