      The investigators asked the question if they can better estimate the middle ear status in OME
      that help them to decide between early intervention or longer follow up.

      Purpose: Otitis media with effusion is an important problem in childhood. After proper
      diagnosis, generally 3 months of follow up has been recommended before surgical tympanostomy
      tube insertion. If the physician can estimate the status of the middle ear or fluid type
      better with a non-invasive method, we can suggest an early operation to these patients or
      decide to follow up more with no intervention. The purpose of the study is to compare the
      surgically confirmed middle ear effusions with wideband absorbance values and to
      differentiate them noninvasively before the operation.

      Methods: A total of 123 children that were followed 3 months and treated surgically with the
      diagnosis of OME were included. Eighty-two sex, age-matched children were tested as control
      with wideband tympanometry. Ears were divided into four groups according to findings in the
      operation: serous, mucoid, adhesive, empty. Resonance frequency, 226 Hz, 1000 Hz compliance,
      Wideband Peak pressure, Absorbance measurements used for comparison.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All patients were diagnosed by ear examination, pneumatic otoscopy, and type B
             tympanogram with 226 Hz tympanometry. They were followed for 3 months with proper
             medication. After 3 months if there was no change with ear examination and 226 Hz
             tympanometry, surgical ventilation tube insertion was offered.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The patients with chronic ear diseases, ototoxic drug use, neurologic disease were
             excluded.
