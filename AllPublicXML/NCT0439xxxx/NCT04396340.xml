      Phase 1b, a study in high grade serous ovarian cancer and nonsmall cell lung cancer to
      evaluate the safety and clinical activity of the antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) XMT-1592.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This Phase 1b trial is an open-label, multi-center study of XMT-1592 administered as an
      intravenous infusion once every 3 weeks. The dose-escalation (DES) segment of the study will
      establish the expansion (EXP) dose and is intended to establish the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) or recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) for XMT-1592 in patients with high grade serous
      ovarian cancer (HGSOC) or non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), adenocarcinoma subtype. The EXP
      segment of the study will consist of 2 parallel cohorts of patients (HGSOC and NSCLC) to
      confirm the MTD or RP2D and estimate the objective response rate in each selected patient
      population. In DES, the observation period for dose-limiting toxicities is 21 days, between
      Day 1 through the end of Cycle 1 which includes the pre-dose assessments before receiving the
      Cycle 2 dose. All adverse events (AEs) will be graded according to NCI, CTCAE v5.0). In
      general, AEs ≥Grade 3 are dose-limiting toxicities with some modifications.
