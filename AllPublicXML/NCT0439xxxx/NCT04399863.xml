    <textblock>
      Feasibility study of a therapeutic education program for the patient and his carers, intended
      for children suffering from acute lymphoblastic leukemia or having received an allograft of
      hematopoietic stem cells in the pediatric hematology department of Robert Debré hospital (
      Paris, APHP). In addition to feasibility, the intermediate effectiveness of the program will
      be assessed.

      This is a pilot feasibility study, of the quasi-experimental before-after, non-randomized,
      mono-centric type. Feasibility is assessed on process criteria (adoption, reach
      implementation, satisfaction). Intermediate effectiveness is assessed on the skill level of
      patients and their caregivers, before, after and at a distance from education. Patients'
      anxiety levels will also be assessed before, after and at a distance from the program. The
      level of health literacy will be assessed at the start of the study.
