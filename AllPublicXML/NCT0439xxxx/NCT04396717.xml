  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pritumumab is a human IgG1 kappa antibody that binds to a malignant tumor associated antigen,
      ecto domain-vimentin (EDV) which is expressed in a variety of tumor cells. Pritumumab was
      shown to have relatively high reactivity with brain cancer cell lines, while no reactivity
      was demonstrated with normal neurons, astrocytes or fetal cerebral cells. Pritumumab has
      notable antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), brain tumor penetration and
      antitumor activity in nude mouse human xenograft models.

      Primary Objectives

      - To determine the safety and/or tolerability and the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of
      escalating, intravenously (IV) administered Pritumumab doses in patients with recurrent
      gliomas or with brain metastases.

      Secondary Objectives

        -  To determine pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of Pritumumab

        -  To identify preliminary signals of anti-tumor response to Pritumumab

        -  To explore disease-related, patient-reported outcomes

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, Phase 1, outpatient, dose escalation study of Pritumumab in patients
      with brain cancer who have failed prior therapy and have no other available options. In the
      first part of the study, escalating doses of Pritumumab of 1.6, 4.8, 8.0, 12.0, and 16.2
      mg/kg will be administered in a sequential, safety-driven manner to eligible patients
      according to standard 3+3 scheme, as an 1-hour IV infusion on Days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of each
      28-day treatment cycle. The dose levels may be modified upon obtained results. Once the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined, an expansion cohort including 6-12 patients in
      selected tumor type at a dose equal or below to MTD is planned to determine the recommended
      Phase 2 dose (RP2D). A total of 42 patients may be administered with Pritumumab in this
      study.

      Patients will be treated with Pritumumab for a maximum of 6 cycles or until cancer
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients will be followed after treatment completion
      every four months or until death or lost to follow-up. Standard clinical, laboratory and
      functional assessments will be employed to monitor for safety, tolerability and tumor
      response, including blood sampling for clinical biochemistries, pharmacokinetics, CSF and
      tissue samples, at frequency specified by the protocol. Patient-reported outcomes will also
      be assessed.
