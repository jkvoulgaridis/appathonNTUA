      Purpose: The purpose of this study is to determine if prostatic artery embolization (PAE) is
      as effective as medication (non-inferiority) in reducing urinary symptoms due to benign
      prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and to determine if PAE will result in less adverse events
      compared to medication in individual patients.

      Participants: Study subjects will be 30 men who have taken BPH medication for at least 6
      months and planning to undergo PAE. Subjects will be enrolled across 3 sites.

      Procedures (methods): This will be a single arm, non-blinded study of PAE using HydroPearl
      Beads. Subjects will be compared to themselves. The study will involve 6 study visits: an
      enrollment/baseline visit, the PAE procedure, and 1 day, 3 month, 6 month, and 12 month
      follow-up visits. Subjects will complete questionnaires and uroflowmetry testing at baseline
      and each follow-up visit. Subjects will also obtain an MRI at baseline and their 6 month
      follow-up visit.

      This will be a single arm, uncontrolled, non-blinded study of PAE using HydroPearl Beads in a
      small population of 30 subjects with benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) to investigate the
      effectiveness of prostatic artery embolization (PAE) relative to previous medication alone
      for reducing urinary symptoms due to BPH. Secondary aims will be to assess adverse effects of
      medication vs adverse events secondary to PAE as well as Quality of Life scores on medication
      vs after PAE.

    <description>The International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) is an 8 Likert questionnaire (7 symptom questions + 1 quality of life question) with scores ranging from 0 to 5, where 0 is less severe. IPSS is a written screening tool used to screen for, rapidly diagnose, track the symptoms of, and suggest management of the symptoms of the disease benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Total scores are determined to be Mild (1-7), Moderate (8-19), or Severe (20-35).</description>

    <description>The QoL question is a single question included with the IPSS related to the symptoms of the disease benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) from 0 to 6. Lower scores indicate a higher quality of life.</description>
