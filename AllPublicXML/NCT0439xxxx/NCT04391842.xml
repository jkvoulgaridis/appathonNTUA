    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to measure the effectiveness of Sustained Acoustic Medicine
      (SAM) treatment combined with diclofenac ultrasound coupling gel in patients with stage II
      and stage III knee osteoarthritis. The ability of the device to reduce pain, increase
      mobility, increase function of the affected leg, and improve quality of life in patients with
      knee osteoarthritis will be evaluated.

      This is a seven day study to clinically evaluate the effectiveness of the Sustained Acoustic
      Medicine (SAM) device combined with diclofenac on symptoms of patients suffering from knee
      osteoarthritis. The class-II device, samÂ® has been FDA-cleared for home use. On the first day
      of the study, baseline data will be collected as patients report pain score before treatment.
      During the following 6 days, patients will self-apply the wearable SAM device with diclofenac
      patch to their affected knee for 4 hours daily. Each day of the study, pain scores will be
      recorded immediately before application of SAM device as well as 30 minutes, 2-hours and
      4-hours after applying the device. A quality of life and function assessment will be
      performed prior to the patient beginning the protocol and at the conclusion of the protocol.

      Up to 32 subjects will be recruited from neighboring communities to the study sites. The
      study is designed to reach a target patient population which includes rural citizens and
      socioeconomic disadvantaged individuals.

    <description>WOMAC questionnaire will be utilized (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index). WOMAC was divided into 3 categories: pain, stiffness, function and total score. The pain category consists of five scores from 0-10, 0 is no pain 10 is worst pain possible for a range of 0 - 50 points. The stiffness category consists of two scores from 0-10, 0 is no stiffness 10 is worst stiffness possible for a range of 0 - 20 points. The function score consists of 17 scores from 0-10, 0 is normal function and 10 is severely limited function, for a range of 0 - 170 points. Categories were multiplied by 10 for analysis. Total score is the sum of pain, stiffness, and function scores (range of 0 - 2400)</description>
