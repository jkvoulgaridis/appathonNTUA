  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      After surgery on the lungs or esophagus, 12-46% of patients experience an irregular heart
      rhythm called atrial fibrillation. Although usually transient, post-operative atrial
      fibrillation is associated with longer stay in hospital, greater complications, and increased
      risk of death. Several medications have been shown to be effective at reducing the risk of
      atrial fibrillation after their surgery with the greatest effectiveness and safety
      demonstrated with amiodarone. Nevertheless, amiodarone has potential side effects, and so it
      is only recommended in patients with increased risk of developing atrial fibrillation. A tool
      has been developed and validated to identify high-risk patients but no clinical trial has
      looked at the effectiveness of administering amiodarone in this high-risk group. This study
      aims to assess the feasibility and safety of conducting a clinical trial where patients are
      randomized to receive amiodarone or placebo. This is critical before considering a full-scale
      trial to assess the effectiveness of amiodarone in reducing atrial fibrillation after surgery
      on the lungs or esophagus.
