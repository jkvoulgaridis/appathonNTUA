  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One fourth of colorectal neoplasias are missed during screening colonoscopiesâ€”these can
      develop into colorectal cancer (CRC). In the last couple of years, Artificial Intelligence
      Deep learning systems were introduced in the endoscopic setting to allow for real-time
      computer-aided detection/characterization (CAD) of polyps with high- accuracy. Few CADe
      (detection) and CADx (diagnosis, characterization) have been therefore proposed with this
      purpose. Because CAD systems are based on deep learning where the computer directly learns
      polyp recognition from supervised data without any human-control on the final algorithm,
      their outcome incorporates some unpredictability in the clinical setting that must be
      cautiously interpreted after its application. This means that the endoscopist may be
      presented with FP images that he would have never been selected in the first place as
      suspicion areas. These FPs may hamper the efficiency of CADe-colonoscopy. Additional time may
      be required to discriminate between an actual FP and a possible false negative result. An
      excess of FPs may reduce the motivation of the endoscopist for CADe, leading to its underuse
      in clinical practice. Although the indications of a CADe must always be interpreted by
      physician, FP may result in unnecessary polypectomy with related adverse events when used
      without appropriate training. Yet, there is a lack of information among quantity and quality
      of False Positive signals provided by the systems. From a post-hoc analysis of a Randomized
      Clinical Trial, in which we extracted and analysed a video library of CADe-colonoscopy (GI
      Genius) performed in our institution Humanitas Clinical and Research Hospital IRCCS we aimed
      that False positives by CADe are primarily due to artefacts from the bowel wall. Despite a
      high frequency, FPs from this CADe system resulted in a negligible 1% increase of the total
      withdrawal time as most of them were immediately discarded by the endoscopists.
