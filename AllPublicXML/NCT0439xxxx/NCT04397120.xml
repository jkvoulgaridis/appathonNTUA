  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the impact of multilevel factors on the quality of
      screening colonoscopy, reflected mainly by adenoma detection rate (ADR).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The subjects will include patients who need to screening colonoscopies by 21 endoscopists
      between January 2019 and December 2019 were retrospectively enrolled in this unit. Multilevel
      factors, including patient-, proceduralist-, and procedure-level characteristics were
      analyzed for the relationship with ADR.
