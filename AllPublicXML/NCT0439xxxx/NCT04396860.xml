  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II/III trial compares the usual treatment with radiation therapy and temozolomide
      to radiation therapy plus immunotherapy with ipilimumab and nivolumab in treating patients
      with newly diagnosed MGMT unmethylated glioblastoma. Radiation therapy uses high energy
      photons to kill tumor and shrink tumors. Chemotherapy drugs, such as temozolomide, work in
      different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping
      them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Immunotherapy with monoclonal
      antibodies, such as ipilimumab and nivolumab, may help the body's immune system attack the
      cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving
      radiation therapy with ipilimumab and nivolumab lengthen the time without brain tumor from
      returning or growing and extend patients life compared to usual treatment of radiation
      therapy and chemotherapy.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine if adding ipilimumab and nivolumab to radiotherapy significantly prolongs
      progression-free survival (PFS) versus adding temozolomide to radiotherapy in patients with
      newly diagnosed glioblastoma (GBM) without MGMT promoter methylation. (Phase II) II. To
      determine if adding ipilimumab and nivolumab to radiotherapy significantly prolongs overall
      survival (OS) versus adding temozolomide to radiotherapy in patients with newly diagnosed GBM
      without MGMT promoter methylation. (Phase III)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine if adding ipilimumab and nivolumab to radiotherapy significantly prolongs PFS
      versus adding temozolomide to radiotherapy in patients with newly diagnosed GBM without MGMT
      promoter methylation for the phase III part of the study.

      II. To determine if adding ipilimumab and nivolumab to radiotherapy significantly increases
      the 2-year overall survival (OS) rate versus adding temozolomide to radiotherapy in patients
      with newly diagnosed GBM without MGMT promoter methylation.

      III. To evaluate the safety of adding ipilimumab and nivolumab to radiotherapy via
      comparative frequency between arms of specific adverse events of interest and frequency
      summaries for all adverse event types.

      IV. To evaluate the effect of adding ipilimumab and nivolumab to radiotherapy versus adding
      temozolomide to radiotherapy on patient reported outcomes (PROs), as measured by the MD
      Anderson Symptom Inventory - Brain Tumor (MDASI-BT) in patients with newly diagnosed GBM
      without MGMT promoter methylation.

      V. To evaluate the effect of adding ipilimumab and nivolumab to radiotherapy versus adding
      temozolomide to radiotherapy on selected Patient Reported Outcomes-Common Terminology
      Criteria for Adverse Events (PRO-CTCAE) items in patients with newly diagnosed GBM without
      MGMT promoter methylation.

      VI. To evaluate the impact of adding ipilimumab and nivolumab to radiotherapy versus adding
      temozolomide to radiotherapy on neurocognitive function (NCF) in patients with newly
      diagnosed GBM without MGMT promoter methylation.

      VII. To explore whether detection of human telomerase gene (TERT) promoter mutations in
      peripheral blood plasma correlates with OS, PFS, and 2-year OS rate.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To explore biomarkers in pre-treatment archival tumor tissue that may predict efficacy of
      ipilimumab and nivolumab as measured by OS, PFS, and 2-year OS rate, such as but not limited
      to:

      Ia. PDL1 expression Ib. Mutational burden II. To explore (in the two treatment separately)
      whether the MGMT protein expression correlates with clinical outcomes including OS, PFS, and
      2-year OS rate.

      III. To evaluate if MGMT protein expression may be predictive of differential treatment
      effects between the two treatment arms.

      IV. To explore whether changes in peripheral blood immunologic profiles correlate with
      efficacy (as measured by OS, PFS, and 2-year OS rate) or toxicity.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM 1: Patients undergo radiation therapy over 30 fractions for 5 days per week
      (Monday-Friday) and receive temozolomide orally (PO) daily for 6 weeks. After radiation,
      patients may wear the Optune device at the discretion of the patient and their treating
      physician. Beginning 1 month after radiation therapy, patients receive temozolomide on days
      1-5. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 12 cycles at the discretion of the treating
      investigator in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM 2: Patients undergo radiation therapy over 30 fractions for 5 days per week
      (Monday-Friday) for 6 weeks. Starting on the first day of radiation, patients also receive
      ipilimumab intravenously (IV) over 90 minutes once every 4 weeks (Q4W) for 4 doses and
      nivolumab IV over 30 minutes every 2 weeks until disease progression.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for year 1, then
      every 4 months for year 2, and then every 6 months thereafter.

             therapy fields

          -  Pregnancy and nursing females due to the potential teratogenic effects and potential
             risk for adverse events in nursing infants

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to ipilimumab, nivolumab, or temozolomide

          -  On any dose of any systemically administered (oral, rectal, intravenous)
             corticosteroid within 3 days prior to step 2 registration. Inhaled, topical, and
             ocular corticosteroids are allowed without limitation but must be recorded. Note that
             treatment with systemically administered corticosteroid after initiating study
             treatment is allowed as needed

          -  Patients with known immune impairment who may be unable to respond to anti-CTLA 4
             antibody

          -  History of interstitial lung disease including but not limited to sarcoidosis or
             pneumonitis

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, defined as New York Heart Association
             functional classification III/IV (Note: Patients with known history or current
             symptoms of cardiac disease, or history of treatment with cardiotoxic agents, should
             have a clinical risk assessment of cardiac function using the New York Heart
             Association functional classification), unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia,
             or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study
             requirements

          -  Known history of testing positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or known
             acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)

          -  Patients with active autoimmune disease or history of autoimmune disease that might
             recur, which may affect vital organ function or require immune suppressive treatment
             including systemic corticosteroids, are excluded. These include but are not limited
             to: patients with a history of immune-related neurologic disease, central nervous
             system (CNS) or motor neuropathy, multiple sclerosis, autoimmune (demyelinating)
             neuropathy, Guillain-Barre syndrome, myasthenia gravis; systemic autoimmune disease
             such as autoimmune vasculitis [e.g., Wegener's Granulomatosis]), systemic lupus
             erythematosus (SLE), connective tissue diseases (e.g., systemic progressive
             sclerosis), scleroderma, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), Crohn's, ulcerative
             colitis, hepatitis; and patients with a history of toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN),
             Stevens-Johnson syndrome, or phospholipid syndrome, Hashimoto's thyroiditis,
             autoimmune hepatitis are excluded because of the risk of recurrence or exacerbation of
             disease

               -  Exceptions: patients with a history of the following conditions are not excluded:

                    -  Vitiligo

                         -  Anti-thyroid antibodies should be evaluated for the presence of target
                            organ involvement and potential need for systemic treatment but should
                            otherwise be eligible

          -  Patients who have evidence of active or acute diverticulitis, intra-abdominal abscess,
