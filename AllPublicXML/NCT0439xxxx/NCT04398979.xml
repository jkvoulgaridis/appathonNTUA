    <textblock>
      Minimally invasive approaches for surgical treatment have been advocated as a treatment
      option for stand-alone atrial fibrillation (AF). This study will investigate the clinical
      outcomes after minimally invasive surgical ablation of both paroxysmal and
      persistent/longstanding persistent AF.

    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation (AF) patients with a previous stroke are often at a high risk of
      recurrent stroke and bleeding. Minimally invasive approaches for surgical treatment have been
      advocated as a treatment option for stand-alone AF. This study will investigate the clinical
      outcomes after minimally invasive surgical ablation of both paroxysmal and
      persistent/longstanding persistent AF. Neurological safety will be assessed by cerebral
      magnetic resonance, neuropsychological examination and periprocedural transcranial Doppler
      measurement.

    <description>After blunt dissection of the oblique and transverse sinus, an AtriCure Lumitip Dissector was introduced around the pulmonary veins. Pulmonary vein isolation was achieved with an AtriCure Isolator Synergy ablation clamp around the pulmonary vein antrum at least six times for each side. Ganglionated plexus identification and ablation were performed using an AtriCure Synergy ablation pen. The additional superior and inferior ablation lines connecting the bilateral pulmonary vein isolations were created by applying the AtriCure Synergy ablation pen. Following completion of the ablation on the right side, ablation on the left side was accomplished in a similar manner. The ligament of Marshall was dissected by electrical cautery. Conduction block was confirmed upon completion of the ablation procedure on the left side.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients age &gt; 18 years

          -  Patients with paroxysmal, or persistent/long-standing persistent AF according to the
             standard EHRA definition.

          -  Patients with symptomatic AF that is refractory to at least one antiarrhythmic
             medication.

          -  Absence of significant structural heart disease (dilated cardiomyopathy, hypertrophic
             cardiomyopathy, valvular heart disease, untreated coronary artery disease)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  AF secondary to a reversible cause (i.e., thyreopathy, etc.) Indication for open-heart
             surgery (coronary artery bypass grafting, valve surgery, etc.)

          -  Severe left ventricle dysfunction that is clearly caused by some other cardiac disease
             (dilated cardiomyopathy, ischaemic heart disease, etc.) where the AF is clearly of
             secondary etiology

          -  Known severe pericardial and pleural adhesions (e.g., history of cardiac surgery)
