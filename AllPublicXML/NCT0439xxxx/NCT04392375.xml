    <textblock>
      This is a randomized double blind placebo controlled trial comparing Nifedipine 30mg XL to
      placebo in 110 patients after decision has been made to proceed with induction of labor for
      the diagnosis of preeclampsia with severe features.

    <description>Nifedipine XL is a long-acting medication used to lower blood pressure. The investigators want to learn whether women who receive the study drug will experience fewer severe-range blood pressure readings, and therefore need fewer intravenous (IV) medications to safely lower blood pressure.</description>

             Nifedipine is contraindicated, such as galactose intolerance, severe gastrointestinal
             (GI) structure, and GI hypomotility disorder.

          -  Currently receiving Nifedipine XL as part of hypertension management prior to
             induction of labor

          -  Participation in another trial that affects the primary outcome without prior approval

          -  Physician/provider or patient refusal
