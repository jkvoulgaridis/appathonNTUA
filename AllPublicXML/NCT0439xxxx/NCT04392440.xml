  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Older patients ≥65 years with chronic kidney disease (CKD) face challenges in decision making
      about dialysis. These patients report little effort by physicians to elicit treatment
      preferences, discuss prognoses, or explain the burdens/benefits of dialysis options including
      conservative management. Older patients with CKD often prefer maintaining the quality of life
      over prolonging life, and many regret their decision to start dialysis: nearly one quarter
      withdraw from dialysis each year. Shared dialysis decision-making requires active engagement
      between nephrologists and patients to align patient, caregiver, and physician communication
      around common goals. The proposed study is a pilot randomized cluster trial of a dialysis
      shared decision-making (DIAL-SDM) intervention for nephrologists (n=20) and their patients
      ≥65 years old (n=60) with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of ≤ 20 ml/min/
      /1.73 m2. Nephrologists in the Intervention Group will receive 3 communication training
      sessions, delivered by a standardized patient instructor (SPI) who enact clinical scenarios
      and offer feedback. In parallel, patients (and caregivers, if available) will receive 2
      coaching sessions provided by health coaches, who will explore each patient's relevant
      contextual information (values, preferences, and goals), and help them identify and practice
      important questions for their nephrologist. Nephrologists in the Control Group will provide
      their patients with usual care. The study outcomes will be assessed during two nephrology
      office visits and at 6 months.

    <description>This outcome will be measure in 30 patients in the Intervention Group by the following measure.
Feasibility of the Intervention Measure is a 4-item scale that measures the extent to which a new treatment, or an innovation, can be successfully used or carried out within a given agency or setting. Higher scores indicate greater feasibility. The score ranges from 0-20.</description>

    <description>This outcome will be measure in 30 patients in the Intervention Group by the following measures respectively.
Acceptability of the Intervention Measure is a 4-item scale that measures the perception among implementation stakeholders that a given treatment, service, practice, or innovation is agreeable, palatable, or satisfactory. Higher scores indicate greater acceptability. The score ranges from 0-20.</description>

    <measure>fidelity of DIAL-SDM intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>This outcome will be measured by looking at the fidelity in which the interventionists complete the intervention checklist after each visit for 30 patients in the Intervention Group.
It will be reported as the number of checklists that are at least 90% complete.</description>
