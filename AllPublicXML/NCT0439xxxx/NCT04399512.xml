  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It has been found that there is an association between prevalence of odontogenic infection
      and systemic diseases.Cirrhosis has also been associated with poor oral health
      status.Treating those patients accordingly can help in reducing the source of infection to
      some extent and may be associated with reduction in mortality.

      Patients will be selected according to inclusion and exclusion criteria.Written informed
      consent will be taken from each participant after being informed about study .There will be
      two groups1) cirrhosis patients 2)normal healthy patients.Prevalence of apical periodontitis
      will be measured in both groups by intraoral examination,digital panoramic radiography.. MELD
      score will be recorded in cirrhosis patients at this stage.Non surgical root canal treatment
      will be performed in teeth with apical periodontitis. Periapical healing will be checked with
      the help of PAI Score given by Orstavik. In Cirrhosis patients MELD Score will be measured
      before and after treatment.

        Inclusion Criteria:(cirrhosis patients)

          1. Known patient of cirrhosis(Diagnosis of cirrhosis is based on blood testing, medical
             imaging, and liver biopsy.) with mature permanent teeth .

          2. Age35-55 years

          3. &gt; or equal to 8 natural teeth(excluding 3rd molars);

          4. I.N.R &lt; 3.5

             -

        Exclusion Criteria:(Cirrhosis patients)

          1. Patient having systemic disorders other than hepatic disease(e.g. HIV,
             osteoporosis,diabetes,cardiovascular disease)

          2. Pregnancy

          3. Use of systemic and topical antibiotic treatment within 3 months prior to the start of
             the study.

        The eligibility criteria of the control group were the same for the cirrhosis group, except
        for the presence of liver disease. Cirrhosis patients were matched with controls according
        to sex, age (± 3 years old) and current smoking status and alcohol satus (yes/no).
