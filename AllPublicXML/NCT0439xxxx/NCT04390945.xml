  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      China is a country with a large incidence of esophageal cancer. The prevalence and mortality
      rate of esophageal cancer in China ranks fifth in the world. However, due to China's huge
      population base, new patients with esophageal cancer and deaths account for about 55% of the
      world. This study aimed to explore the efficacy and safety of Camrelizumab combined with
      concurrent radiotherapy and chemotherapy in the first-line treatment of patients with local
      recurrence after esophageal cancer surgery.
