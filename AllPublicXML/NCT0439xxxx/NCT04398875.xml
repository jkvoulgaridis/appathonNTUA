    <textblock>
      The proposed study aims to evaluate the adjunctive effect of MA with standard care (ASC) for
      relieving cancer-related symptoms in a collaborative model of palliative care compared to
      sham MA plus standard care (SSC) or standard care alone (SC).

      After being informed about the study plan, potential risk and benefits, all subjects will
      give written informed consent prior to participation and undergo eligibility screening.
      Eligible participants will be randomized into three arms, ASC, SSC, and SC, in a 2:1:1 ratio.
