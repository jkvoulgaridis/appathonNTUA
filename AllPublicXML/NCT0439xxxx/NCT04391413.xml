  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The DOCTORS-LM study will investigate the impact of using optical coherence tomography (OCT)
      to guide the procedure in angioplasty of lesions of the left main stem responsible for
      myocardial ischemia.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Angiographic evaluation of lesions of the left main stem presents particular challenges and
      high procedural complexity. The clinical sequelae of a suboptimal result in this context may
      be severe, and thus, it is recommended that patients with left-main lesions be considered for
      imaging-guided interventions by means of optimal coherence tomography (OCT) in non-ostial
      left main lesions. The investigators have previously demonstrated in a randomized trial of
      patients undergoing PCI for a lesion responsible for non ST elevation acute coronary
      syndromes that OCT provides useful clinical information beyond that obtained by angiography
      alone, and OCT-guidance for angioplasty in these patients yielded a significantly higher
      proportion of patients with an optimal functional result after stenting. In this context, the
      aim of the present study is to evaluate whether OCT-guided left-main angioplasty is superior
      to left main angioplasty guided by fluoroscopy alone, as assessed by fractional flow reserve
      (FFR) measured after stent implantation. Eligible patients must be aged 18 years and over,
      admitted for acute coronary syndrome (ACS) or stable coronary artery disease (CAD); AND
      present an angiographically significant non-ostial lesion of the left main stem requiring
      angioplasty with drug eluting stent implantation.

    <description>OCT will be performed after initial coronary angiography and at the end of the procedure. Several OCT runs can be performed. The operator may change procedural strategy, and use additional interventions. The operator must evaluate the following parameters, based on OCT data:
Before angioplasty: reference diameter and reference area of distal main vessel; lesion length; presence and extent of thrombus or calcification.
Stent implantation: Stent should be sized according to distal reference diameter, and should allow for expansion to the reference diameter of the proximal main vessel.
After stent implantation: minimal and reference lumen diameter, minimal and reference lumen area, minimal stent area, presence of thrombus, presence of edge dissection, tissue protrusion, optimal lesion coverage, malapposition, suboptimal stent deployment.</description>

    <description>Angioplasty will be guided by traditional fluoroscopy alone, performed before and after stent implantation. The recommendation for angioplasty of left main stenosis is to use main vessel (MV) stenting with a proximal optimisation technique (POT) and provisional side branch (SB) stenting as a preferred approach. Predilatation of the side branch (SB) may be considered, but is recommended in the following circumstances: extensive ostial SB involvement, heavy calcification, etc. even with a provisional SB stenting approach.</description>
