    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to describe treatment outcomes of abobotulinumtoxinA (aboBoNT-A) and
      onabotulinumtoxinA (onaBoNT-A) treatments, after one injection of either treatment, in
      toxin-naïve adult patients with upper and/or lower limb spasticity at a single National
      Health Service (NHS) centre in the United Kingdom (UK).

        All adult subjects with Upper Limb Spasticity and/or Lower Limb Spasticity complying with
        all inclusion and exclusion criteria during the study enrolment period will be included in
        this study. This study is retrospective and non-interventional, and as such, subjects will
        have been treated in accordance with usual medical practice during the study period. No
        additional assessments or tests will be required.

        Inclusion Criteria :

          -  Patient diagnosed with spasticity related to any cause except cerebral palsy.

          -  Patient initiated on treatment with either onaBoNT-A or aboBoNT-A during the study
             enrolment periods.

          -  Patient is an adult aged ≥18 years old at the time of the first BoNT-A injection for
             spasticity

          -  Patient has not received treatment with any type of BoNT-A 6 months prior to
             initiation of onaBoNT-A or aboBoNT-A. For patients with multiple courses of BoNT-A,
             separated by a gap of 6 months, only the first course will be evaluated in this study.

          -  Patient is being treated at Haywood Hospital at index date and during follow-up for up
             to 24 weeks post-index date, with medical records available for review.

        Exclusion Criteria :

          -  Patient is participating in an interventional clinical trial of an investigational
             medicinal product for the treatment of spasticity at index date and/or during
             follow-up.
