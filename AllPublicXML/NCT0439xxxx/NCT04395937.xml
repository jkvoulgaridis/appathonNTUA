  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The effects of regular exercise on asthma control has not yet been well demonstrated.

      The aim of this study is to investigate the impact of submaximal physical exercise on quality
      of life, on symptomatic control, and on bronchial and systemic inflammatory markers in
      patients with persistant asthma.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      While it is well known that intense physical exercise can generate bronchospasm and limit
      exercise performance, it recently appeared that regular physical exercise practiced
      aerobically could improve the clinical status of asthmatic patients.

      The investigators are planning a 12-week randomized controlled study to assess the effect of
      regular aerobic exercise on quality of life, asthma control, bronchial hyperresponsiveness
      and bronchial and systemic inflammation in patients with persistent asthma

      The hypothesis is that regular physical exercise increases control and quality of life and
      reduces inflammation and bronchial hyperresponsiveness compared to simple physiotherapy
      sessions.

    <measure>Hospital Anxiety and depression scale (HAD)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The questionnaire comprises seven questions for anxiety and seven questions for depression For each item, 4 response modes coded from 0 to 3. The anxiety and depression items are alternating. In addition, an alteration in the order of the ratings was carried out to avoid biases linked to their repetition.
An overall score is calculated by adding the 14 items but also 2 subtotals corresponding to the 2 subscales. The higher the scores, the higher the symptomatology.
From 0 to 7 : absence of anxiety disorders and depressive disorders From 8 to 10 : anxiety and depressive disorders suspected From 11 to 21 : severe anxiety and depressive disorders</description>
