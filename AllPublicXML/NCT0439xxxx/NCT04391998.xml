      Women included between 18 and 45 years old, pregnant during their second or third trimester
      of pregnancy (calculated by a sure menstrual date and confirmed by a 1st trimesteric
      ultrasound) with hemoglobin level below 10.5 mg /dL.

      All patients in the study were subjected to:

        1. Detailed history was recorded. A proper history concerning age, sex, residence,
           socioeconomic status, onset, progression, and previous treatment of anemia was taken.
           Participants' socio-demographic characteristics including gravida and parity were
           documented, level of education, occupation, Diet, and information useful to determine
           the socioeconomic level was recorded. Information on previous pregnancies and children
           and history of chronic diseases were also recorded.

        2. General examination; patients were clinically examined and gestational age (assessed by
           measuring the fundal height), weight was calculated for each participant.

        3. Diagnosis of anemia by Complete blood count (CBC), Hb level and measuring hematocrit
           concentration.

        4. Diagnosis of parasitic infection by stool analysis using suitable techniques.

        5. Imaging including obstetric ultrasound (U/S) to assess fetal development.

        6. Women with helminthic infections will be divided into groups

      Group (A): received iron + antiparasitic treatment as follows:

        -  Patients who have STH received alzental 200mg tab 2 tabs single oral dose.

        -  Patients who have Entamoeba or Giardia received flagyl 500mg tab twice daily for 5 days.

        -  (B): received iron only.
