    <measure>Changes of BMI</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Changes of weight in kilograms was assessed before and after the intervention.
Changes of height in meters was assessed before and after the intervention.
Weight and height were combined to report BMI in kg/m^2.</description>

    <measure>Changes of Insulin Resistance (IR)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Changes of fasting serum glucose in mmol/L was assessed before and after the intervention.
Changes of fasting insulin in μIU/mL was assessed before and after the intervention.
Fasting insulin and fasting glucose were combined to report IR using the following equation: homeostasis model assessment (HOMA)-IR=[fasting insulin (μIU/mL)×fasting glucose (mmol/L)] /22.5.</description>

    <measure>Changes of lipid profiles</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Triglyceride in mg/dL was assessed before and after the intervention.
Total-cholesterol in mg/dL was assessed before and after the intervention.
HDL-cholesterol in mg/dL was assessed before and after the intervention.
LDL-cholesterol was indirectly estimated using the friedewald formula: LDL-cholesterol= total-cholesterol-[HDL-cholesterol+(triglycerides/5)].</description>
