  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pregnancy is a physiological event that lasts for an average of 280 days or 40 weeks,
      starting with the embryo formed by the combination of ovum and sperm ready for fertilization.
      Many anatomical, physiological, social and psychological changes occur in the mother's body
      during pregnancy. In order to better adapt to these changes and to minimize problems during
      pregnancy, it is very beneficial for pregnants who do not have medical or obstetric risk to
      increase their physical activity level and exercise. Training programs created in light of
      the physical activity guidelines prepared specifically for the gestation period during
      pregnancy should be followed.

      For this purpose, pregnant programs have been organized routinely as a group exercise two
      days a week in Hacettepe University, Physical Therapy and Rehabilitation Faculty, Women's &amp;
      Men's Health Unit since 1990. The scope of this exercise program includes posture and body
      mechanics training, strengthening the lower and upper extremities, strengthening the
      abdominal and back muscles, pelvic floor exercises and breathing exercises. In one training
      session, 20 different exercises are performed and one session lasts about 60 minutes. For
      pregnant women with time limitations, sessions with less exercise and lasting about 30
      minutes are held. Trainings are started in the 16th week of pregnancy and terminated in the
      32nd week. Pregnant women who cannot participate in this group exercise program for personal
      reasons are given recommendations as home programs.

      In the literature; There is no specific guide on the type of exercise, intensity, and
      frequency of the exercise that can affect the thickness of the trunk stabilizer muscles
      during pregnancy, improve functionality and quality of life. With this study, it is planned
      to investigate the effects of the exercise protocol applied on the thickness, functionality
      and quality of life of the body stabilizer muscles in pregnant women who routinely
      participate in the short or long group exercise program, which starts from the 16th week of
      pregnancy until the 32nd week of the week. In addition, the pregnant women, who could not
      participate in the short or long group exercise program and started their home program until
      the 32nd week of pregnancy and made their routine follow-ups, will be evaluated in the 16th
      and 32nd weeks of pregnancy.

      At the end of this study; The change between body stabilizer muscle thickness, functionality
      and quality of life will be examined in three different groups, which continue routine short
      or long pregnant exercises and who can not participate in group exercise and follow up with
      the home program. In addition, data on trunk stabilizer muscle thickness, functionality and
      quality of life obtained from these three different groups will be compared. Thus, the
      literature will provide evidence of effective exercise protocols on trunk stabilizer muscle
      thickness, functionality and quality of life.

    <description>During the ultrasonography evaluation for the fetal development of the pregnant woman who came for routine obstetric examination, the pregnant women were lying in a supine position; Using 5-12 MHz linear probe (Logiq P5, General Electrics, Wisconsin, USA), rectus abdominis (at the level of umbilicus), transversus abdominis, external oblique and internal oblique (from the abdominal lateral) muscles will be bilaterally during axial imaging. Diaphragm thickness measurements will likewise be carried out through the mid-axillary line through the 7th intercostal space.</description>

    <description>Oswestry Disability Index will be used to evaluate the degree of loss of functionality in low back pain. Its validity and reliability in Turkish was determined in 2004 and consists of 10 items. The items question the severity of pain, self-care, lifting-carrying, walking, sitting, standing, sleep, the degree of pain change, travel and social life. When the total score is calculated, it is multiplied by two and said as a percentage. The maximum score is &quot;100&quot; and the minimum score is &quot;0&quot;. As the total score increases, the level of disability increases.</description>

    <description>SF-36 will be used to determine the perceived quality of life in physical and mental health areas. SF-36 includes 36 questions and evaluation of eight health areas. These; physical functionality, physical role limitation, physical pain, general health, vitality, social functionality, emotional role restrictions and mental health. Scores from these subscales range from 0-100. &quot;0&quot; indicates poor health, &quot;100&quot; indicates goodness</description>
