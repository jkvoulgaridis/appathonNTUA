    <textblock>
      &quot;La Casa nel Parco&quot; (CANP) Project is a European Union and Regione Piemonte funded
      multidisciplinary project aimed to explore innovative technology application in older subject
      care. In this context, FARMA-CANP is a randomized open-label clinical trial evaluating a
      multidisciplinary intervention in older patients hospitalized at home. The intervention
      involves physicians, pharmacists, nurses and includes a Clinical Decision Support System to
      help the processes of therapeutic review and reconciliation, and an end-user App to support
      patients and/or caregivers in the daily management of drug therapy.

      The main objectives of the study are to evaluate the impact of the intervention on 1)
      medication adherence after discharge 2) medication appropriateness.

    <time_frame>1, 3 and 6 months after Hospital at Home discharge</time_frame>

    <description>Medication review and reconciliation will be performed by geriatricians according to Good Clinical Practice and usual habits, that might also include digital and printed supports for medication appropriateness and drug interaction. Drug therapy will be listed and explained to the patient/caregiver at discharge. Patients/caregivers will be allowed to use any tools to support medication adherence, according to their habits and preferences (i.e. calendars, alarms, pill boxes).</description>

    <description>Geriatricians will introduce medication review data on a Clinical Decision Support System, that will help both pharmacists and physicians in medication reconciliation, highligting potentially inappropriate prescriptions according to Beers' criteria and STOPP/START criteria, and potential controindicated and major Drug-Drug Interactions according to Micromedex. Before Hospital at Home discharge, nurses will instruct patients and/or caregivers to the use of an App, where daily drug therapy at discharge will be inserted and scheduled. This App will automatically create an alert everytime a drug dose needs to be taken, alongside an image of the specific drug packaging. The App will register if and when the patient actually takes the drug, or the reason for the delayed/missed dose.</description>
