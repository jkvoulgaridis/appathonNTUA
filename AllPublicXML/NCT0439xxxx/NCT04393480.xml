      Comparison of Upper Extremity Robotic Rehabilitation Efficiency with Conventional
      Rehabilitation in Patients with Hemiplegia after Cerebrovascular Event

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this single-blind randomized prospective study is to find out whether including
      robotic therapy in addition to conventional rehabilitation program has an effect on quality
      of life, motor function and activities of daily living of the hemiplegic patients. Hemiplegic
      patients diagnosed by anamnesis, physical examination and radiological analysis, which have
      been referred to the outpatient clinic of Ege University Faculty of Medicine Department of
      Physical Therapy and Rehabilitation between April 2016 and April 2019 have been taken to the
      study. The demographic and clinical data of the patients were recorded and they were
      randomized into 2 groups. 17 patients assigned to the robotic rehabilitation group (Study
      group) receiving robot-assisted rehabilitation in addition to conventional treatment and 20
      assigned to the conventional rehabilitation group (control group) receiving only conventional
      therapy completed the study. Robotic-based rehabilitation given additionally was arranged to
      be 30-45 minutes, 5 days per week for 4 weeks. All patients were assessed at the beginning of
      therapy and at the end of 4th week with Brunnstrom stages of motor recovery, Fugl Meyer
      Assessment (FMA), hand grip strength, Purdue peg test, Minnesota manual dexterity test,
      Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS) , Functional Independance Measure (FIM), Stroke Specific
      Quality of Life Scale (SS-QOL), Nottingham Extended Activities of Daily Living (NEADL) Scale,
      Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale
      (CES- D). In the study, improvements in motor function scores, spasticity, general
      functioning, activities of daily living, cognitive assessment scale are better in robotic
      group when compared with control group but this difference was not statistically significant
      (p&gt;0,05). The investigators have found statistically significant improvement in CES-
      Depression scale in robotic group compared with control group (p=0,018). Significantly
      improved motor function gains are observed before and after the treatment in both groups
      being better in the robotic group however no significant differences were observed between
      the groups after the treatment. Robotic rehabilitation provides a favorable alternative
      bringing slight benefits, and also advantageous in terms of work power and psychological
      recovery so robotic rehabilitation addition to conventional neurological rehabilitation is
      effective and useful in patient management after stroke or cerebrovascular events.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline hand functions (Minnesota manuel dexterity test) at 4th week.</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Manual Dexterity Test is a widely used test which measures the capacity for simple but rapid eye-hand-finger movement. This test includes two parts. The 'placing test' requires the patients to place 58 discs with a diameter of 3.5 cm in the spaces of another set of the same dimensions .The length of the sets requires a wide range of shoulder movements.The 'hand turning test' requires the patient to remove the discs from one set and place them in another, or to reinsert them by removing and turning them. This test was performed for the affected (hemiplegic side) upper limb of the patient (right or left) and the result was recorded in 'seconds'. Short periods show that the result is better.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline hand functions (Purdue peg board) at 4th week.</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Purdue Pegboard Test is a neuropsychological test of manual dexterity and bimanual coordination. The test involves two different abilities: gross movements of arms, hands, and fingers, and fine motor extremity. This test consists of a board with holes and pins that can be placed on them , also washers and nuts that can be attached to the pins. The patient is asked to insert as many pins as possible into the holes in 30 seconds in a straight row using his right hand.The same is then repeated for the left hand. Finally, by giving 1 minute time, it is passed to the stage where the patient inserts pins, nuts and washers by using two hands.The total score of these 3 stages gives the test score. The higher scores in this test shows better results.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline spasticity (Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS)) at 4th week.</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Modified Ashworth Scale is the most universally accepted clinical tool used to measure the increase of muscle tone. This scale is a numerical scale that grades spasticity from 0-4, with 0 being no resistance and 4 being a limb rigid in flexion or extension. The greater scores show increased spasticity and worse results.</description>
