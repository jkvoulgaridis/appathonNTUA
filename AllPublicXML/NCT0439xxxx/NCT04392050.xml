      This study investigates the facilitators and barriers to colorectal cancer screening in
      underserved populations with a focus on African American, Latinx, and Asian (Chinese) in the
      Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center catchment area. Learning what encourages people and what keeps
      people from getting colorectal cancer screening may help researchers develop an educational
      tool for colorectal cancer screening that addresses colorectal cancer knowledge, beliefs, and
      cultural factors in underserved populations.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Develop a culturally tailored colorectal cancer education intervention for underserved and
      under-represented populations with a focus on African American, Latinx, and Asian (Chinese)
      in the Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center catchment area.

      OUTLINE:

      KEY CONTACT INTERVIEWS: Participants participate an interviews over 60 minutes focusing on
      identifying facilitators and barriers to colorectal cancer screening, essential cultural
      factors to include in the educational intervention, and insights into the best use of the
      National Cancer Institute (NCI)'s Screen to Save materials.

      FOCUS GROUPS: Participants attend focus groups over 60-90 minutes to examine and define
      further facilitators and barriers to colorectal cancer, cancer knowledge and beliefs,
      essential cultural factors to include in the educational intervention, insights into the best
      use of the NCI's Screen to Save materials, and identification of factors to consider for
      dissemination and sustainability.

      After completion of study, participants are followed up for up to 12 weeks.
