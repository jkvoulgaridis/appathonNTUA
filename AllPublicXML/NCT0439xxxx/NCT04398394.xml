  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Retinal diseases are the major cause of blindness in industrialized countries and while
      tremendous effort is made to develop novel therapeutic strategies to rescue retinal cells,
      optimal means to evaluate the effects of such treatments is still missing. Nowadays, diseases
      diagnosis and treatment monitoring are performed thanks to imaging devices and functional
      measurements (visual acuity of visual field tests). These eye examinations lead to the
      detection of large scale damages of the retinal tissue, i.e. the diagnosis is made too late
      or the treatments cannot be adapted in time. With the developed technology, the goal is to
      provide a tool to the ophthalmologists that allow for better treatment monitoring and early
      diagnosis. Indeed, the technology is able to image the retinal tissues with a ten times more
      detailed visualization as compared to the standard of care (OCT instruments, SLO instruments
      or eye fundus cameras). Towards this goal, we designed the present protocol in order to test
      the technology with a clinical prototype (Cellularis version 1) in a clinical environment.
      The objective is to describe and quantify at the cellular level the retina of patient
      affected by different retinal diseases as well as the healthy retina of people with different
      ages. We will assess the repeatability of the instrument and compare the results of the
      measurements with images obtained with the standard of care (OCT and SLO images).
