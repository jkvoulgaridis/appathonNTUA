  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Thirty cases of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients were recruited from the neurology
      department of Ruijin Hospital, the pain department and the encephalopathy center of Luwan
      Branch of Ruijin Hospital. After the informed consent was signed, they were divided into a
      trial group and a control group. Each group contains 15 cases. The patients in the control
      group was intravenously micropumped with saline and edaravone during hospitalization, while
      the patients in the trial group was intravenously micropumped with dexmedetomidine, atropine,
      scopolamine, and edaravone. Both groups of subjects were treated for 10 days within 2 weeks,
      followed by a buffer period of 2 weeks for observation, which was one treatment course. The
      total treatment protocol contains 6 treatment courses(or 24 weeks). Patients with amyotrophic
      lateral sclerosis were evaluated before treatment and 5, 9, 13, 17, 21, 36, 48 weeks after
      treatment. The observations include whether the functional scores of patients with
      amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Norris amyotrophic lateral sclerosis score and amyotrophic
      lateral sclerosis self-score were superior to those before treatment, as well as changes in
      patient adverse effects and blood levels of creatine kinase, homocysteine, and liver and
      kidney function. Study hypothesis: Cholinergic receptor blocking therapy for amyotrophic
      lateral sclerosis is safe and effective in improving motor function and delaying disease
      progression in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.
