    <textblock>
      To determine the effective dose and the time course, the dermal blood flow response to
      histamine will be evaluated at different doses (5 µg, 15 µg and 50 µg). Histamine will be
      administered by a skin prick on the volar surface of subjects' forearm, alongside a negative
      control. Changes in dermal blood flow will be measured with laser Doppler imaging at
      different time points following the skin prick.

             examination and vital signs

          -  Subject understands the procedures and agrees to comply with them for the entire
             length of the study by giving written informed consent
