  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Maternal morbid obesity is an important risk factor in modern obstetrics, it has been
      associated with higher infertility rates and obstetrics complications. Bariatric surgery
      proven to achieve long term weight loss with improvement in all obesity related morbidities.
      This study was to compare the 5 years outcomes of laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) and
      laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) in terms of fertility outcomes, breast feeding,
      weight loss, safety, and resolution of obesity related co-morbidity.

      This study included 197 adult morbidly obese females, 111 underwent LSG (group I) and 86
      LRYGB (group II). After 5 years follow up, the following were looked at: percentage excess
      weight loss (%EWL), comorbidity improvement or resolution, postoperative complications or
      mortality, fertility outcomes and breast feeding.

        In the LSG group, 14 patients (12.6%) suffered from infertility, and 24 patients (21.6%)
        were at pre-marriage stage. This is versus 15 patients (17.4%), and 26 patients (30.2%) in
        the LRYGB group respectively.
