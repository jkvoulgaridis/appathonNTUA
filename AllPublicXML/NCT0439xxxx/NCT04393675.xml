      In Part A, patient participation is expected to last up to 63 days, including a 28-day
      screening period(consisting of a 7-day diary run-in to build baseline itch NRS) and a 36-day
      on study period (consisting of 56 total doses from Day 1 to Day 29, and a 7 day follow-up/EOS
      visit at Day 36).

      In Part B, patient participation is expected to last up to 85 days, including a 28-day
      screening period (consisting of a 7-day diary run-in to build baseline itch NRS) and a 57-day

    <measure>Improvement in itch-related quality of life as assessed by the change from baseline in 5-D Itch Scale score at the end of Week 4.</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>The 5-D Itch Scale is a multidimensional questionnaire which assesses itch-related quality of life over the past 2 weeks. The questions cover five dimensions of itch including the degree, duration of itch/day, direction (improvement/worsening), disability (impact on activities such as work), and body distribution of itch. A lower total score represents better quality of life.</description>
