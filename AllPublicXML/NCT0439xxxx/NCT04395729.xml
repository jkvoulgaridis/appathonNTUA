  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to investigate the impact of individualized multisite
      neuro-orthopedic surgery of the upper limb in children with Cerebral Palsy on unilateral
      functional capacities and bimanual performance. The investigators also assessed the
      attainment of individualized goals and tracked any potential factors that may have an impact
      on final results.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cerebral Palsy is responsible for the most common neurological disorders in children.
      Although the primary lesion is non-evolutionary, the secondary consequences are evolutive,
      with neuro-orthopaedic degradation leading to soft tissue retraction and osteo-articular
      deformities. Hemiplegia occurs in approximately 30% of cases of Cerebral Palsy, and tone
      disorders (spasticity, dyskinesia) affecting the upper limb generally impact function, both
      in unilateral capacities (range of motion, dexterity, and fluidity of movement), and in
      bimanual performance. The focal treatment of spasticity by botulinum toxin injections, in
      combination with specific occupational therapy training, has proven to be effective in
      improving targeted functional goals. However, there is little evidence today of the
      effectiveness of treatment for the management of upper limb retraction and deformity, whether
      by stretching, orthosis/plaster or even surgery. And apart from its effectiveness on body
      structure, the functional effects of upper limb surgery in Cerebral Palsy have been little
      explored. The aim of the study is to investigate the impact of individualized multisite
      neuro-orthopedic surgery of the upper limb in children with Cerebral Palsy on unilateral
      functional capacities and bimanual performance, by using such tools as the Melbourne
      Assessment (Version 2) and the Assisting Hand Assessment (Version 5.0).

    <measure>Melbourne Assessment - Version 2</measure>
    <time_frame>Available data up to 3 years before surgery and up to 2 years after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The Melbourne Assessment evaluates unilateral upper limb functional capacities for children between 2.5 and 15 years of age with neurological impairment.
It takes into account movement patterns, by characterizing the articular positioning observed during movements, as well as the fluidity of movement. Through 14 items analyzed along 4 axes (range of motion, precision, dexterity and fluidity), this test explores unilateral capacities to reach, grasp, release and manipulate simple objects. The evaluation is filmed according to a standardized protocol analyzed on video. The scoring is based on the video and the result is expressed as 4 scores in % for the areas of: range of motion, precision, dexterity, fluidity of movement. The reliability of the tool proved to be very good for the total score, for intra-examiner reproducibility (R=0.97) and inter-examiner reproducibility as well (R=0.95).</description>

    <measure>Assisting Hand Assessment - Version 5.0</measure>
    <time_frame>Available data up to 3 years before surgery and up to 2 years after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The Assisting Hand Assessment (AHA) evaluates the effectiveness of the use of the assistant hand in bimanual performance in children with unilateral impairment between 18 months and 18 years of age. The test is scored on the video recording of the bimanual performance observation session, through 20 items rated on a rating scale between 1=ineffective and 4=effective; the different AHA items characterize the general use of the upper limb, the use of the arm, the grasp-release domain, fine motor adjustment and coordination. The total raw score is reduced to an interval score between 0 and 100. The reliability of the AHA has been shown to be very good for the total score, both intra-examiner (CCI= 0.99) and inter-examiner (CCI= 0.98). A difference of 5 points on the interval scale 0-100 is considered a significant difference.</description>
