    <measure>Number of Participants with Adverse Events as a Measure of Safety and Tolerability</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Week 48</time_frame>
    <description>An Adverse Event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant participating in a clinical study that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the intervention under study.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in the Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 48</time_frame>
    <description>The CDAI score will be assessed by collecting information on 8 different Crohn's disease-related variables, with score ranges from 0 to approximately 600. A decrease over time indicates improvement in disease activity. .</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in Patient-Reported Outcome (PRO)-2 Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 48</time_frame>
    <description>PRO-2 is based on unweighted CDAI components of the total number of liquid or very soft stools and the abdominal pain (AP) score. The PRO-2 score has a minimum score of 0 and has no upper bound, with a higher score indicating more frequent stools and more severe abdominal pain.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in Simplified Endoscopic Score for Crohn's disease (SES-CD) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 48</time_frame>
    <description>The SES-CD score will be used to evaluate endoscopic improvement based on presence/size of ulcers, mucosal surface covered by ulcers, mucosal surface affected by any other lesions, and presence/type of narrowing/structures) across 5 ileocolonic segments.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Serum Concentation of Guselkumab</measure>

    <measure>Number of Participants with Anti-Guselkumab Antibodies</measure>

    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 32, 40 and 48</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline in C-reactive protein (CRP) will be reported.</description>
