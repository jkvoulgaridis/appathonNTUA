  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiogenic shock (CS) is a medical emergency and a frequent cause of death. CS can be
      complicated and/or precipitated by mitral regurgitation (MR). The efficacy of percutaneous
      treatment of MR in patients with cardiogenic shock is unknown. The aims of the study will be
      to analyse the efficacy of MitraClip therapy on early (30 days) and midterm mortality (6
      months) as well as the predictors of outcomes. Investigators will also report the rate of
      periprocedural complications such as minor and major bleeding, vessel injury and Acute Kidney
      Injury (AKI).

      It is a multicenter retrospective observational study on CE marked medical device (MitraClip速
      System). Retrospective time range: from 01/01/2012 to 01/01/2020

    <description>The MitraClip速 procedure is performed under general anesthesia and orotracheal intubation. The procedure is usually guided by 2 and 3-dimensional transesophageal echocardiography and fluoroscopy. This catheter-based technology is inserted through femoral venous access and advanced in the left atrium through the transseptal puncture. The MitraClip速 is provided by 2 arms able to grasp the anterior and posterior mitral leaflets. The goal is to approximate both leaflets creating a double orifice mitral valve mimicking the edge-to-edge surgical repair procedure (Alfieri stitch).</description>

        Patients with CS and concomitant severe MR who underwent PMVR between 01/01/2012 to
        01/01/2020 will be included in the study. Five Italian centers with high volume of
        MitraClip procedures will participate in the study. The number of enrolled patients will be
        of 30 patients. All patients will be older than 18 years old. Patients enrolled at our
        center (OSR) will be of 10 patients. The patients can tolerate antiplatelets and
        anticoagulant therapy. Inclusion criteria are: cardiogenic shock, severe mitral
        regurgitation, prohibitive surgical risk (STS&gt;10%), anatomic feasibility of PMVR with
        MitraClip速 system. Exclusion criteria are: multiorgan failure, VA-ECMO, inadequate
        peripheral access because of vascular disease, not suitable mitral valve anatomy.
