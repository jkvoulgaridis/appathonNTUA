  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study showed the difference in postoperative pain between the groups that performed
      surgery with the low-pressure pneumoperitoneum and the group that performed surgery in the
      standard-pressure pneumoperitoneum when robotic single-hole cholecystectomy was performed.

      The primary purpose of the study was to compare the differences in the visual analog scale
      (VAS) between the two groups and to demonstrate the effectiveness of pain relief after
      surgery.

      Secondly, the effect of the low-pressure pneumoperitoneum on the patient's postoperative
      recovery and outcome was compared with the control group by comparing the length of stay,
      operation time, and postoperative complications.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Laparoscopic cholecystectomy was the most common treatment method for gallbladder-related
      diseases, and robotic cholecystectomy was also currently being performed. Many patients
      complained pain around the wound, shoulder and back after surgery. Several methods had been
      attempted to reduce postoperative pain, previous studies showed that oral medications such as
      NSAIDS, administration of local anesthetics in wounds and abdominal cavity, low-pressure
      penumoperitoneum, humidification of intraperitoneal washing fluid, And active residual gas
      suction in the abdominal cavity had been found to relieve postoperative pain.

      Robotic cholecystectomy, similar to laparoscopic cholecystectomy, also formed
      pneumoperitoneum to secure the surgical space during operation. Based on the results
      published in various studies, it had known that the most effective method of pain relief for
      laparoscopic pain was to create low-pressure pneumoperitoneum.

      In this study, investigators attempted to prove the effectiveness of low pressure
      pneumoperioneum through a prospective randomized controlled trial between the experimental
      group with the low-pressure pneumoperitoneum and the control group with the standard-pressure
      pneumoperitoneum during robotic single-hole cholecystectomy.

    <description>The Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) consists of a straight line with the endpoints defining extreme limits such as 'no pain at all' and 'pain as bad as it could be'. The patient is asked to mark his pain level on the line between the two endpoints. The distance between 'no pain at all' and the mark then defines the subject's pain.</description>
