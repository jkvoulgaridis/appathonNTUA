  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The COVID-19 epidemic (Coronavirus Disease 2019) which is currently raging in France is an
      emerging infectious disease linked to a virus of the genus coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). The
      first cases were reported in Wuhan, China, in late December 2019 [1]. Globally, it has been
      placed in the &quot;pandemic&quot; stage by the WHO since March 11, 2020. Coronavirus viruses have been
      responsible for epidemics in the past such as the SARS epidemic in 2002 (Syndrome Severe
      Acute Respiratory) linked to the SARS-CoV virus, or the epidemic of MERS (Middle East
      Respiratory Syndrome) that affected the Middle East in 2012.

      Patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) / lymphocytic lymphoma or Waldenstrom
      Disease (WD) therefore represent a population at high risk of developing a severe form in the
      event of COVID-19 infection.

      To date, no data is available in the literature to assess the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic
      in this population of patients with CLL / lymphocytic lymphoma or WD.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia / lymphocytic lymphoma or Waldenstrom
             disease according to the criteria of the WHO 2016 with a proven or probable infection
             by COVID-19 according to the following criteria:

          -  Proven infection: PCR positive regardless of the radio-clinical picture (Other tests
             made available later and having good diagnostic performance will be accepted)

          -  Probable infection: the diagnosis of probable infection is retained in case of
             negative PCR or not made if presence of at least 2 major criteria or of a major
             criterion associated with at least 2 minor criteria among the following, in the
             absence other documented cause.

                  frosted glass, condensations including pseudonodular condensations, association
                  of frosted glass and condensation within the same lesion, nodules and
                  micronodules, thickening of the interlobular septa) or on an X-ray of the thorax
