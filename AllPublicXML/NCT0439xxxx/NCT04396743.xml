    <textblock>
      Healing of apicomarginal defects using 2 different formulations of PRF i.e PRF -high and
      PRF-medium will be assessed and compared using 2D and 3D criteria. Also, in vitro evaluation
      of the PRF formulations and quality of life will be compared between the two groups.

    <textblock>
      Periapical surgery is a viable treatment option in teeth with persistent apical
      periodontitis, especially in cases which fail to heal by non surgical treatment. Kim and
      Kratchman classified periradicular lesions into categories A-F. Lesions A-C are of endodontic
      origin without any periodontal pockets and vary with respect to the size of periapical
      radiolucency while D-F are combined endodontic - periodontal origin and are ranked accoding
      to the magnitude of periodontal breakdown. Type F defects are commonly referred to as
      apicomarginal defects and have worst prognosis among all. The lower success rate is
      attributed to the apical migration of junctional epithelium and intrusion of non osteogenic
      connective tissue into the periapical region.

      Recently, autologous platelet concentrates have been used instead of the conventional
      practice of using GTR barrier membranes for treating apicomarginal defects. Till date no
      human study has compared platelet formulations; PRF-high ( 2700 rpm for 12minutes) and
      PRF-medium (1500 rpm for 14minutes) to see any difference in the bony healing and the quality
      of life between the two groups and no study have assessed bony healing of the periapical
      defect with periodontal communication with the use of CBCT.

      Thus, the aim of the present study is to investigate the effect of 2 different formulations
      of PRF on quality of life and healing outcome of periapical defects with periodontal
      communications . Also, in vitro histological and immunohistochemical evaluation and
      comparison of the clots prepared from different centrifugation protocols will be done .

    <description>Patients will be checked clinically for absence of signs and symptoms. Radiographic 2D assessment will be done by Rud and Molven criteria as follows:-
Complete healing- defined by re-establishment of the lamina dura
Incomplete healing (scar tissue)
Uncertain healing
Unsatisfactory healing (failure).
3D healing will be assessed by modified PENN 3D criteria(Schloss et al) as-
Complete healing
Limited healing
Uncertain healing
Unsatisfactory healing.</description>
