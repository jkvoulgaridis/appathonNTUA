  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended
      Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of ION251 in patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a two-part, multi-center first in human study of ION251 in up to 80 participants.
      Part 1 will use a 3+3 dose-escalation scheme in sequential cohorts to determine the MTD and
      RP2D during repeated 28-day treatment cycles. MTD will be determined by the number of
      participants with AEs meeting the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) criteria during Cycle 1. The
      MTD determined in Part 1 will be used with other variables to inform a RP2D for participants
      proceeding to Part 2 for further assessments in the safety, tolerability and anti-myeloma
      activity.

    <description>MTD is defined as the maximum dose at which ≤ 1 of 3 evaluable participants experiences a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) within Cycle 1 and there are 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 evaluable participants in the next higher-dose level experiencing a DLT within Cycle 1. If no dose in the dose-escalation has 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 evaluable participants experiencing a DLT, the highest dose level is considered the MTD</description>
