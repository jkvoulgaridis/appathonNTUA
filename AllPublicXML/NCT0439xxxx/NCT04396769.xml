      This randomized control trial evaluates the physical activity component of the Family
      Lifestyle Overweight Prevention Program compared to physical education class as usual among
      Hispanic middle school students.

    <textblock>
      Family Lifestyle Overweight Prevention Program (FLOW) is an intensive, multi-component
      obesity intervention designed to take place during physical education class. This
      intervention has established efficacy at improving standardized BMI among low income,
      Hispanic middle school students with overweight classification or obesity. However, the
      efficacy of individual components of the intervention have not been investigated. The purpose
      of this study was to compare only the physical activity component of FLOW to a physical
      education class as usual. The primary outcome of the study is time spent in moderate-vigorous
      physical activity. Secondarily the study evaluated the impact of the intervention on
      standardized BMI.

    <description>Participants received the physical activity component of FLOW five days a week during participants' 45-minute long physical education (PE) class period for six months. Intervention activities were designed to promote moderate-vigorous physical activity through circuit-based stations with both aerobic and strength exercises. Trained research staff partnered with PE teachers to facilitate lessons and undergraduate college students were trained to complete activities with participants.</description>

    <description>Classes were designed to provide the opportunity to be physically activity at a moderate-vigorous level. Each station included exercise options to accommodate varying fitness levels and offer students choice. Heart rate monitors provided consistent biofeedback to students throughout the intervention. Participants were evaluated based on the number of minutes they spent each class between 60-80% of their maximal heart rate. Games were intermixed either as a station or as a break in the circuit (e.g. short game of tag half-way through the workout) to make physical activity enjoyable and engaging.</description>

    <description>PE teachers were instructed to teach class as usual. Research staff were not involved in class activities or instruction. In this school district PE class as usual includes sports-based instruction in which students learn the rules to games and then practice playing.</description>
