  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aortic dissection refers to the blood in the aortic lumen entering the aortic mediastinum
      from the tear of the aortic intima, separating the mediastinum and extending along the long
      axis of the aorta to form the true and false separation state of the aortic wall. This
      disease is rare, and the incidence rate is 100 thousand to 200 thousand a year, with the peak
      age of 50-70 years old. 65%-70% patients died in the acute stage due to cardiac congestion
      and arrhythmia, so early diagnosis and treatment is very necessary. The aim of this study is
      analyze clinical outcome of Chinese patients with acute aortic dissection.

      Aortic dissection refers to the blood in the aortic lumen entering the aortic mediastinum
      from the tear of the aortic intima, separating the mediastinum and extending along the long
      axis of the aorta to form the true and false separation state of the aortic wall. Risk
      factors for aortic dissection included hypertension, cystic necrosis or degeneration of the
      middle aorta, hereditary connective tissue disease, congenital two-lobe active pulse valve,
      arteritis, aneurysm, atherosclerosis and iatrogenic injury, etc. The leading cause of aortic
      dissection is hypertension, and more than 75% of aortic dissection is associated with
      hypertension.Therefore, for hypertension patients to do a good job in the prevention and
      control of hypertension, pay attention to the regular use of antihypertensive drugs and
      monitoring blood pressure. In case of sudden chest and back lacerations, the patient should
      be immobilized in bed, contacted with an ambulance and sent to the hospital for emergency
      treatment, so as to avoid greater risks. The aim of this study is analyze clinical outcome of
      Chinese patients with acute aortic dissection.
