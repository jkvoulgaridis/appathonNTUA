  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The search for biochemical markers in patient's blood for non-invasive colorectal cancer
      diagnostic has not yielded satisfactory results to date. The search for blood in the stool by
      enzymatic techniques has certainly allowed the diminution of colorectal cancer mortality but
      its low sensitivity is still a disadvantage. The new immunological tests for search blood
      test in the stool are more sensitive and more specific but still insufficient. The
      originality of this project is based on the use of new technology developed in fundamental
      research based on the detection of circulating exosomes from tumor cells in the patient's
      serum. The detection of protein markers transported by tumor exosomes is original and
      innovative approach because it's still not considered in the literature. The use of
      innovative and non-invasive health technologies for the patient is an important factor in the
      care of patients in their health care journey. The non-invasive nature of the project could
      reduce the reticence of patients to participate in cancer screening.

      The results expected from the study can have a direct impact on the management of patients
      suspected of having colon cancer and thus make it possible to optimize the earliness of their
      diagnosis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In terms of frequency, colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer diagnosed in men and
      the second in women. Screening for colon and rectal cancer is based on the search for blood
      in the stool. The detection of occult bleeding is an indication for colonoscopy to find the
      origin of this bleeding. In this context, the search for biochemical markers in the blood of
      patients for diagnostic purposes has not yielded satisfactory results to date. Cancer cells,
      including colorectal cancer cells, release extracellular vesicles that contain proteins,
      mRNAs, DNA that can be transferred to neighboring cells but that also circulate through the
      blood stream and can modulate tumor progression and metastatic spread. These extracellular
      vesicles are of two types: exosomes (40 to 100 nm in diameter) formed by budding of endosome
      membranes and microvesicles (100 to 1000 nm in diameter) resulting from the budding of plasma
      membrane. Exosomes carry transmembrane proteins on their surface, called tetraspanins (CD9,
      CD63, CD81) but they also contain proteases involved in the degradation of the extracellular
      matrix, integrins involved in the tropism of metastases, and matrix macromolecules involved
      in the control of tumor invasion. The working hypothesis is that some of these exosomal
      proteins may be good diagnostic and / or prognostic markers for colorectal cancer. This
      project will aim to isolate exosomes from patient blood and to quantify previously cited
      proteins according to the accreditation criteria of clinical laboratory biology analyzes. For
      this purpose, exosomes will be isolated from sera of patients and their number, size and
      protein composition will be characterized. This project is an innovative and non-invasive
      prospective approach in the screening of protein markers for colorectal cancer diagnostic and
      / or prognostic.
