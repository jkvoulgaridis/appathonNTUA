  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effectiveness of oral trehalose in alleviating the neuropathological
      and motor behaviour deficits among patients with SCA3. A total of 40 participants with SCA3
      will be recruited, with 20 participants to be administered with trehalose while another 20
      participants to be administered with a maltose placebo.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Spinocerebellar ataxia 3 (SCA3) is a rare form of inherited neurodegenerative disease
      involving progressive degeneration of spinocerebellar tract. SCA3 is characterised by
      increasingly worsening cerebellar function leading to gait abnormalities and poor
      coordination, dysarthria, and abnormal eye movements. Non-ataxia features include pyramidal
      and extrapyramidal manifestations, sensorimotor, neuropsychological and psychiatric symptoms.
      This is attributed to the role of cerebellum in motor, cognitive and affective processing
      (i.e. cerebellar cognitive and affective syndrome; CCAS), as well as its extensive connection
      with cerebral structures.

      Trehalose is an omnipotent disaccharide molecule found in lower and higher life forms except
      in vertebrates. It has an amorphous (i.e. non-reducing) property, which is shown in its high
      hydrophilicity, chemical stability and strong resistance to denaturation / breakdown by heat,
      acid or enzyme. It is also shown to help refold partially denatured protein, thereby
      stabilizes protein aggregates, including those of polyglutamine, in vivo as well as in vitro.
      This has provided an avenue in which trehalose as a therapeutic agent for neurodegenerative
      disorders with pathological changes of protein aggregates.

      In this study, a double-blinded randomised controlled trial (RCT) will be employed. A total
      of 40 patients with SCA3 will be randomly allocated to oral trehalose group and a placebo
      group (20 participants for each arm). With regards to clinical outcomes, motor and cognitive
      performances will be assessed to infer the efficacy of trehalose. Likewise, structural,
      resting-state fMRI (i.e. functional connectivity), and MR spectroscopy (i.e. metabolism),
      will be used as imaging biomarkers in this study.
