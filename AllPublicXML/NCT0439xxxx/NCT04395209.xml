      ABSTRACT The muscle strength (MS) is necessary to overcome the resistance encountered during
      the activity. The present study aims to determine MS loss in stroke individuals (SI). 33 SI
      and 33 healthy individuals (HI) were included in this study. MS and handgrip force were
      assessed using a power track dynamometer and Jamar hand dynamometer, respectively. The total
      MS of the HI was calculated by summing the muscle strength of the trunk, lower and upper
      extremities. In the SI, the muscle strength of the trunk, unaffected upper and lower
      extremities were summed to calculate the total MS. To compare MS of unaffected sides (US)
      between groups, 27 SI who was dominant and not affected on the right side and 33 HI who was
      dominant on the right side were used.
