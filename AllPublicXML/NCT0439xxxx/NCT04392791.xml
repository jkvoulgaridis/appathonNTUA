      and on work productivity of SLE patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      SLE patients in remission/low disease activity of three immunology centers were included in
      this randomized, controlled, follow-up study. In addition to the standard of care (SOC)
      sixteen out of the thirty SLE patients received balneotherapy (15 times, for 30 minutes) and
      fourteen patients received the SOC only. Prevalidated survey instruments including LupusQol,
      SF36, and WPAI questionnaires were recorded.
