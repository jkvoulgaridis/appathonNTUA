  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Public speaking anxiety (PSA) is a common anxiety with onset in adolescence and early
      adulthood. With the advent of consumer Virtual Reality (VR) technology, VR-delivered exposure
      therapy has previously been shown to be efficacious with adults. Virtual reality has existed
      for several decades, but it is only in the recent years it has become readily available. The
      new generation of off-the-shelf, consumer VR hardware, can revolutionize the design,
      availability and dissemination of VR therapist tools for exposure therapies. Importantly,
      there has been relatively little research on VR delivered exposure of anxiety in social
      situations compared to other anxiety disorders, presumably due to the complexity of the
      virtual stimuli required. There has been no study on VR delivered exposure specifically for
      adolescents until recently. A feasibility and pilot trial laying the foundation of the
      current study showed great potential in using VR for adolescents with PSA. The current study
      aims to investigate the efficacy of a self-guided VR intervention compared to a self-guided
      internet-delivered text-based intervention using a 2x2 factorial and two-phased randomized
      design. Adolescents aged 13-16 will be invited to participate in the study

      The study is a two-phased study using 2x2 factorial intervention design. Participants with
      PSA will be randomized into three self-guided intervention groups and one delayed waiting
      list group as follows in Phase 1 (3 weeks): 1) receiving only VR intervention, 2) receiving
      only text-based intervention, 3) receiving both VR intervention and text-based intervention,
      and 4) no intervention in a waiting list group. After phase 1, each intervention group will
      be re- randomized into two groups as follows in Phase 2 (3 weeks): 1) receive a text-based
      transition program (TP) or 2) not receiving any transition program (No TP). The waiting list
      group will in Phase 2 receive the text-based intervention.

      All participants will be assessed at pre, post1 (after 3 weeks), post 2 (after 6 weeks), 3
      months follow-up and 12 months follow-up. In addition, PSA will be assessed weekly in both
      phase 1 and 2.

    <measure>Change in Public Speaking Anxiety Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>18 months</time_frame>
    <description>A new, modern, reliable and valid self-rating scale (Bartholomay &amp; Houlihan, 2016). The PSAS features 17 items (5 of which are reverse-coded) covering cognitive, behavioral and physiological aspects of PSA. Since the PSAS features a full Likert item response format, it should be more sensitive to change than older rating scales such as the Personal Report of Confidence as a Speaker (Phillips, Jones, Rieger, &amp; Snell, 1997). Normative score data is however as of yet missing. This scale is translated into Norwegian according to scientific standards (back-translation.). Although intended for adults, the wording did not present any problem for adolescents in our feasibility study. lower score means lower symptom-leves</description>

    <measure>Change in Social Interaction Anxiety Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>18 months</time_frame>
    <description>Fear of social interaction distinguishes performance-only from generalized SAD. As such, degree of social interaction anxiety is a likely moderator of treatment response in the current study. A combination of Social Interaction Anxiety Scale (SIAS) 6 and the Social Phobia Scale (SPS) 6 has proven to be a validated measure to measure the more generalized form of social anxiety and gives us a short screening tool which is easy to assess (Peters, Sunderland, Andrews, Rapee, &amp; Mattick, 2012). This scale is translated into Norwegian according to scientific standards (back-translation.).
By collecting data on the 12-item short version of SIAS at both pre and post and FU the aim is to investigate whether VRET for PSA has a treatment effect on generalized social anxiety lower score means lower symptom-levels. scale from 0-80.</description>

    <measure>Change in Catastrophic belief expectancy</measure>
    <time_frame>18 months</time_frame>
    <description>Expectancy ratings of aversive consequences are a valid, simple way of assessing the strength of conditioning (Boddez et al., 2013) and a hypothesis is that a decrease in catastrophic beliefs expectancies will also cause a reduction in PSA symptoms . One-item scale for CBE will be assessed weekly together with the primary outcome measure PSAS. They will be asked to answer, &quot;How sure are you that the most aversive consequence when giving a speech is likely to happen?&quot; on as scale from 0-100.
Alternative: &quot;How sure are that you will sweat, shake, and/or r√∏dme visibly? How sure are you that you will speak in a weird way? (snakke rart). How sure are you that you will have difficulties speaking? How sure are you that others will think negatively of you?</description>
