  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study looks at the effect of long-term diet modification with or without
      full-fat dairy products or restrictive eating on body weight, body composition and
      cardiometabolic markers in healthy overweight/obese men and women.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 93 males and females will participate in the study at the University of Toronto.

      At the beginning and after 12 weeks, body weight, composition will be measured through dual
      energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans. Resting metabolic rate and thermogenesis will be
      measured by indirect calorimetry. Also, fecal samples will be collected for gut microbiome
      profiling along with blood for glucose, insulin, hormones, triacylglycerol, HbA1c,
      short-chain fatty acid, red blood cells and FGF21. Urine samples will be collected throughout
      the study.

      A followup session at 16 weeks will reassess previous measures.
