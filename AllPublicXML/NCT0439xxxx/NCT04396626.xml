      This is a retrospective, observational study that will document the treatment patterns and
      clinical outcomes of patients diagnosed with HR+/HER2- A/MBC who received CDK4/6i combination
      therapy with aromatase inhibitors (AI) as the initial endocrine-based therapy in the A/MBC
      setting.

        The study will include adult patients 18 years or older, diagnosed with HR+/HER2- A/MBC who
        initiated CDK4/6i combination therapy with AI as the initial endocrine-based therapy on or
        after 2/3/2015 and before 4/1/2019.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Female or male sex.

          2. Diagnosis (confirmed by clinical review) of A/MBC, defined as breast cancer at stage
             IIIB, stage IIIC, stage IV or identified as having distant metastasis.

          3. Age ≥18 years at A/MBC diagnosis.

          4. Initiated a CDK4/6i in combination with an AI as initial endocrine-based therapy after
             A/MBC diagnosis on or after 2/3/2015 and before 4/1/2019.

             •Note that the date of the start of the inclusion period reflects the month that the
             first CDK4/6i (ie, Palbociclib) received U.S. FDA approval.

          5. Evidence of ER or PR positive disease, or absence of any indication of ER and PR
             negative disease closest to A/MBC diagnosis (ie, patients are eligible without
             affirmative indication of ER/PR+ status as long as ER/PR- indication is not present).

          6. Evidence of HER2 negative disease, or absence of any indication of HER2 positive
             disease closest to A/MBC diagnosis (ie, patients are eligible without affirmative
             indication of HER2- status as long as HER2+ indication is not present).

        Exclusion Criteria:

        1. Enrollment in an interventional clinical trial for A/MBC during the study observation
        period.
