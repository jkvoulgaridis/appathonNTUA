    <textblock>
      106 subjects selected from 3 study sites in China are with indications for intracardiac
      electrophysiological examination. The trial is to prove the clinical effectiveness and safety
      of Qubic Stim Cardiac Stimulator in Chinese population.

      The trial is a multicenter, prospective and single-arm study. 106 appropriate subjects were
      selected from 3 study sites in China in accordance with the inclusion and exclusion criteria.
      The subjects consent to participate in the trial and sign the informed consent. The subjects
      who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria will receive the intracardiac
      electrophysiological examination, during which the subjects will be subject to diagnostic
      electrical stimulation by the Qubic Stim Cardiac Stimulator. The subjects will also receive
      the clinical follow-up visit after cardiac electrical stimulation until they are discharged
      from the hospital. The clinical effectiveness and safety of Qubic Stim Cardiac Stimulator in
      Chinese population were proved by observing the data collected in this study.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Programmed extrastimulation (PES)</measure>
    <time_frame>during the procedure</time_frame>
    <description>The expected clinical effect: the heart is effectively paced by PES at a set rate of stimulation.
After the release of electrical stimulation, the stimulation signal can produce an effective cardiac pacing wave.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>High Rate (Burst)</measure>
    <time_frame>during the procedure</time_frame>
    <description>The expected clinical effect: when the tachycardia is induced or terminated by high-rate stimulation, the device can effectively pace the heart at a set rate of stimulation.
After the release of electrical stimulation, the stimulation signal can produce an effective cardiac pacing wave.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Measurement of Sinus node recovery time (SNRT)</measure>
    <time_frame>during the procedure</time_frame>
    <description>The expected clinical effect: the sinus node recovery time can be measured. The frequency of the stimulus accelerated step by step and then stopped abruptly.The time interval between the last pacemaker wave and the first recovered sinus atrial wave can be measured.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Serious device adverse events caused by cardiac stimulator</measure>
    <time_frame>from the intracardiac electrophysiological examination to discharge, an average of five days</time_frame>
    <description>All adverse events shall be recorded throughout the study. However, only the serious adverse events that are definitely, likely or possibly related to Qubic Stim cardiac stimulator will become the basis of SADE event rate.</description>
