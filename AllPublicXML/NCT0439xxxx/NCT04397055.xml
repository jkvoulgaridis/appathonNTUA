  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      More than 31 million U.S. adults have high total cholesterol and over 73 million U.S. adults
      have high LDL cholesterol. Cottonseed oil (CSO) is found readily in our food supply, and
      recent research has shown improvements in blood lipids following CSO consumption in healthy
      adults with normal cholesterol profiles. To date, however, there are no published studies on
      the effects of CSO-enriched diets on blood lipids and markers of health in an older
      population with hypercholesterolemia. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to test the
      health effects of a diet rich in CSO against a diet rich in olive oil to determine if the
      CSO-enriched diet will show greater improvements in blood lipids and other health markers in
      adults with high cholesterol levels. If CSO in the diet is found to improve these markers,
      these study findings could lead to improvements in health.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was a single-blind, randomized controlled trial. Investigators recruited subjects with
      hypercholesterolemia (high blood cholesterol levels). Subjects were randomized into one of
      two groups: (1) Cottonseed oil (CSO), (2) Olive oil (OO). The interventions consist of
      identical foods that are only different in the respective oil they are prepared with.

      There was a screening visit and 3 testing visits: Baseline (visit 2), mid-visit at week 4
      (visit 6), and post-visit at week 8 (visit 10). Anthropometrics, questionnaires, and a
      fasting blood sample were collected at each visit. At visits 2 and 10 participants
      participated in a saturated fatty acid meal challenge in which additional blood and
      metabolism measurements were collected. Visits 3-9 represent weekly meal pickups, with the
      exception of visit 6 which is also a testing visit.

      Hypothesis: Investigators hypothesized that enrichment of the diet with CSO would result in
      significantly greater improvements in blood lipids, metabolism, and appetite compared to the
      OO group.

    <description>hunger, fullness, prospective consumption, and desire to eat measured via a Visual Analog Scale (VAS). VAS uses an unmarked 10 centimetre line and asks the subject to answer the connected question by placing a tick mark on the line as though it is a spectrum from 0 to 100 percent with the right being in the most agreement (i.e. extremely hungry in response to how hungry are you) and the left being the most disagreement (i.e. extremely not hungry in response to how hungry are you). Answers will be measured in centimetres in response to questions about hunger, fullness, prospective consumption, and desire to eat.</description>

    <description>perceived Stress Scale is a questionnaire asking 10 questions about the subject's feelings of stress in the past month. There are 5 possible answers, never, almost never, sometimes, fairly often, very often with corresponding scores of 0 - 4 respectively. Scores for all questions will be added up as in indication of stress level. Higher perceived stress scale scores correspond to higher stress levels.</description>
