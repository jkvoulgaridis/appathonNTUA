  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      5-Aminolevulinic Acid (5-ALA) was approved by the FDA as an intraoperative optical imaging
      agent in patients with suspected high-grade gliomas (HGGs) in 2017. The investigators plan to
      administer 5-ALA to patients with pituitary tumors to demonstrate whether it can be used as
      an intraoperative optical imaging agent for this pathology. Overall, this pilot study will
      afford the overall opportunity to improve surgical management and advancement of the science
      of neurological and neuroendocrine disease.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of patients with intraoperative observed fluorescence of pituitary tumor</measure>
    <time_frame>through study completion, an average of 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Under blue light exposure of tumor, the investigators will document whether red fluorescence is seen (+ fluorescence) or not seen (- fluorescence). These will be categorized as a binary finding. If fluorescence is seen, the surgeon will biopsy this area to confirm that fluorescent tissue is consistent with pituitary adenoma by histopathology.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Differences in presence of fluorescence based on hormone receptor staining of the pituitary adenoma</measure>
    <time_frame>through study completion, an average of 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>If possible, the investigators will assess differences in presence and degree of fluorescence between different types of pituitary adenomas based on their hormone receptor staining status by immunohistochemistry.</description>

    <description>Study participants who are deemed surgical candidates for management of their pituitary lesion will drink 20mg/kg 5-ALA 2-4 hours preoperatively. They will then be taken to the operation room and undergo general anesthesia. Intraoperative blood draw may occur from lines places for anesthesia purposes at any time during the operation. In alignment with the neurosurgeon's practice and discretion, the sella will be accessed and opened. During the surgical exploration of the sella, the surgeon will attempt to identify the pituitary mass. The location of the tumor will be assessed using the blue-light filtered microscope or endoscope. These steps will be documented photographically during the operation. A biopsy of the fluorescent region will be taken to confirm pituitary adenoma histopathology. The tumor will then be maximally resected. The tumor sample will be used for further clinical testing as part of the patient's routine care.</description>

        The investigators will study patients with pituitary macroadenomas who require surgical
        intervention, as deemed appropriate by a neurosurgeon, either due to size criteria,
        observed growth in lesion on MRI, and/or for alleviation of the symptoms of mass effect.
        The investigators will also study patients with functional pituitary adenomas, including
        prolactinomas, growth-hormone secreting adenomas, and ACTH-secreting adenomas, where
        surgery is recommended for biochemical control.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with non-functioning pituitary adenomas who require surgical intervention, as
             deemed appropriate by a neurosurgeon, either due to size criteria, observed growth in
             lesion on MRI, and/or for alleviation of the symptoms of mass effect.

          -  Patients with functional pituitary adenomas, including prolactinomas, growth-hormone
             secreting adenomas, and ACTH-secreting adenomas, where surgery is recommended for
             biochemical control. Patients with symptoms of Cushing's Disease and centralization of
             ACTH on IPSS without imaging-confirmed lesions will be included in the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to aminolevulinic acid (ALA). Patients should refrain from use of other
             potential phototoxic substances (e.g. tetracyclines, sulfonamides, fluoroquinolones,
             hypericin extracts) for 72 hours.

          -  Personal or family history of porphyria.

          -  Uncontrolled concurrent illness including, but not limited to ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events
             in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with 5-ALA breastfeeding
             should be discontinued if the mother is treated with 5-aminolevulinic acid.

          -  Women who are pregnant or become pregnant will be excluded from the trial as it is
             unknown if aminolevulinic acid (ALA) is teratogenic or has abortifacient effects.

          -  Prior history of GI perforation, diverticulitis, and/or peptic ulcer disease.
