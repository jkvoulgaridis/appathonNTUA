  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a Phase II, single arm, open label multicenter trial designed to investigate
      the use of haploidentical donor derived NK cells (K-NK002) for the treatment of patients with
      high-risk acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) who are undergoing
      haploidentical donor bone marrow transplantation (HaploBMT). K-NK002 is a NK cell product
      derived from peripheral blood leukocytes collected from a related donor (HLA-haploidentical
      matched) and enriched for NK cells with depletion of CD3+ T-lymphocytes (T-cells) followed by
      enriched ex-vivo expansion and administered to the patient prior to and following BMT.

    <textblock>
      The study is a Phase II, single arm, open label, multicenter trial evaluating the cumulative
      incidence of relapse when K-NK002 is used for relapse mitigation in patients with high-risk
      AML and MDS receiving an allogeneic haploidentical bone marrow graft.

      Part One (Safety run-in):

      An initial safety run-in to confirm the starting dose, and safety and tolerability of
      K-NK002;

        -  Dose cohort 1 will include 3 patients who will receive a dose of K-NK002 at 1 x 10E7 NK
           cells per kg.

        -  Dose cohort 2 will include 3 patients who will receive K-NK002 at 1 x 10E8 NK cells per
           kg.

      Part Two (Open Enrollment):

      Enrollment into the second part of the study (Open Enrollment) can begin following Part One,
      confirmation of dose and safety.
