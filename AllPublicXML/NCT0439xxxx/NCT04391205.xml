  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although the use of peripheral venous catheters (CVP) with brachial insertion with echo-guide
      (Midline) has increased significantly over the last 5-10 years, there are no sensitive data
      concerning complications in the literature during their use, particularly as regards
      incidence of thrombotic complication.The prospective observational study will enroll all the
      patients admitted to Home Health Hospitalization service, Geriatric Department and
      Intermediate Care service, to whom a Midline-type CVP will be placed for infusional therapy
      and who will give their consent to participate.

    <description>Deep vein thrombosis is investigated with Compression ultrasound (CUS) technique, scheduled once a week from the implant day or performed at the time of occurrence of device malfunctions or at the onset of symptoms resulting from thrombotic complications; echodoppler tecnique is used to confirm diagnosis of thrombosis.</description>
