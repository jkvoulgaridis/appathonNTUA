  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational study that intends to compare falls or fall-risk related alarms
      derived from a three-dimensional sensor system with the clinical reality definded by
      attending nurses.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Three dimensional sensor technology (3DS) is available for fall detection and fall prevention
      (e.g. unwanted getting up in persons with risks for frequent falls) in several institutions
      in Europe and Switzerland. 3DS are capable to analyze completely anonymized data and alert
      nurses towards a dangerous (fall) or potentially dangerous (getting out of bed) event during
      day- and nighttime. Multi-sensor technology has been applied to assess activities of daily
      living in persons cognitive problems living at home. To our knowledge, 3DS technology has not
      been examined as part of a structured clinical protocol. In addition, the combination of two
      digital technologies (3DS and a server based software) as an integrative platform could help
      to develop algorithms to analyze complex human activities such as using a toilet. Automated
      analyses of such complex activities have the potential to support nursing staff in the
      future.

    <description>3d sensor system data will be used to develop an algorithm for a complex activity such as using a toilet. The senors results will be compared with a Nurse led 12 step observation protocol. Parts of the activity model include: (1) enter the room, (2) go to the toilet, (3) take off clothes, (4) sit on the toilet, (5) clean oneself, (6) stand up, (7) get dressed, (8) flush the toilet, (9) go to the sink, (10) wash hands, (11) dry hands, (12) leave the room, as well as emergencies.</description>
