  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Visual developmental abnormalities affect 10 to 15% of the population under 6 years of age
      and leads to amblyopia in 30% of cases if left untreated. Untreated amblyopia in adulthood
      has consequences on the quality of life of individuals but will also represent a cost to
      society due to the increased risk of visual impairment.

      The screening protocol for this study recommends that a screening examination for amblyopia
      and amblyogenic factors be routinely performed by an orthoptist in children between 3 and 4
      year old. This examination should include, as a minimum, a standardised measurement of visual
      acuity, a cover test and a measurement of refraction by photoscreener. In the event of a
      positive screening, the child must then be referred to an ophthalmologist so as to complete
      an ophthalmological examination.

      The aim of this protocol is to propose screening tests usually performed with a high
      specificity, in order to avoid congestion of ophthalmological services (i.e. by avoiding
      excessive or unnecessary referral of children to the ophthalmologist) without losing
      sensitivity by combining several tests.

      The orthoptists' role in this screening protocol is to facilitate an extensive screening
      coverage of the population in this age group, as they are more easily accessed by the
      patients and more equitably spread in the community than ophthalmologists.

      Therefore, by initially screening and then referring less children to the ophthalmologist,
      the aim is to reduce waiting times in the access of ophthalmological services which could be
      detrimental in terms of treatment success rates for patients acutely needing care.

      Based on the referral of children between 3 and 4 years of age by the orthoptist to an
      ophthalmologist, the analysis of the data from the standard screening protocol used in our
      centre will enable us to validate it scientifically. The referral thresholds can thus be
      secondarily adjusted for each test if the initial objectives are not achieved (specificity &gt;
      90% and sensitivity &gt; 87%). The aim of this study is also to observe a change in the patient
      flow by reducing the volume of consultations with the ophthalmologist currently required
      based on the present referral rate. The efficiency of the screening protocol by calculating
      the probable economic gain linked to the modification of the screening circuit will be
      secondarily studying in this protocol
