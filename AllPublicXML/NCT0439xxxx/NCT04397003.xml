      The investigators hypothesize that a personalized neoantigen vaccine combined with durvalumab
      and tremelimumab will improve the progression free survival of patients with extensive state
      small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC) at six months following study therapy.

    <description>PFS is defined as the duration of time from start of treatment to time of progression or death, whichever occurs first.
Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm.

    <time_frame>Through completion of treatment (estimated to be 2 years)</time_frame>
    <description>ORR is the proportion of participants with either a complete response or partial response
Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to &lt;10 mm. Disappearance of all non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker level.
Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.</description>

    <description>Patients will receive durvalumab (1500mg Q3W) in combination with standard of care carboplatin and etoposide for a total of 4 cycles given every 3 weeks
Beginning 4 weeks following Cycle 4 of carboplatin/etoposide/durvalumab, patients on Arm A will then receive four cycles of durvalumab 1500 mg and tremelimumab 75 mg with the polyepitope neoantigen DNA vaccine, with each cycle given every 4 weeks.

             informed consent.

          -  Current or prior use of immunosuppressive medication within 14 days before the first

             for eligible injection sites (left and right medial deltoid region) exceeds 40 mm.

          -  Individuals in whom the ability to observe possible local reactions at the eligible
             injection sites (deltoid region) is, in the opinion of the investigator, unacceptably
             obscured due to a physical condition or permanent body art.

          -  Therapeutic or traumatic metal implant in the skin or muscle of either deltoid region.
