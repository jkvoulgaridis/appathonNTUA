  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to develop and assess the feasibility, acceptability, and
      preliminary efficacy on adherence of a community-informed intervention for
      tenofovir/emtricitabine (TDF/FTC) pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) engagement among
      street-based female sex workers (FSW) in Baltimore, Maryland.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective two-group trial comparing the efficacy of a comprehensive PrEP
      adherence program compared to PrEP standard of care among FSW. Outcomes will be assessed
      through self-reported PrEP adherence as well as biological adherence indicators.

      The intervention includes three main components: 1) group PrEP engagement sessions, which
      include four educational sessions that situate PrEP in a broader framework of access and
      barriers to care, provider/patient communication, sexual health, HIV/sexually transmitted
      infection (STI) education, harm reduction around drug use, stigma, risk compensation and safe
      sex, and health/science literacy; 2) peer navigation, which aims to help women navigate
      healthcare engagement with the SPARC nurse practitioner and other providers; and 3) an
      mHealth component, consisting of a two-way text messaging system through which women will
      receive automated daily messages and weekly messages requesting adherence reports.
