  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lateral epicondylitis is a painful enthesopathy of the common extensor tendon at the lateral
      part of the elbow, with a prevalence of 1-3 % in the general population. In the treatment of
      lateral epicondylitis, the role of biological-based therapies has begun to investigate
      regeneration and optimize tendon healing. Prolotherapy (PrT) and hyaluronic acid (HA)
      injections are biological based treatments. Previous studies have shown benefit of PrT in the
      treatment of tendinopathies. Preliminary findings demonstrated that HA could be clinically
      effective in the treatment of enthesopathies. Considering the paucity of HA studies (which
      also lack a control group) and the proposed mechanism of action of both PrT and HA is through
      cell proliferation and the healing process of tendons, this study was conducted to compare
      the effect of PrT and HA in chronic lateral epicondylitis .

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lateral epicondylitis and other chronic tendinopathies are now understood to be
      non-inflammatory conditions characterized by collagen degeneration, fibroblast proliferation,
      mucoid degeneration and neovascularization Biological-based treatments can trigger the
      release of cytokines and growth factors from platelets, leukocytes, macrophages and other
      inflammatory cells. These growth factors support neovascularization and the chemotaxis of
      fibroblasts and tenocytes. It stimulates proliferation and collagen remodeling of fibroblasts
      and tenocytes.

      PrT involves multiple injections of a small amount of irritant or sclerosing solution. Common
      irritants include hypertonic dextrose, phenol-glycerin-glucose and sodium morrhuate. PrT
      injection mechanism is as follows; while hypertonic dextrose causes cell rupture through
      osmosis, monosodium morrhuate attracts inflammatory mediators and improves blood flow of the
      diseased tendon.Previous studies have shown benefit of PrT in the treatment of tendinopathies
      HA injection is a treatment method that increases the ability of sliding with its
      viscoelastic properties, reduces tendon surface friction and accelerates regeneration. In
      vitro models suggest that HA can increase collagen I production and accumulation with a
      dose-dependent positive collagen I / collagen III ratio. However, controlled randomised
      studies are still needed.

      Mechanism of action of both PrT and HA is cell proliferation and the healing process of
      tendons, this study was conducted to compare the effect of PrT and HA in chronic lateral
      epicondylitis .

    <measure>Pain via Visual Analogue Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 week, 12 week</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline at 6 week and at 12 week
Pain of the participants will be assessed by most widely used and accepted &quot;visual analogue scale&quot;. It consists of a 10 centimeter line marked at one end with &quot;no pain&quot; and at other end with &quot;worst pain ever&quot;. Participant is asked to indicate where on the line he or she rates the pain on the day of presentation, baseline, 6 and 12 weeks of follow-ups. Numerical score is given to it simply by measuring length between &quot;no pain&quot; to patients mark.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 week, 12 week</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline at 6 week and at 12 week
The elbow disability scale was assessed using the Quick DASH (disability of arm, shoulder &amp; hand) questionnaire containing 11 questions with five choices for each question. The final score can range between 0 (best condition) and 100 (worst condition). Participant is asked to answer the Quick DASH at baseline, 6 and 12 weeks of follow-ups</description>

    <measure>Grip strength via dynamometer</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 week, 12 week</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline at 6 week and at 12 week
Pain-free grip strength is a commonly used objective measure of lateral epicondilitis-related disability with high reliability and validity. In the study, we used a hand dynamometer (BaselineÂ® Hydraulic Hand Dynamometer 200 LB Standard). Patients were asked to sit, adduct the shoulder, flex the elbow to 90 degrees and put their forearm in a neutral position, then squeeze the dynamometer for three to five seconds. This test was conducted three times with 60-second intervals for each patient, and the mean patient grip strength was recorded at baseline, 6 and 12 weeks of follow-ups.</description>
