  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The peripheral venous catheter is the most commonly used medical device in the hospital
      setting. Infectious complications are infrequent, bacterial or fungal, and local or systemic
      (catheter-related bacteremia). The latter prolong the length of hospitalization and increase
      the cost of care and mortality. For peripheral venous catheters, the risk of catheter-related
      bacteremia is lower (0.2-0.7 episodes per 1000 catheter days) than for other intravascular
      devices. However, the much higher number of peripheral venous catheters used explains a total
      number of infections close to that of other catheters. Colonization is usually the
      preliminary step to catheter infection. It is far more common than infection. Skin
      disinfection prior to catheter insertion is therefore essential to prevent this complication.

      Currently, Chlorhexidine or Povidone Iodine in alcoholic solution is recommended before
      insertion of a peripheral venous catheter. Although rare, allergies may contraindicate these
      antiseptics. The widespread use of antiseptics in recent years for hand disinfection,
      mouthwashes or body baths could increase the risk of the development of strains that have
      become less sensitive, or even resistant, to currently available antiseptics. Allergies and
      reduced sensitivity require the search for alternatives to currently available solutions.
      Sodium hypochlorite is used to disinfect mucous membranes or healthy skin before an invasive
      procedure in children under 30 months of age. Very few studies have evaluated its efficacy in
      adults for this same indication, despite the fact that it was the first antiseptic used to
      prevent infections.

      The aim of this study is to estimate the colonization rate of peripheral venous catheters
      after skin disinfection with 0.5% sodium hypochlorite (Dakin®) alone or preceded by an
      application of 70% ethanol.
