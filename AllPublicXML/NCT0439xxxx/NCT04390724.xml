      HCC resection candidates with inadequate future liver remnant will be enrolled in this study.
      They will be treated with Y90 radioembolization to help grow the liver enough to undergo
      liver resection. There will be 2 Patient Groups. The first group of patients will be treated
      with Y90 dose and embolic load as per standard-of-care. The second group of patients will be
      treated with the optimal Y90 dose and embolic load found in Patient Group 1.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study there will be 2 different patient groups 1 and 2 that will consist of 40 and 64
      patients, respectively with hepatocellular carcinoma who are eligible for resection and to
      receive Y90 radioembolization who have inadequate future liver remnant.

      Y90 radioembolization uses radioactive beads (microspheres), which are tiny glass particles
      that are loaded with radiation. The beads are injected into an artery of the liver that
      supplies blood to the tumor(s). The beads flow to the tumor(s) and become trapped inside. The
      beads release the Y90 radiation inside the tumor(s).

      Liver resection is used to remove the part of the liver that has the HCC tumor(s). It has
      been shown that Y90 radioembolization can also increase the untreated liver's size and
      volume. Patients with HCC may be liver resection candidates if they have a large enough
      liver.

      The purpose of this research is to determine if there is an ideal Y90 dose to increase liver
      volume of the future liver remnant. This research may help determine the best Y90 dose for
      future patients who need a larger liver to have a liver resection.

      Participants in Group 1 will have standard-of-care Y90 radioembolization as well as
      study-specific optional liver biopsy.

      Participants who already have a planned Y90 radioembolization treatment with the dose range
      established in Group 1 will be enrolled into Group 2. Patient Group 2 will have blood drawn
      and a quantitative MRI performed at specific timepoints.

      The study will last up to 3 months. Participants' health status will be followed up to 5
      years.
