    <textblock>
      The current study evaluates the rotational One Shape single-file system regarding clinical
      and radiographic outcomes in root canal treatment of infected primary molars.

      This randomized clinical trial was carried out on 94 primary molars on children in the age
      group from 4 to 6 years. The teeth selected for this study were randomly assigned into 2
      groups according to the used endodontic preparation system. Group I: 47 primary molars were
      instrumented with One Shape rotational single-file system. Group II: 47 primary molars were
      instrumented with stainless steel K-files. All teeth were evaluated clinically and
      radigraphically for 12 months with periodic recall at 3, 6 and 12 months.
