    <textblock>
      Although the adverse effects associated with prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) are well known,
      many women continue to drink heavily during pregnancy, putting their infants at risk for
      fetal alcohol spectrum disorders. Animal studies have shown that choline supplementation can
      mitigate effects of PAE on growth and development. Choline, an essential nutrient, serves as
      a methyl-group donor for DNA methylation and is a constituent of the neurotransmitter
      acetylcholine and a precursor to major components of cell membranes. In an R21 feasibility
      trial, 70 heavy drinkers were randomly assigned to receive a daily dose of 2g of choline or a
      placebo from initiation of antenatal care to delivery in Cape Town, South Africa, where the
      incidence of heavy drinking during pregnancy and fetal alcohol syndrome are among the highest
      in the world. When compared with infants in the placebo arm, infants in the choline-treated
      arm were more likely to meet criterion for eyeblink conditioning, demonstrated markedly
      better recognition memory on the Fagan Test of Infant Intelligence, which is known to have
      predictive validity for school-age IQ, and had better postnatal gains in weight and head
      circumference. Key features of this study included the higher choline dose (4.4 times
      adequate intake (AI), compared to 1.7-2.5 in previous human studies) and initiation of
      treatment early in pregnancy. We are now conducting a fully-powered, double-blind,
      randomized, placebo-controlled choline supplementation trial in heavy drinking pregnant women
      from a rural community in South Africa (1) to assess the effectiveness of maternal choline
      supplementation during pregnancy to mitigate effects of PAE on three primary outcomes: infant
      recognition memory and postnatal growth restriction (weight and head circumference); (2) to
      assess the efficacy of this supplementation for mitigating alcohol effects on the following
      secondary outcomes: infant eyeblink conditioning, postnatal length, and information
      processing speed; (3) to use innovative methods in causal inference analysis to examine
      protocol adherence as an important source of variation in treatment efficacy and to identify
      sociodemographic factors associated with non-compliance in order to facilitate implementation
      of the intervention protocol in clinical settings; and (4) in exploratory analyses, to
      examine whether maternal choline supplementation is particularly effective in women with
      lower dietary choline intake or poor nutritional status.
