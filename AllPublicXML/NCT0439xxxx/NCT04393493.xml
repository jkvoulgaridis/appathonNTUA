  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In a patient with type 1 cardiorenal syndrome, we tried to compare two Furosemide strategies:
      both with a morning bolus, and randomized in two groups:

      Group A: Furosemide 80 mg every 24 hrs (morning) intravenously every 24 hrs for 4 consecutive
      days, additionally:

        -  Day 1 furosemide 100mg / day infused with 100cc of Hartmann solution

        -  Day 2 Furosemide 200mg / day infused with 100cc of Hartmann solution

        -  Day 3 Furosemide 300mg / day infused with 100cc of Hartmann solution

        -  Day 4 Furosemide 400mg / day infused with 100cc of Hartmann solution

      Group B: Furosemide 80 mg every 24 hrs (morning) intravenously every 24 hrs for 4 consecutive
      days, additionally:

        -  Day 1 furosemide 100mg / day infused with 100cc of Hartmann solution + Chlortalidone
           50mg VO every 24 hours + Spironolactone 25mg VO every 24 hrs.

        -  Day 2 furosemide 100mg / day infused with 100cc of Hartmann solution + Chlortalidone
           50mg VO every 24 hours + Spironolactone 25mg VO every 24 hrs.

        -  Day 3 furosemide 100mg / day infused with 100cc of Hartmann solution + Chlortalidone
           50mg VO every 24 hours + Spironolactone 25mg VO every 24 hrs.

        -  Day 4 furosemide 100mg / day infused with 100cc of Hartmann solution + Chlortalidone
           50mg VO every 24 hours + Spironolactone 25mg VO every 24 hrs.

      With the primary objective of improving renal function measured by serum creatinine, as
      secondary objectives the efficacy in vascular decongestion and electrolyte alterations.
