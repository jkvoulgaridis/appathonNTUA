  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common inherited disease in the western world. On a yearly
      basis, 56% of CF patients, or nearly 17,000 individuals in the US, suffer from acute
      pulmonary exacerbations (APE). The purpose of this study is to test a candidate assay for its
      ability to diagnose APE, the most important disease event in CF. While previous studies have
      been able to identify biomarkers of CF prognosis and risk stratification, three markers have
      demonstrated characteristics ideal for APE diagnosis: CD64, TLR2, and GILT. CD64 is a
      cellular receptor, expressed on numerous cells of the immune system, whose role is to bind
      antibodies which are attached to infected cells or pathogens. TLR2 plays a major role in
      early host-microbial interactions. GILT has been shown to be more precise in targeting immune
      responses against antigens and influences T lymphocyte response. This study looks to identify
      the differences in the expression of neutrophil CD64 and CD4+ T cell TLR2 and GILT between
      acute illness and baseline health as a sensitive marker of acute pulmonary exacerbation so
      that it may facilitate rapid hematologic diagnosis of the condition. The study also looks to
      compare sensitivity and specificity of the assays above to standard measures, such as health
      related quality of life scores (CFQ-R), loss of lung function, white blood cell counts and
      CRP, for diagnosing acute exacerbations.
