  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vitamin D deficiency is proposed to be prevalent in community-dwelling older adults, with
      prevalence substantially higher among older adults in residential care facilities.
      Musculoskeletal health is compromised in older vitamin D deficient individuals and alongside
      frailty, sarcopenia and osteoporosis associated with ageing, affected individuals are at
      increased risk of falls and fractures. Vitamin D supplementation is an effective intervention
      for fall prevention and, along with calcium supplementation, in fracture risk reduction in
      institutionalised older adults. Thus, monitoring vitamin D status and treating deficiency
      among older adults in residential care facilities may limit the substantial economic burden
      associated with falls/fractures in this population. The vitamin D status of older adults in
      residential care facilities in Northern Ireland (NI) is currently unknown, therefore, the aim
      of this pilot study is to determine the vitamin D status of this cohort of the population,
      and to define factors which may influence vitamin D status, including body mass index (BMI),
      mobility out-of-doors, medication use, dementia and diet. Vitamin D status will be determined
      via the measurement of 25-hydroxyvitamin D using liquid chromatography-tandem mass
      spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). In addition, biomarkers associated with vitamin D metabolism will be
      measured including calcium, albumin, creatinine, urea, bone turnover markers and parathyroid
      hormone. Factors that may affect vitamin D status will be assessed using a health and
      lifestyle questionnaire and dietary vitamin D intake will be estimated via analysis of the
      menus in the residential care facilities. Vitamin D supplementation practices in these
      facilities will also be assessed via analysis of drug prescription records, focusing on
      differences between residents who have/have not suffered a fracture. Physical measures such
      grip strength, timed up and go test and T-score measurement via Achilles ultrasound machine
      will be taken. This study will provide data on the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in
      older adults in residential care facilities within NI and identify factors that predispose
      residents to increased risk of deficiency. Dissemination of these findings, along with
      analysis of current supplementation practices, will help practitioners to develop a strategy
      to identify those residents with vitamin D deficiency/insufficiency and thus requiring
      supplementation ultimately improving health and well-being. This study will also inform the
      design of a larger study to investigate vitamin D status, supplementation and musculoskeletal
      health in older adults in residential care facilities within Northern Ireland, providing
      important information that will ultimately contribute towards reducing falls and fractures
      within this population.

        Older adults within residential care facilities in the Western Health and Social Care Trust
        in Northern Ireland have been selected to be studied. Residents are being investigated to
        determine vitamin D status and bone.
