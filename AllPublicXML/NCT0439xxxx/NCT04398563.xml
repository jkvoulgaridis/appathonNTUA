  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of Heart failure above 70 years of age is 10% and 5 year mortality rate above
      60%, higher than for cancer. The readmission rate first after hospitalisation is 44% despite
      the availability of life prolonging and life quality enhancing treatment. There is a lack of
      resources for adequate diagnostic workup necessary for implementing evidence-based treatment.
      This projects aims at assessing the impact of guidelines based diagnostic workup and
      guidelines based treatment of heart failure on mortality and readmission rates. As the
      symptoms defining the degree of heart failure and the discharge medication only is available
      in the electronic patient files, artificial intelligence is used to retrieve this information
      to assess if treatment is according to guidelines.

      The project is using first a rule based text processing approach using IBM Watson, then
      advancing to a machine learning approach using readmission and mortality as endpoints.

      The project has access to digitally stored echocardiographic measurements as well as digital
      ECG's and lab data on 15 000 patients admitted with a diagnosis of Heart failure. If the
      retrieval of symptoms and function by artificial intelligence is successful, the next step is
      to assess if those benefitting the most from echocardiography can be identified using
      information from the ECG's, lab data or symptoms and functional capacity as described in the
      Electronic Health Records.
