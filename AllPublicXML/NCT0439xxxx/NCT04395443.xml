      family through interviews, revising previous prescriptions and hospital records.

        -  Preadmission medication history will include medications trade names, doses, frequency
           and route of administration and treatment duration and also will include the consumption
           of vitamins or herbs.The detection of medication discrepancies will be done through a
           comparison between each patient drug history already presented in the profile and drug
