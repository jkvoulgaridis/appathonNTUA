  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In patients with locally advanced oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), due to the large tumor
      burden and neck lymph node metastasis, comprehensive treatment is recommended, including
      surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy and others. Pre-operative inductive therapy can reduce
      tumor volume, increase organ retention rate, and reduce distant metastasis rate. Vascular
      endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma is
      over-expressed and associated with disease invasion and poor prognosis. The use of targeted
      therapy against VEGF can not only inhibit tumor neovascularization, but also make the
      effectiveness of chemotherapeutic agents. VEGF and VEGFR are closely related to immune
      escape. Tumor growth requires new blood vessels to supply nutrients and oxygen, and VEGF can
      stimulate neovascularization. However, tumor neovascularization is often abnormal and
      distorted, which prevents immune active substances from reaching the tumor site. After tumor
      hypoxia, high expression of VEGF will induce tumor cells to express programmed cell death
      protein-1 (PD-1), which further leads to immune escape. Targeted drugs against angiogenesis
      can relieve immunosuppression to a certain extent, and theoretically have a synergistic
      effect with anti-PD-1 immunotherapy. The innovation of this study is the combination of
      immune checkpoint inhibitor, Camrelizumab, and targeted drug against VEGFR, Apatinib, as an
      inductive therapy to treat the patients with locally advanced OSCC, followed with radical
      surgery and post-operative radiotherapy/chemoradiotherapy, the major pathologic response and
      safety will be evaluated as the primary surrogate endpoints, the 2-year survival rate and
      local recurrence rate will be the second endpoints.
