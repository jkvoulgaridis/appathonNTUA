  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Veterans with mental illness face challenges with community reintegration, including
      achieving vocational success, attaining their educational goals and going back to school, and
      maintaining a high quality of life. VA Mental Health Residential Rehabilitation Treatment
      Programs and Psychosocial Rehabilitation and Recovery Centers are designed to help Veterans
      overcome these barriers, but cognitive impairment often seen in Veterans with mental illness
      limits gains from these settings. Cognitive remediation interventions can be helpful, but
      they are either &quot;one-size fits all,&quot; and thus may not be useful for all Veterans with mental
      illness, or are too narrow in scope, focusing on specific mental illnesses, limiting
      generalizability.

      This project will test whether an objective neurophysiological biomarker, mismatch negativity
      (MMN), can better match the &quot;right&quot; Veteran to the &quot;right&quot; cognitive remediation treatment
      regardless of their specific mental health diagnosis.

      This is an observational, non-interventional study. Veterans within 4 weeks of starting
      services in VA Mental Health Residential Rehabilitation Treatment Programs (RRTP) and
      Psychosocial Rehabilitation and Recovery Centers (PRRC) will be recruited. Veterans with PTSD
      and psychosis-spectrum illnesses engaged in RRTPs and PRRCs will have their cognitive
      functioning assessed. Following this, mismatch negativity (MMN) will be assessed via
      electroencephalography (EEG). Participants will undergo a 1 hour computerized cognitive
      training program. They will be interviewed about their attitudes about EEG and computerized
      cognitive training. They will be followed monthly for a total of 4 months from study entry to
      assess recovery trajectory. This study aims to enroll 104 Veterans from the VA San Diego
      Healthcare System.

      The Specific Aims of this proposal are 1) Determine whether MMN is related to functioning,
      psychosocial recovery and treatment engagement in VA rehabilitation milieus; 2) Determine
      whether MMN is linked to cognition and predicts cognitive remediation exercise performance in
      a heterogenous group of Veterans with mental illness. The proposal will also assess
      feasibility and acceptability of using biomarker-guided cognitive rehabilitation
      interventions in VA rehabilitation settings.

      Information gained from this study will help establish a precision-medicine approach towards
      cognitive rehabilitation for Veterans with mental illness.
