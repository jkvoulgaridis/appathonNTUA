  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The vitamin D status of older adults in residential care facilities in Northern Ireland (NI)
      is currently unknown. An observation study is currently being carried out by Ulster
      University and the Western Health &amp; Social Care Trust (WHSCT) to provide data on the
      prevalence of vitamin-D deficiency among older adults within residential care facilities in
      NI. It is expected that some 40% of the cohort will be deficient in vitamin D and will
      require immediate replenishment of vitamin D status. Therefore, as a follow up to the
      observational study, an intervention study will be conducted, where participants identified
      as vitamin D deficient (25(OH)D) status &lt;30nmol/L (cut-off currently used by the WHSCT will
      be re-contacted and provided with a vitamin D supplement. The aim of this study is to
      investigate the dose and duration of vitamin D supplementation that is required to replenish
      and maintain vitamin D status in older adults with vitamin D deficiency within residential
      care facilities. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive one of two supplementation
      regimes: 3200IU/day vitamin D3 or 20,000IU/week vitamin D3. Blood samples (no more than 20ml
      per appointment) will be taken at 4 different time points: week 0, week 2, week 4 and week 8.
      These two doses are routinely used in clinical practice for remedial supplementation of
      vitamin D and have been chosen based upon their availability from manufacturers of vitamin D
      supplements. Also, albeit these doses are currently routinely used to replenish vitamin D
      status little is known on how effective they are and how soon vitamin D status is optimised.
      Clinicians can only administer medication for the management of osteoporosis (e.g.
      bisphosphonates) once vitamin D status is optimised. Therefore, measurements will be taken
      every two weeks to establish response to the remedial supplementation. This project provides
      a unique opportunity to monitor the replenishment and maintenance of vitamin D status
      following remedial supplementation more regularly (at weeks 0,2,4,8) than would be done under
      standard National Health Service care. This does and duration of vitamin D required to
      replenish vitamin D deficiency in older adults is currently ambiguous within the literature
      and clinical care.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Currently residing (â‰¥1 month) within residential care facilities in Northern Ireland
             and who have previously undertaken the observation study (full title: A
             cross-sectional analysis of vitamin D status and bone health of older adults within
             residential care facilities in Northern Ireland) and have been identified as vitamin D
             deficient.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants will be excluded from the study if by the judgement of the consultant
             rheumatologist that they have very abnormal bone or vitamin D metabolism due to
             conditions such as end stage renal failure or bone metastases.
