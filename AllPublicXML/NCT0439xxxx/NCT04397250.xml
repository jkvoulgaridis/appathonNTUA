  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Persons with chronic paraplegia at an increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease and
      type-2 diabetes compared to the able-bodied population. There is mounting evidence from the
      able-bodied literature that high-intensity interval training (HIIT) is an effective way to
      improve cardiometabolic health outcomes, but this effect has yet to be investigated in
      persons with chronic paraplegia.

      This study is recruiting adults (aged 18-65 years) with paraplegia (T2 or below) who
      sustained their spinal cord injury more than one-year ago. Participants will need to attend
      the laboratory at the University of Bath on two occasions (baseline and follow-up testing)
      separated by eight weeks. Following the first visit, participants will be randomised to a
      exercise group or control group. For those in the exercise group, participants will be
      provided with an arm crank ergometer for use in their home, and be asked to perform four
      exercise sessions per week (30 min each) for six weeks. For those in the control group,
      participants will be asked to continue their normal lifestyle.

    <textblock>
      The aim of this research is to determine the effect of HIIT (vs. a control group) on
      biomarkers of cardiometabolic health in persons with chronic paraplegia.

      Baseline and follow-up assessments:

      Before each visits, participants will be asked to refrain from any strenuous physical
      activity (2 days prior), consume no caffeine (including tea or coffee) or alcohol (1 day
      prior), and have fasted for at least 10 hours overnight before arriving to the University of
      Bath laboratories.

      There will be measurements of basic anthropometrics (height, weight, waist and hip
      circumference), body composition (via a DEXA scan), resting metabolic rate, sub-maximal and
      maximal exercise capacity, and blood responses following the consumption of a sugary drink.

      Physical activity and diet monitoring:

      Participants will be asked to monitor their normal diet (weighed food diary) and physical
      activity patterns (chest-worn strap) over a 1-week period following the first visit, and in
      the final week of the 6-week intervention/control period.

      Exercise intervention:

      The 6-week exercise programme or control will start two weeks after the first lab visit.
      Participants in the exercise group will be asked to wear a heart-rate monitor for all
      exercise sessions, and upload their data to a smartphone for remote-monitoring by the
      research team.
