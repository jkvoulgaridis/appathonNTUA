  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multivessel TALENT is a prospective, randomized, multi-center study comparing clinical
      outcomes between SUPRAFLEX Cruz and SYNERGY in approximately 1550 patients with de-novo three
      vessel disease undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Patients will be treated
      according to &quot;state of art PCI&quot;; not only treatment strategies based on the latest ESC
      guideline, such as SYNTAX Score II recommendation, Heart Team discussion, post-procedure
      intravascular imaging optimization, cholesterol reduction by statin or PCSK-9 inhibitor, but
      also exploratory treatment strategies based on the latest evidence, such as physiological
      assessment using quantitative flow ratio and prasugrel monotherapy following 1-month dual
      antiplatelet therapy after PCI.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female patients' ≥18 years.

          2. At least 1 stenosis (angiographic, visually determined de novo lesions with ≥50% DS)
             in all 3 major epicardial territories (LAD and/or side branch, LCX and/or side branch,
             RCA and/or side branch) supplying viable myocardium without left main involvement.

          3. The vessel should have a reference vessel diameter ranging from ≥2.25 mm to ≤4.50 mm
             (no limitation on the number of treated lesions, vessels, or lesion length).

             according to local practice).

          4. Known contraindication to medications such as Aspirin, Heparin, Bivalirudin, Prasugrel
             and Ticagrelor.

          5. Prior PCI or prior CABG.

          6. Ongoing ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).

          7. Cardiogenic shock is also an exclusion criteria.

          8. Concurrent medical condition with a life expectancy of less than 2 years.

          9. Currently participating in another trial and not yet at its primary endpoint.

         10. Patient with both ostial LAD and ostial LCX stenosis, or left main stenosis.

         11. Previous intracranial haemorrhage.
