  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Eye tracking is the process of measuring an individual's eye movements in order to reflect
      their attentional behavior by using a device called an eye- tracker.

      This study uses eye-tracking methodology to observe the gaze patterns of participants to a
      high fidelity simulation scenario of postpartum hemorrhage acting in the role of leader to
      evaluate the relationship between eye-tracking patterns and leadership and team behavioral
      and technical skills.

  <detailed_description>

      This study will include 5 groups of anesthesia trainees consisting of 5 participants each.
      Each group will practice a standardized high-fidelity scenario on postpartum hemorrhage (PPH)
      which will be repeated for four times. All the scenarios will be video recorded.

      All groups will receive a technical briefing on the PPH guidelines before the scenario, and
      after having assigned to each participant a role (leader anesthesiologist, junior
      anesthesiologist, obstetrician, and midwife) they will practice a standardized 15 minutes
      scenario with a high fidelity manikin. A debriefing with an expert debriefer will be
      performed after each scenario.

      The participant acting as the leader will practice the scenario while wearing a pair of
      eye-tracking glasses (Tobii Pro Glasses 50 Hz wearable wireless eye-tracker). All the
      eye-tracking video-recordings will be stored and analyzed by using a Tobii Pro Lab Software.
      Specific areas of interest (AOI), to define regions of a displayed stimulus, and to extract
      metrics specifically for those regions will be selected. Number and duration of fixations,
      visit counts and their duration for each area of interest and for each scenario will be
      examined. Eye-tracking metrics will be mapped as gaze plots and heat maps. Two independent
      observers will review the scenario video recordings and will assing a score to the leader and
      team behavioral and technical skills. These scores will be correlated to eye tracking
      metrics.
