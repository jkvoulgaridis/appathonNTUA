  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety, tolerability, and recommended phase 2
      dose (RP2D) of TAK-573 when used with dexamethasone and in combination with bortezomib,
      pomalidomide, or cyclophosphamide, in participants with RRMM.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug that is being tested in this study is called TAK-573. The study will evaluate the
      safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of TAK-573 when used in
      combination with dexamethasone and either bortezomib, pomalidomide or cyclophosphamide in
      participants with RRMM.

      The study will be conducted in 2 phases: Dose Escalation Phase and Dose Expansion Phase. The
      study will enroll approximately 135 participants (approximately 60 participants in Dose
      Escalation Phase and approximately 75 participants in Dose Expansion Phase). The dose
      escalation phase will determine the recommended dose of TAK-573 along with the combination
      agents for the dose expansion phase.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in the United States, Germany, France, Spain, and
      Canada. The overall time to participate in this study is approximately 3 years. Participants
      will be followed up for 30 days after the last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.

    <ipd_description>Takeda makes patient-level, de-identified data sets and associated documents available for all interventional studies after applicable marketing approvals and commercial availability have been received (or program is completely terminated), an opportunity for the primary publication of the research and final report development has been allowed, and other criteria have been met as set forth in Takeda's Data Sharing Policy (see www.TakedaClinicalTrials.com for details). To obtain access, researchers must submit a legitimate academic research proposal for adjudication by an independent review panel, who will review the scientific merit of the research and the requestor's qualifications and conflict of interest that can result in potential bias. Once approved, qualified researchers who sign a data sharing agreement are provided access to these data in a secure research environment.</ipd_description>
