  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After being informed the study and potential risk, patients was provided written informed
      consent prior to initiating therapy. The chemotherapy regimen including docetaxel, cisplatin,
      5-fluorouracil, and leucovorin was administered every 14 days for six cycles or until disease
      progression or intolerant treatment toxicity.
