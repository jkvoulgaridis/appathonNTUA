  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose is to evaluate the impact of hypnosis coupled with MEOPA (Equimolar
      Mix-ture of Nitrogen Protoxide and Oxygen) on patient comfort when performing
      transoesophageal echocardiographies.

      Further studies on the use of MEOPA alone or the technique of hypnosis alone in the context
      of an TEE, would not be innovative in any way in view of previous studies or already in
      progress.

      However, service has led to perform TEEs several times by combining MEOPA and hypnosis.
      Doctors noted a clear reduction in induction time for hypnosis and satisfaction of the
      patient and operators. This association technique is very often used in pediatrics.

      According to one study, it seems that MEOPA increases the threshold of suggestibility and
      imagination. However suggestion and imagination are two essential notions of the hypnotic
      technique. To date, doctors have not found any other studies combining MEOPA and hypnosis for
      adults patients in the context of TEE.

      This leads to the following hypothesis: Is there a difference for the patient in terms of for
      the global management of pain and anxiety between an TEE performed under MEOPA with a
      standard support and TEE under MEOPA coupled with hypnosis with support standard?

      Secondary purposes are:

        1. Compare patients' feelings / opinions: patients who have benefited from hypnosis
           associated with MEOPA versus patients who have been treated with MEOPA alone.

        2. Compare patient stress: patients who have benefited from hypnosis associated with MEOPA
           versus patients who have benefited from MEOPA alone.

        3. Compare the operators' feelings / opinions: procedures that have been performed under
           hypno-analgesia and MEOPA versus standard procedures under MEOPA alone.

        4. Failed the TEE procedure
