  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of Part 1 of the study is to determine the safety and efficacy of topical ocular
      ECF843 compared to topical ocular vehicle for the relief of the signs and symptoms associated
      with moderate to severe dry eye disease (DED).

      Part 2 of the study is exploratory only and intended to explore potential areas of
      differentiation between ECF843 and Xiidra® (lifitegrast 5% ophthalmic solution) for the
      treatment of subjects with dry eye disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted in 2 parts: Part 1 - efficacy and safety of ECF843 vs vehicle,
      followed by Part 2 - exploratory assessment of ECF843 vs Xiidra®.

      Part 1 uses a double-masked design where subjects will be randomized to receive BID or TID
      treatment with either ECF843 or vehicle for 56 days.

      Part 2 will be initiated only if safety and efficacy of ECF843 during Part 1 is demonstrated.
      Part 2 uses an open-label design of ECF843 versus Xiidra® for 84 days after a 2-week vehicle
      run-in phase.

      Approximately 800 subjects will need to be screened in Part 1 to have approximately 680
      subjects randomized into the 56-day treatment period.

      For Part 2, it is estimated that up to 200 subjects will need to be screened to randomize up
      to 160 subjects into the 2 treatment arms.

    <description>The primary aim of the study is to demonstrate improvement in moderate to severe DED with ECF843. This will be evaluated by measuring signs and symptoms as primary estimands. The analysis of the primary estimands will be based on Full Analysis Set (FAS) 1.
