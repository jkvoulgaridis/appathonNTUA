  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2, randomized, two-cohort, open-label study to evaluate the comparative
      efficacy and overall safety of standard-of-care chemotherapy versus standard-of-care
      chemotherapy in combination with aldoxorubicin HCl, N-803, and PD-L1 t haNK in subjects with
      locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer. Each treatment setting (ie, first line
      maintenance, or second or later line) will be evaluated independently as a separate cohort.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age ≥ 18 years.

          2. Able to understand and provide a signed informed consent that fulfills the relevant
             IRB or IEC guidelines.

          3. Have histologically confirmed unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic
             cancer.

               1. For Cohort A, subjects must have initially received, or are currently receiving,
                  continuous treatment with gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel for at least 16 weeks
                  and have confirmed PR, CR, or SD prior to receiving first-line maintenance
                  therapy on this study. Duration of actual initial treatment may be unlimited as
                  long as no evidence of disease progression is noted by the Investigator at the
                  time of randomization.

               2. For Cohort B, subjects must have PD after receiving initial treatment with
                  FOLFOX, FOLFIRINOX, and/or a gemcitabine-based therapy for pancreatic cancer.
                  Subjects who discontinued prior therapy due to toxicity, intolerance, or
                  available therapy was clinically contraindicated are allowed.

          4. ECOG PS of 0 or 1.

          5. Have at least 1 measurable lesion and/or non-measurable disease evaluable in
             accordance with RECIST V1.1.

          6. Must have a tumor biopsy specimen and be willing to release the specimen for
             exploratory tumor molecular profiling. Specimen may be either an FFPE tumor biopsy
             specimen obtained following the conclusion of the most recent anticancer treatment or
             the subject should undergo a biopsy during the screening period, if considered safe by
             the Investigator. If safety concerns preclude collection of a biopsy during the
             screening period, a tumor biopsy specimen collected prior to the conclusion of the
             most recent anticancer treatment may be used. A tumor biopsy specimen is not required
             for subjects who have tumor molecular profiling results from previous NantOmics
             testing.

          7. Ability to attend required study visits and return for adequate follow-up, as required
             by this protocol.

          8. Agreement to practice effective contraception for female subjects of child-bearing
             potential and non-sterile males. Female subjects of child-bearing potential must agree
             to use effective contraception while on study and for at least 5 months after the last
             dose of study treatment. Non-sterile male subjects must agree to use a condom while on
             study and for up to 5 months after the last dose of study treatment. Effective
             contraception includes surgical sterilization (eg, vasectomy, tubal ligation), two
             forms of barrier methods (eg, condom, diaphragm) used with spermicide, IUDs, oral
             contraceptives, and abstinence.

        Exclusion Criteria

          1. Body weight ≤ 50 kg at screening.

          2. Serious uncontrolled concomitant disease that would contraindicate the use of the
             investigational drug used in this study or that would put the subject at high risk for
             treatment-related complications.

          3. Systemic autoimmune disease (eg, lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, Addison's
             disease, autoimmune disease associated with lymphoma).

          4. For Cohort A only: tumors harboring germline BRCA1/2 mutations.

          5. For Cohort B only: previous treatment with liposomal irinotecan for advanced or
             metastatic pancreatic cancer.

          6. History of organ transplant requiring immunosuppression.

          7. History of or active inflammatory bowel disease (eg, Crohn's disease, ulcerative
             colitis).

          8. Inadequate organ function, evidenced by the following laboratory results:

               1. Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &lt; 1000 cells/mm3.

               2. Platelet count &lt; 100,000 cells/mm3.

               3. Hemoglobin &lt; 9 g/dL.

               4. Total bilirubin greater than the upper limit of normal (ULN; unless the subject
                  has documented Gilbert's syndrome).

               5. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST [SGOT]) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT [SGPT])
                  &gt; 2.5 × ULN (&gt; 5 × ULN in subjects with liver metastases).

               6. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels &gt; 2.5 × ULN (&gt; 5 × ULN in subjects with liver
                  metastases, or &gt;10 × ULN in subjects with bone metastases).

               7. Serum creatinine &gt; 2.0 mg/dL or 177 μmol/L.

               8. Serum anion gap &gt; 16 mEq/L or arterial blood with pH &lt; 7.3.

             corticosteroids (dose equivalent to or greater than 10 mg/day methylprednisolone),
