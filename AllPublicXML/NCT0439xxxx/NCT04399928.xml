    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to determine the long-term safety and effectiveness from the
      R3 Acetabular Hip System. The study hypothesis is that implant survivorship of the R3 cup is
      at least 97% at 3 years, 95% at 5 years, 93% at 7 years, and 90% at 10 years follow-up.

    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter prospective observational post-market clinical follow-up study that
      will include 500 patients who will have total hip replacement with the R3 Acetabular System
      and either cemented or cementless hip stem.

      Effectiveness will be assessed by comparison of changes in parameters contained in the HOOS
      questionnaire and based upon incidence of revision and change in Harris Hip Score and UCLA
      Rating. Safety will be measured by assessing all adverse events experienced by patients from
      study enrolment through to study completion.

    <description>The HOOS is developed as an instrument to assess the subject's opinion about their hip and associated problems. HOOS consists of 5 subscales: Pain, other Symptoms, Function in daily living (ADL), Function in sport and recreation (Sport/Rec), and hip related Quality of Life (QOL).
Standardized answer options are given (5 Likert boxes) and each question gets a score from 0 to 4. A normalized score (100 indicating no symptoms and 0 indicating extreme symptoms) is calculated for each subscale.</description>

        This clinical study can fulfill its objectives only if appropriate subjects are enrolled.
        All relevant medical and non-medical conditions should be taken into consideration when
        deciding whether a particular patient is suitable. Subjects will be enrolled consecutively.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Subjects must meet all of the following characteristics for inclusion in the study.

          -  Patient is 18-75 years old and he/she is skeletally mature

          -  Patient requires primary total hip arthroplasty due to non-inflammatory degenerative
             joint disease (e.g. osteoarthritis, post-traumatic arthritis, avascular necrosis,
             dysplasia/DDH or inflammatory joint disease (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis)

          -  Patient has met an acceptable preoperative medical clearance and is free from or
             treated for cardiac, pulmonary, hematological, etc., conditions that would pose
             excessive operative risk

          -  The patient is willing to comply the follow-up schedule

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Subjects with any of the following characteristics must be excluded from the participation
        in the study.

          -  Patient has active infection or sepsis (treated or untreated)

          -  Patient is a prisoner or has an emotional or neurological condition that would
             pre-empt their ability or unwillingness to participate in the study including mental
             illness, mental retardation, linguistic insufficiencies (i.e. immigrants), or
             drug/alcohol abuse.
