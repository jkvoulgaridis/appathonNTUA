  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Belantamab mafodotin (GSK2857916) is an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) containing humanized
      anti- B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA) monoclonal antibody (mAb). Impaired hepatic function
      may alter the pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of belantamab mafodotin, a drug
      that is primarily hepatically eliminated and hence may require adjustments in dosing regimens
      as compared to patients who have normal hepatic function. The purpose of this study is assess
      the PK, safety, and tolerability of belantamab mafodotin monotherapy in Relapsed/Refractory
      Multiple Myeloma (RRMM) participants with impaired hepatic function and in matched RRMM
      participants with normal hepatic function. The study will consist of two parts: Part 1 will
      include participants with normal hepatic function and moderate hepatic impairment and Part 2
      will include participants with severe hepatic impairment. Participants will be administered
      GSK2857916 at a dose of 2.5 milligram per kilogram (mg/kg) intravenously in Part 1 and in
      Part 2, dose will depend on the evaluation of pharmacokinetic and safety data of Part 1.
      However, dose in Part 2 will not exceed 2.5 mg/kg. Participants will be treated with
      GSK2857916 monotherapy until confirmed disease progression, death, unacceptable toxicity,
      withdrawal of consent, or end of study, whichever occurs first. This study will include a
      screening phase, treatment phase and follow-up phase. The total duration of the study is
      approximately up to 48 months.

             pregnancy test within 72 hours of dosing on Cycle 1 Day 1 and agree to use effective
             contraception during the study and for 9 months after the last dose of study
             medication. The investigator is responsible for review of medical history, menstrual
             history, and recent sexual activity to decrease the risk for inclusion of a woman with
             an early undetected pregnancy.

             treatment to allow for clearance of any altered sperm, Plus, any of the following: Be
             abstinent from heterosexual intercourse as their preferred and usual lifestyle
             (abstinent on a long term and persistent basis) and agree to remain abstinent; or must
             agree to use a male condom even if they have undergone a successful vasectomy and
             female partner to use an additional highly effective contraceptive method with a
             failure rate of &lt;1% per year as when having sexual intercourse with a WOCBP (including
             pregnant females).
