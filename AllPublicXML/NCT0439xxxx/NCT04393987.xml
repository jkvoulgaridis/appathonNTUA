  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In bipolar disorder, treatment noncompliance is associated with high rates of recurrence and
      hospitalization. Furthermore, it is reported that that treatment noncompliance disturbs the
      social functioning of patients and reduces the quality of life. Improvement of the quality of
      life, social functioning and treatment compliance is as important as the long-term treatment
      of symptoms.This study aimed to determine the effect of treatment compliance training given
      to patients with bipolar disorder on treatment compliance, social functioning, and quality of
      life.

      The aim is to determine the effect of treatment compliance training given to patients with
      bipolar disorder on treatment compliance, social functioning, and quality of life.

      The study was conducted with 38 bipolar disorder (n=17 intervention group; n=21 control
      group) using a quasi-experimental research design. Patients were evaluated using a pre-test,
      post-test, monitoring test, &quot;Medication

      Adherence Rating Scale (MARS)&quot;, &quot;Social Functioning Scale (SFS)&quot;, and &quot;World Health
      Organization Quality of Life Instrument Short Form (WHOQOLBREF-TR).&quot; The measurements were
      taken 3 times:

      pre test, post-test and 3-months post-test.

    <intervention_model_description>The research was using quasi-experimentally research methods. The research was carried out with 19 patients enrolled in the Community Mental Health Center and 21 outpatients who were monitored in the Psychiatry Outpatient Clinic of a university and who met the inclusion criteria. The data were collected using the Participant Information Form, Medication Adherence Rating Scale, Social Functioning Scale, and World Health Organization Quality of Life Instrument Short Form. Treatment compliance training was given to the intervention group (n=19) individually once a week for a total of five sessions. No intervention was applied to the control group (n=21) following the pretest application. Post-tests were applied to the intervention group after the training and follow-up tests were applied to both groups three months after the training.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The Social Functioning Scale is a tool that evaluates role functions requiring judgment on the social role of an individual. The scale consists of seven subscales. The total score that can be obtained from this scale ranges between 0-223 points. High scores taken from each subscale indicate that there is a positive development in functioning.</description>

    <time_frame>Change from baseline to 5 weeks (also assessed at 17 weeks post-baseline)</time_frame>
    <description>World Health Organization Quality of Life Instrument Short Form consists of 26 questions and four domains. These 4 domains are physical health, psychological health, social relationships, and environment.Domain I: Physical domain: It covers the ability to conduct daily tasks, commitment to medicines and treatment, vitality and fatigue, physical mobility, pain and discomfort, sleep and rest, ability to work. Domain II: Mental domain: It covers body image and appearance, negative emotions, memory, and concentration. Domain III: Social domain: It covers the relationships with others, social support, and sexual life. Domain IV: Environmental domain: It covers financial resources, physical security, access to health services, home environment, opportunity for rest and recreation, physical environment and transportation. The quality of life increases as the score obtained from the domains increases .</description>
