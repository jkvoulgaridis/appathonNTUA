  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the combination of two drugs (AD128), to treat obstructive sleep apnea
      (OSA) severity. After a baseline evaluation and during 7 days, half of the participants will
      randomly receive this drug combination (AD128) and the other will receive a placebo, i.e. a
      drug without pharmaceutical effect. Neither the participants, nor the investigators will know
      in which arm participants are until the end of the study. After one week of trial, an
      evaluation will be perform and will be follow by one week without any treatment. During the
      third and last week of trial, there will be a crossover of the groups, i.e. the participants
      of the first group who took the two drugs (AD128) during the first week will take a placebo
      and those who took the placebo will take the drugs combination.
