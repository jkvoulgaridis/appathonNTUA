  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Surgical resection is currently the major treatment for esophageal carcinoma while disease
      progression still occurred in most cases within 3 years. The rate of local recurrence and
      distant metastases could reach nearly 40% to 60%. The neoadjuvant chemotherapy could
      significantly improve resection rate and overall survival after surgery. Squamous cell
      carcinoma is the most common histology in Asia. JCOG9907 trial performed in Japan confirmed
      that compared to surgery plus adjuvant chemotherapy, the combination of neoadjuvant
      chemotherapy and surgery could further prolong overall survival. The regimen of cisplatin and
      fluorouracil is a classic effective option in combination therapy for esophageal carcinoma.
      Nanoparticle albumin-bound (nab)-paclitaxel is a novel taxane and has better efficacy in
      esophageal carcinoma treatment. We try to evaluate the efficacy and safety of neoadjuvant
      chemotherapy with nab-paclitaxel plus cisplatin and capecitabine for locally advanced
      thoracic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma patients.
