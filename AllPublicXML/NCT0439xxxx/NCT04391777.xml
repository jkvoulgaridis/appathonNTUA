  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to analyze the influence of the fourth ventricle compression technique in
      heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure, conductivity and thermal variability of the
      skin in healthy young adults.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The fourth ventricle compression technique (CV-4) is one of the most important techniques in
      the treatment of cranial osteopathy.

      During the present study, the effects of CV-4 technique will be analyzed in the following
      variables: heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure, conductivity and thermal variation
      of the skin.

      According to the literature, CV-4 technique will cause changes in all of the studied
      variables, except the respiratory rate, through the activation of the brain stem, namely the
      parasympathetic nerve centers.

      Regarding the respiratory rate, it is justified by the fourth ventricle and the respiratory
      centers proximity.

      Concerning heart rate and respiratory rate, during the CV-4 technique the literature
      describes a decrease in the values of this variables. However, other studies refer that the
      technique does not produce relevant effects in the heart and respiratory rates variation,
      probably because there was no stipulated time to finish the technique, ending subjectively
      compared to previous ones.

      When it comes to blood pressure, a decrease in systolic blood pressure values is noticed by
      some authors.

      In which concerns the variation in body temperature, according to the literature, there were
      no significant results obtained when performing CV-4.

      During the performed literature analysis,there were not found any studies concerning the
      influences of the CV-4 technique in the thermal conductivity variable.

    <description>The participant is in the supine position and the principal investigator is seated at the patient's head, with elbows resting on the table. The main investigator overlaps his hands with the thenar eminences, contacting the occipital bone squamous part, between the external occipital protuberance and the participant's occipito-mastoid suture. The technique begins with a maintained compression on the occipital squamous part during a deep thorax exhalation. Throughout the compression of the occipital bone and the participant's voluntary inspirations, the principal investigator feels a gradual pressure increase at the thenar eminences. The technique will be performed until reaching the still point, in which the mobility of the occipital bone, respiratory rate and muscle tone decrease, or until 5 minutes elapsed.</description>
