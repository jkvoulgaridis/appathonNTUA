  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      &quot;La Casa nel Parco&quot; (CANP) Project is a multidisciplinary project funded by the European
      Union and Regione Piemonte aimed to explore innovative technology application in the care of
      older subjects. In this context, ADAMO is a single arm open label trial evaluating the
      capability of a wearable watch device to correctly detect fall events in community-dwelling
      older subjects aged 75 years and older, at high risk of falls. Secondary objectives of the
      study are to identify specific patterns on telemetric measures and health status variations
      able to predict future fall events, and to evaluate the tolerability and the influence on
      patient's quality of life of this wearable device.

      The main objectives of the study are to evaluate the impact of the intervention on 1)
      medication adherence after discharge 2) medication appropriateness.

    <description>Patient's quality of life will be evaluated both at enrollment and at 6 months through the five levels EQ-5D (EQ-5D-3L) Questionnaire, exploring the five dimensions of mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety depression (each dimension scored 1-3, with 3 indicating worse problems), and a general measure of perceived health on a Visual Analogue Scale (EQ-VAS), scored 0-100 (with 100 indicating the best perceived health possible)</description>

    <description>Every study participant will be given a wearable watch device at the beginning of the study and will be instructed on how to use the device and to wear it continuously throughout the duration of the study (6 months total follow-up). The device will register biometric data and automatically archived. During the follow-up period both healthcare personnel and investigators will not be aware of data (including fall events) registered by the experimental device.</description>
