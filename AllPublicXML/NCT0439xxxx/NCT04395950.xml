  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the effects of an investigational drug, PF-05221304
      (PF'1304) on the way the liver handles fat. The planned study will identify why the fat in
      the blood increases at the same time this drug reduces fat in the liver. The study will have
      two treatment periods of 6 weeks each, separated by a 3 week rest period with no treatment.
      The subjects will receive the active drug in one of the 6 week treatment periods and a
      placebo in the other 6 week period. The investigators will know when the subjects are
      receiving active treatment or placebo, but the subject will not know.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) is a condition in which fat builds up in the liver.
      As its name suggests, it is not associated to heavy alcohol use. Non-Alcoholic
      Steatohepatitis (NASH) is a condition of liver inflammation and damage that is caused by the
      buildup of fat in the liver. It is usually associated with prediabetes, diabetes (high blood
      sugar in the blood), a high concentration of fat (triglycerides) in the blood, and obesity
      (increase in fat all over the body). The signs and symptoms of NASH are often not seen until
      the liver is damaged beyond repair, making NASH very difficult to diagnose (be picked up by
      your doctor) in its early stages where treatments might be able to reverse the damage. There
      are no treatments currently approved for people with NASH but several new medications are
      under study in people with NAFLD or NASH. This study uses a treatment being developed for
      treating NASH. The investigators will conduct a study to assess the effects of PF-05221304
      (PF'1304) on the way the liver handles fat. In early studies, this new drug has shown promise
      for lowering the level of fat in the liver. However, it also, unexpectedly, increases the
      level of fat in the blood, which could increase the risk of heart disease and inflammation of
      the pancreas

             months.

          -  Subjects may have diabetes but must have an HbA1C ≤ 8.0% with glycemic control either
             non-pharmacologically managed or pharmacologically managed with stable doses of up to

             insulin or an injectable (glucagon like peptide-1 (GLP-1) inhibitor may be enrolled at
             the discretion of the investigators.

             may be included).

          -  Any other disease, condition, or laboratory value that, in the opinion of the
             principal investigator or clinical study team would place the subject at an
             unacceptable risk or interfere with the evaluation of the investigative product.

          -  History of organ transplantation (other than corneal).

          -  History of hepatobiliary malignancy even if subject &quot;cured&quot;.

          -  Pancreas divisum or a congenital abnormality of the pancreas

          -  History of pancreatic surgery.

             cyclosporine (the major clearance mechanism of PF-05221304 is active uptake into liver
             (mainly via hepatic transporters OATP1B1/1B3) followed by hepatic carbonyl reductase
             1, 11b-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, and CYP 3A4/5-mediated metabolism. It is
             anticipated that potent OATP inhibitors may increase plasma concentrations of
             PF-05221304. As such, subjects treated with clinically relevant OATP inhibitors will
             be excluded from this study).

             these include: alfentanil, astemizole, cisapride, cyclosporine, dihydroergotamine,
             ergotamine, fentanyl, pimozide, quinidine, sirolimus, tacrolimus, and terfenadine will
             be reason for exclusion.
