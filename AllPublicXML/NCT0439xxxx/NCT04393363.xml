  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a common, but not well understood
      complication to treatment with chemotherapy. In this study the investigators will investigate
      a novel method for early detection of CIPN and compare it to other methods in patients
      treated for haematological cancers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Haematological malignancies can be treated with chemotherapy if the patient tolerates the
      treatment. However, many patients develop complications during treatment including
      chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) and/or impaired memory. Even though it is a
      well-known complication, no gold standard for CIPN assessment is known. Besides chemotherapy
      reduction or cessation, there is so far no sufficient prevention or treatment, therefore
      early detection and intervention is crucial.

      The main purpose of this study is to find a reliable test for chemotherapy-induced peripheral
      neuropathy (CIPN) in order to predict early signs of CIPN. All included patients has to be
      scheduled for treatment with vincristine, bortezomib or lenalidomide regardless of
      haematological malignancy. Neuropathy and cognitive impairment will be tested at baseline
      (prior to treatment with chemotherapy), before each treatment course, 1 month after treatment
      and finally 1 year after onset of chemotherapy. CIPN will be examined by different methods:
      Clinician-based assessment, objective neurophysiological parameters and patient-reported
      outcome. A novel test using Perception Threshold Tracking (PTT), developed at Aalborg
      University, is included in the study. The test investigates the nerve excitability in both
      large and small fiber nerve fibers using two different electrodes. Blood samples will be
      collected, stored, and analyzed for deficiencies correlated to neuropathy.
