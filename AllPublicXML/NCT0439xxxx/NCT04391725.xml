  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of i-PRF in the healing of through and through
      periapical lesion after periradicular surgery

    <textblock>
      Detailed patient examination will be carried out and those satisfying inclusion criteria will
      be enrolled in the study. Written informed consent will be obtained and patients will be
      randomly allocated to two groups. Entire surgical procedure will be carried out by single
      operator. After complete elevation of the flap, debridement (periradicular curettage
      -enucleation) of the bony lesion will be performed. 3 mm root-tip resection will be performed
      and root end cavity will be prepared using an ultrasonic diamond-coated retrotip. Root end
      filling will be done with mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA). In test group The i-PRF will be
      produced and incorporated with collagen will be used to fill into the defect. In the control
      group, no guided tissue regeneration technique will be used. Flap will be re-positioned and
      sutured using nonabsorbable 4-0 silk sutures.Sutures will be removed 4-7 days
      postoperatively.
