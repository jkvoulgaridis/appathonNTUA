  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The diagnoses processes of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) focus on the following four
      main types of diagnoses methods consisting of inspection, listening and smelling, inquiry,
      and palpation. The most important one is palpation also called pulse diagnosis which is to
      measure wrist artery pulse by TCM doctor's fingers to detect patient's health state. The
      pulse diagnosis has three parts, namely 'Cun', 'Guan' and 'Chi', with the location. Wrist
      measurements correspond to different parts of the body's organs.

      However, the pulse information is analyzed by TCM doctor's pulse diagnoses process, which is
      picked only a single waveform from a long-term pulse measured process and often discarded the
      other waveforms contained in the same information, e.g. Slippery Pulse waveform. The research
      object of this project is to divide the TCM diagnosis patients into two groups, one is the
      Slippery Pulse group and the other is a Normal Pulse group, in which 30 cases are collected
      in each group. The purpose of this project will integrate the TCM doctor's experiences and
      standardize them in order to construct an effective Slippery Pulse diagnosis system. It could
      refine Slippery Pulse diagnoses processes and reduce their diagnoses loading by using the
      proposed approach during this project. Therefore, we could carry out the research on feature
      extraction method of Slippery Pulse based on the image processing technology. We could
      extract the pulse characteristics of Slippery Pulse automatically from the many measurement
      signals and improve the automatic judging ability of the current pulse instrument to the
      Slippery pulse waveform. Provide important pulse information to the TCM doctors as an
      important reference for clinical diagnoses.
