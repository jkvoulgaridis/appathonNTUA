  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a single-center prospective randomized control trial that is Institutional
      Review Board (IRB) approved. The study plans to enroll 250 female patients presenting to the
      University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) for stereotactic biopsy. This study is a
      prospective and will target approximately 250 patients. This will be a HIPPA-compliant
      randomized control trial planned on spanning approximately six months' time. Patients will be
      entered into the study only based on their already scheduled stereotactic biopsy procedure.
      Patients will be informed of the study and they will be offered the opportunity to
      participate or not participate in the study. Their participation is completely voluntary.
      This study will not involve any intervention that is not already a part of standard care.
      Patients will be randomized to two groups, one group that will undergo clip placement with
      approximately with a 5 mm retraction of the biopsy clip post-placement and one that will
      involve no retraction prior to deployment.
