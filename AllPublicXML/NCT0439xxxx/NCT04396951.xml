    <textblock>
      pre and post intervention quasi-experimental epidemiological study without a control group
      will be carried out in large burned patients that will evaluate the influence on metabolic
      expenditure of the inclusion of active external rewarming in the control of body temperature.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      the heavily burned patient requires specific care to prevent hypothermia and maintain body
      temperature. You are at high risk of developing hypothermia in the acute phase due to heat
      losses from convection, radiation, evaporation, and conduction. After the acute phase, the
      patient due to physiological mechanisms and the hypermetabolic response mainly demands a
      temperature close to 38.5ºC, ruling out the infectious focus. According to the authors,
      environmental temperatures between 28-33ºC are recommended for the care of these patients to
      decrease energy expenditure. The research carried out has studied the influence of passive
      external heating (environmental regulation), without including the influence of active
      external heating (heat blankets, heating plate ...) or the study of the thermal comfort of
      large burned patients and of professionals who provide them they attend.

      A pre and post intervention quasi-experimental epidemiological study without a control group
      will be carried out in large burned patients that will evaluate the influence on metabolic
      expenditure of the inclusion of active external rewarming in the control of body temperature.
      Metabolic expenditure will be measured by indirect calorimetry in the usual treatment with
      passive external rewarming and post-intervention in the combination of passive and active
      external heating. The combination of passive and active external reheating will previously
      study the operating temperature in various cases for optimal application, as well as the
      definition of thermal comfort in the large burn unit. The specific training of the personnel
      involved in the care of these patients will be required for the application of the
      evidence-based recommendations and the evaluation of their implementation.
