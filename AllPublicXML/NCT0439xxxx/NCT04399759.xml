  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to conduct a randomized clinical trial. Implement instrumental
      daily activities of daily living (A-IADL) in home rehabilitation. To explore the effect of
      A-IADL on stroke patients' movement, cognition, social participation, daily life function and
      quality of life.

      Subjects will be randomized to intervention group and control group. The experiment is
      designed as randomized cross-over control trial. The primary outcome included 10 measures,
      Fugl-Meyer Assessment, Balance computerized adaptive testing, Mini Mental State Examination,
      Participation Measure-3 Domains ,4 Dimensions, Canadian Occupational Performance Measure,
      Barthel Index-based Supplementary Scales, Frenchay Activities Index, Lawnton Instrumental
      Activities of Daily Living, stroke impact scale and Stroke Self-Efficacy Questionnaire.
