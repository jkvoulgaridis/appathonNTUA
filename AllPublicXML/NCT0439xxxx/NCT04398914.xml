    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of pyrotinib in combination with
      trastuzumab, pertuzumab and nab-paclitaxel as neoadjuvant therapy in early stage or locally
      advanced HER2-positive breast cancer.

      The study evaluate the pathological complete response rate, event-free survival, disease-free
      survival, overall survival and safety of pyrotinib in combination with trastuzumab,
      pertuzumab and nab-paclitaxel as neoadjuvant therapy in early stage or locally advanced
      HER2-positive breast cancer. Patients will receive 4 cycles of pyrotinib in combination with
      trastuzumab, pertuzumab and nab-paclitaxel or 4 cycles of trastuzumab, pertuzumab and
      nab-paclitaxel as neoadjuvant therapy, then undergo surgery, then receive adjuvant
      chemotherapy and targeted therapy according to pathologic response and physician's choice.
