  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gestational trophoblastic neoplasias (GTN) are characterized by the persistence of elevated
      hCG titers after complete uterine evacuation of a partial hydatidiform mole (PHM) or a
      complete hydatidiform mole.

      Low-risk GTN patients (FIGO score ≤ 6) are commonly treated with single agent treatment
      (methotrexate or actinomycin-D) The cure rate, assessed by hCG normalization, is obtained in
      65 to 75% of patients with these agents GTN patients with resistance to these treatments are
      treated with another single agent drug or polychemotherapy regimens, such as EMA-CO or BEP
      regimen.

      Chemotherapy standard regimens are old and toxic for these young lady patients, with
      potential long term effects detrimental for further maternity and quality of life

      There is a strong rational for investigating the anti-PDL1 monoclonal antibody avelumab in
      chemoresistant GTN patients. Several elements suggest that the normal pregnancy immune
      tolerance is &quot;hijacked&quot; by GTN cell for proliferating :

        -  Spontaneous regressions of metastastic GTN are regularly observed, thereby the role of
           immune system for rejecting GTN cells.

        -  Strong and constant overexpression of PDL1 and NK cells has been found in all subtypes
           and settings of GTN tumors from French reference gestational trophoblastic center.

        -  Complete and durable responses to pembrolizumab were reported in 3 patients with
           multi-chemoresistant GTN in United Kingdom.

        -  Three cases of hCG normalization with avelumab in 6 patients with chemo-resistant GTN
           enrolled in TROPHIMMUN cohort A (resistant to a mono-chemotherapy).

        -  Cytotoxicity of avelumab is mediated through antibody dependent cell cytotoxicity (ADCC)
           by NK cells.
