  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label phase1/2, multi-center trial to evaluate the efficacy, safety,
      tolerability and immunogenicity of INO-3107 in participants with HPV-6 and/or HPV-11
      associated recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (RRP). The trial population is divided into
      two cohorts: Cohort A: Participants with diagnoses of Juvenile-Onset RRP as defined by age at
      first diagnosis of RRP &lt; 12 years. Cohort B: Participants with Adult-onset RRP as defined by
      age at first diagnosis of RRP ≥ 12 years. A safety run-in will be performed with up to six
      participants across cohort A and B with a one week waiting period between each enrolled
      participant.

    <description>An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical investigation participant administered a pharmaceutical product and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can include any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product. A serious adverse event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: 1. Results in death. 2. A life-threatening event; however, this does not include an event that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death. 3. Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization. 4. Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity. 5. Results in a congenital anomaly/birth.</description>

    <time_frame>Screening, Day 0, Weeks 6, 11, 26, 52, 78 and 104 (up to approximately 2 years)</time_frame>
    <description>An RRP Staging Assessment score will be determined using a modified Derkay staging tool. It includes both a subjective functional assessment of clinical parameters and an anatomic assessment of disease distribution. The anatomic score can then be used in combination with the functional score to measure an individual patient's clinical course and response to the therapy over time.</description>
