  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test whether a single dose of Lamotrigine (300mg) exerts significant effects
      on emotional processing, cognitive ability and neural activity in healthy volunteers compared
      to placebo.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Glutamate has been implicated in the aetiology of mood disorders and there is current
      interest in developing novel agents targeting this system. However, the role of glutamate in
      human emotional function is relatively unknown. Lamotrigine's pharmacological profile
      involves a blockade of voltage-gated sodium channels, leading to an inhibition in the release
      of glutamate and resulting in a general inhibitory effect on cortical neuronal function.

      The current study plans to investigate the effects of modifying glutamate on emotional
      processing, cognitive function and neural activity. For this, 36 healthy volunteers will be
      recruited to the study and randomised to receive a single dose of lamotrigine (300 mg) or
      placebo. Two hours after drug administration, the effects of emotional processing via the use
      of cognitive tasks will be assessed using fMRI. This will be followed by an emotional test
      battery that will measure aspects of cognitive function as well.
