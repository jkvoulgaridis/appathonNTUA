  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This cross-sectional study was conducted to assess i) the prevalence of probable bruxism ii)
      the association between probable bruxism and periodontal status.The age, gender, education
      level, tooth loss, presence of probable bruxism and periodontal status of patients were
      evaluated. Periodontal statuses of the participants were defined according to the American
      Association of Periodontology/European Federation of Periodontology, 2017 consensus and
      assessment of probable bruxism was performed according to the 2018 consensus report on the
      assessment of bruxism.

      This cross-sectional study was conducted to assess i) the prevalence of probable bruxism ii)
      the association between probable bruxism and periodontal status dental examination, all
      participants completed a standardized questionnaire. Sociodemographic findings comprised age,
      gender and educational level. Periodontal statuses of the participants were defined according
      to the American Association of Periodontology/European Federation of Periodontology, 2017
      consensus. Participants were diagnosed with periodontitis if interdental clinical attachment
      loss (AL) was detected at ≥2 non-adjacent teeth, or buccal or oral AL was ≥3 mm with probing
      depth &gt;3 mm was detected at ≥2 teeth. 12 In addition number of missing teeth is
      recorded.Assessment of probable bruxism was performed according to the 2018 consensus report
      on the assessment of bruxism.Presence of masticatory muscle hypertrophy, temporomandibular
      joint pain, indentations on the tongue or lip and/or a linea alba on the inner cheek, damage
      to the dental hard tissues (eg, cracked teeth), mechanical wear of the teeth (ie, attrition),
      repetive failures of restorative work/prosthodontics constructions were examined in clinical
      evaluation.

    <description>Assessment of probable bruxism was performed according to the 2018 consensus report on the assessment of bruxism. For this purpose clinical inspection, one of the non-instrumental approaches, was used to evaluate the clinical features of bruxism. Presence of masticatory muscle hypertrophy, temporomandibular joint pain, indentations on the tongue or lip and/or a linea alba on the inner cheek, damage to the dental hard tissues (eg, cracked teeth), mechanical wear of the teeth (ie, attrition), repetive failures of restorative work/prosthodontics constructions were examined in clinical evaluation.</description>
