    <textblock>
      This is a phase II single arm trial to evaluate the objective response rate of abemaciclib
      and letrozole in advanced stage, persistent or recurrent endometrioid endometrial cancer.
      Treatment will continue until either unacceptable toxicity, progression of disease, or
      investigator/patient request for withdrawal.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient must have advanced (FIGO Stage III or IV), persistent, or recurrent
             endometrial carcinoma, which is not likely to be curable by surgery or radiotherapy.
             Histologic documentation of the recurrence is not required.

          2. Patients must have endometrioid histology (all grades allowed) based on hysterectomy
             or biopsy specimen and verified by central pathology review. (Hormone receptor status
             is not required for enrollment).

          3. All patients must have measurable disease. Measurable disease is defined by RECIST
             version 1.1. Measurable disease is defined as at least one lesion that can be
             accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded). Each
             lesion must be greater than or equal to 10mm when measured by CT, MRI or caliper
             measurement by clinical exam; or greater than or equal to 20mm when measured by chest
             x-ray. Lymph nodes must be greater than or equal to 15mm in short axis when measured
             by CT or MRI.

             Patient must have at least one &quot;target lesion&quot; to be used to assess response on this
             protocol as defined by RECIST 1.1. Tumors within a previously irradiated field will be
             designated as &quot;non-target&quot; lesions unless progression is documented or a biopsy is
             obtained to confirm persistence at least 90 days following completion of radiation
             therapy.

          4. Prior chemotherapy in the adjuvant setting for Stage I, II, or III is permitted. Prior
             chemoradiotherapy for a pelvic recurrence is permitted.

             Note: No prior chemotherapy in the setting of Stage IV disease is permitted unless the
             patient was without evidence of disease at the completion of chemotherapy and had a
             least six months of progression-free survival since the completion of chemotherapy.

             Regardless of circumstances, no more than one prior chemotherapy regimen (including
             chemo-radiotherapy) is permitted.

             Patients who received prior chemotherapy must have recovered (Common Terminology
             Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE] Grade â‰¤1) from the acute effects of chemotherapy
             except for residual alopecia or Grade 2 peripheral neuropathy prior to enrollment. A
             washout period of at least 21 days is required between last chemotherapy dose and
             initiation of therapy.

             Patients who received radiotherapy must have completed and fully recovered from the
             acute effects of radiotherapy. A washout period of at least 14 days is required
             between end of radiotherapy and initiation of therapy.

          5. Patient must be able to swallow oral medications.

          6. Patient must have an ECOG performance status of 0 to 1.

          7. Patients must have adequate organ and marrow function as defined below NOTE:
             Institutional/laboratory upper limit of normal = ULN Institutional/laboratory lower
             limit of normal = LLN

             Bone marrow function:

               -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) greater than or equal to 1500/mcl

               -  Platelets greater than or equal to 100,000 cells/mcl

               -  Hemoglobin greater than or equal to 8 g/dL (Patients may receive erythrocyte
                  transfusions to achieve this hemoglobin level at the discretion of the
                  investigator. Initial treatment must not begin earlier than the day after
                  erythrocyte transfusion).

             Renal function:

             â€¢ Creatinine less than or equal to 1.5 x ULN

             Hepatic function:

               -  Bilirubin less than or equal to 1.5 x ULN (Patients with Gilbert's syndrome with
                  a total bilirubin â‰¤2 times ULN and direct bilirubin within normal limits are
                  permitted).

               -  ALT (alanine aminotransferase) and AST (aspartate aminotransferase) less than or
                  equal to 3 x ULN

             release of personal health information.

          9. Patients must be at least 18 years of age.

         10. Patients of childbearing potential must have a negative urine pregnancy test prior to
             the study entry and be practicing a highly effective form of contraception during the
             study treatment and for 8 weeks after stopping the treatment.

        Highly effective contraception methods include combination of any two of the following:

          1. Use of oral, injected, or implanted hormonal methods of contraception or;

          2. Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS);

          3. Barrier methods of contraception: condom or occlusive cap (diaphgram or cervical/vault
             caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/vaginal suppository;

          4. Total abstinence or;

          5. Male/female sterilization. Women are considered post-menopausal and not of
             child-bearing potential if they have had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea
             with an appropriate clinical profile (e.g. age appropriate, history of vasomotor
             symptoms) or have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy)
             or tubal ligation at least six weeks prior to randomization. In the case of
             oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed
             by follow up hormone level assessment is she considered not of child-bearing
             potential.
