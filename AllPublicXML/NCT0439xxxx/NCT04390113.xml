    <textblock>
      A study to evaluate Viralym-M; an allogeneic, off-the-shelf multi-virus specific T cell
      therapy that targets six viral pathogens: BK virus, cytomegalovirus, adenovirus, Epstein-Barr
      virus, human herpesvirus 6 and JC virus.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study hypothesis is that the administration of Viralym-M to patients with
      virus-associated HC will demonstrate superiority for the time to resolution of HC (as
      measured by resolution of macroscopic hematuria) compared to patients treated with placebo.
      The primary hypothesis will be tested in patients with BK virus (BKV) viruria to demonstrate
      superiority over placebo in this population (BK Intent-to-Treat [ITT] Population). A
      supplementary analysis will be conducted in all patients with any virus-associated HC
      (cytomegalovirus [CMV], human herpesvirus 6 [HHV-6], Epstein-Barr virus [EBV], JC virus
      [JCV], and/or adenovirus [AdV]) in order to evaluate efficacy in this broader population (ITT
      Population).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Had an allogeneic HCT performed at least 21 days and not more than 1 year prior to
             randomization.

          -  Myeloid engraftment confirmed, defined as an absolute neutrophil count ≥500/mm³ for 3
             consecutive laboratory values obtained on different days, and platelet count
             &gt;10,000/mm³ at the time of randomization.

          -  Diagnosed with HC based on the following criteria (all 3 criteria must be met):

               1. Clinical signs and symptoms of cystitis, including dysuria, lower abdominal pain,
                  and/or other bladder-associated pain or spasms.

               2. Grade ≥3 hematuria (per Bedi scale).

               3. Viruria of &gt;5 log10 copies/mL of at least 1 target virus (ie, BKV, JCV, AdV, CMV,
                  EBV, and/or HHV-6).

          -  At least 1 identified, suitably matched Viralym-M cell line for infusion is available.
             (If a Viralym-M line is not available, the following patient data will be collected:
             demographic data and human leukocyte antigen [HLA] type.)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Ongoing therapy with high-dose systemic corticosteroids (ie, prednisone dose &gt;0.5
             mg/kg/day or equivalent).

          -  Prior therapy with antithymocyte globulin, alemtuzumab (Campath-1H), or other
             immunosuppressive T cell-targeted monoclonal antibodies within 28 days of
             randomization.

          -  Presence of uncontrolled or progressive bacterial or fungal infections (ie, evidence
             of bacteremia, fungemia, dissemination, and/or organ-specific infection not well
             controlled by present therapies).

          -  Presence of progressive, uncontrolled viral infections (ie, evidence of viremia,
             dissemination, and/or organ-specific infection not well controlled by present
             therapies) not targeted by Viralym-M.

          -  Uncontrolled or progressive EBV-associated post-transplant lymphoproliferative
             disorder.
