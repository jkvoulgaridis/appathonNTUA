      This qualitative study evaluates the acceptability of positioning pregnant women in labour in
      an optimized position, which consists in the hyperflexion of the legs and the loss of the
      lumbar lordosis. Twenty patients in situation of dystocia will adopt the described position
      for a limited amount of time.

      Recent data brings out that the Caesarian Section rate in Switzerland is quite high, reaching
      33.4 %. Though, the reasons to this increasing amount of CS are not fully known. Therefore,
      it is absolutely necessary to expand the existing knowledge in different fields, including
      the biomechanics of childbirth. Numerous CS are performed in response to an obstructed
      labour, especially when the foetus does not engage in the pelvis near full dilatation. In
      order to manage such situations, midwifes currently position parturients in pragmatic
      postures. Although not verified by data, this care management suggests that it is possible to
      impact the position of the bone segments at stake for vaginal birth including pelvis and
      lumbar spine and to promote the descent of the foetus through the pelvic inlet plane. In his
      PhD thesis about vaginal birth biomechanics, Desseauve et al investigated this area and found
      out that an optimized position similar to the squatting position (hyperflexion of the thighs
      and loss of the lumbar lordosis) could be close to the perfect delivery position in terms of
      ability for the foetus to go through the pelvic inlet plane. Although these findings are
      encouraging, it is yet to be confirmed in clinical practice, particularly when a dystocia
      occurs. Prior to doing that, it is though necessary to validate the optimized posture in
      terms of acceptability in a qualitative clinical study. In this study, fifteen to twenty
      parturients who respond to the inclusion criteria and whose foetus does not engage in the
      pelvis near full dilation will be asked to adopt the optimized position for a twenty minutes
      period. The investigator will then consign information reflecting the progress of the labour
      on a data sheet.
