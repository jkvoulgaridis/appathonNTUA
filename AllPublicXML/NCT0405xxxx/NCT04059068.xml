    <textblock>
      Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is present in one third of the population and due
      to its potential to cause irreversible liver damage and liver cancer, it is a significant
      health burden. There is a strong link between obesity and NALFD. As fat accumulates, the body
      is unable to process it, leading to unhealthy fat metabolism. Currently, other than lifestyle
      measures and better control of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) with medication, there is no
      drug that can prevent or reverse the liver damage. Furthermore, there is no easy way to
      identify which person will go on to develop the liver damage.

      Mounting evidence suggests that inflammation in the fat has a key role in driving liver
      damage, particularly by the immune cell called the macrophage. However, detailed mechanisms
      are lacking. Therefore, the aim of this proposal is to study obese patients with NAFLD to
      better understand the link between unhealthy fat metabolism and liver damage, focusing on
      identifying macrophage-derived drug targets which can potentially reverse the liver disease.
      Samples of fat and liver from patients who are having bariatric surgery at Imperial College
      Healthcare NHS Trust will be analysed to identify and target the inflammatory markers of
      unhealthy fat and NAFLD using genetic profiling techniques.

      NAFLD is a huge health burden and can lead to liver damage,scarring and cancer, therefore
      gaining a further understanding of the mechanisms involved in causing liver damage is
      particularly important to identify drug targets that could reverse this process.

      White adipose tissue (WAT) or fat fails to respond normally in obesity which leads to fat
      deposition in other organs, particularly the liver, and the fat tissue becomes inflamed. The
      inflammation in the fat is lead by specific immune cells called macrophages. This
      inflammatory state in the fat tissue is thought to be a precursor to liver inflammation and
      liver damage. This has been demonstrated in mouse models where the fat inflammatory cells
      contributed to liver inflammation and worsened liver damage, emphasising the importance of
      the relationship between fat tissue and the liver in NAFLD.

      Liver damage or liver fibrosis is also the result of activation of these inflammatory cells,
      the macrophages, in the liver which drive scarring through cells called fibroblasts that lay
      down collagen. Therefore, understanding the interaction between the cells involved in
      inflammation (macrophages) and scarring (fibroblasts) in both the fat and the liver is key to
      identifying potential drug targets for reversal of this process.

      Our lab demonstrated, using an obese animal model, that the release of pro-fibrotic compounds
      called prostagladins from the fat macrophages is linked to NAFLD and liver inflammation.
      Based on these results the investigators aim to deepen the understanding of the link between
      fat and liver inflammation and damage specifically looking at cell interactions (the
      macrophage and fibroblast) by using genetic tests on liver and fat samples in obese patients.
