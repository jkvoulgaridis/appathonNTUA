    <description>Group 1 - Extraction Socket Management: If the second CBCT shows favourable results, implant placement will be performed. Depending on the clinician's choice, a CAD-CAM surgical guide could be prepared to facilitate proper positioning of the implant(s). Access to the bone crest will be made with an as minimally-invasive surgical approach as possible, depending on the surgeon's choice.
The drilling procedure will be performed according to the manufacturer's instructions for the placement the implant(s); during this drilling procedure, the clinician will determine if the bone quality is sufficient for placing the implant(s).</description>

  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Implant success</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year after after definitive prosthesis delivery</time_frame>
    <description>Implant Success will be defined in accordance with the criteria proposed by van Steenberghe. Answering yes or no to the following statements:
The implant causes allergic, toxic or gross infectious reactions either locally or systemically.
The implant offers anchorage to a functional prosthesis.
The implant shows signs of fracture or bending.
The implant shows signs of peri-implant radiolucency on an intra-oral radiograph using a paralleling technique strictly perpendicular to the implant-bone interface.
The implant shows mobility when individually tested by tapping or rocking with a hand instrument.</description>
