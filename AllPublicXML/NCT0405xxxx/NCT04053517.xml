    <textblock>
      This trial studies the severity of financial distress in advanced cancer patients. The cost
      of cancer care can often be very expensive. Financial distress from the burdens of high costs
      and debt may interfere with a patient's physical symptoms and quality of life.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the frequency of high financial distress in advanced cancer patients.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the association between high financial distress with clinical and demographic
      characteristics in advanced cancer patients.

      II. To determine the correlation between In Charge Financial Distress/ Financial Well-Being
      Scale (IFDFW) and other financial distress instruments such as Comprehensive Score for
      Financial Toxicity‚ÄêFunctional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (COST-FACIT) and Edmonton
      Symptom Assessment Scale- Financial Distress (ESAS-FS).

      III. To determine the association between high financial distress with patient symptoms in
      ESAS-FS and quality of life assessed by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - General
      (FACT-G).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients complete questionnaires about financial state and quality of life over 15 minutes.
      Patients' medical chart is also reviewed.

    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>Comprehensive Score for Financial Toxicity Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (COST-FACIT) was developed as part of a series of questionnaires aimed at measuring different symptom indexes of health-related quality of life in patients with advance disease such as cancer. The survey contains 12 questions and each of them is rated from 0 (not at all) to 4 (very much). This survey focuses on financial distress caused by illness in patients with cancer. It takes about 5 minutes to complete.</description>
