    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well PAT-1251 works in treating patients with primary
      myelofibrosis, post-polycythemia vera myelofibrosis, or post-essential thrombocytosis
      myelofibrosis. PAT-1251 may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes
      needed for cell growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the efficacy of LOXL2 inhibitor PAT-1251 (PAT-1251) as therapy for primary
      myelofibrosis (PMF), post-polycythemia vera (PV) myelofibrosis (MF), and post-essential
      thrombocytosis (ET) MF.

      II. To determine the objective response of PAT-1251 treatment which is defined as CR
      (complete remission) + PR (partial remission) + CI (clinical improvement) after three and six
      cycles of treatment.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety of PAT-1251 as therapy for PMF, post-PV MF and post-ET MF.

      II. To determine time to response and response duration. III. To assess changes in symptom
      burden as assessed by Myeloproliferative Neoplasm Symptom Assessment Form Total Symptom Score
      (MPN-SAF TSS).

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To explore changes in bone marrow reticulin fibrosis, collagen, osteosclerosis (grading).

      II. To determine the percent target engagement based on a plasma target engagement assay
      after treatment with PAT-1251.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive LOXL2 inhibitor PAT-1251 orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28. Cycles
      repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days.
