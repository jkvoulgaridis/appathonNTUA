    <textblock>
      Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) is a condition where a person's own good and
      useful germs, live in parts of the bowel where there should not be any germs. It may cause
      difficult tummy and bowel symptoms in a wide variety of patient groups. Increasing evidence
      suggests that sometimes small intestinal bacterial overgrowth can also trigger or worsen
      diseases which do not have any bowel symptoms at all.

      It is hugely under-diagnosed in clinical practice. Part of the reason for this is that
      current available diagnostic tests - culture of fluid sampled from the upper part of the
      gastrointestinal tract or breath testing, are complicated to do, difficult for the patient,
      and are not completely accurate. Therefore, the potential for a simple, more accurate test to
      revolutionise the diagnosis and aid with the treatment of this condition is immense.

      When it is accurately diagnosed, treatment with antibiotics can cure the patient of their
      tummy or bowel symptoms.

      Based on previous research the investigators have conducted, it is believed that it might be
      possible to diagnose this condition in a simpler and more accurate way by examining urine
      samples. This study will also investigate whether the condition could be diagnosed more
      accurately using a blood test, a different sort of breath test or using a mouth swab.

      The proposed study will be conducted at Lincoln County Hospital, in collaboration with Joseph
      Banks Laboratory at the University of Lincoln. Additional urine, blood, swab and breath
      samples from patients with and without small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, before and
      after antibiotic treatment to identify specific molecular markers in urine, blood and saliva
      samples which diagnosis small intestinal bacterial overgrowth accurately.

    <description>The Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale is a self-assessed questionnaire consistsing of 32 individual gastrointestinal symptoms which are categorised into olfactory, upper GI, lower GI and anorectal subgroups. Each of the 32 items has a score of 0-3 (a high score represent a higher severity of the symptom). All 32 subscores will add up to give a total score.</description>
