      To characterise the safety and tolerability of NG-641 in patients with metastatic or advanced
      epithelial tumours.

      The Phase Ia part of the study is a dose escalation and dose expansion phase investigating
      NG-641 administration by intratumorural injection (IT) and intravenous (IV) infusion in a
      range of tumour types

      The Phase Ib part of the study is to investigate safety and efficacy of NG-641 as monotherapy
      or in combination with chemotherapy agents and/or checkpoint inhibitors in separate efficacy
      cohorts of patients with specific epithelial tumour types.

             study treatment administration, impair the ability of the patient to receive protocol
             therapy or interfere with the interpretation of study results

         23. Previous treatment with enadenotucirev or FAP targeting agents
