  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the present study is to investigate the effects of additional functional
      inspiratory muscle training in individuals with non-specific chronic neck pain.

    <textblock>
      Patients participating in the study will be divided two parallel groups. The patients in
      study group will instruct to perform both functional inspiratory muscle training and
      conventional treatments for neck pain, the patients in the control group will instruct to
      perform just conventional treatments. The severity of the pain, disability, fear of movement
      and depression levels will be assessed by visual analog scale, neck disability index, Tampa
      Scale of kinesiophobia and beck depression inventory, respectively. Neck postures
      (craniovertebral angle) will be evaluated by photogrammetric method.Endurance of deep
      cervical flexor muscles will be measured using Stabilizer Pressure Biofeedback Unit with
      cranio-cervical flexion test. Pain threshold will be measured by algometer from the middle
      point of upper trapezius. Cervical proprioceptions will be evaluated by laser pointer method
      in the right and left rotational directions. In addition, diaphragma thickness will be
      measured by two-dimensional ultrasonography. Assessments were repeated before and after the
      treatment.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in Pain Severity</measure>
    <time_frame>change from baseline in pain severity at 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Patients' resting pain intensities will be assessed by Visual Analog Scale. (a 10 cm horizontal line). There is two anchors in the tips of the visual analog scale and while the zero represented &quot;no pain&quot;, ten indicated &quot;excessive pain&quot;. The length from the zero to marked point was recorded in cm.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in Disability</measure>
    <time_frame>change from baseline in disability at 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Patients' disability levels will be assessed by neck disability index. The questionnaire has ten sections; pain intensity, personal care, lifting, reading, headaches, concentration, work, driving, sleeping, and recreation. Each item is scored between zero (no disability) and five (total disability). The maximum score is therefore 50. Higher scores indicates having more disability.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in Fear of Movement</measure>
    <time_frame>change from baseline in disability at 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Patients' fear of movement will be assesed by Tampa Kinesiophobia Scale. The scale has 17 pain statements, and the patient selected her agreement for each question using a 4-point scale. The maximum score is 68. Higher score indicates having more fear of movement.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in Depression</measure>
    <time_frame>change from baseline in disability at 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Patients' depression levels will be assessed by Beck Depression Inventory. composed 21 questions. The maximum total score is 63. Higher scores demonstrate greater level of depression</description>

    <description>Conventional program plus functional inspiratory muscle training will be carried out three sessions per week during the six weeks. The content of the program will be the same as for the conventional group. Additional functional inspiratory muscle training will be began with 50% of the maximal inspiratory pressure value in a specific device and it will be progressed 5% every week according to the tolerance.</description>
