      Proposal of a &quot;rapid typing&quot; technique by a new real-time PCR method, simpler, faster and
      cheaper than nucleotide sequencing (reference method) for rapid typing in Adenovirus
      infections.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adenoviruses cause many infections, mainly respiratory and gastroenteric, in pediatrics.

      They also behave as opportunistic agents in 10% of hematopoietic stem cell recipients. In
      these immunocompromised persons, these infections are all the more frequent as the graft is
      of placental origin and the recipient a child (20%). They are then willingly disseminated and
      potentially deadly; their treatment is based on cidofovir, a viral agent that is very
      sensitive to handling.

      Adenoviruses, which have a high genetic diversity, are classified into 7 types. According to
      some observations, still limited, some types of Adenovirus would show a higher pathogenicity
      (types C and A). Thus, viral typing may be prognostic for immunocompromised patients,
      justifying the initiation of an earlier specific treatment when identifying certain more
      pathogenic viral types, in addition to measuring the viral load, already performed by
      quantitative PCR.

      For this purpose, this study proposes a &quot;fast typing&quot; technique by new real-time PCR method,
      simpler, faster and cheaper than nucleotide sequencing, reference method.
