    <textblock>
      This study will create and test an enhanced critical congenital heart defect (CCHD) screen
      that combines non-invasive measurements of oxygenation and perfusion in two ways. The first
      will use current equipment without automated interpretation and the second will require
      additional software/device but will automate the interpretation. To work towards development
      of those two algorithms in this stage of the study, the study team will download oxygen
      saturation (SpO2) and perfusion index (PIx) measurements from newborns with and without
      congenital heart disease (CHD) and apply statistical tests to the data afterwards to identify
      parameters to include in the newly developed screening algorithms. The overall objective is
      to create an automated screening algorithm to improve acyanotic CCHD detection, preventing
      morbidity and mortality associated with diagnoses missed by SpO2 screening. The central
      hypothesis is that the addition of non-invasive perfusion measurements to SpO2 will be
      superior to SpO2-alone screening for detection of acyanotic CCHD. The data collected during
      this study will be used to develop the two algorithms and the algorithms will be compared to
      the standard of care using statistical tests on the data after the fact (k-fold validation).
      The newly developed algorithms will not be tested in-situ on patients during this study.

    <description>A CCHD screening algorithm will be created by simultaneously measuring oxygen saturation, perfusion index, and pulse oximetry waveform analysis from right upper and any lower extremity in newborns with and without CHD. Investigators will use cross-validation to test the newly developed algorithms and estimate AUROC for the specified types of heart defects. For purposes of defining primary and secondary criterion variables, the CHD will be considered present or absent at enrollment when the infant is less than 8 days of age according to the latest diagnostic assessment available for the infant (echocardiogram and/or physical examination). Because some CHDs can be diagnosed at later dates despite earlier negative diagnostic evaluations, investigators will reconfirm the presence or absence of the outcome at a minimum of 6 weeks of age for all patients except those who die or are lost to follow-up.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age &lt; 8 days

          -  and either: a) asymptomatic newborn undergoing SpO2 screening for CCHD, or 2b) newborn
             prenatally or postnatally diagnosed/suspected with CHD.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  For Controls: Echocardiogram completed prior to enrollment as the newborn would then
             no longer be considered &quot;asymptomatic undergoing SpO2 screening for CCHD&quot;

          -  For Newborns with confirmed/suspected CHD: a) Patent ductus arteriosus and/or atrial
             septal defect/patent foramen ovale without other defects, b) Corrective cardiac
             surgical or catheter intervention performed before enrollment or c) Current infusions
             of vasoactive medications other than prostaglandin therapy.
