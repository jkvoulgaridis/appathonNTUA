  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our objective in this study is to identify an optimal set of quantitative ultrasound
      parameters that can be used, non-invasively, to characterize breast masses with high
      accuracy, as determined histopathologically. Breast cancer is the most frequent form of
      non-epithelial cancer diagnosed in women, with approximately 1.5 million new cases diagnosed
      annually worldwide. Accurate diagnosis and characterization of disease play an important role
      in therapy planning for breast cancer treatment. Currently, the gold standard method of
      tumour diagnosis is pathological examination of core biopsy specimens. However, the invasive
      core biopsies can cause post-surgical complications. Besides, some lesions require repeat
      biopsy due to sampling errors during the initial biopsy. Also X-ray mammography and
      ultrasound B-mode images, which are used by radiologists for breast examination, lack
      reliable information about micro-structural properties of tissues. There is an urgent need of
      a non-invasive imaging modality that can provide rapid and quantitative information for
      breast tumour characterization, in real time and at the patient bed. The main goal, as
      described above, is to select the best quantitative ultrasound parameters that can facilitate
      breast cancer characterization, non-invasively.
