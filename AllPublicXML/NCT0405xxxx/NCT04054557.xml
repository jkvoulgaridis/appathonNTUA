  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well telehealth works in improving adherence to endocrine
      (anti-estrogen) therapy in participants with estrogen receptor and/or progesterone receptor
      positive (hormone receptor positive) stage 0-III breast cancer who have underwent surgery.
      Telehealth is an approach to care that uses digital information and communication tools to
      manage health and well-being. Participants interact with their health care providers via a
      video chat on a computer or smart phone. Telehealth may help identify the effects of
      treatment on participants with breast cancer who have underwent surgery.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate if the utilization of telehealth can improve patient adherence with adjuvant
      endocrine therapy during the first year of treatment.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate if the utilization of telehealth can improve quality of life and decrease side
      effects while taking adjuvant endocrine therapy during the first year of treatment.

      OUTLINE: Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Participants receive standard of care office visits every 3 months (± 2 weeks) for one
      year.

      ARM II: Participants receive standard of care as in Arm I and 4 telehealth visits over
      approximately 20-30 minutes every 6 weeks (± 2 weeks) at around weeks 6, 18, 30, and 42 for
      one year.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Adherence to endocrine therapy (ET)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to one year</time_frame>
    <description>ET is defined as the proportion of participants with filled prescriptions to cover &gt; 80% of their ET doses for the year and pill diaries documenting receipt of &gt; 80% of prescribed doses of ET for the year. ET medication adherence will be evaluated by pill diary collected at each clinic visit at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of life</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to one year</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will fill out the Functional Assessment of cancer Therapy-Endocrine Subscale (FACT-ES) at initiation of trial and then at the time of their 6 month and 12 month clinic visits. The FACT-ES, has two sections each of which will be evaluated separately. The first section, FACT-G, will be used as a measure of general quality of life. It consists of 27 items, each scored 0 to 4. Scores range from 0 to 108 with higher scores indicating worse quality of life.</description>

    <measure>ET side effects</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to one year</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will fill out the Functional Assessment of cancer Therapy-Endocrine Subscale (FACT-ES) at initiation of trial and then at the time of their 6 month and 12 month clinic visits. The FACT-ES, has two sections each of which will be evaluated separately. The second section of the FACT-ES will be used as a measure of specific side effects of endocrine therapy. It consists of 19 items scored 0 to 4 with scores ranging from 0 to 76. A higher score indicates worse side effects. The FACT-ES has established validity and reliability in breast cancer patients.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Satisfaction with telehealth</measure>
    <time_frame>At 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>This will be evaluated using a modified version of the Patient Satisfaction With Cancer Care Scale (PSCCS). The modified scale contains 14 items, each rated on a 5-point scale ranging from strongly agree (5) to strongly disagree (1). Scores range from 14 to 70 with higher scores indicating greater satisfaction.</description>
