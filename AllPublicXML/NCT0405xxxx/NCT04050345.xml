  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-centre, prospective, translational research study involving the collection
      and analysis of tumour tissue, serial blood samples and clinical data in patients with newly
      diagnosed stage I, II and III CRC. The study will also include collection and analysis of
      tissue, serial blood samples and clinical data of patients with newly diagnosed stage I CRC.

    <textblock>
      Circulating cell free tumour DNA (ctDNA) maintains the same mutations that are present in
      tumour. In colorectal cancer, primary tumours &amp; metastases exhibit high genomic concordance.
      Therefore the TRACC study is investigating whether in patients with stage II and III
      colorectal cancer that have undergone potentially curative surgery, blood samples to detect &amp;
      quantify ctDNA may identify minimal residual disease and relapse earlier than existing
      methods. CtDNA may ultimately help identify a subset of patients that are or are unlikely to
      benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy and could therefore safely spare some patients from
      receiving unnecessary chemotherapy &amp; its associated side-effects.

      FFPE tumour tissue will be retrieved from surgery of patients with stage I, II and III CRC
      and targeted resequencing by a clinically validated method for a panel of pre-specified genes
      such as KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, PIK3CA, TP53 and APC will be performed. The study will also collect
      plasma from these patients and extract cfDNA. ddPCR assays will be used to detect and track
      tumour specific mutations in cfDNA.

  <eligibility>
    <study_pop>

        All patients will have eligibility assessed in a 2 step process, prior to surgery and again
        post-operatively with the histopathology report from surgery using the criteria below. All
        patients meeting the eligibility criteria at the first assessment will be registered.

        Rectal cancer patients that undergo pre-operative radiotherapy or chemo-radiotherapy will
        have an additional eligibility assessment after completion of this with the results of
        their response assessment imaging, after their management plan has been determined. This is
        most likely to be following multi-disciplinary team discussion.

          -  Patients with high grade dysplasia whose imaging is suggestive of colorectal carcinoma
             (CRC) will be included but will be excluded post-surgery if carcinoma diagnosis is not

          -  Age≥18

          -  Ability to give informed consent

          -  Able to adhere to follow up schedule

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Scheduled to have neoadjuvant chemotherapy, (neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy for
             patients with rectal cancer is permitted)

          -  Current or previous other malignancy within 5 years of study entry, except cured basal
             or squamous cell skin cancer, superficial bladder cancer, prostate intraepithelial
             neoplasm, carcinoma in situ of the cervix or other non-invasive malignancy

        Additional eligibility criteria for rectal cancer patients following completion of
        pre-operative radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy

        Inclusion Criteria:

        • All patients proceeding to surgery

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients scheduled to have further pre-operative treatment with chemotherapy

          -  Patients that are no longer proceeding with surgery i.e. those in whom surgery is
             considered too high risk

          -  Patients that are no longer proceeding with surgery as they are proceeding with a
             deferral of surgery approach
