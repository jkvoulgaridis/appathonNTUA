      The investigators intend to explore the characteristics and outcomes of pregnant women with
      PAH during different pregnancies and to provide applicable evidence for clinical practice.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a fatal disease with progressive vascular resistance
      that leads to the loss of right heart function. Avoiding pregnancy is essential for PAH
      women. In recent years, maternal mortality in pregnant women with PAH has decreased mostly
      due to emerging advanced therapies for PAH and the progress in high-risk pregnancy
      management. Nevertheless, the maternal death rate in parturients with PAH remains high;
      therefore, contraception is still recommended for women diagnosed with PAH. However, some
      women develop this condition during pregnancy. With the two-child policy, families in China
      are allowed to have a second child. As a result, the number of PAH diagnoses during pregnancy
      may increase with the general increase in the number of pregnant women. Additionally, some
      patients develop PAH only during their second pregnancy. In order to investigate the
      incidence and clinical characteristics of pregnant women diagnosed with PAH during different
      pregnancies, this observational study aimed to analyze perinatal and pregnancy clinical data,
      to compare the perinatal status and maternal and infant outcomes of the first and second
      pregnancies complicated with PAH, establishing a clinical basis for the prenatal
      consultation, diagnosis, and treatment of pregnant women with PAH.

        The first pregnancy group was composed of patients diagnosed with PAH in their first
        pregnancy. Patients in the second pregnancy group were diagnosed with PAH during their
        second pregnancy but normal in their first pregnancy.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        PAH was screened by Doppler echocardiography first. Echocardiographic criteria for the
        diagnosis of PAH included tricuspid regurgitation velocity &gt;2.8 m/sec, with extra more than
        one additional echocardiographic sign

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Cases of PH diagnosed before pregnancy, secondary to chronic lung disease, and left heart
        disease, as well as right ventricular outflow tract obstruction and congenital pulmonary
        stenosis.
