  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate rapidity of tooth alignment in a randomised
      clinical trial of orthodontic patients allocated randomly into two different appointment
      intervals groups. First group will be reviewed every two weeks to adjust their braces while
      the second group will be reviewed every 8 weeks.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Orthodontics is a branch of dentistry concerned primarily with the correction of dental
      crowding or tooth malalignment. The first phase of fixed appliance orthodontic treatment is
      concerned with tooth alignment and relies upon a rapid and predictable response of the
      appliance system to the forces applied by the aligning archwire. The appropriate length of
      time between orthodontic appointments, generally called the 'appointment interval', has been
      the subject of debate for many years. Doctors all have their own preferences, based either on
      what they were taught in their orthodontic specialty programs or on community norms. Little
      evidence has been presented in the orthodontic literature to support these biases. The
      appointment interval may influence tooth alignment rates and treatment time along with other
      variables, such as periodontal status. Accelerating orthodontic tooth movement can
      significantly reduce treatment duration and the risk of side-effects.

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Level of oral biomarkers</measure>
    <time_frame>4-10 months.</time_frame>
    <description>In vivo levels of oral biomarkers derived from gingival crevicular fluid in the periodontal ligament and saliva. Biomarkers associated with orthodontic tooth movement and/or periodontitis will be tested, including biomarkers for tissue damage and inflammatory processes, such as Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and Aspartate aminotransferase (AST), biomarkers to asses inflammation in orthodontic movement, such as Myeloperoxidase (MPO) , biomarkers for resolution of organic matrix and bone resorption, such as Cathepsin B, biomarkers for periodontal ligament remodelling, such as Matrix Metalloproteinases (MMPs).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Self-reported pain and discomfort.</measure>
    <time_frame>4-10 months.</time_frame>
    <description>At each adjustment visit, subjects will be given a prepared discomfort questionnaire to complete over the following week and to be returned at each subsequent visit. This questionnaire records discomfort by means of a 100 mm visual analogue scale (VAS) at 4 hours, 24 hours, 3 days, and 1 week, using the terms 'very comfortable' and 'very uncomfortable' as peripheral weightings (Seymour, 1982). The VAS score is the distance from the left end of the line to the point of the subject's mark, measured to the nearest millimetre.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Periodontal health.</measure>
    <time_frame>4-10 months</time_frame>
    <description>Periodontal health will be measured using established Gingival and Plaque indices. The criteria for plaque index as:
0: No plaque
A film of plaque adheres to the free gingival margin and adjacent area of the tooth. The plaque may be seen in situ only after application of disclosing solution or by using probe on the tooth surface.
Moderate accumulation of soft deposits within the gingival pocket, or the tooth and the gingival margin, which can be seen with the naked eye.
An abundance of soft matter within the gingival pocket and/or the tooth and gingival margin.
The criteria for gingival index as:
0: Normal gingiva.
Mild inflammation: slight change in colour, slight oedema, no bleeding on probing.
Moderate inflammation: moderate glazing, redness, oedema, and hypertrophy, bleeding on probing.
Severe inflammation: marked redness and hypertrophic ulceration, tendency to spontaneous bleeding</description>

    <measure>Rate of tooth movement</measure>
    <time_frame>4-10 months</time_frame>
    <description>Rate of tooth alignment will be calculated from serial dental study casts using Little's Irregularity Index, which measures the horizontal linear contact-point displacement of each mandibular incisor from the adjacent tooth and therefore, represents the sum of the five individual displacements (Little, 1975).</description>
