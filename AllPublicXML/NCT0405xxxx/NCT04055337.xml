  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study assessed the efficacy and safety of a simple, noninvasive &quot;flap sliding&quot; technique
      for managing flap striae following laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK). Included eyes
      underwent flap sliding 1-2 days after surgery, which involved using a cellulose sponge to
      gently slide the flap perpendicular to the striae. The flap was not lifted during the
      procedure. Thirteen of 14 eyes were successfully managed with flap sliding. Uncorrected
      distance visual acuity (DVA) improved in all patients 1 day after flap sliding, with 11 eyes
      having a corrected DVA of 20/25 or better. Complications following flap sliding occurred in 2
      eyes. We believe that our study makes a significant contribution to the literature because it
      demonstrates a simple, noninvasive technique for managing flap striae that develop during
      early post-LASIK epithelial healing.

    <description>All subjects underwent the &quot;flap sliding&quot; technique, which was performed at the Alforsan Eye Centre in Assiut, Egypt. Prior to surgery, all subjects underwent corneal imaging with anterior segment optical coherence tomography to confirm the presence of striae. All surgical procedures were performed by the same surgeon 1 or 2 days following LASIK.
Subjects were administered a topical anesthetic. Striae location and orientation were then determined after drying the corneal surface with a cellulose sponge. The sponge was used to push the LASIK flap over the stromal bed in a direction that was perpendicular to the striae. The flap was pushed from the proximal side of the striae toward the flap edge. The ultimate goal was to move striae and put the flap into its proper place. Following surgery, OCT imaging was repeated.</description>
