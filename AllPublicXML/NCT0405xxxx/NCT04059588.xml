  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the safety and tolerability of 2141-V11 in people who
      have cancer that does not respond to standard treatment and who have skin lesions (skin
      tumors) associated with their cancer. The study will also test how the body processes and
      responds to 2141-V11, and if the study drug has cancer fighting activity in people. The study
      drug activates a naturally occurring protein called CD40. By activating CD40, cells of the
      immune system are better able to identify and kill cancer cells.

      We are testing if injection of 2141-V11 into metastasis to the skin will be safe and well
      tolerated, and may result in immune activation in patients with solid tumors that have
      metastasis to the skin.

  <detailed_description>

      This is a Phase 1 open label, dose-escalation study evaluating the safety, pharmacokinetics,
      pharmacodynamics, immunogenicity, and efficacy of the Fc-engineered variant 2141-V11 in
      patients with previously treated relapsed or refractory solid tumors and locally advanced or
      metastatic solid tumors to the skin amenable to intratumoral injection.

      There are two parts to the study: a dose-finding stage (Part I), and a dose expansion stage
      (Part II). Both Part I and Part II of the study will include patients with locally advanced
      or metastatic cancers of the skin which are not amenable to standard treatment.

      A traditional 3 + 3 dose escalation design will be used (Part I). Successive cohorts of
      participants (3 participants/cohort) will be started on a fixed dose intratumoral injection
      of 2141V11 at the dose assigned to their cohort. The study drug, 2141-V11, will be dosed once
      every 3 weeks. The study drug is administered in cycles.

      The first group of study participants in Part I will receive the lowest dose of study drug.
      The next group of study participants will receive the next higher dose. This dosing scheme
      continues until the maximum tolerated dose is determined. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD)
      will be defined as 1 dose level below the dose in which DLTs are observed in &gt;33% of the
      participants.

      Participants in Part II of the study will receive the MTD determined from Part 1 (dose
      escalation) of the study. Part II participants in the study will also receive two
      vaccinations (KLH and tetanus) to allow monitoring of their immune function.

      Participants in both Part I and II can continue to receive cycles of study drug at their
      assigned dose if they do not experience progression of disease, a serious adverse event, and
      the study is ongoing.
