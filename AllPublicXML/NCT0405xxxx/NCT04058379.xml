  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We assume that an early iterative automatic CT scan analysis (D0, D1 and D3) by different AI
      approaches will allow an early differentiation of the tissues evolution after TBI. Our
      objective is to couple theses scan profiles to a neurological evolution, measured by
      therapeutic intensity.

    <textblock>
      Traumatic brain injury is a common and serious pathology, responsible of an important
      morbi-mortality. The TBI can be consider as a complex set of nosological entities of
      different evolution with difficult early identification whereas the main issue of this
      pathology depends on prevention and management of the lesions caused by the initial cerebral
      aggression.

      Different evolutionary profiles seems to exist and sometimes coexists: edema evolution,
      hemorrhagic transformation and/or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) resorption issues with
      hydrocephalus apparition.

      Currently, there is no Imaging methods that can be used in every day clinical management that
      allows a visualization, quantification and prediction of these different lesional evolutions

      CT scan is the reference imaging method for TBI patient monitoring. It allows a lesion
      description, a therapeutic adaptation and an evaluation of the prognostic.

      Even if it is used as a routine examination, the analysis of cerebral scanners remains manual
      and a non-quantitative one, which make a little informative analysis as far as lesions
      evolution is concerned.

      Recently it has been established the automatic MRI analysis with AI approach allows:

        1. - To show aspects of images that can't be seen to the naked eye

        2. - To automatically segment and quantify the different tissues (edema, hemorrhage...).
           First tests on this kind of analysis on CT scans shows that this technology can be
           transferred from MRI to CT scans and more importantly it brings out new quantitative
           informations on cerebral lesions evolution.
