  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The FEOR registry is undertaken to examine the real-world data of patients that were treated
      with the E-vita OPEN Plus Stent Graft System under routine care in France. This registry is a
      requirement of the Haute Autorité de Santé (HAS).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this registry data will be collected on patients who have been implanted with an E-vita
      OPEN PLUS Stent Graft System from 15th of July 2014 until May 31st 2019. The E-vita OPEN PLUS
      Stent Graft System will be implanted at the discretion of the treating physician.
      Participating physicians will be asked to provide their observations collected during routine
      care for patients he/she had decided to treat with the E-vita OPEN PLUS Stent Graft System.
      As this registry is a requirement of the Haute Autorité de Santé (HAS), written Informed
      consent of the patients is not required, however all patients will be provided with a
      non-objection letter and given the opportunity to refuse to participate.

      The period of data collection will be three years starting from the intervention of each
      patient. Data verification will be performed.

    <description>The primary endpoint is a composite endpoint of morbi-mortality defined as following:
Mortality rate
Morbidity rate including neurological complications, visceral malperfusion, and renal complications.
Neurological complications comprise new cerebrovascular accident (CVA)/stroke, spinal cord ischemia, paraparesis, paraplegia as reported in the eCRF.
Visceral malperfusion includes new bowel obstruction and visceral ischemia/infarction as reported in the eCRF.
Renal complications comprise new renal insufficiency and renal insufficiency requiring dialysis as reported in the eCRF.</description>
