      Patients with diabetes should be thoroughly examined before they are provided with insoles
      and shoes. The purpose of the foot examination is to determine whether the patient is at risk
      of developing diabetic foot ulcers (DFU). Risk factors are: neuropathy, peripheral
      angiopathy, foot deformities, skin pathologies, earlier history of DFU/amputation. With
      effective control and examination of the feet, foot complications, such as DFU, can be
      prevented. In the study the feet are examined with the help of a new software, the D-Foot.
      D-Foot includes questions and surveys.

      The aim of the of the study is evaluate how the patients experience the visit at the
      department of Prosthetics &amp; Orthotics based on the digital foot check.
