  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although stress has long been linked to substance use, craving and relapse, there are no
      available medications that target stress-induced substance use disorder (SUD). In particular,
      with the rise in opioid use, there is still a crucial need for developing effective
      pharmacological treatments that target and integrate the complexity of this disease. The long
      term goal of this project is to identify the key neuroendocrine pathways that are responsible
      for stress-induced craving in individuals with opioid use disorder (OUD) in order to better
      understand how they can be effectively treated.

      The goal of this research is to evaluate whether oxytocin, a hormone with anti-stress
      properties, dampens the effects of stress and opioid-associated cues on opioid craving and
      thus may be an effective adjunctive treatment for OUD.

      The central hypothesis of this research is that oxytocin will reduce stress-induced opioid
      craving in patients with OUD treated with buprenorphine/naloxone as opioid replacement
      therapy (ORT). This hypothesis is based on the model of addiction (Koob, Neuron 2008) in
      which chronic substance use and stress lead to neurobehavioral counter-adaptations that
      dysregulate biobehavioral response.

      In this double-blind, placebo controlled, randomized trial, individuals with OUD (N=68) who
      are currently receiving treatment with buprenorphine/naloxone will be randomized to
      intranasal oxytocin (40 international units, IU) or oxytocin-matched placebo, administered
      twice/day for 7 days. On days 5 and 7, participants will complete two counter-balanced
      sessions in which they receive yohimbine (32.4 mg) or yohimbine-matched placebo, and
      responses to opioid cues are assessed.

    <description>The primary outcome will test the effect of oxytocin, compared to placebo, on opioid craving during two laboratory stress induction, paired to a cue reactivity paradigm. The dependent measure for the primary aim is the Opioid Craving Questionnaire (OCQ) the stress induction will be done using yohimbine or matching placebo (counterbalanced) during the two laboratory sessions.
At each visit the OCQ will be administered 4 times: before starting any procedure, during the yohimbine challenge, at the cue-reactivity and end of experiment. The primary outcome will be the area under the curve (AUC) formed by the OCQ score. This outcome will be compared between oxytocin and matching-placebo during the stress induction produced by yohimbine or matching-placebo.</description>

    <time_frame>one week</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will complete a laboratory session that includes a battery of medical/physiological/psychological assessments to monitor adverse events.
To monitor safety and tolerability during the entire course of the study, we will examine between-group differences (oxytocin, placebo) and during yohimbine administration in reports of side effects (headache, vertigo, edema, nausea, somnolence, anxiety, abdominal pain, palpitations) at the laboratory sessions and at the follow up visit. Reporting of the study results will be of a descriptive nature and presented using summary statistics: number of subjects (n), mean (M), standard deviation (SD) or standard error of the mean (SEM), co-efficient of variation (CV), median, minimum, maximum or frequency distributions (n, %)</description>
