  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess whether non-pharmacological interventions by a comfort coach affect
      the amount of opioid pain medication used, as well as perceived physical pain and emotional
      anxiety and healthcare utilization for adult cardiac surgery patients. Participants that are
      eligible for the study will be randomized to the comfort coach arm or standard of care. Both
      groups will complete surveys at the specific time frames in order to compare their outcomes.
      The study hypothesis is that there will be a decrease in opioid use in the intervention group
      compared to the standard of care arm during the 90-day perioperative course, as well as a
      decrease in pain and anxiety along with a lower composite outcome of healthcare utilization.

    <measure>Brief pain inventory (short)</measure>
    <time_frame>hospital discharge (within 48 hours of time of hospital discharge)</time_frame>
    <description>This is a 9-question inventory which assesses both pain intensity (sensory dimension) and the interference (reactive dimension) of pain in daily activities. Pain intensity is measured on a 0 - 10 scale, with 0 being no pain and 10 being worst possible.</description>

    <measure>Postoperative Opioid and Pain Management Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>approximately 30 days after discharge</time_frame>
    <description>This is an 11-item questionnaire collecting data on opioids prescribed, opioids used, pain scores, opioid storage and disposal practices, and assessment of opioid education.</description>

    <measure>Picker Patient Experience Questionnaire (PPE-15)</measure>
    <time_frame>approximately 30 days after discharge</time_frame>
    <description>This is a 15-item questionnaire designed to capture the patient's inpatient experience.
Each response will be categorized as a problem or non-problem and reported as the percent of respondents reporting a problem, averaged across all PPE-15 domains.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to approximately 90 days after discharge</time_frame>
    <description>This is a self-administered patient questionnaire with 7 items that measures generalized anxiety disorder. Through a 4-point Likert scale from 'not at all' to 'nearly every day', it is asked how often the patient has been bothered by any of the presented problems. The GAD-7 index is obtained by adding the scores from the questionnaire, after having assigned 0 to the least severe situation, 3 to the most severe one, and 1 and 2 to the intermediate ones. The cut off points 5, 10 and 15 allow to classify the anxiety as none/normal (0-4), mild (5-9), moderate (10-14), and severe (15-21). This will be completed at 4 different times in every patient, ranging from preoperative clinic through 90 (+/-7) day follow up.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to approximately 90 days after discharge</time_frame>
    <description>This is a self-administered instrument that will be used to measure depression in each subject. The PHQ-9 score can range from 0-27 with each of the 9 items can be scored from 0-3 corresponding to &quot;no at all&quot;, &quot;several days&quot;, &quot;more than half the days&quot; and &quot;nearly every day&quot; responses, respectively. This will be completed at 4 different times in every patient, ranging from preoperative clinic through 90 (+/-7) day follow up</description>

    <measure>Impact of Events Scale-Revised (IES-R)</measure>
    <time_frame>approximately 30 days after discharge</time_frame>
    <description>This is a 22-item self-report questionnaire measuring post traumatic stress disorder symptoms. Items are rated on a 5-point scale ranging from 0 (&quot;not at all&quot;) to 4 (&quot;extremely&quot;). The IES-R yields a total score ranging from 0 (not at all) to 88 (extremely).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ-12)</measure>
    <time_frame>preoperative clinic visit, approximately 30 days after discharge</time_frame>
    <description>This a 12-item, self-administered instrument that quantifies physical function, symptoms (frequency, severity and recent change), social function, self-efficacy and knowledge, and quality of life. The KCCQ-12 clinical summary score is a composite assessment of physical limitations and total symptom scores. Scores are transformed to a range of 0-100, in which higher scores reflect better health status.</description>
