  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tracheal suctioning is a process which is often applied to patients' care who have an
      artificial airway and whose respiration is achieved via mechanical ventilation. When
      secretions are not cleaned enough, it causes a variety of complications in the patient from
      hypoxemia to infection.

      It is reported that the studies with nurses in clinical practice have shown that they have
      opinions such as the closed system does not suction the patients effectively as the open
      system does; it remains incapable in removing secretions, thus the suctioning process is
      being applied more frequently.

      Therefore this study is designed to examine the amount of secretions and frequency of
      suctioning as a result of open and closed suctioning systems.

      Patients will be monitored for two days. On the first day, the patient will be followed up
      with an open system and the second day closed suctioning system will be used, or the patient
      will be followed up with a closed system on the first day and followed with an open system on
      the second day. The patients are randomly allocated on the first follow up days. The
      follow-up period has two consecutive days. suctioning will be performed for 12 hours in one
      day. The number of suctions will be recorded. The amount of secretion will be accumulated in
      the mucus collection vessel. At the end of the day, the secretion will be weighed with
      precision weighing.

They are monitorized for two days. If a patient is suctioned via OSS in the first enrolled day, the same patient is suctioned via CSS in the second enrolled day. For CSS, vice versa.</intervention_model_description>
