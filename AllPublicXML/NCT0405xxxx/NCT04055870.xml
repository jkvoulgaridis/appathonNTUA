      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and adequacy of EUS-guided
      liver biopsy in patients undergoing EUS-guided liver biopsy at Methodist Dallas Medical
      Center (MDMC). This is a clinical quality improvement (CQI) initiative to evaluate outcomes
      within our institution. The data collected will be used to inform new innovative ways to
      improve EUS-guided liver biopsy with an ultimate goal of improving the quality of patient
      care. The clinical outcomes of this patient population have not been previously
      systematically reviewed in MDMC. Currently, the procedure in not being performed routinely at
      Methodist Dallas Medical Center (MDMC). However, with new technical and physician expertise,
      this option is now available at our institution. PI will evaluate the efficacy, safety, and
      adequacy of EUS-guided liver biopsy in patients requiring histologic examination of their
      liver at MDMC.
