  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if AMG 570 could be a useful therapeutic agent in
      the current treatment landscape where subjects with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) have
      ongoing disease activity despite treatment with standard of care therapies.

      This is a Bayesian adaptive phase 2, multi-center, double-blind, randomized,
      placebo-controlled, 52-week, dose-ranging study in subjects with active SLE and inadequate
      response to SOC therapies including oral corticosteroids (OCS), immunosuppressants and
      immunomodulators. Previous biologic use is allowed with an adequate washout period.

    <intervention_model_description>This is a Bayesian adaptive phase 2, multi-center, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, 52-week, dose-ranging study in subjects with active systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and inadequate response to standard of care (SOC) therapies. Subjects will be randomized to receive either placebo or 1 of 3 doses of AMG 570 with the last dose at week 50. Study duration for each subject will be 52 weeks plus the screening and safety follow-up. Treatment will be administered every 2 weeks.
The first interim analysis (IA) will be executed after the first 80 enrolled subjects have had the opportunity to complete the week 24 assessment. Additional IAs may be executed approximately every 10 weeks or every 40 newly enrolled subjects have had the opportunity to complete the week 24 assessment (whichever comes last). A final IA will take place after all the subjects have been enrolled.</intervention_model_description>

        Inclusion Criteria Screening Visit:

          -  Subject has provided informed consent prior to initiation of any study-specific
             activities/procedures.

          -  Age ≥ 18 years to ≤ 75 years at screening visit.

          -  Fulfills classification criteria for SLE according to the 2019 European League Against
             Rheumatism (EULAR)/American College of Rheumatology (ACR) classification criteria for
             SLE (Aringer et al, 2019), with antinuclear antibody ≥ 1:80 by immunofluorescence on
             Hep-2 cells being present at screening.

          -  Anti-dsDNA results based on the Farr assay will be used to SLE classification
             criteria, while test results from the Phadia method will be used for the purposes of
             hSLEDAI scoring during screening and throughout the study.

          -  Hybrid SLEDAI score ≥ 6 points with a &quot;Clinical&quot; hSLEDAI score ≥ 4 points. The
             &quot;Clinical&quot; hSLEDAI is the hSLEDAI assessment score without the inclusion of points
             attributable to laboratory results, including urine or immunologic parameters.

        Additional protocol-specific rules are applied at screening and throughout the study, as
        follows:

          -  Arthritis: Arthritis must involve joints in the hands or wrists, and for the hSLEDAI
             score the distribution should not involve the ankles, knees, hips, elbows, or
             shoulders

          -  Alopecia: Subjects should have hair loss without scarring; should neither have
             alopecia areata nor androgenic alopecia; and should have a CLASI activity score for
             alopecia ≥ 2.

          -  Oral ulcers: Ulcers location and appearance must be documented by the investigator.

          -  Scleritis and Episcleritis: the presence of stable SLE-related scleritis and
             episcleritis must be documented by an ophthalmologist and other causes excluded.

          -  Renal: subjects with urine protein/creatinine ratio &lt; 3000 mg/g (or equivalent) in a
             clear catch spot urine sample can enroll and be scored in the hSLEDAI, provided the
             subject has a clinical hSLEDAI ≥ 4 and did not receive induction treatment for
             nephritis within the last year.

          -  Pleurisy and Pericarditis: symptoms of pleurisy and pericarditis must be accompanied
             by objective findings to be scored in the hSLEDAI.

               -  Must be taking at least 1 but not more than 2 of the following SLE treatments:
                  mycophenolate mofetil, azathioprine, methotrexate, hydroxychloroquine,
                  chloroquine, dapsone, or quinacrine. Treatment should be taken for ≥12 weeks
                  prior to screening and must be a stable dose for ≥ 8 weeks prior to screening. If
                  subject is taking 2 of the above mentioned SLE treatments, 1 of these must be
                  either hydroxychloroquine, quinacrine, or chloroquine.

               -  For subjects taking OCS, dose must be ≤ 20 mg/day of prednisone or OCS
                  equivalent, and the dose must be stable at baseline visit for ≥ 2 weeks prior to
                  screening visit.

        Exclusion Criteria Screening Visit

        Subjects are excluded from the study if any of the following criteria apply:

        Disease Related

          -  History of lupus nephritis requiring induction therapy within 1 year or active lupus
             nephritis defined as urine protein creatinine ratio ≥ 3000 mg/g (or equivalent) at
             screening.

          -  History of active CNS lupus within 1 year prior to screening including, but not
             limited to, aseptic meningitis, ataxia, CNS vasculitis, cranial neuropathy,
             demyelinating syndrome, optic neuritis, psychosis, seizures, or transverse myelitis.

    <ipd_time_frame>Data sharing requests relating to this study will be considered beginning 18 months after the study has ended and either 1) the product and indication have been granted marketing authorization in both the US and Europe or 2) clinical development for the product and/or indication discontinues and the data will not be submitted to regulatory authorities. There is no end date for eligibility to submit a data sharing request for this study.</ipd_time_frame>
    <ipd_access_criteria>Qualified researchers may submit a request containing the research objectives, the Amgen product(s) and Amgen study/studies in scope, endpoints/outcomes of interest, statistical analysis plan, data requirements, publication plan, and qualifications of the researcher(s). In general, Amgen does not grant external requests for individual patient data for the purpose of re-evaluating safety and efficacy issues already addressed in the product labelling. Requests are reviewed by a committee of internal advisors, and if not approved, may be further arbitrated by a Data Sharing Independent Review Panel. Upon approval, information necessary to address the research question will be provided under the terms of a data sharing agreement. This may include anonymized individual patient data and/or available supporting documents, containing fragments of analysis code where provided in analysis specifications.
