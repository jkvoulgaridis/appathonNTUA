    <textblock>
      This is a dose escalation, Phase 1-2 study of ABN401 in patients with advanced solid tumors,
      refractory metastatic disease, or refractory locally advanced disease not amenable to local
      therapy.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      First part of the study uses single patient cohorts at the initial dose levels, followed by a
      classic 3+3 design, with enrollment of 3 patients per cohort and expansion to 6 patients in
      the event of a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT).

      The second part of the study consists of expansion cohorts with patients with c-Met
      amplification/mutation of interest.

Route of Administration: Oral
Once the MTD or highest escalation cohort has been reached, or notable efficacy has been observed at a given dose level, a decision as to RP2D will be determined. Upon the establishment of RP2D, up to 4 expansion cohorts of 10-29 patients will be recruited representing various c-Met amplification or mutant tumor types of interest.</description>

             discussion and approval of sponsor and the medical monitor.

         14. For at least one patient per dose level: Agree to pre- and on-treatment fresh tumor
             biopsies (that can be biopsied based on investigator's assessment) and to providing
             the acquired tissue for biomarker analysis. Tissue obtained for the biopsy must not be

             required in that cohort. At least one fresh tumor biopsy is required in single dose
             cohorts that are expanded to 3 patients and in all 3+3 cohorts. Note : During

          6. Known active central nervous system (CNS) primary tumor or metastases and/or
             carcinomatous meningitis. Patients with previously treated brain metastases may
             participate provided they are clinically stable for at least 4 weeks prior to study
             entry, have no evidence of new or enlarging brain metastases and are off steroids for

         13. History or clinical evidence of any surgical or medical condition which the
             investigator judges as likely to interfere with the results of the study or pose an
             additional risk in participating e.g., rapidly progressive or uncontrolled disease
             involving a major organ system-vascular, cardiac, pulmonary, gastrointestinal,
             gynecologic, hematologic, neurologic, neoplastic, renal, endocrine, autoimmune or an
