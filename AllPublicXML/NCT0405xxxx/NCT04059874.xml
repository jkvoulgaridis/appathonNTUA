      To assess the safety and efficacy of third-line and above therapy of patients with local
      advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with combined treatment with
      launched recombinant humanized anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody and Donafenib Tosilate

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Donafenib has a multi-target and dual anti-tumor effect, similar to sorafenib toluene
      sulfonate, and its effect is similar to that of sorafenib toluene sulfonate. Donafenib has
      the potential to be effective in the treatment of cancer, including advanced non-small cell
      lung cancer. PD-1 inhibitor has become a new therapy for advanced non-small cell lung cancer
      because of its strong specificity, definite efficacy, small side effects and long time of
      tumor control.

      This is a single-center, open, single-arm, exploratory phase Ib trial. There were two dosages
      of donafenib (100mg qd and 100mg bid, respectively). Three to six subjects were enrolled in
      the dosages of 100mg qd. The investigators determined that the dosages of 100mg bid were well
      tolerated
