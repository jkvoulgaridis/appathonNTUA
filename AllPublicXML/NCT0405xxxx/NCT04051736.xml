    <textblock>
      This study replaced the 2nd and 3rd dose of Salk-IPV (produced by Sanofi) with Sabin-IPV
      (produced by CNBG) and then reviewed the safety and immunogenicity of the vaccination, aiming
      to acquire scientific evidence for the feasibility of immunization involving different viral
      strains replacement.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is required by China Food and Drug Administration (CFDA) that considering in the real
      situation IPV receivers may be immuned by different viral strains of this vaccine, a phase 4
      clinical trial aiming to demonstrate the safety and immunogenicity of the immunization
      schedule should be carried out. To be specific, the subjects were divided into 2 groups.

      Group 1 received Salk-IPV+Sabin-IPV+Sabin-IPV respectively at the age of 2,3,4 months old.

      Group 2 received Salk-IPV+Salk-IPV+Salk-IPV respectively at the age of 2,3,4 months old.

      Blood sample was collected before vaccination and 30 days after the third dose of
      vaccination. Neutralization antibody against type I, Type II and Type III poliomyelitis virus
      were detected to evaluate the seroprotection rates and antibody geometric mean
      concentrations. The safety of both immunization schedule will also been monitored.
