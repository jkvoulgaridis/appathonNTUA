  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Long-term side effects of antiretrovirals (ART) have led to the introduction in clinical
      practice of NRTI-sparing regimens as double- or mono- therapy and their use is now
      recommended in specific populations by International Guidelines. Indeed, based on the
      monitoring of surrogate markers of ART efficacy, most of these unconventional regimens, when
      used in switch studies, have shown to have a non-inferior virological efficacy and a good CD4
      recovery compared to standard triple drug-based therapy.

      At present, the best marker to evaluate the risk of developing of non-AIDS related events has
      not been determined. Interestingly, the analysis of the data of the investigator's and others
      cohorts have shown that, in contrast with recent data from ART-CC collaboration, a low
      CD4/CD8 ratio is a predictor of non-AIDS related events independently from CD4 cell count,
      while other studies have shown an association of this marker with non-AIDS defining cancers
      or, more recently, with pulmonary emphysema. Aim of the present study is to compare CD8 and
      CD4/CD8 slopes in patients switching with an undetectable viral load to the 2 regimens which
      will be more frequently used in clinical practice: i.e B/F/TAF and dolutegravir + lamivudine.
      Indeed, B/F/TAF is already a recommended regimen in all guidelines while dolutegravir +
      lamivudine is widely used in clinical practice.

               -  Not pregnant or nursing

               -  Of non-childbearing potential (e.g., women who have had a hysterectomy, have had
                  both ovaries removed or medically documented ovarian failure, or are
                  postmenopausal women &gt;54 years of age with cessation for =12 months of previously
                  occurring menses)
