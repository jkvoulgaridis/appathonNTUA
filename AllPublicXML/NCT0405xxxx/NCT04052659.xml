  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm, single-center Phase II clinical trial for patients with relapsed or
      refractory primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL), Peripheral T/NK-cell lymphoma
      (PT/NKCL), Primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL). Although safety and efficacy of
      PD-1 antibodies (Pembrolizumab or Nivolumab) in these patients were confirmed, anti-tumor
      effects of Sintilimab (IBI308) in these patients are still unknown. Therefore, the trial is
      conducted to study the safety and efficacy of Sintilimab in patients with relapsed or
      refractory PMBCL, PT/NKCL or PCNSL.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      1) To determine the objective response rate (ORR) .

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

        1. To determine the complete response (CR) rate and partial response (PR) rate.

        2. To determine the time to response (TTR).

        3. To determine the duration of response (DOR).

        4. To determine the progression free survival (PFS).

        5. To determine the overall survival (OS).

        6. To determine the safety.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      1) To correlate PD-L1/L2 gene alterations and PD-L1/L2 protein expressions of tumor and the
      efficacy of Sinitilimab.
