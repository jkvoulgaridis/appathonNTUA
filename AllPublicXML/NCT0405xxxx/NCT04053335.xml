  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Low-value care is defined as patient care that provides no net benefit to patients in
      specific clinical scenarios, and it can cause patient harm. Prior research has documented
      high-rates of low-value care in Virginia, and this work has helped to inspire a Virginia
      government-sponsored quality improvement initiative to reduce low-value care. Funded by a
      $2.2 million Arnold Ventures grant, six large health systems in Virginia volunteered to
      partner with the Virginia Center for Health Innovation (VCHI) to reduce use of seven
      low-value health services (three preoperative testing measures, two cardiac screening
      measures, one diagnostic eye imaging measure, and one peripherally inserted central catheter
      [PICC] measure). These health systems include nearly 7,000 clinicians practicing across more
      than 1,000 sites. VCHI is implementing a step-wedge cluster-randomized physician
      peer-comparison feedback quality improvement intervention to reduce the use of these seven
      low-value services. VCHI will provide education, quality improvement training, and financial
      resources to each site, and VCHI will use the Milliman MedInsight Health Waste Calculator to
      create the peer comparison reports using the Virginia all payer claims database (APCD). Of
      note, the primary purpose of the initiative is to improve quality of care for Virginia
      residents and this initiative is not being done for research purposes, and step-wedge
      randomization is done to both ease logistical workload on VCHI and clarify impact of
      intervention (IRB exempt). Nevertheless, University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) team
      plans to rigorously study and publish the impact of this intervention across the state of
      Virginia, which is why the UCLA team is preregistering the initiative. The UCLA team will use
      the Virginia APCD to evaluate the impact of the intervention. Because the APCD has a 1 year
      time-lag of data collection, the initial results of the impact of the intervention will not
      be available until August 2020 at the earliest.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of participants with low-value utilization across the 7 low-value care measures</measure>
    <time_frame>36 months</time_frame>
    <description>The 7 measures are defined using evidenced-based guidelines such as the USPSTF, American College of Cardiology, Choosing Wisely, among other guidelines.
The primary measure is a global percentage of use among eligible patients across the 7 measures (see eligibility criteria for each measure-specific denominator):
Preoperative laboratory testing
Preoperative EKGs, chest x-rays, and pulmonary function testing
Preoperative cardiac imaging/stress testing
Annual EKG/other cardiac screening for low-risk adults
Cardiac stress imaging/cardiac imaging in low-risk adults
Diagnostic eye imaging in low-risk patients
Peripherally inserted central catheters in stage 3-5 chronic kidney disease patients without consulting nephrology
UCLA statisticians will independently assess these measures using the Virginia APCD, which includes paid claims for Commercial, Medicaid, Medicare insured patients, and includes demographics, procedure/diagnostic codes.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage participants with high-value utilization across the 7 measures (e.g., balancing measures)</measure>
    <time_frame>36 months</time_frame>
    <description>These balancing measures will assess the use of high-value services. For example, the UCLA team will assess whether symptomatic (e.g., chest pain) patients continue to receive testing (e.g., EKGs) prior to low-risk surgery, or whether patients with eye disease continue to receive eye imaging, etc.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of participants with adverse events (e.g., peri-operative medical complications)</measure>
    <time_frame>36 months</time_frame>
    <description>While VCHI, the UCLA team, and health systems do not expect adverse events (AEs) to increase in this evidenced-based quality improvement initiative, the UCLA team will monitor for them. AEs will be measure specific. For example, patients with preoperative visits will be evaluated for 30 day peri/post-operative medical complications (e.g., myocardial infarction). Patient eligible to receive cardiac screening (and do not receive it) will be evaluated for 30-day myocardial infarction diagnoses and hospitalization rates. Patients eligible to receive eye imaging and do not receive it will be evaluated for 1-year eye disease progression or new diagnosis rates. Patients eligible to receive a PICC line and do not will be evaluated for 30-day readmission rates. Each local health system QI team will also be provided education on how careful, nuanced attention to guidelines can reduce the risk of potential AEs.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Total costs (estimates from percent effort of clinical leadership team, utilization trends</measure>
    <time_frame>36 months</time_frame>
    <description>The cost analysis will estimate costs based on changes in utilization over time using costs as defined by the total amount paid to each provider (including out-of-pocket costs) available in the Virginia APCD. The UCLA team will also estimate the percent effort of each member of the clinical leadership team during the study time-frame to estimate investment costs. These latter data will be obtained via surveys and/or interviews of the clinical leadership teams.</description>

Education Materials: The CLTs will distribute clinician and consumer education throughout the health systems calling to avoid 7 low-value services.
