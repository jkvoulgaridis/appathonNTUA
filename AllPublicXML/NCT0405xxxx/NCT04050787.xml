  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to conduct a randomized controlled trial of two kinds of radical gastrectomy
      for patients with proximal gastric cancer. One is laparoscopic D2 radical total gastrectomy
      combined with spleen-preserving No.10 lymph node dissection , another one is laparoscopic D2
      radical total gastrectomy without clearing the No. 10 lymph nodes of the spleen. We explore
      the effect of the two procedures on the survival of patients, as well as the surgical
      complications associated with the two procedures, the number of lymph node dissection, the
      operation time and the amount of intraoperative blood loss. Furthermore, we also want to
      discuss the application value of laparoscopic lymph node dissection for spleen preservation
      in radical gastrectomy for proximal gastric cancer.
