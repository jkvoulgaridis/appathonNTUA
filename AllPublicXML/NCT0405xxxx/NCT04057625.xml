      VAP is the most frequent hospital-acquired infection in intensive care units. Depending on
      the diagnostic criteria used, its incidence ranges from 5% to 67%. The risk of acquiring VAP
      is 3% per day during the first 5 days on mechanical ventilation, and it is decreased to 1%
      per day for the following days.

      VAP is suspected when subject shows high grade fever, increase in leukocyte count, change in
      color of sputum and tachypnea. It's a leading cause of mortality in 15- 65% of the cases.

      Serial chest x-ray for diagnosis and follow up, done at time of diagnosis, after 5 days and
      after 10 days. Chest radiography is consistently carried out after LUS , LUS is done every
      other day, measuring the largest area of consolidation according to the intercostal space and
      direction of the probe . Chest radiography is read by two physicians.
