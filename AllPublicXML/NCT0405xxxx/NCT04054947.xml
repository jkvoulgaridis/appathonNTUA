  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the United States (U.S.), suicide is a major public health concern. U.S. Veterans who live
      in rural areas may be at even higher risk for suicide than their urban counterparts.
      Available evidence indicates that suicide risk in rural U.S. Veterans is most concentrated
      during high-risk care transition scenarios such as discharge from an emergency room. There is
      limited knowledge about effective interventions to address suicide risk. There is a critical
      need to develop targeted interventions that address suicide risk during high-risk care
      transition periods. To be effective, these interventions should address key contributors to
      suicide risk such as reduced engagement in treatment. This clinical trial evaluates the
      effect of a suicide prevention intervention to support treatment engagement during high risk
      transition periods such as discharge from an emergency room.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the United States (U.S.), death by suicide is a notable public health concern and a
      particular problem in the U.S. Veteran population. Furthermore, U.S. Veterans who live in
      rural areas may be at even greater risk for suicide than their urban counterparts. These
      risks may be concentrated during times of transition in their treatment such as after
      emergency room discharge. Multiple interventions have been developed to target suicide risk
      during periods of transition but there is limited evidence regarding their efficacy in
      preventing suicide. Furthermore, a key contributor to suicide risk may include limited or no
      engagement in care. Therefore, developing interventions to support engagement in treatment
      may be effective ways to help mitigate suicide risk and promote participation in care. This
      clinical trial studies an intervention that is designed to help support treatment engagement
      during periods of high risk in Veterans who live in rural areas. The trial will recruit
      Veterans from various treatment settings such as the emergency room and the residential drug
      treatment programs and follow them for a period of three months. The trial evaluates not only
      the effect of the intervention on suicidal behavior but also measures of engagement.

    <description>The BSSI ranges from 0-38. While there is no established BSSI cutoff score to classify suicide risk, here is evidence that higher scores on the BSSI correspond to more severe suicidal ideation and that an improvement of five points or more on the total BSSI scores may be clinically relevant.</description>
