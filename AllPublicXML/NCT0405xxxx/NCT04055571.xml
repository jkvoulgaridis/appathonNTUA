    <textblock>
      This study will be a retrospective chart review of patients who have been diagnosed with the
      benign or malignant pancreatic disease under the practice of Dr. Rohan Jeyarajah, M.D., Dr.
      Houssam Osman M.D., and Dr. Edward Cho M.D., Sc.M. at Methodist Health System Hospital in
      Richardson, TX. The investigators plan to conduct an analysis of patients meeting the
      inclusion criteria from 2005 to present. Study will also be conducted by the PI, Sub-Is,
      surgery fellows, office staff and clinical research coordinator who are delegated to do by
      the PI. Data will be obtained by looking through either investigator's patients or through a
      national database. Data will be analyzed primarily by the study conductors.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is reported in the literature that the treatment of any pancreatic disease process,
      whether benign or malignant, continues to be a huge challenge. For example, patients with
      adenocarcinoma continue to be diagnosed at an advanced stage with medical and surgical
      options that are improving in terms of outcome measurements but with much more room for
      improvement. The investigator's goal is to continue to review our treatment outcomes to
      further improve overall survival, overall symptom control, mortality, and morbidity.

      The main aim of this study is to evaluate and compare the outcomes from the investigator's
      decisions on multiple treatments of benign or malignant pancreatic diseases.There is a need
      to understand and improve the current diagnosis and treatment algorithm for pancreatic
      pathologies. Continued evaluation and study is imperative to ensure that national guidelines
      are improving to enhance patient cure and/or recovery.

      All past patients who were treated for a particular benign or malignant pancreatic disease
      process under evaluation from 2005 to present will be included in this study.
