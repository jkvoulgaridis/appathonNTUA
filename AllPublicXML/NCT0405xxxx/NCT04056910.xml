      In this study, response to treatment and (progression free and overall) survival will be
      described and safety events of ivosidenib in combination with nivolumab will be summarized in
      patients with advanced solid tumors (nonresectable or metastatic) or enhancing gliomas.

      This study will describe the safety, response rate, progression free and overall survival,
      and summarize safety events of ivosidenib in combination with nivolumab in participants with
      advanced solid tumors (nonresectable or metastatic) or enhancing gliomas. Participants are
      required to have a histologically consistent diagnosis of IDH1 gene mutated tumor that is not
      eligible for curative therapy. Enrolled subjects will receive orally administered ivosidenib
      dosed daily on 28-day cycles and nivolumab will be infused every 28 days. Participants will
      be assessed at every visit for adverse events starting from the first dose of study
      treatment. Assessment (CT or MRI) for evaluation of disease response will be conducted every
      8 weeks (±7 days) from the first day of treatment cycle 1 and/or at any time when progression
      of disease is suspected. A Post-Treatment Follow-Up Visit for safety will occur 28 (+/- 5)
      days after the last dose of study drug.

             investigational product administration or may interfere with the interpretation of
             study results and, in the judgment of the treating investigator, would make the
             participant inappropriate for entry into this study.

          -  Have known active inflammatory gastrointestinal disease, chronic diarrhea, previous
             gastric resection or lap band dysphagia, short-gut syndrome, gastroparesis, or other

             administered orally. Gastroesophageal reflux disease under medical treatment is
             allowed (assuming no drug interaction potential).

          -  Have been committed to an institution by an order issued either by the judicial or
