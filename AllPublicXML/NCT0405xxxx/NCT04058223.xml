  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hemorrhoidal disease affects approximately 4.4%-36% of the general population, and it has
      been estimated that &gt;50% of the population aged &gt;50 years experiences hemorrhoidal problems .
      Traditional hemorrhoidectomy, including Milligan-Morgan, Ferguson, and Whitehead procedures ,
      are known to cause significant postoperative pain and discomfort and result in a poor quality
      of life after operation. Since the first introduction of the novel procedure hemorrhoidopexy
      by Longo in 1998, it has been considered as a safe procedure causing less postoperative pain
      and resulting in earlier recovery; furthermore, the patients are able to resume their normal
      daily life and work. The PPH stapler (Ethicon Endo-Surgery, Inc. Cincinnati, OH, USA) was
      also first introduced in 1998 as a device to perform this procedure. Subsequently, a new
      device, the DST stapler (Covidien, Mansfield, MA, USA), was introduced in 2008 with some
      structural differences, including a detachable anvil, three anchor points over different
      levels, a larger case, and different agraffe sizes.

      However, the majority of current studies have been focusing on the use of PPH stapler for
      hemorrhoidopexy, and comparison with the DST stapler has been rarely discussed. One
      randomized controlled trial that compared between the PPH stapler and the DST stapler
      reported that the DST stapler demonstrated a better hemostatic ability and allowed the
      resection of a larger area of mucosal prolapse; however, that trial focused only on bleeding
      among the postoperative complications. Currently, only a limited number of studies have
      compared these two devices in terms of pain, complications, and anorectal stricture incidence
      rate. The present investigation is a matched cohort-control study aimed to compare the
      postoperative short-term outcomes among patients with grade III and IV hemorrhoids who were
      treated with either the PPH or the DST stapler. The specimen surface area and the
      relationships with complications were also analyzed.

      After the surgery, the ring of the excised anorectal mucosa was cut open and flattened on a
      surgical towel as shown in Figure 2. The presence of muscle in the specimen was confirmed
      grossly and photographed. The entire surface area of the mucosa, muscle and the muscle/mucosa
      ratio were measured using the ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD,
      USA).
