  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      ICU delirium are assessed by clinical nurses twice every day. Delirious patients are matched
      with patients according to their disease, gender and age range(±3 years). Stool samples for
      gene sequencing are collected. Gut barrier function are studied with several serum biomarkers
      (endotoxin, etc.). Ecological analyses, regression models and mediation equation will be
      performed.

      ICU delirium are assessed by clinical nurses twice every day using Confusion Assessment
      Method for the ICU (CAM-ICU). Delirious patients are matched with patients according to their
      disease, gender and age range(±3 years). Stool samples for gene sequencing are collected
      within 24 hours after surgeries. Gut barrier function are studied with several serum
      biomarkers (endotoxin, etc.). Ecological analyses, regression models and mediation equation
      will be performed.
