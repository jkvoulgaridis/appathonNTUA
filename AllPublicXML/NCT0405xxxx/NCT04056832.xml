  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aortic stenosis is a commonly found heart disease, which often leads to mortality and
      morbidity. Valve replacement using mechanical prosthetic valve will have an expensive cost
      especially in the Integrated Heart Center of Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital, Jakarta, Indonesia.
      In addition to the expensive cost, patients who have mechanical prosthetic valve have an
      increased risk of infection of the prosthetic valve and developing thrombo-embolism thus have
      to consume a lifelong anticoagulant therapy that increase risk of bleeding. A surgical
      technique using autologous pericardium is an alternative to prosthetic valve replacement, one
      of which is a single pericardium strip technique that uses modified autologous pericardium
      technique from Ozaki et al and Duran et al.

      The objective of this study is to investigate the outcome of aortic valve replacement with a
      single pericardium strip of autologous pericardium in patients with aortic stenosis.

      This study will be conducted at the Integrated Heart Center of Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital,
      Jakarta, Indonesia, by using quasi experimental type time series design. Subjects are
      patients with aortic stenosis who are candidates for valve replacement. Inclusion criteria is
      having low to moderate surgical risk (EuroScore II &lt;5). The sampling method used in this
      study is non-probability consecutive sampling. This study will assess the outcome of the
      aortic valve replacement (valve hemodynamic, left ventricular reverse remodelling, sST2,
      6MWT) at 3 months and 6 months post-aortic valve replacement.

      It is expected that aortic valve replacement using a single strip of autologous pericardium
      will have good valve hemodynamic outcome, yield left ventricular reverse remodelling,
      decrease sST2 level, show upgrade in 6MWT, and have shorter aortic cross clamp time so that
      it can be an alternative to aortic valve replacement using mechanical prosthetic valve that
      is less expensive and have good outcomes in patient with aortic stenosis.

    <description>The anterior pericardium is taken in accordance with the measurements made using an aortic annulus sizer or Ismail sizer. The diameter of the annulus valve is converted to circumference of the aortic valve according as a measure of the length of the pericardium. Measurement of aortic commissure height is done by measuring the distance between the lowest point of the valve attachment to the highest point on the commissure as a measure of pericardium width. The pericardium is immersed in 0.6% glutaraldehyde solution for 10 minutes, then rinsed and soaked with saline solution 3 times for 6 minutes each. After the pericardium becomes firm it is cut to be a single strip according to the length and width in the previous measurement. It is then sutured to the aortic valve annulus.</description>
