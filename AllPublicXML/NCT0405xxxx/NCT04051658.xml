    <textblock>
      It is generally accepted that transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) can induce
      change in cortical excitability and thus modulate brain plasticity in human brain. tDCS has
      been used in neurorehabilitation to benefit ischemic stroke patients at different stage of
      stroke especially during acute, sub-acute and chronic phase with positive and safety reports.
      After unilateral stroke, the excitability of affected hemisphere is decreased, an increase in
      the excitability of unaffected hemisphere and an abnormally high interhemispheric inhibition
      (IHI) drive from intact to lesioned hemisphere have been reported. These neuronal
      reorganizations and plasticity begin in the very early stages after stroke. Prevent the
      abnormal IHI and thus increase the excitability of the affected hemisphere in the early phase
      would be a beneficial for stroke rehabilitation.

      Based on the polarity-specific effects, anodal tDCS increases cortical excitability and
      cathodal tDCS decreases cortical excitability. tDCS can be applied in two distinct montages:
      monocephalic and bi-hemispheric/dual-tDCS (applying two electrodes over both cerebral
      hemispheres at the same time). To induce post-stroke motor recovery, two different
      monocephalic montages are typically used: i) to restore excitability in the ipsilesional
      hemisphere: anode over the ipsilesional hemisphere and the cathode as the reference electrode
      placed over the contra-orbital area ii) to down regulate excitability of the contralesional
      hemisphere and rebalance IHI: cathode over the contralesional hemisphere and the anode as the
      reference electrode. Dual-tDCS can be also applied, permitting simultaneous coupling of
      excitatory and inhibitory effects on both cortices. In acute phase, there is few evidence
      regarding to the effect of tDCS on upper or lower limbs motor functions. However no evidence
      for tDCS combined with training in acute phase. Some of previous studies reported a positive
      effect on upper or lower limbs performance of tDCS with physical therapy in sub-acute to
      chronic stroke. The immediately and long-term effective of each tDCS montage (monocephalic
      and bi-hemispheric/dual-tDCS) without physical rehabilitation in acute stroke also has been
      reported. However, there is still unclear evidence regarding the best tDCS montage with
      conventional physical therapy for stroke recovery, especially for the early phase The
      mechanism underlying cortical excitability changes after tDCS is still elusive. However, one
      of possible mechanism indicating a change in cortical activity is the subsequent variation in
      hemodynamic response. Since difference montage of tDCS can induce differ response on brain
      excitability. Different methods have been developed for cerebral hemodynamic evaluations i.e.
      cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV), cerebral vasomotor reactivity (VMR) that is the
      capability of cerebral small vessels to respond to a stimulus. Transcranial color-coded
      duplex ultrasonography (TCCD) has been used to measure CBFV through the major intracranial
      vessels through relatively thin bone windows. It is a non-invasive, relatively inexpensive,
      safe and portable allowing bedside monitoring of CBFV that is convenience in the intensive
      care setting.

      Five consecutive days for tDCS over the M1 appeared to be safe in acute stroke patient, and
      tDCS over the M1 have been reported to improve motor functions and balance performance.
      Clinical outcomes that has been using in the clinical setting such as Fugl-Meyer Assessment
      for motor functions, strength assessed by hand-held dynamometer, Time up and go for dynamic
      balance and mobility, Five times sit to stand test for dynamic balance and muscle strength
      will be used as secondary motor outcome.

      The aim of the present study is to investigate hemodynamic response and motor performance
      following difference montages of 5 tDCS sessions over the primary motor cortex (M1) applied
      before conventional physical therapy, at immediate after of 5-sessions and then follow up at
      1 month.
