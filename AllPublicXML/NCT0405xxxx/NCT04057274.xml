  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study involves drawing blood samples from men before and after they perform 30-minutes
      of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise. The investigators will evaluate whether adding the
      exercise serum to colon cancer cells in a dish can reduce the growth of the cells compared to
      the resting serum.

      Note: serum is the liquid part of the blood that carries hormones and metabolites around the
      body.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Regular exercise is associated with a reduced risk of developing colon cancer. However, the
      mechanisms underpinning the anti-cancer effect of exercise are not yet fully understood. A
      recent theory suggests that each time you exercise, the short-lasting spikes in circulating
      hormones can suppress the growth of cancer cells. Hence, every exercise bout could have a
      direct anti-cancer effect.

      This study will recruit men with an increased of colon cancer and explore whether incubating
      colon cancer cells with serum collected after a bout of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise
      influences cell viability in vitro.

    <description>Viability of a human colon cancer cell line (LoVo) will be assessed via quantification of the fluorescent signal by the resazurin assay (Sigma-Aldrich, Dorset, UK). Cells will be seeded in culture medium containing 10% serum from individual participants and incubated for 48 hours. Fluorescence will then be measured using a microplate reader at an excitation of 540 nm and emission of 590 nm. Background fluorescence will be subtracted from each well and then values will be normalised to fluorescence of control cells grown in 10% fetal bovine serum instead of participant serum to give a percent viability.</description>

    <description>The moderate-intensity aerobic interval exercise will be performed on a cycle ergometer under the supervision of trained staff in an exercise science laboratory. Participants will perform a 5 to 10-minute warm-up that begins by pedalling against a light resistance (60 W) and progressively increases in resistance until a target heart rate of 50-60% heart rate reserve is achieved. Participants will then complete 6 x 5-minute bouts at 60% heart rate reserve whilst maintaining a cadence of 60 rev·min-1, separated by 2.5-minutes of pedalling against light resistance (60 W). The session will finish with a cool-down at light resistance (60 W) lasting 10-minutes.</description>
