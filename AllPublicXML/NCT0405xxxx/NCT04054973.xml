    <measure>Changes in brain chemistry as measured by 1H-MRS scans</measure>
    <time_frame>14 days</time_frame>
    <description>To demonstrate that L-arginine and tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) combination targets and alters brain chemistry in patients with TRS (target engagement). The investigators hypothesize that two-week treatment of L-arginine and Tetrahydrobiopterin (as Kuvan) will alter glutamate and GABA levels measured with proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS).</description>

    <measure>Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events as assessed by patient report</measure>
    <time_frame>14-days</time_frame>
    <description>The study doctor in conjunction with the study coordinator will conduct a diagnostic interview with the subject at each visit to record the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events as assessed by patient report.</description>

    <measure>Change in Positive and Negative Symptom scale (PANSS) from Baseline to Day 14</measure>
    <time_frame>14 days</time_frame>
    <description>The PANSS is a 30-item clinician-rated instrument for assessing schizophrenia symptoms. It consists of 3 subscales: positive subscale (7 items), negative subscale (7 items), and general psychopathology subscale (16 items). For each item, symptom severity was rated on a 7-point scale, from 1=absent to 7=extreme. The PANSS total score for each participant was sum of the rating assigned to each of the 30 PANSS items, and ranged from 30 to 210 with a higher score indicating greater severity of symptoms. The reported measure is the change from baseline at until day 14.</description>

    <measure>Change in blood levels of glutathione (GSH) from baseline to day 14.</measure>
    <time_frame>14 days</time_frame>
    <description>Blood levels of glutathione (GSH) (uM) will be measured at baseline and day 14 via blood draw. Values of the this biomarker correspond to the bodies inflammatory and oxidative stress response. The results will be analyzed and compared from baseline to day 14 to measure for the effect of L-arginine and BH4 combination treatment on the body's inflammatory and oxidative stress response regulation.</description>

    <measure>Change in blood levels of high-sensitivity C reactive protein (hsCRP) from baseline to day 14.</measure>
    <time_frame>14 days</time_frame>
    <description>Blood levels of high-sensitivity C reactive protein (hsCRP) (mg/L) will be measured at baseline and day 14 via blood draw. Values of the this biomarker correspond to the bodies inflammatory and oxidative stress response. The results will be analyzed and compared from baseline to day 14 to measure for the effect of L-arginine and BH4 combination treatment on the body's inflammatory and oxidative stress response regulation.</description>

    <measure>Change in blood levels of Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF-α) from baseline to day 14.</measure>
    <time_frame>14 days</time_frame>
    <description>Blood levels of Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF-α) (pg/mL) will be measured at baseline and day 14 via blood draw. Values of the this biomarker correspond to the bodies inflammatory and oxidative stress response. The results will be analyzed and compared from baseline to day 14 to measure for the effect of L-arginine and BH4 combination treatment on the body's inflammatory and oxidative stress response regulation.</description>
