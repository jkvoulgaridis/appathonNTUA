      To use machine learning for early detection of malignant brain edema in patients with MCA
      ischemia

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Malignant cerebral edema following large ischemic strokes account for up to 10% of all
      ischemic strokes. Mortality rates are high and most of the survivors are left severely
      disabled. Although decompressive craniectomy has been shown to significantly decrease
      mortality, high morbidity rates among survivors are reported. The optimal timepoint when
      neurosurgical decompression should be performed in the individual patient varies and is a
      subject of debate.

      Early prediction of malignant brain edema to identify those patients who benefit from
      surgical treatment is a clinical challenge. The aim of this study is to use machine learning
      for comprehensive analysis of CT images as well as clinical data from 1500 patients with
      large ischemic MCA strokes in oder to develop a model for early prediction of malignant brain
      edema. In a first step algorithms automatically identify characteristic imaging features and
      clinical data of 1400 retrospective data sets to create a multistage model (learning phase).
      This is followed by a validation phase where the model is tested with 100 other retrospective
      data sets.

    <time_frame>4/2019-3/2022</time_frame>
    <description>Deep learning algorithms will be used for automatic identification of specific image findings and specific clinical data that indicate a stroke-related malignant edema. Primary outcome measures are Sensitivity/Specificity/negative predictive value/positive predictive value of early detection of patients developing stroke-related malignant edema based on initial CT and 24 hour follow up CT and clinical parameters.</description>

    <measure>Number of correctly identified specific imaging findings for early detection of malignant edema</measure>
    <time_frame>4/2019-3/2022</time_frame>
    <description>Used specific imaging findings for early detection of malignant brain edema are Collateral status, Clot Burden Score, Vein Score, Change in CSF volume. In this study the specific image findings are manually annotated and also automatically detected using deep learning algorithms. Secondary outcome measures are Sensitivity/Specificity/NPV/PPV of specific imaging findings identified by deep learning algorithms.</description>

        1500 retrospective datasets will be collected from 5 large German stroke units. Data sets
        include imaging data and clinical data from patients with subtotal MCA infarcts (M1-M2
        occlusion), with or without malignant brain swelling, with or without reperfusion therapy,
        with or without neurosurgical decompression, and with or without death following malignant
        brain edema. Data sets from patients who have died following malignant brain edema will be
        included. Each data set consists of initial NCCT, CTA, (DSA if available), and follow-up
        NCCT until 14 days after stroke onset as well as clinical data.
