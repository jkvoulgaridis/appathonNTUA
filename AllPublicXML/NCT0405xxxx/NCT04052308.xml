  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The tripod of OA clinical treatment is education, weight loss and exercise. A sedentary
      lifestyle has been characterized as an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease.
      Studies have shown the inverse association between the level of physical activity and the
      incidence of cardiovascular disease. High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT), which consists
      of repeated high-intensity exercise sessions interspersed with passive recovery. Active, has
      been studied as a new therapeutic approach and has been shown to be effective in controlling
      blood pressure (BP) and arterial stiffness in treated hypertensive individuals. HIIT training
      has also been shown to be able to reverse the hemodynamic, metabolic and hormonal changes
      that are involved in the pathophysiology of essential hypertension, leading to improved
      arterial stiffness and BP response, endothelin-1 and nitrite / nitrate to exercise, increased
      cardiorespiratory fitness when compared to moderate-intensity continuous exercise in young
      women with a family history of essential hypertension. Six weeks of HIIT training (3 times /
      week) reduced body fat and waist circumference in young women. , while increasing fat-free
      mass, maximum running speed and aerobic fitness. Two recent studies evaluating body weight
      change in overweight patients have shown that HIIT training is comparable to
      moderate-intensity continuous exercise, but HIIT is more efficient compared to time spent
      training, which may facilitate the inclusion of daily routine training of patients. Previous
      work performed by the authors patients undergoing an education and physical activity program
      showed improvement in WOMAC. The investigators believe that the inclusion of an HIIT training
      protocol may lead to improved BP and hemodynamic variables in patients with knee
      osteoarthritis. To evaluate the effect of high intensity interval physical training
      associated with an educational program on BP, hemodynamic variables of individuals undergoing
      treatment for knee OA. 63 patients with knee OA will be randomized into 3 groups: interval
      exercise (21), continuous exercise (21) and control (21). Patients will be evaluated for BP
      using ABPM, arterial stiffness and endothelial reactivity by measuring carotid-femoral pulse
      wave velocity and quality of life using the Euroqol scale.

      High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT), which consists of repeated high intensity exercise
      sessions interspersed with passive / active recovery, has been studied as a new approach to
      hypertension therapy and systemic arterial hypertension. HIIT training has also been shown to
      be able to reverse how the hemodynamic, metabolic and hormonal changes that are involved in
      the physiology of essential hypertension, leading to improved arterial stiffness and BP
      response, endothelin-1 and nitrite / nitrate to exercise, Increased cardiorespiratory
      capacity when moderate-intensity continuous exercise was performed in young women with a
      history of essential arterial hypertension.

      Six weeks of HIIT training (3 times / week) reduced body fat and waist circumference in young
      women while increasing fat-free mass, maximum running speed, and aerobic fitness. Two recent
      studies evaluating body constitution change in overweight patients have shown that HIIT
      training is comparable to moderate-intensity continuous exercise, but HIIT is more efficient
      compared to the time spent during training, and HIIT can deliver savings of approximately 40%
      of the training time, which can facilitate the inclusion of training in the daily routine of
      patients.

      In previous work by the investigators, patients undergoing an education and physical activity
      program showed improvement in WOMAC. Researchers believe that the inclusion of an HIIT
      training protocol may lead to improved BP and hemodynamic variables in patients with knee
      osteoarthritis.
