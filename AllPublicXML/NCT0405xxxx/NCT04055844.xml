  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, single-arm, open-label, phase II trial for the frontline treatment of
      relapsed AML or MDS following allo-HCT. Eligible subjects will receive up to 4 cycles of
      combined modality treatment. The number of cycles depends on response, toxicity, and the
      remaining cell dose.

                  (0.85 if female) / (72 * Cr).

          -  Peripheral white blood cell count &lt;50 x 109/L within 3 days prior to consent. The use
             of hydroxyurea for cytoreduction is allowed and may continue until cycle 2 day 1

          -  Subjects and spouse/partner who are of childbearing potential must be using highly
             effective contraception consisting of 2 forms of birth control (at least 1 of which
             must be a barrier method) starting at Screening and continuing through the entire
             study (for at least 3 months after the last dose of ruxolitinib if study treatment is
             stopped early or subject withdraws consent). Highly effective contraception is defined
             as:

             for at least 3 months after the last dose of ruxolitinib.

          -  Subjects are willing and able to give written informed consent and to comply with all
             study visits and procedures. Parents or legal guardians will consent for minors and
             minors will be asked to assent.

        Patient Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Active uncontrolled infection at the time of consent. An active uncontrolled infection
             is defined as hemodynamic instability attributable to sepsis or new symptoms,
             worsening physical signs or radiographic findings attributable to infection.
             Persisting fever without signs or symptoms of infection will not be interpreted as an
             active uncontrolled infection. Subjects with a controlled infection receiving
             definitive therapy for 72 hours prior to enrollment are eligible.

          -  History of infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), unresolved hepatitis B,
             or hepatitis C.

             effective birth control for the duration of the study, as agents in this study are in
             pregnancy category C: Animal reproduction studies have shown an adverse effect on the
             fetus and there are no adequate and well-controlled studies in humans, and category D:
             there is positive evidence of human fetal risk based on adverse reaction data from
             investigational or marketing experience or studies in humans.

          -  Radiation therapy within 14 days prior to consent.

          -  Any prior therapy for relapse after allo-HCT.

          -  Prior DLI. CD34-selected boost is allowed

          -  Exposure to any other investigational agent, device or procedure within 14 days prior
             to consent

             the Investigator, might interfere with the subject's participation in the trial, pose

             subject.

          -  Subjects with known allergies, hypersensitivity or intolerance to ruxolitinib or
             similar compounds.

          -  In general good health as determined by the medical provider

          -  Adequate organ function defined as:

               -  Hematologic: hemoglobin, WBC, platelet within 10% of upper and lower limit of
                  normal range of test (gender based for hemoglobin)

               -  Hepatic: ALT &lt; 2 x upper limit of normal,

               -  Renal: serum creatinine &lt; 1.8 mg/dl

          -  Performance of a donor infectious disease screen panel including CMV Antibody,
             Hepatitis B Surface Antigen, Hepatitis B Core Antibody, Hepatitis C Antibody, HIV 1/2

             HCV, WNV, HIV by nucleic acid testing (NAT); or per current standard institutional
             donor screen - must be negative for HIV and active hepatitis B

          -  Not pregnant - females of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test
             within 7 days of mobilization start (if applicable) or within 7 days of cell
             collection (if not using mobilization)
