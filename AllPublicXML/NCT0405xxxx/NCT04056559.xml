      The aim of this study is to the validate adaptable mouthguards prototypes, patented by
      Bordeaux University and Bordeaux University Hospital.

    <textblock>
      The current state of knowledge in the areas of mouthguards shows that type II (adaptable)
      models account for 90% of the mouthguards of the sporting population. But a majority of these
      devices do not appear to comply with the European Directive 89/686 / European Economic
      Community.

      A previous work consisted of the production of prototypes of mouthguards meeting the
      essential requirements of the directive. These prototypes were the subject of a patent filed
      by the Bordeaux University and the Bordeaux University Hospital.

      The aim of this study is to the validate the prototypes for a future launch on the market.

    <measure>Impact on electromyographic recording</measure>
    <time_frame>At Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>The electromyographic activity will be amplified and filtered (bandwidth 10-1000 Hz). The signals will be digitized using a CED 1401 interface coupled to a microcomputer that is controlled by the &quot;SPIKE2&quot; software. The digitization frequency will be 2,000 Hz. The software &quot;SPIKE2&quot; will then calculate what is called &quot;integrated electromyogram&quot;: the electromyographic signals will be rectified and filtered with a moving average having a period of 0,2 seconds.</description>
