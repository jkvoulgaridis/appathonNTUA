  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a follow up investigation to our previous study entitled &quot;On-pump intraoperative
      echocardiography (OPIE)&quot; (clinicaltrials.gov NCT03094325) whereby we determined that left
      ventricular septal thickness as measured by the OPIE technique correlates highly with
      traditional methods of transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography during septal
      myectomy for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. OPIE may be especially useful in patients with a
      thin ventricular septal thickness as adequate treatment may rely on mere millimeters of
      myocardial resection. We therefore propose a study in which OPIE is compared to transthoracic
      and transesophageal echocardiography in patients with a thin interventricular septum.
      Subjects will receive the same perioperative care regardless of their involvement in the
      study. Patients who enroll in the study will undergo an additional intraoperative
      echocardiographic measurement that adds less than five minutes to total operative time.

    <description>Subjects will be patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with interventricular septae less than 2.0cm who are undergoing septal myectomy. The patients will have already had a number of preoperative transthoracic echocardiographs as part of their normal hypertrophic cardiomyopathy care. Before cardiopulmonary bypass, the basal anterior septal thickness will be measured by transesophageal echocardiograph as is performed in all septal myectomy procedures. The Principal Investigator will then use the OPIE probe to measure the anterior basilar septal thickness. Myectomy will be performed and OPIE will be repeated. The post-myectomy anterior basilar septal thickness will again be measured by transesophageal echocardiography.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All hypertrophic cardiomyopathy patients, inclusive of male and female and all
             racial/ethnic origins, age 18 or older who are scheduled to receive a septal myectomy
