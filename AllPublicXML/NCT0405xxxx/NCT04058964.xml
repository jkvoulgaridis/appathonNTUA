  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well pembrolizumab and PEGPH20 work in treating patients with
      pancreatic cancer that has spread to other places in the body (metastatic). Immunotherapy
      with monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack
      the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. PEGPH20 is
      an enzyme that breaks down hyaluronic acid coating tumor cells which may inhibit growth of
      tumor cells. Giving pembrolizumab and PEGPH20 may work better in treating patients with
      pancreatic cancer compared to pembrolizumab alone.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the progression free survival duration of patients treated with the combination
      of pegylated recombinant human hyaluronidase PH20 (PEGPH20) and pembrolizumab.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the safety and tolerability of the combination of PEGPH20 and pembrolizumab.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate objective response rate (ORR) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
      (RECIST) and Immune-Modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (iRECIST) criteria,
      duration of response (DOR), disease control rate (DCR), time to progression (TTP) and
      progression-free survival (PFS) per RECIST and iRECIST as assessed by M.D. Anderson
      investigators and overall survival (OS) of the combination of pembrolizumab and PEGPH20.

      II. To explore the association between PD-L1 expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC), shed
      PD-L1 level, hyaluronan (HA) levels, somatic gene expression profiling and antitumor efficacy
      of the combination of pembrolizumab and PEGPH20 based on RECIST 1.1 as well as OS.

      III. To explore the relationship between genomic variation and response to study treatment.

      IV. To examine the effect of pembrolizumab and PEGPH20 on immune cell infiltration into
      tumor.

      V. To explore the effect of PEGPH20 on serum HA levels, and to compare changes in serum HA
      with clinical efficacy.

      VI. To determine the impact of the combination of pembrolizumab and PEGPH20 on circulating
      immune cells.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 10 minutes on day 1 and pegylated
      recombinant human hyaluronidase PH20 subcutaneously (SC) on days 1, 8, and 15. Cycles repeat
      every 21 days for 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 9 and
      12 weeks.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Have histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of pancreatic adenocarcinoma
             based on pathology report

          -  Be willing and able to provide written informed consent for the trial. The subject may
             also provide consent for Future Biomedical Research. However, the subject may
             participate in the main trial without participating in Future Biomedical Research.

          -  Have at least one measurable lesion and one lesion available for biopsy (not the
             primary pancreatic lesion) based on RECIST 1.1. Target lesions situated in a
             previously irradiated area are considered measurable if progression has been
             demonstrated in such lesions

          -  Have had prior treatment with first-line therapy for metastatic disease for at least 4
             months, and have had a radiologic response or stable disease at the most recent
             imaging. Adjuvant therapy for resected disease will not count as first-line therapy.
             Therapies that are derivative of others (e.g. fluorouracil/leucovorin
             calcium/oxaliplatin [FOLFOX] vis-a-vis fuorouracil/irinotecan/leucovorin/oxaliplatin
             [FOLFIRINOX]) will be counted as a single line of treatment for the purpose of
             determining the number of prior therapies

          -  Be willing to undergo a core biopsy or excisional biopsy of tumor from a metastatic
             site. Note that the biopsy itself will be done only after the patient has been found
             to meet all other inclusion/exclusion criteria and the patient is otherwise prepared
             to start therapy

          -  Be willing to provide (and have available) archival tissue from a surgical or biopsy
             specimen obtained PRIOR to the most recent chemotherapy

          -  Have a performance status of 0 or 1 on the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG)
             performance scale

          -  Demonstrate adequate organ function. Specimens must be collected within 10 days prior
             to the start of trial treatment

          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential must have a negative urine or serum
             pregnancy test at screening (prior to biopsy) and again within 24 hours prior to
             receiving the first dose of study medication. If the urine test is positive or cannot
             be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will be required

          -  Male and female subjects of childbearing potential must agree to use an adequate
             method of contraception starting with the first dose of trial therapy through 120 days
             after the last dose of trial therapy. Note: Abstinence is acceptable if this is the
             usual lifestyle and preferred contraception for the subject. Acceptable methods of
             contraception are as follows:

               -  Single method (1 of the following is acceptable): intrauterine device (IUD),
                  vasectomy of a female subject's male partner, contraceptive rod implanted into
                  the skin

               -  Combination method (requires use of 2 of the following): diaphragm with
                  spermicide (cannot be used in conjunction with cervical cap/spermicide), cervical
