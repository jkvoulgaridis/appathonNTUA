  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A multicenter cross-sectional observational study was conducted in the counties of Geneva and
      Vaud (1'271'957 inhabitants in 2016 and 1'288'090 inhabitants in 2017 ) and included all
      subjects under home NIV followed by the two university hospitals of Geneva and Lausanne (HUG
      and CHUV), one private regional general hospital (La Tour Hospital), one pulmonary
      rehabilitation center (Rolle Hospital) and 38 pulmonologists in private practice (for a total
      of 43, 18 in Geneva and 20 in Vaud). In Switzerland home NIV can be prescribed, initiated and
      followed by a pulmonologist in private practice without referring to a hospital center. The
      coordinating institution for this project was the Geneva University Hospital (HUG).

      The investigator's goals were to update the prevalence of home NIV, the description of the
      population involved, the devices used, their settings, compliance, and a large array of
      technical data to provide a complete photography of home NIV in an area with 30 years of
      experience in this field.

    <description>Diagnosis leading to NIV. 5 disease categories with identification of the percentage of patients with SRBD, COPD, Overlap syndrome, OHS, NMD, restrictive chest wall and lung disorders. All data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Qualitative parameters were described as frequencies and percentages and quantitative parameters were described as mean and standard deviation (SD) or as median and interval interquartile (IQR). Comparisons between groups were performed using chi-square tests or Fisher exact tests for qualitative parameters and analysis of variance (one-way ANOVA) or Kruskal-Wallis tests for quantitative parameters, as appropriate.</description>
