  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall aim of this study was to assess the effects of nutritional supplementation and
      education on the healing of foot ulcers in diabetic patients. The hypothesis was that
      improving dietary intake can promote wound healing by improving nutritional status, blood
      flow, and decreasing inflammatory biomarkers while increasing anti-inflammatory factors.

    <description>Participants in the treatment group were educated about improving their diet by consuming more low-fat high-quality protein sources, vegetables, complex carbohydrates and less simple carbohydrates. They were also instructed to consume two servings (474 ml) of a commercially produced Glucose Control Nutritional Shake between meals throughout the day for 12 weeks or until complete healing. The supplements provided a total of 500 kilocalories, 28 grams of high-quality protein and essential vitamins and minerals.</description>
