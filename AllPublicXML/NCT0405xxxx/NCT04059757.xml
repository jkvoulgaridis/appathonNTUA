  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gastro-Intestinal Acute Graft Versus Host Disease (GI-aGVHD) is a complication of allogeneic
      stem cell transplant which is usually treated with steroids. You are being asked to take part
      in this study because you have recently been diagnosed with GI-GVHD. The standard of care for
      GI-aGVHD is steroids. When aGVHD does not respond to steroids it is described as
      steroid-refractory aGVHD. There is no standard therapy for steroid-refractory GI-aGVHD.

      This study is a Phase II study. The main goal of a Phase II study is to see the efficacy and
      what side effects are seen with FMT as a treatment for GVHD.

      Fecal Microbiota Transplantation (FMT) is the transfer of fecal material from a healthy donor
      to a patient in order to restore the diversity of the intestinal microbiota. FMT is currently
      indicated for the treatment of recurrent Clostridium Difficile infection.

      FMT is considered experimental in this study, meaning it is not approved by the FDA for the
      treatment of GVHD.

    <intervention_model_description>The study follows R. Simon's minimax two-stage phase II design with type I error of 0.05 and power of 80%. Ten participants will be enrolled on stage one. If there are 2 or less responses, the trial will be stopped and the treatment will be considered less than 60% effective for this patient population. If there are 3 or more responses, 7 additional patients will be enrolled.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Toxicity is defined as:

Any grade 3 or more adverse event that occurs during or immediately after receiving the treatment and is definitely attributed to FMT.</description>

    <description>Response will be determined from the maximum GI-aGVHD stage and grade at day 28 (+/- 3 days) post FMT treatment. Response will be determined by P.I and a second physician.
Complete response (CR) is defined as the complete resolution of GI aGVHD symptoms, without secondary GVHD therapy.
Partial response (PR) is defined as improvement without complete resolution and without worsening of GI aGVHD, without secondary aGVHD therapy.
No response (NR) is defined as the same grade of GVHD, progression, death, or the addition of secondary GVHD therapy.
Progression is defined as worsening GI aGVHD.</description>
