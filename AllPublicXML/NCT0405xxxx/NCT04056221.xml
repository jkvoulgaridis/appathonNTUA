  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sjögren's syndrome (SS) is a multisystemic chronic autoimmune disease characterized by
      lymphocytic infiltration of the exocrine glands, resulting in salivary and lacrimal glands
      hypofunction, with symptoms of dry eyes and mouth. Xerostomia and xerophthalmia present
      profound negative impact on patients' quality of life, especially due to difficulties in
      swallowing, dysarthria, dysgeusia, halitosis and burning tongue, discomfort and visual
      disturbances that lead to daily activities difficulty such as driving or reading. Although
      some drugs may improve symptoms and prevent SS complications, they can cause significant
      adverse effects and even fail to relieve symptoms. Integrative and complementary techniques
      have become a therapeutic option for SS patients. Scientific evidence has supported the
      efficacy of acupuncture in relieving symptoms of xerostomia and xerophthalmia. Due to the
      lack of well-controlled and standardized clinical studies, this study aimed to conduct a
      randomized and controlled trial to determine the efficacy of acupuncture as a therapeutic
      option for SS patients' symptoms relief.

    <textblock>
      The present study is designed as a 24-month, single centre, double-blind, randomized,
      controlled, two-arm clinical trial (acupuncture and control). The research will be conducted
      following the CONSORT recommendations and the STRICTA extension. The study care protocol will
      consist in acupuncture or control intervention at the selected acupoints (R6, E6,E2, Ig4,
      VC24, TA23, B2) for 8 weeks, 20 minutes sessions with 12 weeks of follow up. Complementary
      clinical approaches (sialometry, sialochemistry, Schirmer test, staining with topical
      lissamine green), and the questionnaires (OHIP-14, Eular Sjögren's Syndrome Patient Reported
      Index (ESSPRI), Xerostomia Inventory, ocular surface disease index (OSDI) will be performed
      in weeks 1, 8 and 12. The control group will consist of superficial acupuncture, or placebo,
      or sham. After all interventions and evaluation methods completed, data will be analyzed for
      their distribution and homogeneity in order to choose the most appropriate statistical test.

    <description>Instrument of data collection which comprises of 14 questions with two questions each under seven domains. The domains include; functional limitation,physical pain, psychological discomfort, physical disability, psychological disability, social disability and handicap. Responses to the questions are based on a Likert scale which ranged from 0- &quot;never&quot; to 4- &quot;always&quot;.</description>

    <description>This 12-item questionnaire assesses dry eye symptoms and the effects it has on vision-related function in the past week of the patient's life. The questionnaire has 3 subscales: ocular symptoms, vision-related function, and environmental triggers. Patients rate their responses on a 0 to 4 scale with 0 corresponding to &quot;none of the time&quot; and 4 corresponding to &quot;all of the time.&quot;</description>
