        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Written informed consent obtained from the parents or legally acceptable
             representatives (LARs) of the subject who have been informed of the purpose, method,
             effects, etc., of the study

          2. A male or female 6 to 8 weeks of age, inclusive, at the time of the first vaccination

          3. In good health as determined by medical history, physical examination, and judgment by
             the Investigator

          4. Body weight 3.2 kg and over at the time of screening

          5. Subjects for whom the Investigator believed that their parent(s)/LAR(s) could comply
             with the requirements of the protocol (e.g., completion of the Subject Diary Cards,
             return for site visits)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Past or present medical history of known or suspected diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis,
             polio, HB and/or Hib diseases

          2. Any history of allergy to any of the components or excipients of EupentaTM Inj.,
             including aluminum hydroxide, sodium hydrogen phosphate heptahydrate, monobasic sodium
             phosphate dihydrate, polysorbate and thimerosal

          3. Any medical condition which can compromise the infant's safety, as per Investigator's
             discretion

          4. History of seizures or abnormal cerebral signs in the newborn period or other serious
             neurological abnormality

          5. History of bleeding tendencies

          6. Household contact and/or intimate exposure with a confirmed case of diphtheria,

             anti-pyretic/analgesic medication. Subjects who meet this criterion will be rescreened
             to check the temperature after the temporary condition has resolved and if they are
             within the window period for age of first vaccination at the time of re-scheduled
             visit

          8. History of previous diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP), and/or Hib vaccination doses

          9. History of previous or concurrent vaccinations other than Bacillus Calmette-Guérin
             (BCG), HB vaccination at birth, Polio, Rotavirus and Pneumococcal vaccines

         10. Known or suspected immune disorders, or, received immunosuppressive therapy

         11. Participation 30 days prior to screening in the study or simultaneously in another
             study and/or received any investigational product
