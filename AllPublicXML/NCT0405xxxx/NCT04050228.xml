  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to assess the feasibility of randomizing breast cancer
      patients to quantitative ultrasound to guide adaptive Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy as compared to
      standard clinical monitoring and therapy. The Investigators have previously demonstrated that
      high-frequency ultrasound and spectroscopy, and recently conventional-frequency ultrasound
      and spectroscopy may be used to detect cell death in vitro, in situ and in vivo. The method
      can detect different forms of cell death and has been demonstrated to be sensitive to
      apoptotic, necrotic and mitotic cell death. By detecting cell death early in a treatment on
      the order of hours to days, rather than traditional anatomical assessments that take place
      weeks to months after the completion of therapy, ineffective therapies could be switched to
      more efficacious treatments or aggressive salvage therapy which has shown to already benefit
      patients. The overarching goal of this research is to transform the delivery of neoadjuvant
      chemotherapy using quantitative ultrasound (QUS), which is non-invasive, inexpensive and
      portable.

    <description>Patient in the control arm will receive standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy and clinical monitoring as per standard of care. Patients will be imaged but no modifications to treatment will occur in this trial arm depending on response by quantitative ultrasound. Patients in the experimental arm will receive adaptive neoadjuvant chemotherapy based on quantitative ultrasound monitoring. Non-responders to neoadjuvant chemotherapy based on quantitative ultrasound will be switched to different chemotherapy or other treatments reflecting current clinical practice. The treatment option will be left to the discretion of the treating medical oncologist and the care team.</description>
