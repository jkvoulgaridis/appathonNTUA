  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, single-center, dose finding phase I trial in
      healthy adult volunteer participants consisting of two phases, an unblinded dose escalation
      and an observer-blinded treatment phase.

      The aim is to investigate the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of MV-LASV after
      administration of two different dose levels of MV-LASV. Placebo will be applied to blind the
      different Treatment schedules.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, interventional, observer-blinded, randomized, phase I trial, comparing
      different dose levels of MV-LASV. As safety precaution, the study will begin with enrollment
      of two successive unblinded dose groups of sentinel participants randomized into groups of
      four in an open-label fashion (group A and B).

      Thereafter, 52 participants will be enrolled in an observer-blinded, randomized manner into
      one of the three treatment groups (A, B or C). Placebo will be applied to blind the different
      Treatment schedules.

      After the screening visit, participants will bei enrolled to one of three Treatment groups.
      Visits for immunogenicity sample collection and safety assessments will be performed for 56
      days, and additionally subjects will for long-term follow-up up to 365 days.

      The investigator and site personnel assessing Adverse Events (AEs), all participants, as well
      as the sponsor's representatives involved in the monitoring and conduct of the study will be
      unblinded to which vaccine was administered within the unblinded treatment phase. Only the
      site personnel performing randomization, reparation and administration of Investigational
      Medicinal Product (IMP) will be unblinded within the randomized observer-blinded treatment
      phase.
