  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The assessment and treatment of pain in neonates remains a challenge. In an effort to improve
      the quality of care while limiting opioid-related adverse effects, this study aims to
      determine the efficacy of a non-pharmacological intervention on the mitigation of
      nociception-specific responses to a skin breaking procedure in term and preterm neonates.
      Such responses will be measured using behavioral measures as well as with
      electroencephalography-based methods.

      Eligible neonates who are 36-56 weeks post-menstrual age and who are scheduled to undergo a
      clinically required heel lance will be studied after obtaining appropriate verbal and written
      consent from the respective parents. Subjects will be monitored during a baseline resting
      state, during vibratory stimuli alone, and during a heel lance that is randomized to be
      preceded or not preceded by the vibratory stimulus. The sessions will include time-locked
      video recordings and electroencephalography using a specialized net of 128 electrodes
      (Electrical Geodesics Inc., EGI; Eugene, OR). Behavioral and cortical responses will be then
      be analyzed in a blinded fashion to determine the efficacy of the vibratory intervention, as
      well as to validate what behavioral responses are most correlated with nociception-specific
      cortical activity.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in nociception-specific brain activity</measure>
    <time_frame>EEG-based responses are very brief, so the relevant assessment window is 350-700 ms after stimulus</time_frame>
    <description>Electroencephalography (EEG)-based measurements will be done to detect changes in nociception-specific cortical activity. Recordings will be done using a high-density array of 128 electrodes embedded in soft sponges (Electrical Geodesics, Inc. (EGI); Eugene, Oregon, USA) soaked in warm saline and applied to the infant's head to record event-related potentials (ERPs) with a sampling rate of 1000 Hz, filters set to 0.1-400 Hz. As per published protocols, the midline Cz electrode will be used as the reference. Previous studies have also determined the EEG-based nociception-specific response to occur 350-700 ms after the stimulus. Changes in the amplitude of the signal during this time frame is the primary outcome measure.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in facial expression</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessment of facial expression is done based on video clips that are synchronized with the ERP window of 350-700ms after stimulus</time_frame>
    <description>The Neonatal Facial Coding System (NFCS) is an established scale that uses facial actions to monitor pain in newborn infants. Facial actions that occur each score 1 point, while those that do not occur each score 0 points. Partial actions score 0.5 points. This system consists of up to 10 facial actions and may therefore score between 0 and 10. A higher score is interpreted as a higher pain intensity. Comparison of median scores between groups will determine the effect of the intervention, which should result in a lower score to represent mitigation of pain.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Visible limb withdrawal reflex</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessment of limb withdrawal is done based on video clips that are synchronized with the ERP window of up to 700ms after stimulus</time_frame>
    <description>Visible limb withdrawal is simply based on whether or not a visible limb movement is detectable in response to the stimulus. This response may be noted in the ipsilateral and/or contralateral limb. The results are recorded on a yes/no basis for each limb individually and together. The hypothesis is that a lower incidence of limb withdrawal will occur in the intervention group to represent mitigation of the response to skin puncture.</description>

    <description>The Baby GentleStick is a handheld device that fits and provides vibration to an Owen Mumford Unistik3 Dual lancet. The gentle vibration occurs at 178 Hertz with a free-hanging 0.24 mm range of motion. The device may provide vibration alone and also allow for simultaneous vibration and deployment of the lancet.</description>
