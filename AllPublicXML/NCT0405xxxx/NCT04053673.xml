  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      RBN-2397 inhibits PARP7, an enzyme that is switched on by cancer stresses, such as the toxins
      in cigarette smoke. Cancer cells use PARP7 to hide from the immune system by stopping the
      cell from sending a signal (Type 1 interferon) that tells the immune system that something is
      wrong and to kill the cell. RBN-2397 has been shown in animal studies to inhibit tumor growth
      and also shuts down the &quot;don't kill me&quot; signal the tumor is sending to evade the immune
      system. As a PARP7 inhibitor RBN-2397 is different from drugs inhibiting PARP1, PARP2 and
      PARP3 enzymes which are approved for the treatment of certain ovarian and breast cancers.

      The primary purpose of this study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of orally
      administered RBN-2397 in patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors. This study will
      also evaluate the safety and tolerability of RBN-2397, examine the pharmacokinetics (PK)
      (measure how the body absorbs, breaks down and eliminates RBN-2397) and investigate whether
      it has antitumor activity in solid tumor cancers.

      This is a first-in-human, Phase 1, multi-center, open-label, dose-escalation study to:

        -  Evaluate the safety profile and MTD of RBN-2397 administered orally and establish the
           RBN-2397 dose(s) and schedule(s) recommended for further investigation in Phase 2

        -  Characterize the PK profile of RBN-2397

        -  Identify preliminary antitumor activity.

        -  Biomarkers and their correlation with response to RBN-2397 and other outcomes will be
           examined.

      Cohorts will follow a traditional 3 + 3 design. After enrollment of the first participant
      within a cohort, there must be a wait period of at least 1 week before enrollment of
      additional participants in that cohort.

      After the MTD is determined, Expansion Cohort(s) of approximately 20 participants each will
      be enrolled to further examine the safety, PK, pharmacodynamics, and antitumor activity of
      RBN-2397 at the MTD or other dose recommended for further investigation. Based on nonclinical
      data as well as clinical data obtained from the dose-escalation portion of this study,
      enrollment in the Expansion Cohort(s) may be limited to specific tumor type(s), as warranted
      by the data.
