  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the PK, relative bioavailability, safety, and tolerability of the
      extended release (ER) 50 mg MN-166 (ibudilast) tablet formulation as compared to the
      intermediate-release (IR) capsule formulation of MN-166 (ibudilast) and to examine the effect
      of food on the pharmacokinetics of the ER formulation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, open-label, single-center study in at least 12 healthy volunteers or
      participants.

      Participants (at least n=2/sequence) meeting study eligibility and providing informed consent
      will be randomized to one of six treatment sequences. The three treatments of each sequence
      will be administered in a crossover fashion, separated by one week apart. Thus, participation
      in the study is 3 weeks long per participant.

      During each single-dose treatment, participants will check in the study facility the night
      before dosing and remain at the facility until 32 hours after dosing. For example, the
      participant would arrive at the study facility at 8:00 PM Sunday night, receive a single dose
      at 8:00 AM Monday morning, and blood samples will be taken prior to dosing and 30 minutes, 1,
      2 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24, and 32 hours after dosing. After the 32-hour sample collection,
      participants may leave the study facility. Participants will return to the study facility for
      outpatient visits at each remaining PK sampling day (48, 72, and 96 hours after dosing) and
      after last treatment in each sequence. Participants will be discharged from the study after
      the last treatment.

             within 3 months before receiving study drug.

         19. Used any systemic medications, including vitamins and over-the-counter items, during
             the 14 days (or five times the elimination half-life of the medication, whichever is
             longer) before receiving study drug or will require their use during the study.
             Metabolic inducers and herbal preparations, which have been shown to produce metabolic
             enzyme induction or inhibition, whether as teas or formulations, are prohibited 28
             days before dosing. Paracetamol 3000 mg/day will be allowed up to 2 consecutive days
             before dosing and during the outpatient phase of the study, as needed.
