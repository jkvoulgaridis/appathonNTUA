    <textblock>
      The study evaluates differences in perceived and objective workload in anesthetists during
      intubation procedure with a direct (Mcintosh) or indirect (Glidescope) laryngoscope. Expert
      anesthetists will perform 3 intubations per device, while completing a secondary task, during
      which reaction times to an auditory stimulus will be recorded, and will complete a
      questionnaire (the NASA-Task Load Index) to evaluate their perceived workload at the end of
      each procedure.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Intubation and laryngoscopy are the most demanding procedure in anesthesiological routine
      clinical practice, associated with high workload. The measurement and management of workload
      is considered important in anesthesiology to prevent work-related stress and errors in
      performance. New devices, thanks to advances in technology, seem promising in reducing
      operators' workload and improving safety and success of intubation processes.

      Therefore, in this study, based on previous results, the hypothesis that the Glidescope
      videolaryngoscope reduces operators' perceived and and objective workload, as compared to the
      standard Mcintosh laryngoscope, will be tested.

      Expert anesthetists will perform 3 intubations per device in a randomized order, while
      completing a secondary task, during which reaction times (verbal responses) to an auditory
      stimulus (a clacson) will be recorded, and operators will complete a questionnaire (the
      NASA-Task Load Index) to evaluate their perceived workload at the end of each procedure.
