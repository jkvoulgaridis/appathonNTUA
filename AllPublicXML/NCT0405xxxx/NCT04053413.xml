  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is pilot quasi-experimental study of women with one or two prior cesarean deliveries who
      are now pregnant and eligible for a trial of labor after cesarean delivery, to assess whether
      a decision aid, providing knowledge about trial of labor (VBAC) and planned repeat cesarean
      delivery can improve the birth options decision-making process for patients.

      Participants are screened for eligibility through electronic health records. Once an
      individual is screened eligible, and email invite is sent providing information about the
      study and assessing the interest in participation. An on-line consent is completed and women
      are entered sequentially into the usual care group and then through further recruitment,
      another sample of women are entered into the decision aid group. The primary outcome is
      satisfaction with the shared decision-making process with their provider.

      Once a potential participant is screened eligible, completes the on-line informed consent,
      they are officially enrolled in the study and sent a link confirming their enrollment and the
      study group in which they have been assigned. Participants are sequentially enrolled in the
      study with enrollment first into the usual care group. Once enrollment in the usual care
      group is complete, enrollment into the decision aid group will occur.

      The study includes two non-randomized groups:

      Arm 1 (Usual care group): Women in this group will undergo usual care and complete the survey
      questions on knowledge of risks and benefits of TOLAC (also referred to as VBAC) and planned
      repeat cesarean (PRCS), certainty of their decision, and involvement in the decision for
      trial of labor (TOLAC) or repeat cesarean delivery.

      Arm 2: (Decision aid group- group receiving the decision tool): Women in this group will
      receive a decision aid prior to undergoing counseling by their physician. Following
      completion of the decision aid and physician counseling, they will complete a series of
      survey questions to assess their knowledge of the risks and benefits of TOLAC and PRCS,
      certainty of their decision, and involvement in the decision for repeat cesarean or TOLAC.

      The decision aid group will be compared with women who do not receive the decision aid (usual
      care group).

    <measure>Shared Decision Making (SDM) Process score</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 months prior to delivery</time_frame>
    <description>This is a measure of the patient's involvement in the decision. 1 point is assigned for discussing the pros 'a lot' or 'some'; 1 point is assigned for discussing the cons 'a lot' or 'some'; 1 point is assigned for responding 'yes' if the provider explained the options; and 1 point is assigned for responding 'yes' that the provider asked the patient what treatment she wanted. The tool's score range is 0-4. A higher score indicates more involvement in the decision.</description>

    <description>The decision aid is a series of web pages that includes videos, questions, and evidence-based information. The decision aid is designed to help women think about what matters to them and what questions they may have for their doctor or midwife. At the end, they receive a summary of which way they are leaning and what matters most to them.</description>
