  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intraplaque hemorrhage (IPH) is one of the main features of the carotid plaque instability's
      and predictor of ischemic stroke. Benefits (on the basis on benefit/risk ratio) of the
      carotid endarterectomy remain unclear for stroke asymptomatic patients; thus, more and more
      patients with important stenosis (i.e. over 60%) detected are not operated. However, these
      patients need adapted therapeutic treatments to limit plaque instability and this should
      include physical activity (PA). Indeed, PA has been showed to decrease numerous inflammatory
      markers involved in atherosclerosis. It has also recently been reported on stroke
      asymptomatic patients that the prevalence of carotid IPH was decreased in those with higher
      level of PA. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the IPH has been shown to be the better
      non-invasive imaging technique to assess carotid plaque instability and in particular IPH.
      Here, the aim of this study is to assess the effect of an individualized home-based 6 months
      physical activity intervention on carotid IPH and other biomarkers of vulnerability for
      asymptomatic patients.

      This study has been designed as a monocentric, longitudinal and interventional study. This
      study will involve one centre: Hopital Louis Pradel (HCL, Lyon). After inclusion tests,
      patients will be randomly included in the control group, or in the PA group. Patients of the
      PA group will have connected bracelets to measure daily count of steps. Twice a month, daily
      goals will be revaluated to increase or maintain the steps per day. The final goal is to
      reach 6 000 steps per day or increase by 30% the initial count of steps per day. Same tests
      will be done after 6 months of intervention for comparison.

The subjects self-rate their level of severity for each dimension using a five-level (EQ-5D-5L) scale (scored from 1 to 5, 1 indicating no problem and 5 indicating extreme problem).
The health rate score correspond to the addition of each dimension score and is from 5 to 25. The lower the score, the better the health state.</description>
