    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 2a trial to study the biological
      activity, safety, and tolerability of regulatory T Lymphocytes (Tregs) taken and expanded
      outside of the body and returned back to the same person whose Treg were removed, given back
      by IV (intravenously) and in combination with low-dose IL-2 in people with Amyotrophic
      Lateral Sclerosis (ALS).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Based on data collected in a previous study with a small group of patients, evidence was
      found to show that interfering with the immune system using Treg cells slowed ALS disease
      progression. It is known that Treg cell numbers and function are reduced in patients with ALS
      and in some patients with lower Treg cells, they have a more marked rapid progression of
      their ALS. For this study, there are two sites (in Houston, TX and Boston, MA) in which Tregs
      will be taken from participants, increased or expanded outside the body, and then
      re-administered back to the participants from which the Tregs came.

      This study has two parts:

        1. the first period is a 6-month phase 2a, 2-center, randomized, placebo-controlled
           clinical trial studying the biological activity, safety, and tolerability of the
           increased / expanded Tregs administered intravenously (IV) with subcutaneous low-dose
           Interleukin-2 (IL-2) in 12 adults with ALS. IL2 helps regulate the immune system's white
           blood cells.

        2. The second period is a 6-month open-label extension in which all participants will
           receive their own expanded Treg cells administered intravenously in combination with
           subcutaneous low-dose IL-2.

      This study is studying whether the enhancement of Treg numbers and function will slow disease
      progression.

      In the first study of Tregs, we completed a single-center, open-label phase I study of Tregs
      from people with ALS. Tregs were increased outside the body and returned back to the
      individual Treg owners in multiple doses every 2 to 4 weeks. This early study provided
      evidence in a small group of patients that treatment with autologous Tregs may be effective
      in slowing ALS progression.
