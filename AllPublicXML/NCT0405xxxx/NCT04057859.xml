  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this observational study is to examine the level of activity in the prostate
      cancer population treated with Androgen Deprivation Therapy (ADT).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the current observational study will be to examine the level of activity in the
      prostate cancer population treated with ADT therapy; specifically, the impact of physical
      activity levels along with nutritional guidance through physician support. The application of
      an innovative technology to motivate patients will also be examined through the provision of
      an accelerometer/pedometer (NIKE+ FuelBand). The physical activity will be monitored by a
      NIKE+ Fuelband or tracked on an activity log.This study will assess the clinical and patient
      reported outcomes relevant to the management of their prostate cancer, in conjunction with a
      program assessing daily physical activities and nutritional guidance on the impact on the
      patient's quality of life, mobility and weight maintenance.
