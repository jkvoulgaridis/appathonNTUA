  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a safety study of the molecule VU319 to ascertain pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic
      data and test cognitive enhancement in healthy volunteers.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a chronic and irreversible neurodegenerative disease
      characterized by the deterioration of memory and other cognitive functions, progressive
      impairments in normal daily living, and severe neuropsychiatric symptoms and behavioral
      disturbances. Currently, there is no available prevention or cure for AD. Therapeutic
      strategies for the cognitive impairments in AD involve only symptomatic treatments, primarily
      through enhancement of cholinergic neurotransmission using AChEIs.

      Primary objectives To establish the safety and tolerability of multiple dose (up to VU319
      steady state) VU319 administration in healthy volunteers To establish the maximum tolerated
      dose of multiple dose (up to VU319 steady state) VU319 administration in healthy volunteers
      To characterize the plasma pharmacokinetics and urinary excretion of VU319 and metabolite
      after single dose oral administration in healthy volunteers Secondary objectives To establish
      the effect of food on the bioavailability and pharmacokinetic parameters of VU319 in healthy
      volunteers Exploratory Objectives To gain preliminary evidence that tolerable doses of VU319
      engage central M1 receptors by 1) altering/enhancing cognitive performance, and 2) enhancing
      cortical event related potentials (ERP) as a measure of increased cognitive function in
      healthy volunteers

      This will be a double blind, randomized, placebo controlled, and sequential dose escalation
      in male or female healthy volunteers. Gender will be balanced to the extent possible.
      Volunteers will receive oral VU319 multiple dose administration in the fasted state. Subjects
      meeting entry criteria will be enrolled in successive dose escalating cohorts of 8 subjects
      each (2 placebo and 6 active drug per dose level). The dose levels will be tested
      sequentially until the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) is reached, or saturation of exposure
      occurs, or sustained VU319 plasma level above the safe daily exposure determined from animal
      toxicokinetic studies is achieved.

      Clinical safety endpoints include adverse event and symptoms data, vital signs (HR, BP,
      Respiratory Rate, body weight), 12-lead ECG changes, and laboratory safety assessments
      (hematology, plasma biochemistry, coagulation, urinalysis).

Feeling active, vital, alert, and wide awake.
Functioning at a high level but not at peak performance. Able to concentrate.
Relaxed and awake, but not fully alert. Still responsive.
Feeling a little foggy and let down.
Foggy and beginning to lose track of things. Difficult to stay awake.

    <description>Starting at day -1, each subject will receive a wearable motion-based actigraphy device for assessing sleep (sleep duration and patterns of deep and light sleep stages) and biometrics. The device incorporates clinical-grade photoplethysmography (PPG) technology to capture physiological biometric data, including heart rate (HR), heart rate variability (HRV), respiratory rate(RR), and blood oxygen saturation (SPO2).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Behavioral Measure-Suicide Behavior Questionnaire (SBQ-R)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 8 (23.5 hour post last drug administration), Day 12(144 hours post last drug administration)</time_frame>
    <description>It consists of four questions. Each of the four questions addresses a specific risk factor: the first concerns presence of suicidal thoughts and attempts, the second concerns frequency of suicidal thoughts, the third concerns the threat level of suicidal attempts, and the fourth concerns likelihood of future suicidal attempts. The first item has often been used on its own in order to assign individuals to a suicidal and a non-suicidal control group for studies. A total score of 7 and higher in the general population and a total score of 8 and higher in patients with psychiatric disorders indicates significant risk of suicidal behavior.</description>
