  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the effects of messages communicating the risks (i.e.,
      health harms, addictiveness) of indoor tanning delivered via mobile text messaging among
      young adult women ages 18 to 30 years who meet screening criteria for indoor tanning
      addiction.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a two arm randomized controlled trial to test the effects of messages communicating
      the risks of indoor tanning delivered via mobile text messaging as a strategy for promoting
      cessation among young adult women who meet screening criteria for indoor tanning addiction.
      Eligible participants are young adult women ages 18 to 30 years who meet screening criteria
      for indoor tanning addiction and have access to the internet and a personal mobile phone to
      complete study procedures. Participants will complete baseline measures and then be
      randomized to the study arms. The text messaging intervention exposure in the intervention
      arm will last for four weeks. The control arm will be given basic indoor tanning education
      information and will not receive any intervention. Follow up assessments capturing study
      outcomes will be administered at 1 month (i.e., immediately post-intervention) and three
      months post-intervention.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Motivation to Quit Indoor Tanning</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month follow up</time_frame>
    <description>Motivation to quit is measured by participant report by a single question with a 1 to 7 response scale. Higher scores indicate greater motivation to quit and are considered better outcomes. This question is administered at 1 month follow up and at 3 month follow up.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Indoor Tanning Cessation</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month follow up</time_frame>
    <description>Indoor tanning cessation is measured by participant report by a single question asking if participants have stopped indoor tanning completely. Responses indicating cessation are considered better outcomes. This item is administered at 1-month follow-up and at 3 month follow up.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Attempts to Quit Indoor Tanning</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month follow up and 3 month follow up</time_frame>
    <description>Attempts to quit indoor tanning are measured by participant report by a single question asking if participants have attempted to quit indoor tanning since the last assessment. Responses indicating any attempt(s) to quit are considered a better outcome. This item is administered at 1 month follow up and at 3 month follow up.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Risk Appraisals</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month follow up and 3 month follow up</time_frame>
    <description>Perceived risk of harm are measured by asking participants how likely harms are to occur (1 = no chance, 7 = certain to happen). Worry about harms are measured by asking participants how worried they are about harms of indoor tanning (1 = not at all, 7 = very much). Greater risk appraisals are considered a better outcome. The items are administered at 1 month follow up and at 3 month follow up.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Efficacy Beliefs</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month follow up and 3 month follow up</time_frame>
    <description>Beliefs about the health benefits of quitting indoor tanning, efficacy beliefs, are measured using 6 questions asking about health benefits occurring from quitting indoor tanning (1 = No Chance, 7 = Certain to Happen). Greater efficacy beliefs are considered a better outcome. These items are administered at 1 month follow up and at 3 month follow up.</description>

    <description>Participants in the intervention arm will receive text messages to their mobile phones designed to communicate the risks of indoor tanning and motivate cessation. The intervention exposure lasts for 4 weeks with messages sent 2 days each week. It is an interactive intervention that engages participants by asking them to respond to prompts, and sending indoor tanning message content in return on message days.</description>
