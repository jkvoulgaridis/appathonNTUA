    <textblock>
      Bladder cancer is the seventh cause of cancer mortality in France. Overall survival is poor,
      between 45 and 50% at 5 years.

      Optimal staging of lymph nodes and metastasis is crucial for treatment decision of muscle
      invasive bladder cancer (MIBC).

      Guidelines do not recommend FDG-Positron Emission Tomography (PET) Computed Tomography (CT),
      but rather CT for lymph node and metastatic staging, despite its low accuracy. We performed a
      retrospective analysis of patients undergoing PET CT for localized MIBC in two centers, to
      help define the utility of PET CT in this setting.

      Background:

      Bladder cancer is the second most frequent genito-urinary cancer, and the seventh cause of
      cancer mortality in France. Overall survival is poor, between 45 and 50% at 5 years. Curative
      treatment of muscle invasive urothelial carcinoma localized to the bladder includes
      cisplatin-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy, followed by radical cystectomy with lymph nodes
      dissection. Nonetheless, surgery indications depend on pre-operative staging regarding nodes
      and metastatic involvement.

      Computed Tomography (CT) scan is the reference imaging study for loco-regional and metastatic
      staging. Lymph node involvement evaluation is based on morphologic criteria only. Its
      sensitivity lies between 30 and 53% and its specificity between 67 and 91%. Yet, optimal node
      staging is crucial for therapeutic decision.

      FDG-Positron Emission Tomography (PET) CT, using both morphologic and functional criteria,
      could help for node staging in muscle invasive bladder cancer assessment, especially by
      detecting infracentimetric involved lymph nodes. Moreover, it could be useful for detecting
      distant metastasis.

      Objective:

      To evaluate the accuracy of the PET CT for lymph node staging and to determine the rate of
      treatment modification according to PET CT results

      Methods:

      Retrospective study based on the medical records of every patient undergoing a PET CT at the
      time of diagnosis of MIBC from 01/2005 to 12/2017 in Bordeaux (Bergonie Institute and
      University Hospital). PET CT could have been done before any treatment (PET 1) and/or after
      neo-adjuvant chemotherapy and before surgery (PET 2).
