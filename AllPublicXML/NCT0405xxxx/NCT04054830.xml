    <textblock>
      PURPOSE:

      Glaucoma is the leading cause of non-curable blindness globally. Patients with glaucoma will
      get a gradual narrowing of the visual fields caused by compression at the optic nerve head
      due to increased intraocular pressure. Thus the main preventive strategy is to reduce
      intraocular pressure, initially by eye drops and/or laser treatment but in some patients
      surgery is warranted. The surgical procedure (trabeculectomy) most widely performed worldwide
      creates a path from the anterior chamber to the subconjunctival space and thereby lowers the
      IOP by producing a more efficient drainage of the aqueous humour. Surgical success depends
      upon controlling post-operative inflammation to ensure a functional drainage. The purpose of
      this blinded, randomized study is to investigate which anti-inflammatory treatment provides
      better long-term control of intra-ocular pressure (IOP) following glaucoma surgery
      (trabeculectomy) by comparing topical NSAIDs to topical steroids. Additionally, we want to
      explore the mechanisms behind the pathophysiology of glaucoma by evaluating retinal and optic
      nerve head perfusion before and after IOP lowering surgery. The primary outcome is the
      intraocular pressure 12 months after surgery measured by applanation tonometry.

      MAIN HYPOTHESIS:

        -  NSAIDs and steroids are equally effective in assuring long-term filtering function and
           controlling IOP after trabeculectomy but may be associated with different risk profiles
           and bleb morphology

        -  Patients with lower post-operative IOP demonstrate less progression of visual field loss

        -  Trabeculectomy lowers IOP and provides better microcirculation in and oxygenation of
           inner retinal layers (i.e. ganglion cell layer) and the optic nerve head
