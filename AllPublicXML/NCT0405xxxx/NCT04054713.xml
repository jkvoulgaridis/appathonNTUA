  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Barrett's esophagus is a complication of chronic gastroesophageal reflux disease that occurs
      in up to 10% to 15% of patients with this pathology. Well-defined risk factors have been
      established and are important because they are considered a precancerous lesion (intestinal
      metaplasia). The conventional diagnostic methods are ineffective in reliably detecting
      potentially treatable lesions. Investigators propose the use of vital chromoendoscopy with
      acetic acid using the simplified classification of Portsmouth looking for areas with loss of
      acetowhitening and taking targeted biopsies to increase the detection of esophageal
      neoplastic lesions.

      Barrett's esophagus is a complication of chronic gastroesophageal reflux disease that occurs
      in up to 10 to 15% of patients with this disease, well-defined risk factors have been
      established and are important because they are considered a precancerous condition
      (metaplasia intestinal). Chromoendoscopy is postulated as an effective way for the detection
      of esophageal precancerous lesions, early detection and timely treatment with chromoendoscopy
      with acetic acid being a seemingly reliable alternative, so the investigators will use with
      the simplified classification of Portsmouth looking for areas with loss of acetowhitening and
      targeted biopsy to increase the detection of esophageal neoplastic lesions, our main
      objective being to compare the diagnostic effectiveness of directed biopsies of dysplastic
      lesions with acetic acid in patients with Barrett's esophagus compared to taking non-directed
      protocolized biopsies.

      A clinical trial will be carried out, including all those patients older than 18 years who go
      to perform a superior endoscopy with diagnosis of Barrett's esophagus where patients will be
      up and B Seattle protocol group(four quadrant biopsy every 2 centimeters starting 1
      centimeter from above the esophagogastric junction), then proton pump inhibitor washout and
      crossover allocation with the opposite corresponding manoeuver. Histopathological results of
      both groups will be compared.

      Demographic data of the participants will be collected and the evaluated areas of Barrett's
      esophagus with each method will be recorded in a data collection sheet detailing in a
      specific way the number of biopsies taken, specifying if there was loss of acetowhitening and
      alterations in the mucous pattern and in the case of the opposite arm, the total number of
      biopsies taken based on the Seattle protocol, said data will be condensed into a database for
      subsequent statistical analysis and publication of results.
