    <textblock>
      This study is to assess the biodistribution and kinetics of a novel T-cell imaging agent in
      non-small cell lung cancer patients undergoing immunotherapy with and without adjuvant
      radiation therapy. This study is assessing the change in kinetics that occurs in this patient
      population to better understand the distribution of this compound in patient disease
      circumstances.

      The overall goal of this project is to evaluate the ability of [18F]-AraG, a novel T-cell
      activation imaging biomarker, to measure T-cell activation before and after treatment with
      programmed death (PD) PD-1/PD-L1 inhibition and with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibition plus radiation
      therapy in NSCLC patients. Early preclinical and clinical studies have shown promise for
      immunotherapy treatments for several malignancies [1]. Immunotherapy is expected to grow in
      importance; however, it presents difficult challenges for response assessment. For instance,
      successfully treated tumors may actually increase in size after therapy due to inflammation
      and only later shrink [2]. RECIST criteria [3] designed to detect early effects of cytotoxic
      agents by size reduction, or the more recently proposed immune-related response criteria
      (irRC) [4] do not allow an early assessment of immunotherapeutic response since both depend
      on tumor size change. Furthermore, FDG PET is confounded by inflammatory effects causing
      hypermetabolism [5] [6]. Thus, it is imperative to develop new imaging and analysis protocols
      to evaluate immune-checkpoint blockade approaches. A method that evaluates T cell activation
      would permit an assessment of a basic first step in the process of assessing immunotherapy
      efficacy.

      There are two main goals associated with this project. We propose to 1) assess the [18F]-AraG
      biodistribution and kinetics, in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tumor(s) and tumor
      draining lymph nodes on [18F]-AraG PET/CT imaging before and after 1 course of immunotherapy
      and 1 course of immunotherapy plus radiation 2) correlate (potential) change in [18F]-AraG
      uptake within the tumor(s) or tumor draining lymph nodes with clinical and pathologic
      response in patients treated with immunotherapy.
