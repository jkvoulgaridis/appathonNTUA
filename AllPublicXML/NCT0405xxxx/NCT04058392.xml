  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Persons living with HIV and receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) remain with inflammation
      leading to higher risks of cardiovascular diseases, fatty liver and cancer. It has been
      observed in colitis and in HIV infection that abnormal composition of the gut microbes and
      leaky gut induce inflammation contributing to diabetes, fatty liver and cardiovascular risks.
      Abundance of Akkermansia muciniphila in stool, a type of good bacteria acting as a shield on
      the gut barrier has been shown to prevent obesity, diabetes and to improve cancer treatment
      response. Health food (prebiotic) increases the frequency of A. muciniphila in overweight
      individuals.

      Dr Marette, a study collaborator from Laval University, has recently published (Gut, 2018)
      that an extract from a Brazilian fruit called Camu Camu (CC) protects mice from obesity,
      reduce LPS, a marker for passage of microbes from the gut into the blood and decreases
      inflammation in association with the frequency of A. muciniphila in stools. The extract of CC
      is sold in nutritional stores to regulate body fat.

      The investigators will invite 22 participants to take 2 capsules of CC daily for 12 weeks in
      addition to their ART. CC tolerance and changes in blood and stools for inflammation and
      microbe composition will be evalutated at the end of the 12-week treatment and 8 weeks
      post-intake. An optional sub study will assess the changes of gut barrier by doing biopsies
      by colonoscopy.

      CC is expected to beassociated with an enrichment of A. muciniphila in stools, combined with
      reduced gut damage and inflammation.
