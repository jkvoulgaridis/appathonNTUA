  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed to investigate the safety and tolerability of KBL697 in healthy
      volunteers. KBL697 has been developed as a potential new treatment for atopic dermatitis
      (AD).

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects able to read and understand, and willing to sign the informed consent form
             (ICF)

          2. Male or female, aged 18 to 60 years (inclusive) at the time of Screening

          3. Body mass index (BMI) of 18 kg/m2 to â‰¤ 30 kg/m2 (both inclusive)

          4. Willing and able to comply with clinic visits (including confinement to clinical trial
             unit) and study-related procedures

          5. No history of allergic asthma

          6. Baseline laboratory test values within reference ranges based on the blood and urine
             samples taken at screening and on Day -1. Out of normal ranges values may be accepted
             by the Investigator, if not clinically significant.

          7. Male subjects must abstain from heterosexual activities or agree to use a condom from
             screening through 90 days after the final dose of study drug. Women of child-bearing
             potential (WOCBP) must also abstain from heterosexual activities or agree to use
             effective contraception from screening through 90 days after the final dose of study
             drug.

          8. Ability to remain in the study centre for up to a 3-day period for Part A of the study
             and up to a 15-day period for Part B of the study.

          9. The subject is, in the opinion of the Investigator, generally healthy based on
             assessment of medical history, physical examination, vital signs, electrocardiogram
             (ECG), and the results of the haematology, clinical chemistry, urinalysis, serology,
             and other relevant laboratory tests.

         10. Subject willing to allow storage of samples for genetic make-up in future studies.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Female subjects who are pregnant or lactating

          2. The subject has either a history or presence of any clinically significant
             immunological disorder/disease (such as allergy, autoimmune diseases, etc.),
             cardiovascular, thromboembolic events, respiratory, metabolic, renal, hepatic,
             gastrointestinal, endocrinological (particularly diabetes or prediabetes),
             haematological, dermatological, venereal, neurological, chronic infectious or
             psychiatric disease or other major disorder.

          3. History of cancer, including any form of skin cancer, which has not been in remission
             for at least 5 years prior to the first dose of study product.

          4. The subject's corrected QT interval (QTcF) (Fridericia's correction) is &gt;450 ms at
             screening and on Day -1. An out-of-range or abnormal ECG may be repeated. In total, 3
             ECGs should be recorded consecutively, and the Investigator must evaluate the
             triplicate ECG. If the subject's QTcF is &gt;450 ms on at least 2 ECGs, the subject must
             be excluded.

          5. The subject has taken prescription (including antibiotics) or non-prescription
             medication, herbal remedies, vitamins or minerals.

          6. The subject has a substance abuse-related disorder or has a history of drug, alcohol
             and/or substance abuse deemed significant by the Investigator.

          7. The subject has taken any investigational products within 30 days prior to the first
             dose of study product or 5 half-lives, whichever is longer.

          8. The subject has a history of significant hypersensitivity or anaphylaxis involving any
             drug, food or other precipitating agent (e.g. bee sting).

          9. The subject has any abnormal laboratory values that, in the opinion of the primary
             Investigator, are deemed clinically significant and would preclude participation in
             the study.

         10. Positive test for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B surface antigen
             (HBsAg), or hepatitis C virus antibody (anti-HCV) at screening.

         11. Positive screen for drugs of abuse or alcohol at screening or on Day -1. If result
             obtained during screening is positive, it can be repeated at Day -1.

         12. The subject is, in the opinion of the Investigator, unlikely to comply with the
             clinical study protocol or is unsuitable for any other reason.
