  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is to determine the presence of gemcitabine in childhood
      diffuse midline gliomas (DMG) (previously classified as diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma
      [DIPG]) after systemic treatment with the drug.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants in this study will be given a one-time, intravenous (IV) dose of gemcitabine
      prior to having standard-of-care surgery. During surgery, biopsies will be obtained for
      clinical and research purposes along with a blood sample. Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) is
      optional and will only be obtained if clinically indicated. This will be determined by the
      investigators and the provider performing the procedure.

      Because patients will be undergoing a biopsy/resection as part of their standard-of-care
      therapy, this is an optimal time to obtain a tumor biopsy for this study. The biopsy will
      serve to see if the study drug is penetrating the tumor. Patients will then enter a follow-up
      period for 30 days post-surgery.

      This trial is in conjunction with a University of Colorado trial started in 2016,
      &quot;Gemcitabine in Children With Newly-Diagnosed Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma&quot;
      (NCT02992015).

    <description>Gemcitabine will be considered to be detectable in a participant's tumor sample if gemcitabine or one of its metabolites (difluorodeoxyuridine [dFdU] or gemcitabine triphosphate [dFdCTP]) is detected at a measurable level in any of the participant's tumor samples. Undetectable gemcitabine will be defined as gemcitabine, dFdU, and dFdCTP levels below the detectable limits for all of an individual participant's samples, in the setting of detectable gemcitabine, dFdU, or dFdCTP in the plasma and/or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for that patient, and the pathologic review showing viable tumor tissue.</description>

    <description>Gemcitabine, dFdU and dFdCTP will be quantified in the available tumor sample(s), in plasma, and in CSF (if available). For this pilot trial, gemcitabine PK results will be analyzed descriptively, and this trial is not designed for statistical analysis.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age greater than or equal to 3 years and less than 18 years at the time of enrollment.

          -  Patients must meet both of the first two conditions, OR the third:

               -  Clinical findings consistent with a presumed new diagnosis of diffuse midline
                  glioma (DMG) in the opinion of the treating neuro-oncologist, AND

               -  Brain MRI findings consistent with a new diagnosis of DMG based on
                  multidisciplinary consensus after review of imaging

               -  OR, recurrent DMG requiring tumor resection or biopsy

          -  Adequate bone marrow, liver, renal and metabolic function (per protocol)
