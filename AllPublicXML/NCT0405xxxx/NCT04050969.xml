  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to determine whether bariatric surgery followed by Atrial
      Fibrillation (AF) catheter ablation is superior to AF catheter ablation alone in the
      management of atrial fibrillation in patients with morbid obesity.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a multicenter, randomized, controlled, 1:1 allocation trial comparing Atrial
      Fibrillation (AF) catheter ablation only (Group A) to those undergoing bariatric surgery six
      months prior to AF catheter ablation (Group B) in patients with paroxysmal or persistent AF
      who also have morbid obesity.

      Participants will be followed for 12 months after their protocol-assigned catheter ablation.
      Scheduled visits Group A will be at baseline, 3, 6, and 12 months post AF ablation. Scheduled
      visits in Group B will be baseline, clinical visit prior AF ablation, and at 3, 6, and 12
      months post AF ablation. At each post ablation visit the following data will be collected:

      AT/AF recurrence determined by ambulatory monitoring, clinic visit, or hospitalization;
      Physical Exam (weight, height, vitals); 12 lead ECG; Medication Regimen; AF Symptom Severity
      Scale (AFSS); Quality of Life (AFEQT); Laboratory Testing; and Adverse Events

    <intervention_model_description>Patients will undergo screening and eligibility to make sure they meet all criteria for the trial. If patients meet all defined criteria, they will undergo informed consent and will be randomized with equal allocation to the catheter ablation only and bariatric surgery plus AF catheter ablation arms. Randomization will be stratified by site and type of AF (paroxysmal or persistent) using permuted blocks to limit effects of clinician variation.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The primary outcome measure will be time to first recurrence of any atrial arrhythmia including AF, atrial flutter, or atrial tachycardia lasting longer than 30 seconds and occurring more than 3 months after AF ablation, without the use of antiarrhythmic medications. An episode of AF or atrial tachycardia will be considered part of the primary outcome analysis if it lasts longer than 30 seconds and is documented by any form of electrocardiographic monitoring, regardless of symptoms. A repeat catheter ablation procedure at any time will constitute a recurrence for the outcome analysis.</description>

    <description>Participants will undergo either a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass or a laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy. The choice of the procedure will be based on numerous factors including current practice, the surgeon's and participant's choice, BMI, and the presence of certain comorbidities and their severity such as GERD, kidney stones, and past surgical history. Participants will undergo standard preoperative evaluation including dietary consultation and psychological evaluation during the eligibility process.
After bariatric surgery, in addition to routine post-surgical management, patients will follow up with cardiologist prior to AF catheter ablation.</description>
