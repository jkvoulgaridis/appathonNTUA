  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of SPN-538 for the prophylaxis of migraine in
      pediatric patients 6 to 11 years old.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is to assess the efficacy and safety of SPN-538 in reducing the monthly migraine
      headache frequency in pediatric patients with migraine.

      SPN-538 (or matching placebo) will be administered in patients diagnosed with migraine with
      or without aura based on the International Headache Society criteria.

      The frequency of the migraine attack will be assessed as the primary outcome measure.
