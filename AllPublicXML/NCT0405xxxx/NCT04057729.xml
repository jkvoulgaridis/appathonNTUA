    <textblock>
      This food-effect study plans to enroll 16 (at least 12 to complete the study) subjects.
      Subjects will be randomly assigned to 1 of 2 dosing sequences (fasted or standard high-fat
      breakfast) at a 1:1 ratio generated from a computer. Each dosing sequence will consist of 2
      cycles, with 1 dose in each cycle of the study and a washout period of at least 7 days
      between each dose. Study drug will be administered to subjects in the morning of each
      administration day of each cycle. PK, ECG, vital signs, physical examinations and laboratory
      tests will be performed as specified in the protocol. Tolerability and safety of the
      treatment will be evaluated by monitoring adverse events.

             more clinical trials within the last year before the first dose of investigational
             drug; If the half-life of other investigational drugs is longer, the time interval
             required will be longer, suggesting 5 half-lives of the investigational drug.

         13. Blood donation including blood components or massive blood loss (≥ 200 mL) within 3

             longer, which is suggested as 5 half-lives of the investigational drug.

         18. Any abnormal result in laboratory tests and other examination, which is judged as
             clinical significance by the investigator.

         19. Have positive result in hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis B core antibody,
             hepatitis C antibody, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody, or Treponema

             resting on supine. If QTc exceeds 450 msec or QRS exceeds 120 msec, 2 additional ECG
             measurements should be repeated, and the subject's eligibility will be determined by
             using the average value of the 3 QTc or QRS measurements.

         22. Unwilling or unable to follow the lifestyle guideline described in the study protocol
             (e.g. dietary restrictions, activity and contraceptive requirements).

         23. Have other acute or chronic medical or psychiatric disease that, in the judgment of
             the investigator, would make the subject unsuitable or increase the risk associated
             with participating in this study, or would interfere with interpretation of the study
             results.

         24. Have consumed chocolate, any caffeine-containing, xanthine-containing foods or
             beverages, and other special diets affecting the absorption, distribution, metabolism,
             and excretion of the drug during the admission period from screening to Day -2.

         25. Inability to keep abstinence from grapefruit or grapefruit-related citrus (e.g.
             pomelo) fruits or juices within 7 days prior to the first dose of study drug and for
             the duration of the study.

         26. Other subjects, judged by investigators, to be unsuitable for participation in the
             study.
