  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pectus excavatum is the most common anterior chest wall deformity that affects up to 1:400 of
      newborns. If an operative correction is indicated, patients are often operated via the
      Ravitsch or Nuss bar procedure. The latter (i.e. the Nuss bar procedure) is the most commonly
      performed procedure. During this procedure one or more metal bars are inserted behind the
      sternum to push the sternum back into its normal position. These bars remain in situ for
      two-to-three years before being removed. Despite the fact that the Nuss bar procedure is
      regarded as an effective procedure, retraction may occur after removal. A recent study has
      investigated this phenomenon, utilizing three-dimensional (3D) optical surface scans acquired
      before and after Nuss bar removal. The authors found statistically significant changes to
      occur in chest wall dimensions directly after, as well as between 2 and 8 weeks after Nuss
      bar explantation, in comparison to the situation just prior to bar removal. They, moreover,
      found the time the bar was in situ to be predictive for retraction. However, the authors also
      stressed that further studies are needed to reinforce their preliminary findings and perform
      long-term assessments. Subsequently, a similar study with long-term assessments will be
      conducted.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients that received 1 or more Nuss bar(s) to treat pectus excavatum and is/are
             scheduled to be removed due to the end of treatment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients in which the Nuss bar(s) or its stabilizers are or have been dislocated.

          -  Patients that received a second operation to treat any complications regarding the
             initial Nuss bar implantation.

          -  Patients with proven connective tissue diseases (e.g. Marfan's syndrome).

          -  Patients with a diagnosis of epilepsy (as the 3D scanner utilizes flashing light to
             acquire the torso topography)

          -  Patients that are not fit to remain in a standing position with their arms above
             shoulder level for a maximum of 60 seconds.
