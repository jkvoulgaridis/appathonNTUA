  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized clinical trial of doxycycline post-exposure prophylaxis (dPEP) to reduce
      bacterial STIs among Kenyan women taking pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). The overarching
      goal is to assess the effectiveness of dPEP on incidence of STIs while also balancing
      acceptability, cost, and impact on tetracycline resistance to inform public health policy.
      Participants will be randomized to receive dPEP and standard of care or the standard of care
      only. Questionnaires, focus group discussions, SMS, and in-depth interviews will be used to
      study acceptability and changes sexual behavior due to dPEP.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is an open-label 1:1 randomized clinical trial of doxycyline PEP to reduce
      bacterial STIs - Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis, and T. pallidum (syphilis) -
      among Kenyan women taking PrEP. Participants will be counseled about the preliminary
      effectiveness data from IPERGAY, and the potential for resistance in STIs or other bacteria.

      The primary study objectives are to 1) evaluate the effectiveness of doxycycline PEP (dPEP)
      to reduce STI infections in HIV-uninfected Kenyan women taking HIV PrEP; 2) assess the
      safety, tolerability, and acceptability of dPEP; 3)assess adherence to dPEP; 4) investigate
      the impact of dPEP on tetracycline resistance in N. gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis; 5)
      measure the cost of dPEP and estimate the cost per case averted, budget impact, and
      affordability

      Subjects will be randomized 1:1 to dPEP versus standard of care; randomization will be done
      in variable-sized blocks and using opaque envelopes opened at randomization. Participants
      assigned to dPEP will be instructed to take doxycycline 200 mg (two 100mg capsules) orally
      within 24 hours and up to 72 hours after each condomless sex act (consistent with IPERGAY) as
      frequently as daily if indicated but not more than once daily.

      At Months 0,3,6 and 9, women randomized to dPEP will receive doxycycline, sufficient for up
      to daily use for 3 months (i.e., 180 capsules). Unused capsules will be counted at each
      quarterly follow-up visit and additional doxycycline will be provided. Participants will also
      be offered single- or multi-dose pill carriers for ease of dosing dPEP following exposures.
      All participants will receive quarterly visits for standard of care prevention services and
      collection of clinical and behavioral data, for a total of 12 months of follow-up.
