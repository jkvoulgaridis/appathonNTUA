      Background:

      Most people with tuberculosis (TB) feel better after starting treatment. But for some people,
      the opposite happens. They may feel better at first, but then suddenly get worse. This is a
      paradoxical reaction. Researchers want to better understand what causes this reaction and
      what happens after someone has it.

      Objective:

      To learn about paradoxical reactions to TB treatment.

      Eligibility:

      Adults 18 and older diagnosed with confirmed or suspected TB and currently on treatment for
      at least 2 weeks, with or without signs/symptoms of a paradoxical inflammatory reaction.

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. They will give blood
      and urine samples.

      Eligible participants will visit the NIH Clinical Center 3 times over 6 to 18 months. Each
      visit will take 7 hours to complete; visits may be scheduled over more than 1 day.
      Participants may have more visits if their TB symptoms change.

      Participants will give blood, urine, and sputum samples. They will have adverse event
      assessments. They will have 2 to 3 positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT)
      scans. PET/CT scans make pictures of the inside of the body. For this, participants will lie
      on a table that slides into a donut-shaped scanner. They will get a small amount of
      radioactive dye through an IV, which is a small plastic tube placed in a vein in the arm
      using a needle.

      Participants may have optional apheresis. For this, blood is taken from a needle in one arm.
      White blood cells are separated from the rest of the blood. The rest of the blood is returned
      through a needle in the other arm.

    <textblock>
      Paradoxical reaction in non-HIV tuberculosis (TB) is a clinical and/or radiologic worsening
      of a patient s pre-existing TB while receiving anti-TB medications. This phenomenon has been
      clinically well described for many years and is thought to occur in 10%-25% of HIV-negative
      patients starting treatment for TB. Paradoxical reactions are diagnosed by excluding other
      possible causes for worsening of TB signs and symptoms, such as a second infection or
      treatment failure. However, challenges in culturing TB can complicate early diagnosis of
      paradoxical reactions.

      This is an observational study intended to improve understanding of the pathogenesis of
      paradoxical response to treatment in TB-infected patients who do not have HIV. We plan to
      follow up to 20 patients with TB who have already initiated treatment and are suspected to
      have paradoxical reactions, as well as about 40 patients taking TB treatment without signs of
      paradoxical reactions (controls). All participants will have regular study visits for
      clinical assessments, blood and sputum collections, positron emission tomography-computed
      tomography (PET/CT) scans, and optional leukapheresis. Radiography and laboratory evaluations
      will be performed to identify biomarkers, clinical signs, and molecular explanations for
      paradoxical reactions. Better understanding of characteristics of paradoxical reactions will
      assist in earlier diagnosis or even prediction.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Suspected Paradoxical Reaction Group Criteria:

          1. Aged greater than or equal to 18 years.

          2. Diagnosed with confirmed (microbiologically or with molecular methods) or suspected
             (clinical plus or minus histologic diagnosis) TB and currently on ATT for a minimum of
             2 weeks with at least 2 of the following signs/symptoms of a paradoxical inflammatory
             reaction:

               -  Recrudescent symptoms of TB after initial clinical improvement.

               -  Change in physical exam after initial clinical improvement suggestive of new
                  inflammatory process (e.g., lymphadenopathy or new findings on pulmonary exam).

               -  Worsening radiographic evidence of disease after initiation of treatment, as
                  compared with imaging prior to or earlier in treatment.

               -  Laboratory evidence of acute inflammatory response, including the development of
                  leukocytosis (white blood cell count &gt; 10,000 cells/microL) or a change of
                  C-reactive protein (CRP) &gt; 5 mg/L compared to prior laboratory values.

               -  Worsened organ function after initial clinical improvement.

          3. The above sign/symptom(s) cannot be explained by a newly acquired infection, clinical

        Individuals in either group who meet any of the following criteria will be excluded from
        study participation:

          1. HIV infection. (Individuals with HIV infection may be eligible for a separate study
             exclusively evaluating persons living with HIV.)

          2. Pregnant or breastfeeding.

          3. Uncontrolled psychiatric disease, substance use, or inappropriate conduct unsuitable
             for a research study.

          4. Malignancy requiring imminent or ongoing treatment including radiation, chemotherapy,
             or immunotherapy.

          5. Debilitating or chronic conditions that would limit ability to participate in the
             study.

          6. Emergent or urgent clinical conditions not due to studied disease of interest
             requiring immediate treatment that would be unsuitable for a research study. These
