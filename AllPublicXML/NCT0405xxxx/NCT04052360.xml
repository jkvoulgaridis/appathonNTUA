    <textblock>
      This study is for research purposes only and is not intended to treat any medical condition.
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) and
      pharmacodynamics (PD) of cenerimod following a single dose in healthy Japanese and Caucasian
      participants. Pharmacokinetics is the study of the absorption and breakdown of the study drug
      in the body. Pharmacodynamics is the study of the effect of the study drug on the body. There
      will be 2 groups in the study. 10 Japanese participants in one group and 10 Caucasian
      participants in the other group.

      The duration of participation in this study is approximately 75 days from screening to the
      end of study visit. A screening visit is required within 21 days prior to the start of the
      study to determine whether the volunteer qualifies and is willing to participate in this
      research study. This study requires in-patient stay in the research clinic of 4 days (3
      nights) followed by outpatient visits and an end of study visit 3 to 5 days after the day 49
      outpatient visit.
