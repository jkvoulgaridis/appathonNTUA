    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to describe hormonal responses and changes of the gastrointestinal
      (GI) tract during healthy and catabolic inflammatory conditions.

      Participants will receive isocaloric, isonitrogenous beverages of either whey or 3-OHB+whey
      in a randomized crossover design during either healthy (overnight fast) or catabolic
      conditions (inflammation/endotoxemia + 36 h fast and bed rest).

      Background: Endotoxemia (LPS) is known to cause fever, inflammation and nausea, but the
      underlying mechanisms are unknown. In a human disease model comprising LPS-induced
      inflammation, 36 hour fast and bed rest the investigators want to investigate mechanisms
      accounting for the nausea and decreased food intake often observed in hospitalized patients.

      Aim: This study aims to investigate total transit time and motility of the GI-tract together
      with the regulation of gut- and appetite hormones following catabolic conditions compared
      with healthy controlled conditions

      Hypothesis:

      Catabolic stress (endotoxemia/inflammation + 36 h fast and bed rest) induces GI-tract and
      hormonal changes compared with healthy conditions (overnight fast)

      Interventions:

      In a randomized crossover design, eight healthy, lean, young men will undergo either:

      i) Healthy conditions (overnight fast) + whey protein

      ii) Catabolic conditions (Inflammation (LPS) + 36-hour fast and bed rest*) + whey protein

      iii) Catabolic conditions (Inflammation (LPS) + 36-hour fast and bed rest*) + 3-ketone/whey
      protein

      Beverages will be isonitrogenous with 45 g whey protein + 20 g maltodextrin +/- 50 g of
      3-OHB. Bolus/sip administration will be applied (1/3 bolus, 2/3 sip).Beverages will be
      isocaloric (fat will be added to interventions without 3-OHB)

      *LPS will be administered (1 ng/kg) the day prior to the study together with fast and bed
      rest. On the study day LPS (0.5 ng/kg) will be injected.
