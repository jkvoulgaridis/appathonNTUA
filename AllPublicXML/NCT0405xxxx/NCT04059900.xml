  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study researchers want to learn more about the effectiveness of Iberogast® in
      patients with irritable stomach and concomitant chronic or recurrent heartburn and backward
      flow of stomach liquid into the esophagus. 60 patients in the age range from 18 - 80 year
      will be treated over 4 weeks with Iberogast® or placebo - an inactive substance which looks
      identical to Iberogast®. Patients completed diaries will provide researchers with detailed
      information on the change of stomach and intestinal symptoms during the treatment period. In
      addition information on the acidity of the esophagus and stomach liquid will be collected.

    <measure>Change of the Gastrointestinal Symptoms Profile (GIS) from baseline (visit 3) at the end of study (day 28)</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline and day 28</time_frame>
    <description>The GIS is a symptom related score, validated in German language, which allows the investigator to assess the dyspeptic symptoms by asking the patient for the following 10 items (GIS): epigastric pain / upper abdominal pain, abdominal cramps, fullness, early satiety, loss of appetite, sickness, nausea, vomiting, retrosternal discomfort and acid eructation/heartburn. The total GIS score is 40 points and an increasing summary score therefore represents a higher intensity of dyspeptic symptoms.</description>

    <description>The FDDQL provided a profile with eight subscores (daily activities, anxiety, diet, sleep, discomfort, health perceptions, coping with disease and impact of stress) as well as a global score.

    <description>The Bravo™ pH system is a new, single use, disposable class I catheter free pH monitoring system, which involves the attachment of a miniaturised radiotelemetry pH capsule to the mucosal wall of the esophagus.
