    <textblock>
      During a TIPS procedure, a shunt or stent (mesh tube) is passed down the jugular vein (the
      vein above the collarbone in the neck) using fluoroscopy (real time x-rays) guidance. Then, a
      stent is inserted between the portal vein (vein that carries blood from the intestines into
      the liver) to a hepatic vein (vein that carries blood away from the liver back to the heart).
      This means that blood that would usually gets filtered through the liver is now bypassing the
      liver and going directly to the heart. Because more blood will be flowing to the heart, the
      heart needs to be strong enough to handle the extra volume.

      This study is being done to determine the impact of the TIPS procedure on cardiac (heart)
      function by collecting data (heart pressures) during the TIPS procedure. Immediately after
      TIPS and at standard follow-up time points, labs and transthoracic echocardiograms (TTE or
      echo) will also be collected.

      The device(s) used in this study are neither the intervention studied nor the experimental
      variable of interest. Devices are commercially available and used, and procedures are
      performed, in accordance with the institution's standard of care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The long-term goal of this proposal is to improve survival in patients with end stage liver
      disease following TIPS placement. Given that the most common indications for TIPS placement
      are also defining features of decompensated cirrhosis, specifically hemorrhage and refractory
      ascites, the overall health of this patient population is extraordinarily complex. One
      notable circulatory impact of cirrhosis is the increase in total blood volume in concert with
      a disproportionate increase in splanchnic blood volume. Therefore, at the time of TIPS
      placement, a patient may experience a marked increase in central blood volume that may lead
      to cardiac dysfunction. Considering that a central feature of cirrhotic cardiomyopathy is
      attenuated response to stress, it is conceivable that some perioperative cardiovascular
      complications could be attributed to the patient's baseline health rather than an isolated
      effect of the procedure alone. By instituting measures to identify patients that may be at
      increased risk for an adverse outcome, this proposal hopes to offer a new paradigm for
      managing TIPS patients in the acute postoperative setting. Therefore, the purpose of this
      study is to derive better correlates between non-invasive and invasive measurements of
      cardiac function.

    <intervention_model_description>All patients undergoing TIPS will have the following hemodynamic measurements obtained: systolic, diastolic and mean RAP; systolic, diastolic and mean right ventricular pressure (RSV). Peak systolic right ventricular (PSRV) pressure will serve as surrogate for pulmonary artery pressure (PAP). There are 2 groups in this project. Subjects will be enrolled in 1 of the 2 groups based on their heart pressure measurements (high or normal). If a subject does not meet criteria for 1 of the 2 groups, they will not be in the study.</intervention_model_description>

Subjects with abnormal heart pressures during TIPS will have a right heart catheterization (RHC) to monitor heart function, blood flow, and pressures in and around the heart. The subject will be admitted to the Cardiovascular Intensive Care Unit and have a TTE all of which are standard of care. Routine follow-up visits will occur in IR Clinic at 2 Weeks (± 3 days), 4-6 weeks and 4-6 months. Visits will include: blood draws for research related blood tests as listed above; standard of care ultrasound of the abdomen; TTEs; and for at least one year, routine lab testing, imaging, medications, and subject overall condition will be assessed for long term outcomes. Diagnostic RHC will be done as needed per standard of care.</description>
