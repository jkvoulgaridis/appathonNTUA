  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Infertility is estimated to affect 15% of reproductive age couples worldwide and is defined
      as the inability to conceive after 12 months of unprotected sex for women under 35 or 6
      months for women over 35 and is associated with stress, especially due to psychological
      factors such as anxiety, frustration and depression. In addition, women seeking treatment for
      pregnancy suffer additional stressors - significant emotional burdens and physical changes
      that can increase stress and anxiety levels. The possibility of an association between
      emotional stress and pregnancy outcome in women undergoing assisted reproduction treatment
      makes important therapies that address the psychological state of these women. Meditation and
      Reiki have been used to successfully reduce stress and anxiety in various health contexts.

      Reiki is a complementary health approach in which practitioners lightly place their hands on
      or just above a person to facilitate their own healing response. Reiki has been used as an
      adjunctive therapy to treat the symptoms common to infertile women seeking treatment,
      including anxiety, stress, depression, anger, despair and depression. Reviews of randomized
      controlled trials concluded that implementation of the Reiki intervention in health centers
      resulted in mental health benefits, including reduced tension, mental confusion, anxiety and
      pain as well as improved quality of life.

      Meditation can be defined as a form of mental training aimed at improving an individual's
      psychological capacities, such as attentional and emotional self-regulation. Meditation
      encompasses a family of practices that include mindfulness meditation, mantra meditation,
      yoga, tai chi and chi gong. Meditation has been used specifically in women undergoing IVF
      treatment to successfully reduce symptoms related to psychological distress. Studies measure
      the development of self-compassion, mechanisms of emotion regulation, and coping strategies
      related to infertility and quality of life in infertility. However, only one study showed a
      relationship between meditation and pregnancy rate. Unfortunately, the authors incorporated
      yoga and psychological approaches into meditation. Therefore, we designed this study to
      evaluate the impact of Meditation and Reiki on the outcome of assisted reproduction
      treatment.
