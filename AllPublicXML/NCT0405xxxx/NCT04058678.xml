  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project explores the implication of the telomere pathway in ovarian premature and
      regular aging. Telomere length and maintenance underlie several biological processes such
      cancer, aging, human diseases and the biology of stem cells. The reactivation of telomerase
      should lead to a rejuvenation of the ovarian tissue and the improvement of fertility.

      The correlation of telomeric factors in blood and granulosa cells will be studied with the
      aim of finding telomeric biomarkers of ovarian aging.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study, randomized, controled, blind, parallelo arm clinical trial with
      inactive substance and medicine.

      A pilot study will be developed with a total of 45 individuals from 30 to 45 years old, who
      represent the most frequent population of women seeking for ART.

      A control group composed of women with normal ovarian reserve (30 to 45 years old) is needed
      to compare telomeric and fertility parameters with the group of women with compromised
      ovarian reserve. Women in the control group irrespective of their age, will have a greater
      number of follicles compared to women belonging to the group with compromised ovarian
      reserve.

      A group of women with diminished ovarian reserve that will take an inactive substance has
      been incluided to avoid biases and to set the fertility base line for women with compromised
      ovarian reserve. The use of an inactive substance or placebo will help obtain better quality
      results. For instance, if Danazol happened to improve the fertility outcome, then, there
      could be a possibility that the IVF improvement might be due to other components of the pill.
      Using placebo, this possibility would be eliminated, since the placebo will contain all
      components of the pill, except Danazol.

      The development of a pilot study will help us understand the statisticl behavior or the
      telomeric factors as well as to determine the appropriate number of individuals that shoyuld
      be recruited in a clinical trial to have results with statistical significance. In addition,
      a pilot study will help us learn errors or undesired events that may happen during the
      clinical trial. For instance, if patients cannot follow the indications of their doctors and
      why, or what proportion of patients will drop the study and the reasons for it. Furthermore,
      it will also help us understand if there exist a tendency, an indication or even a clear
      beneficial effect for patients without harming them.

      The number of participants selected for the study is considered adequate for each group,
      since each group will be measured in an independent manner.

    <masking_description>During the first visist to the doctor, women will be selected according to the selection criteria. Those who seem to have a low ovarian reserve by ultrasound will be informed of the trial, and if they decide to participate, blood will be taken to analyze AMH values. On the second visit, women with low ovarian reserve will be randomized 1:1 for either inactive substance or Danazo, accordint to a computer-generated randomization list prepared by associated statistic. This way, the assigned group will be blind until the momento of executing the randomization procedure. Moment in which, the assigned group will be revealed.
Those with normal ovarian reserve will not be randomized and will just be included as controls.
To maintain the blinding of the trial, Danazol and placebo will be provided in boxs with blisters (PVC opaque and aluminium sealed).
Only the trial medication delegate(s) at the site will dispense the IMP and will know the treatment allocation.</masking_description>

    <description>A control group composed of women with normal ovarian reserve (30 to 45 yerras old) is needed to compare telomeric and fertility parameters with the group of women with compromised ovarian reserve. Note that the term &quot;normal ovarian reserve&quot; referred to older women indicates women that still have follicles in their ovaries -and thus, normal AMH values-, even though the number may be lower tan at a younger age or the quality of oocytes may be lower tan in younger women. In other words, women in the control group irrespective of their age, will have a greater number of follicles compared to women belonging to the group with compromised ovarian reserve.</description>
