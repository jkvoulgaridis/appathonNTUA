    <description>To assess visual function-related patient reported outcomes (VFQ-25) following treatment with brolucizumab relative to aflibercept. The VFQ-25 includes a series of 25 questions pertaining to vision or feelings about a vision condition. Answers are selected among a numbered list of possible responses, the values of which are ultimately recoded and converted to a 0 to 100 scale. Items within each subscale are averaged together to create 12 subscale scores. An overall composite score will be calculated by averaging vision-targeted subscale scores, excluding the general health rating question.</description>
