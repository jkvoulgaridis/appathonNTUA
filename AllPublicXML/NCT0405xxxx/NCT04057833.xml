  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1b investigator-initiated clinical trial that will evaluate the safety and
      feasibility of E-CEL UVEC® cells with the aim of improving outcomes for patients with
      full-thickness rotator cuff tears who undergo arthroscopic surgical repair. Animal models of
      rotator cuff repair performed by the investigator using murine E-CEL cells in a fibrin
      carrier vehicle demonstrated increased supraspinatus tendon strength and collagen
      organization with no observable deleterious side effects compared to surgical repair with the
      carrier vehicle alone.

      After thawing and washing, allogeneic E-CEL UVEC cells will be resuspended in two different
      solutions; one to deliver the cells under arthroscopic guidance into the supraspinatus tendon
      repair site and the other to deliver cells into the muscle adjacent to the tendon repair
      site. Cells delivered to the tendon repair site will be resuspended in human plasma (derived
      from a peripheral blood sample drawn from the patient), then combined with allogeneic,
      pharmaceutical grade human thrombin to generate a fibrin matrix, simultaneously with
      implantation of the cells into the tendon using a two syringes joined with a luer-lock
      connection under arthroscopic guidance . Cells delivered to the muscle adjacent to the tendon
      repair site will be resuspended in infusion solution [6.0% Dextran 40 and 10.0% human serum
      albumin (HSA)], then directly implanted into the muscle.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Full-thickness rotator cuff tears present a clinical challenge, often with occurrence of
      re-tears after surgical repair and a slow rate of complete functional recovery, which limits
      daily functional tasks and has negative impacts on qualify-of-life. The frequency of failed
      healing and re-tear following repair is more pronounced in patients over age 60 due to
      age-related, intrinsic degenerative changes involving the muscle, tendon, and enthesis.

      Currently there is no approved adjunct biological therapy to standard-of- care arthroscopic
      surgical repair for acceleration of healing, reducing time-to complete functional recovery,
      and decreasing the rate of re-tear.

      Healing of the enthesis, the site of tendon attachment to the bone, can be compromised due to
      microvascular and vascular niche deficiencies resulting from various causes including aging,
      prior injuries, and/or tissue degeneration. Administration of exogenous allogeneic engineered
      CD31+ endothelial cells (E-CEL UVEC® cells) at the surgical repair site of simulated
      supraspinatus tendon tear in animal models has been shown to positively affect the tissue
      vascular niche, where tissue regeneration and repair occur, resulting in accelerated healing
      and a significant improvement in tendon attachment strength at the enthesis repair site.

      E-CEL UVEC cells are derived proprietary allogeneic human umbilical vein endothelial cells
      produced under cGMP and cGTP regulations. The cells are genetically modified by a
      transduction of Ad5 E4ORF1 gene. The gene has endothelial pro-survival properties. It is
      found naturally in adenoviruses that have near ubiquitous human exposure.

      The non-clinical and CMC information of E-CEL UVEC cells has been reviewed and accepted by
      the US FDA as part of IND #018355, titled &quot;AB-205-001&quot;. Specifically, E-CEL UVEC cells
      comprise the cellular component of AB-205, an experimental engineered cell therapy, that will
      be administered intravenously to subjects with relapsed lymphoma after treatment with high
      dose therapy and autologous stem cell transplant in a clinical trial sponsored by Angiocrine
      Bioscience, Inc. Pre-clinical information of E-CEL UVEC cells will be provided via
      cross-reference to Angiocrine's IND in support of this Investigator Initiated Trial.

      There is currently no approved adjunct biologic therapy to improve surgical repairs of full
      rotator cuff tear, enhance post-operative recovery, and decrease the risk of re-tear.
      Therefore, it is reasonable to study, via an Investigator Initiated Trial, the safety and
      feasibility of local implantation of E-CEL UVEC cells along with standard-of-care
      arthroscopic surgical repair of full rotator cuff tears. The E-CEL UVEC cell dose will be
      much lower than what is needed for systemic application.
