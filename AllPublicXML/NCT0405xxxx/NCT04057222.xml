  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple sclerosis causes demyelinating lesions, which can induce multiple symptoms.
      Ano-rectal avec urinary disorders are frequent due to specific lesions in inhibitor/activator
      encephalic centers, or interruption on medullary conduction. It seems to be evident that
      anorectal and urinary disorders are link, because of similar anatomic ways and control
      process.

      To our knowledge several studies test the effect of rectal distension and bladder sensory
      function but only one study examined the effect of bladder filling on rectal sensitivity on
      healthy people. The effect of bladder filling on rectal sensory function in patient with
      neurological disease stay unknown, while dysfunction often occur concomitant, and therapeutic
      actions in one organ may influence function of the other.

      Anorectal manometry is the gold standard for the evaluation of rectal sensory function and
      the volume of constant sensation to need to defecate is reported in literature as the most
      reproducible measure.

      Primary aim is to assess the effect of need to void on volume of constant sensation to need
      to defecate in multiple sclerosis with anorectal symptoms. Secondary aim is to identify the
      effect of need to void on modulation of rectoanal inhibitory reflex (RAIR) and external anal
      sphincter resting pressure.

      Patient with multiple sclerosis over 18 years old, consulting for anorectal disorders in a
      tertiary center, with an indication to realize an anorectal manometry are included.

      History and treatment, height, weight, Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), anorectal and
      urinary symptoms severity by Bristol, Neurogenic Bowel Dysfunction (NBD), Cleveland, Kess,
      Urinary Symptom Score (USP) scores, and last urodynamic data are recorded. Patient are asked
      to drink water until they feel a strong need to void, for which they would go to urinate at
      home. 3 void volume with portable sonography are done, and the higher is recorded.

      Anorectal manometries are realized by the same doctor, in a specific place, with calm. Before
      the manometric examination, thermal and vibratory sensory thresholds on the right hand are
      collected. The patient is then placed in a left lateral position. Then the anorectal
      manometry's catheter is inserted and collect of the external anal sphincter resting pressure
      begins. Then the investigator proceed to search for RAIR by 5 brief distensions of the
      intrarectal balloon with increasing volumes of 10 mL from 10 mL to 50 mL. Finally, the
      investigator collect the threshold volumes of perception, need and maximum tolerable by
      gradually distending the intra-rectal balloon to 5 mL/s from 0 mL to 300 mL. Toilets are just
      next to the table of examination.

      Next, patient can urinate. 3 post void residual volume with portable sonography are done, and
      the higher is recorded.

      The same tests are realized after urinate, in the same order. After the classical complete
      manometry was performed.

      Primary outcome is the volume of constant sensation to need to defecate Secondary outcomes
      are the modulation of RAIR and the external anal sphincter resting pressure. Manometric data
      are collected.

      Influence of age, EDSS, severity of symptoms, manometric data and detrusor overactivity on
      rectal sensory function will be study in secondary analysis.

A first record of rectal sensory function will be at strong desire to void. A second record will be after void. Rectal sensory function records consist on an anorectal manometry with 3 measures of external anal sphincter resting pressure, 5 measures of RAIR, 1 measure of perception, constant sensation to need to defecate and maximum tolerable threshold volumes.</description>
