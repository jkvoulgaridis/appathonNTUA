  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Over the past two decades, the misuse of prescription opioids has significantly increased. A
      recent systematic review reported as much as 67% to 92% of opioids dispensed on discharge
      post-surgery go unused. This culture of overprescribing is consistently observed across
      surgical specialties. Less frequently observed is the potential for opioid use and misuse in
      children and adolescents post-surgery. The research to date in this area has been poorly
      performed with heterogenous data collection, analysis and reporting, as well as large loss of
      patients to follow-up.

      The investigators' previous prospective observational deception study identified three areas
      of concern:

        1. There is a culture of postoperative opioid over-prescribing at discharge as demonstrated
           by heterogenous opioid dosing and duration of treatments across practitioners for single
           procedures

        2. This overprescribing is in excess of patients' home-requirements and results in
           significant quantities of leftover opioids

        3. There is a culture of inappropriate storage and lack of safe disposal of prescribed
           opioids in the community

      This study focuses on addressing and minimizing pediatric surgical over-prescribing. It aims
      to reduce the amount of opioids prescribed by focusing prescribers and families on regular
      use of simple non-opioid analgesics, as well as decreasing the amount of opioids prescribed
      and dispensed.
