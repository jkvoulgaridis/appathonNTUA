  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate whether apremilast is better than placebo (inactive substance in the
      same form as the drug) for the treatment in Japanese subjects with PPP. This study also will
      evaluate the safety and tolerability of apremilast in Japanese subjects with
      PPP.CC-10004-PPP-001 is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel
      group, Phase 2 study of apremilast in Japanese subjects with PPP and inadequate response to
      treatment with topical steroid and/or topical vitamin D3 derivative preparations.

      The placebo-controlled period will be 16 weeks and patients will receive apremilast or
      placebo. After the 16-week placebo-controlled period, all subjects will receive apremilast
      for 16 weeks. All subjects will have their final study visit 4 weeks after stopping
      apremilast treatment.
