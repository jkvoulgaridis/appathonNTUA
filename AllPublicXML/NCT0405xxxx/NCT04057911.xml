  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cervical dystonia (CD) is a common movement disorder. Despite the optimization of botulinum
      toxin injection (BoNT-A) parameters including muscle selection and dosing, a significant
      proportion of patients report low levels of satisfaction, and a few of them develop
      resistance to therapy. The only options for such patients would be invasive therapy such as
      pallidotomy or pallidal deep brain stimulation. Currently, studies are going on the
      effectiveness of noninvasive neurostimulation in different neurological disorders.
      Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) or transcranial pulsed current stimulation
      (tPCS) are known to be safe non-invasive intervention with almost no side effects that can be
      used to provide complementary treatment. To detect the dysfunctional regions five min resting
      state quantitative EEG (qEEG) eyes closed will be recorded and analyzed each time before and
      after noninvasive stimulation. The investigators will evaluate the efficacy of acute
      noninvasive stimulation in those CD patients who are already on 3 monthly BoNT-A therapy but
      the effect of BoNT-A is wearing off in 8 weeks. Kinematics (static and dynamic movements) of
      neck movements will be recorded using established technology before and after stimulation.

      Cervical dystonia (CD) is the most common adult onset dystonia. Abnormal sensorimotor
      integration and maladaptive plasticity have been proposed as possible mechanisms. Currently,
      there is no definite way to assess and modify this dysfunctional network. Deep brain
      stimulation (DBS) is one possible way, but it is invasive and being used in highly selected
      patients. Intramuscular injections of botulinum toxin injection (BoNT-A) are successful.
      However, 30% patients discontinue due to lack of efficacy, side effects like muscle atrophy
      and dysphagia and the effect may wear off by week 8. Importantly, injections don't change the
      abnormal networks, as patients need life-long treatment.

      Noninvasive brain stimulation (NIBS) is an evolving therapeutic option. Repetitive
      transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has already been used in network modulation in CD.
      Although effective, cost, lack of portability and side effects remain issues of rTMS.
      Portable, better tolerated and cheaper options using transcranial direct current stimulation
      (tDCS) in Parkinson's disease, dystonia, tremor, ataxia and transcranial pulsed current
      stimulation (tPCS) in Parkinson's disease are exciting new options. However, with these
      methods of NIS, many challenges remain - dysfunctional network localization, selecting
      parameters to use, providing adequate stimulation to alter the network consistently, maintain
      the therapeutic benefit chronically and have consistent adoption by the patient and clinician
      community. These variables make this exciting approach high risk, yet high yield if
      successful.

      In this study, the investigators will use a new quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG)
      technique to first localize global network dysfunction in CD. Kinematic analysis of the
      biomechanics of CD will be recorded. The efficacy of acute NIBS will be evaluated in those CD
      patients who are already on 3 monthly BoNT-A therapy but the effect of BoNT-A is wearing off
      in 8 weeks.The effect will be measured using qEEG and kinematics pre and post stimulation.

      Noninvasive stimulation will be delivered through a pair of saline-soaked (0.9% NaCl) surface
      sponge electrodes. Stimulation will be given for 20 mins, single session. For the sham
      condition, the electrode placement will be same, but the electric current will be ramped down
      in 5 seconds after the beginning of the stimulation.

      Neurophysiological EEG signals will be recorded, eyes-closed, no-task, using g.Nautilus g.tec
      wireless system. The g.tech system uses earclip reference sensors. The subject will be in a
      quiet place with less light or electromagnetic perturbations. During the resting state
      recordings, patients are seated in a comfortable arm chair and will be instructed to keep
      relaxed, with their eyes closed for 5 mins.

      A paired t test will be used to compare baseline data and post tPCS data. Descriptive
      analysis of the neurological examination findings will be provided.

    <description>Toronto Western Spasmodic Torticollis Rating Scale (TWSTRS) will be assessed before and after stimulation. This scale is used to assess the severity of cervical dystonia and the success of its treatment. A total score of 0 to 35 can be achieved; this is made up of various sub scores- maximal excursion, duration of neck deviation, effect of sensory tricks, shoulder elevation/anterior displacement, range of motion, time to maintain in neutral position.</description>
