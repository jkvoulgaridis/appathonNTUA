      The aim of this study is to determine histological immunological parameters, sought on
      splenectomy pieces that may explain the failure or success of splenectomy in patients with
      ITP who had a splenectomy to treat their ITP(Immune thrombocytopenic purpura).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is a rare autoimmune thrombocytopenia whose incidence
      is 2 to 5 cases / 100,000 inhabitants / year. The potentially serious haemorrhagic risk is
      the major issue of management. A recent international consensus conference classifies PTI
      according to the duration of thrombocytopenia: acute ITP (&lt;3 months), persistent ITP (3-12
      months) and chronic ITP (&gt; 12 months) (Rodeghiero 2009). In the acute or persistent phase,
      polyvalent immunoglobulins (IVIG) and / or corticosteroids are proposed. In the chronic
      phase, splenectomy is a possible cure for 70% of patients. No predictor of treatment response
      is known.

      The pathophysiology of ITP is multifactorial: platelet phagocytosis, mediated by
      autoantibody, macrophages of the reticuloendothelial system, and destruction in the spleen,
      genetic background and / or environmental factor favoring the role of certain lymphocyte
      subpopulations, cytotoxic or regulatory T, via their cytokine environment, abnormalities of
      thrombopoiesis.

      At present, no predictive factor of splenectomy success has been identified. The aim of this
      study is to determine histological immunological parameters, sought on splenectomy pieces
      that may explain the failure or success of splenectomy in patients with ITP who had a
      splenectomy to treat their ITP.

      This work is done on frozen female rats of already splenectomized adult ITP patients. A
      notice of no objection will be asked to patients for permission to work on this frozen
      material. Similarly, 10 control rats, from patients who had had a splenectomy at Bordeaux
      University Hospital following a road accident, will be analyzed and compared to those of the
      patients. It is a work of immuno-marking on splenic tissue.
