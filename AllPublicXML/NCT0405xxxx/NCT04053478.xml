  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypotension is one of the most common adverse effects of spinal anesthesia for cesarean
      deliveries, affecting as many as 55-90% of mothers. Hypotension during cesarean deliveries
      can have detrimental effects on the mother and neonate. Various vasopressors, such as
      ephedrine, phenylephrine and more recently norepinephrine, have been used for the prevention
      and treatment of hypotension at cesarean deliveries.

      Ephedrine was historically considered as the gold standard vasopressor for the management of
      hypotension during cesarean deliveries. This was based on studies in animal models that
      showed preserved uteroplacental circulation with ephedrine and not with phenylephrine.
      However, multiple studies in the past several decades have shown that phenylephrine compared
      with ephedrine results in a more favorable fetal acid-base status. Consequently, the use of
      phenylephrine for blood pressure management during cesarean deliveries increased. Recently,
      norepinephrine was introduced in the obstetrical practice for the management of hypotension
      at cesarean deliveries, due to its ability to maintain maternal cardiac output better than
      phenylephrine. However, much controversy still exists surrounding the choice of vasopressor
      in the obstetric population, in large part due to their varying efficacies, and maternal and
      fetal effects.

      Vasopressors used for the treatment of hypotension during cesarean deliveries can have
      significant direct or indirect effects on the perfusion of uteroplacental and umbilical
      vessels. Reduction of uteroplacental perfusion and constriction of umbilical arteries can
      result in fetal acidosis, however, the mechanisms for these effects are unclear. The
      investigators hypothesize that ephedrine, phenylephrine and norepinephrine have variable
      effects on the contractility of pregnant myometrium and umbilical arteries due to their
      variable actions on adrenergic alpha (α) and beta (β) receptors located in these tissues.

    <textblock>
      One of the major concerns addressed in the literature is the risk of fetal acidosis related
      to the use of vasopressors, which varies according to the type of drug used. Since severe
      fetal acidosis is associated with a two- and four-fold increase in neonatal morbidity and
      mortality, respectively, it is important to understand the mechanism by which these
      medications may contribute to fetal acidosis.

      It is well known that reduced uteroplacental blood flow can result in impaired fetal
      oxygenation and fetal acidosis. This can occur indirectly via compression of vessels due to
      myometrial contractions or directly by vasoactive effects on umbilical arteries. So far, no
      studies have directly explored the role of the aforementioned vasopressors on myometrial
      contractions and umbilical artery vasoconstriction. An in-vitro approach in isolated tissues
      will eliminate many clinical confounding variables, allowing direct comparison of the drugs
      in a controlled environment, and providing insight into the contractile mechanisms
      responsible for their neonatal effects.

      There is currently no consensus as to which vasopressor is best for the management of
      hypotension in obstetric patients and the mitigation of fetal acidosis. A survey of the
      members of the Society of Obstetric Anesthesia and Perinatology suggested significant
      variation in the practice of vasopressor use during cesarean deliveries. The evidence from
      animal studies contradicts the effects seen in human studies. This is possibly related to
      species differences in adrenergic receptor distribution, affinity to vasopressors, or
      placental transfer of vasopressors. It is well known that reduced uteroplacental blood flow
      can result in impaired fetal oxygenation and fetal acidosis. This can occur indirectly via
      compression of vessels due to myometrial contractions or directly by vasoactive effects on
      umbilical arteries. However, none of the studies so far have directly explored the role of
      the aforementioned vasopressors on myometrial contractions and umbilical artery
      vasoconstriction. An in-vitro approach in isolated tissues will eliminate many clinical
      confounding variables, allowing direct comparison of the drugs in a controlled environment,
      and providing insight into the contractile mechanisms responsible for their neonatal effects.
