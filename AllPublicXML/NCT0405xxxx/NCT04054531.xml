    <textblock>
      This is a phase II study of KN046 plus platinum-based doublet chemotherapy in previously
      untreated advanced non-squamous and squamous NSCLC subjects.

      The study will assess primarily the safety and efficacy of KN046 plus platinum-based doublet
      chemotherapy.
