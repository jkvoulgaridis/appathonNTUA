    <textblock>
      The hypothesis of the present study is low intensity extracorporeal low energy shock wave
      therapy (LiESWT) can decrease inflammatory disorders, increase pelvic floor blood supply,
      enhanced bladder stem cell activation, Using LiESWT can decrease bladder overactivity,
      eliminate urinary incontinence and improve stress urinary incontinence (SUI) and overactive
      bladder (OAB) symptoms. Therefore improve quality of life and improve social activity.

      Clinical application of low intensity extracorporeal low energy shock wave therapy (LiESWT)
      (2000 to 3000 impulses in 0.20-0.25 millijoule/mm2 (mJ/mm2)) initiated wound healing,
      promoted angiogenesis, reduced the level of oxidative stress, induced the releasing of VEGF,
      stimulated proliferation and differentiation of stem cells, and resulted in the effect of
      anti-inflammatory and tissue regeneration. Generally, LiESWT was used clinically to improve
      tissue regeneration at tendon-bone junctions, ischemic cardiovascular disorders, skin wound
      healing, chronic injuries of soft tissues and erectile dysfunction.

      LiESWT has also been shown to increase vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression
      in ischemic tissues in vivo and to promote angiogenesis and functional recovery in models of
      chronic myocardial ischemia, myocardial infarction, and peripheral artery disease.
      Importantly, the advantages of LiESWT include therapies without medication or surgery,
      outpatient therapies, short treatment sessions, no anesthesia required, and non-invasive
      therapy.

      The hypothesis of the present study is LiESWT can decrease inflammatory disorders, increase
      pelvic floor blood supply, enhanced bladder stem cell activation, Using LiESWT can decrease
      bladder overactivity, eliminate urinary incontinence and improve stress urinary incontinence
      (SUI) and overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms. Therefore improve quality of life and improve
      social activity.
