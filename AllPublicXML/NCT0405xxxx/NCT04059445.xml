    <description>To assess QoL changes related to mouth and teeth prior to therapy to after therapy by the use of &quot;The Oral Impacts on Daily Performance (OIDP)&quot; instrument. Each question is assessed by a 5-point scale; (1) never affected, (2) less than once a month, (3) once or twice a month, (4) once or twice a week; and (5) every or nearly every day. The higher number represents more severe impact on quality of life; e.g. worse outcome.
Each item will be dichotomised yielding the categories (A) affected; including scale categories (2)-(5), and (B) unaffected, including category (1).</description>
