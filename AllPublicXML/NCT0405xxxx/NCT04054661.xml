    <textblock>
      Cross-sectional diagnostic accuracy study with 250 volunteer participants. The clinic will
      recruit and consent adult study participants (all comers). Clinic staff will draw 2
      ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) tubes, 1 heparin tube, and 1 acid citrate dextrose
      (ACD) tube from venous blood and obtain finger stick capillary blood. Clinic staff will
      perform the investigational SD Biosensor STANDARD™ G6PD Test for glucose-6-phosphate
      dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency and a HemoCue® hemoglobin test on finger stick capillary
      blood. An EDTA anti-coagulated venous blood sample will be sent to a Clinical Laboratory
      Improvement Amendments (CLIA) certified lab for G6PD reference testing by the gold standard
      assay: G6PD measurement by spectrophotometry; this sample will also have a hemoglobin
      measurement by a hematology analyzer. Deidentified blood samples collected in tubes with
      other anti-coagulants will be evaluated for equivalency across anti-coagulant types.
      Individuals identified as G6PD deficient or intermediate by the reference test will be
      notified of their results by the clinic and referred to their physician for follow-up.

      This study includes a nested repeatability study.

    <description>all participants recruited in the study will be screened with an investigational IVD- STANDARD G6PD Test. The investigational test will not be used to determine any treatment or case-management. Participants will be tested on venous and fingerstick blood. Venous blood will be sent to a clinical laboratory for confirmatory testing on a reference assay</description>

    <description>The STANDARD G6PD Analyzer is designed to measure the quantitative determination of total Hb concentration and G6PD enzymatic activity in fresh human whole blood specimens based on reflectometry assays. The test is intended to aid in the identification of people with G6PD deficiency. The test is currently not licensed for use in the US and is considered an investigational product. System components shall be labeled in accordance with regulatory requirements, including the following statement, &quot;For Investigational Use Only. The performance characteristics of this product have not been established.&quot;</description>
