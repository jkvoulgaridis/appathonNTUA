  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed as an open label, single dose combination of HSK3486 and etomidate in
      healthy adult male subjects. The study will evaluate the anesthetic/sedation effect of the
      combination of the 2 drugs and the safety profile including pain on injection, hypotension,
      tachycardia or bradycardia effects (HSK3486), and involuntary muscle movements, nausea and
      vomiting potential and adrenal suppression (etomidate).

      All subjects will be administered HSK3486 plus etomidate. Subjects will be confined to the
      study unit from the evening of Day -1 until the morning of Day 2, then will be required to
      return for a follow up visit on Day 7.

      Intensive PD, PK, safety and tolerability and assessments will be performed prior to dosing
      on Day 1 until 24 hours post-dose (Day 2).

However, these 2 cohorts were not done as the results of Cohorts 1 to 3 suggested that dose increases would cause higher occurrence of drug-related adverse events (AEs).</description>
