  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project will develop and pilot test a new smartphone-based system for AUD patients,
      their partners, and clinicians called PartnerCHESS. PartnerCHESS will integrate key features
      of ABCT and A-CHESS. PartnerCHESS will also include a Clinician Report to automatically alert
      clinicians of patients at risk of relapse and offer other information on how recovery is
      proceeding. The project has three specific aims:

        1. Integrate A-CHESS with key features of ABCT to create PartnerCHESS to serve patients,
           partners, and clinicians.

        2. Conduct a pilot test (a small randomized clinical trial) of PartnerCHESS to estimate
           effect size and refine the protocol, procedures, recruitment strategy, measurements, and
           operations for use in a large RCT.

      3a. Decide whether to pursue an R01 application, and if so, 3b. plan for the R01.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is one of the most common substance use disorders. Yet only a
      small fraction of people who need treatment receive it, and most of them get only short-term
      support even though continuing care has been shown to be much more effective. Partner support
      can be critical to recovery, but many partners do not know how to support their partners'
      recovery or manage their own responses to it. Clinicians also lack evidence of the efforts
      patients are making toward recovery. Treating couples in which one member is recovering from
      AUD has been shown to be efficacious; in particular, Alcohol Behavioral Couples Therapy
      (ABCT) has shown positive outcomes. Still, ABCT has not been widely adopted, in part because
      of practical problems such as the stigma that goes with the partner needing to go to an
      addiction treatment agency to participate. A-CHESS is a smartphone-based system proven to
      substantially reduce relapse rates, but A-CHESS serves only the patient.

      This project will develop and pilot test a new smartphone-based system for AUD patients,
      their partners, and clinicians called PartnerCHESS. PartnerCHESS will integrate key features
      of ABCT and A-CHESS. PartnerCHESS will also include a Clinician Report to automatically alert
      clinicians of patients at risk of relapse and offer other information on how recovery is
      proceeding. The project has three specific aims:

        1. Integrate A-CHESS with key features of ABCT to create PartnerCHESS to serve patients,
           partners, and clinicians.

        2. Conduct a pilot test (a small randomized clinical trial) of PartnerCHESS to estimate
           effect size and refine the protocol, procedures, recruitment strategy, measurements, and
           operations for use in a large RCT.

      3a. Decide whether to pursue an R01 application, and if so, 3b. plan for the R01.

      The project would engage 6 couples to help design PartnerCHESS, test its usability and give
      feedback on its utility. Once ready, the system would be tested by 34 other couples
      randomized to receive either PartnerCHESS + treatment as usual (TAU) or A-CHESS + TAU for a
      6-month trial. The investigators will collect survey data at baseline, 2, 4, and 6 months and
      analyze it to see if a large clinical trial holds promise and, if so, produce an application
      to support a full-scale trial based on the technology developed and the research procedures
      employed in the pilot test.

      The study is important to public health because of the scope of the alcohol abuse and the
      potential of technology to improve the lives of both patients and partners. If successful,
      such technology could greatly broaden the reach and impact of AUD treatment in general and
      couples therapy in particular.

    <description>The Short Inventory of Problems (SIP) assess consequences of drinking and is based on the Drinker Inventory of Consequences and measures consequences in 5 domains: interpersonal, intrapersonal, physical, impulse control, and social. Respondents indicate whether each item occurred in the last 30 days. Responses are summed across the 15 items to yield a total score. The higher the number the greater degree of consequences being experienced by the drinker.</description>

    <measure>Change in Negative Affect as measured by the PANAS Questionnaire for both Patient and Partner</measure>
    <time_frame>60 days</time_frame>
    <description>The Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) Questionnaire is comprised of two 10-item scales for both positive and negative affect. Each item on the negative affect scale is scored from 1 (very slightly or not at all) to 5 (extremely) for a total range of 10-50 where the higher the score, the more negative the affect.</description>

    <measure>Change in Couple/Relationship Satisfaction for both Patient and Partner</measure>
    <time_frame>60 days</time_frame>
    <description>Determined by use of the Dyadic Adjustment Scale - 7 (DAS-7) which is a brief version of the 32 question Dyadic Adjustment Scale (DAS) and assesses the quality of marriage and similar dyads. The DAS-7 includes 4 subscales: Affectional Expression where the total range of scores is 0-12, the higher the score, the higher the affection; Cohesion subscale ranging from 0-24, the higher the score the more cohesive a relationship is; Consensus subscale ranging from 0-65, the higher the score the more consensus in the relationship; and the Satisfaction subscale ranging from 0-51, the higher the score the more satisfying the relationship.</description>

    <measure>Change in Psychological Distress for both Patient and Partner</measure>
    <time_frame>60 days</time_frame>
    <description>The OQ45 measures the patient's and partner's outcomes during treatment by assessing three sub-domains, Symptom Distress, Interpersonal Relations, and Social Role. Scores from the Outcomes Questionnaire-45 range from 0-180, the higher the score, the higher the symptoms of distress</description>

    <measure>Change in sleep disturbance for both Patient and Partner</measure>
    <time_frame>60 days</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed through a modified version of the PROMIS-29, specifically questions to address sleep quality and sleep difficulty over the last 7 days. The sleep portion of the PROMIS is a 4-item survey with a lowest possible score of 5 and a highest possible score of 20. A conversion table is used to convert the raw score into a T-score. The higher the T-score represents more of the concept being measured.</description>

The pain portion of the PROMIS is a 4-item survey with a lowest possible score of 5 and a highest possible score of 20. A conversion table is used to convert the raw score into a T-score. The higher the T-score represents more of the concept being measured.</description>
