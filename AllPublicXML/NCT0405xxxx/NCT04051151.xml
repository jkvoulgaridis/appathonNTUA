  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Apathy is a multi-dimensional behavior characterized by impairments to motivation, planning
      and initiation; collectively called, goal-directed behavior. It is highly prevalent in
      patients suffering from neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's
      disease (PD) as well as psychiatric disorders such as depression and schizophrenia. In PD,
      specifically, apathy is one of the more troublesome symptoms. Apathetic PD patients have
      greater disability, lower adherence to treatment plans and caregivers report greater stress
      and burden.

      Interventions grounded in behavioral economic theories, namely, financial and social
      incentives often promote positive behavioral change such as weight loss and smoking
      cessation. However, the effectiveness of these interventions varies across and within
      conditions and incentive type. It also tends to dissipate when incentives are no longer
      provided. To date, these approaches have not been used to promote behavior change in PD or
      other neurological conditions where apathetic behaviors are a pressing problem. The overall
      goal of this study is to test if behavioral economic approaches will reduce apathy, and
      subsequently, improve goal-directed behavior in Parkinson's disease.

    <description>To test the feasibility and preliminary effectiveness of a gamification intervention that enhances supportive social incentives that includes collaboration, accountability and peer support to improve physical activity levels compared to a control group that receives the standard of care. The researchers will compare the change in mean daily steps between the gameification and control (education) groups using an independent t-test.</description>

    <description>Participants and partners that have randomized to the gamification group will receive instructions and help in setting up a game platform via Way to Health. This game will include wearing a Fit Bit device, setting a daily step goal, and point deductions for failure to meet this step goal throughout the following 4 weeks. Participants will move up or down specified levels each week depending on how many days they met their step goal.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Eligible participants will have a diagnosis of Parkinson's disease, and may have
             either normal cognition or mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Most eligible participants
             will have to have smartphones with wifi, application, Bluetooth, and text messaging
             capabilities. The study team does have five smart phone that can be provided to
             participants who do not have smartphones so as to not exclude these individuals.

          -  Eligible participants will have to be mobile as the primary outcome measure for the
             study is step goals measured on the Fitbit. Participants will be eligible if they can
             ambulate successfully with a cane.

          -  Participants will also need a study partner to be eligible to participant. This
             partner can be anyone of the eligible participant's choosing, who also consents to
             participation in the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Individuals will be excluded if they screen positive for dementia at the screening
             visit or do not have the decisional capacity to give consent. Dementia will be defined
             as a Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score of &lt;22. Decisional capacity will be
             tested based on their understanding of study risks and benefits.

          -  Individuals will also be excluded if they require a wheelchair or walker, or are
             unable to ambulate safely.

          -  Individuals will be excluded if they are currently participating in another physical
             activity study, have been told by a physician not to exercise, or are currently
             pregnant.
