      This study evaluates implant survival and marginal bone resorption in patients receiving
      implant treatment with respect to demographic data and AB0 (groups) blood types.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For a successful dental implant, optimal soft and hard tissue characteristics are required.
      These characteristics include appropriate bone quality and a healthy adherent keratinized
      gingiva that surrounds the implant neck. The most common complications are peri-implant
      diseases and marginal bone loss for dental implants. Marginal bone loss around the implant
      may be observed as a long-term complication due to microbial dental plaque-induced
      peri-implant inflammatory disease or may be observed in the absence of such a disease.

      The immune system and genetic factors are known to have important effects on implant success,
      and ABO blood types are also included in the genetic factors. In the studies evaluating the
      association of ABO blood types with increased susceptibility to infection and various
      systemic diseases, it was reported that the percentages of blood types differed
      significantly, especially in skeletal-muscle system injuries, fractures and cardiovascular
      disease susceptibility. Also some researchers reported that blood types may be effective on
      the bacteria colonization which is the main reason of the periodontal diseases. ABO blood
      types may have an impact on dental implant success and survival.

    <description>We evaluated marginal bone resorption in patients receiving implant treatment with respect to ABO blood types. These measurements will be measured by periapical radiographs. Periapical radiographs were taken with a parallel technique to measure the amount of mesial and distal bone resorption in the neck region of the implants.</description>

        This cross-sectional study was performed on patients who had undergone implant treatment
        and had prosthetic rehabilitation at the Faculty of Dentistry of the Van Yuzuncu Yil
        University between 2010 and 2017 and who had been followed up for at least one year.
