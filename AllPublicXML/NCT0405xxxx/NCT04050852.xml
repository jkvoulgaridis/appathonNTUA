  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is well known that patients with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) have progressive decline of
      respiratory muscle function. Therapy traditionally involved supportive means to ensure
      optimal nutrition and airway clearance. Nusinersen (spinraza) is a disease-modifying
      medication approved for treatment of SMA in pediatric and adult patients. The goal of this
      study is to observe pulmonary function test (PFT) changes and respiratory muscle strength
      trends throughout the first year of treatment. A prospective, longitudinal study measuring
      pulmonary function testing (PFTs) changes in spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) patients. Patients
      will be patients with SMA who are approved and maintained on nusinersen. Patient will have a
      baseline PFT. Investigators will repeat PFT at 3, 6, and 12 months while on nusinersen
      treatment.
