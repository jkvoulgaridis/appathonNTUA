  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The involvement of the immune system in the process of implantation and its modulation as a
      therapeutic line in these alterations, failure of implantation and repetition abortion are
      controversial and make it necessary to conduct clinical studies properly led and with a study
      population chosen by strict criteria in order to better understand the involvement of the
      different innate and adaptive immune mechanisms in the field of reproductive medicine and
      especially in clinically expressed failures recurrent implantation failure and recurrent
      abortions.

      A prospective pilot study is proposed in patients with recurrent implantation failure and
      recurrent abortions undergoing assisted reproductive techniques.

      The main objective of this study is to determine the involvement of key effectors of innate
      immune response in the endometrium that induces a pro-inflammatory response, and to be able
      to know in particular what is the distribution of KIR receptors in the uNK and the HLA-C
      typing in patient-mother, egg/semen donors, male-father, abortive remains, live newborns.

      To this end, the distribution of KIR and HLA-C receptors will be studied two arms/patient
      groups, divided from a population chosen according to inclusion/exclusion criteria:

        -  Group I: group recurrent abortions.

        -  Group II: group recurrent implementation failure. The study population will include
           subjects of older age (aged between 18 and 37 years) who will be divided into 2 total
           Study Arms N x 200 (n x 100 for each arm).
