      Single arm phase II trial designed to assess the efficacy of durvalumab treatment in terms of
      6-month progression-free survival. We will include 22 patients who will receive 1500 mg
      durvalumab (MEDI4736) via IV infusion Q4W &lt;&lt;for up to a maximum of 12 months (up to 13
      doses/cycles) with the last administration on week 48&gt;&gt; or &lt;&lt;until confirmed disease
      progression&gt;&gt; unless there is unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or another
      discontinuation criterion is met. If a patient's weight falls to 30 kg or below for 1 week or
      longer ( ≥ 7 days) durvalumab will be permanently discontinued.

      N) Investigational Product(s), Dose and Mode of Administration:

      Patients in the durvalumab (MEDI4736) monotherapy treatment group will receive 1500 mg
      durvalumab (MEDI4736) via IV infusion Q4W &lt;&lt;for up to a maximum of 12 months (up to 13

      patient's weight falls to 30 kg or below for 1 week or longer ( ≥ 7 days) durvalumab will be
      permanently discontinued.

      O) Study Assessments and Criteria for Evaluation:

      O.1) Safety Assessments:

      Safety assessments will be performed in accordance with the National Cancer Institute Common
      Terminology Criteria, version 5.0.

      At least every 4 weeks, during each visit, data on toxicity on treatment will be evaluated.

      Laboratory analysis will also be performed at least every 4 weeks to assess toxicity.

      O.2) Efficacy Assessments:

      Patients will undergo tumor assessments with cross-sectional imaging at study site at start
      and then 8 ± 1w until complete 12 months after first dose; Patients who have disease control
      following completion of 12 months (13 cycles) of treatment will continue to have objective
      tumor assessment q12w ± 1w for more 12 months or until disease progression (whichever comes
      first); Patients who are withdrawn from durvalumab treatment for reasons other than confirmed
      PD (e.g toxicity) will continue to have objective tumor assessments q8w ± 1w until complete
      12 months after first dose. Then, they will have objective tumor assessments q12w ± 1w for
      more 12 months (24 months after first dose) or until disease progression; Measurable target
      and nontarget lesions will be assessed according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
      Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1).

      P) Statistical Methods and Data Analysis:

      Safety analysis will be performed considering all enrolled patients who received at least one
      dose of durvalumab; Efficacy analysis will be performed using intention-to-treat approach;
      Will be used an alpha error of 0.05 (1-sided) and a power (1 - beta error) of 90%; Primary
      endpoint will be 6-month progression free survival rate; Secondary endpoints will be overall
      survival, incidence of locoregional progression and incidence of distant progression;
      Locoregional progression is defined when an in-field lesion (primary tumor or lymph nodes) is
      the first site of progression or in case of worsening dysphagia with an upper endoscopy
      revealing an unequivocal local progression; Distant progression is defined when an out-field
      lesion (lymph node, visceral, bone) is the first site of progression; We estimate 12 months
      of recruitment, with 2 patients per month; Overall survival will be estimated using
      Kaplan-Meier method.

      Q) Sample Size Determination:

      Single arm phase II trial; Will be estimated p0 (null-hypothesis 6-month PFS) as 10%; Will be
      estimated p1 (alternative hypothesis 6-month PFS) as 35%; With an estimated dropout rate of
      10%, our sample size will be 22 patients.
