  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to 1) convene African American and Latino Community Coalitions
      to adapt Family Teamwork (FT) for school-age youth, and integrate FT with the Smart and
      Secure Children (SSC) program community-based, peer delivery format, 2) identify facilitators
      and barriers to parental involvement in diabetes management for African American and Latino
      parents of children (5-9 years) with T1D to refine, with Community Coalitions the adapted and
      integrated Family Teamwork- Peer Delivery (FT-P), and 3) evaluate the feasibility,
      satisfaction, and preliminary outcomes of the FT-P program among African American and Latino
      parents of school-aged children (5-9 years) withT1D.

      A randomized pilot trials will be conducted with African American and Latino families to
      examine the feasibility, parent satisfaction, and preliminary outcomes of FT-P. Families will
      be stratified by race/ethnicity, age, and HbA1c strata, and randomized to FT-P plus standard
      diabetes care or to standard diabetes care alone after completion of baseline assessment
      using a random numbers table generated by a program created through Baylor College of
      Medicine's Institute for Clinical Training and Research data management specialists.
