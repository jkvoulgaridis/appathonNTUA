  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      DeepDoc is an AI-based decision support system for the early etiology diagnosis of
      neurological diseases using clinical data points from patients admitted to hospital within 24
      hours.This study aims to evaluate whether the diagnosis of the DeepDoc AI-based decision
      support system is better than the doctor's initial diagnosis by a multi-center, superiority
      diagnostic study.

      The doctor completes the admission note within 24 hours after the patient is admitted to the
      hospital. After informed consent is given to the patient who meet the inclusion criteria,
      open the DeepDoc to fill in the patient identification information. Then take the picture of
      the initial diagnosis of the admission note page and upload it to DeepDoc, fill the doctor's
      initial diagnosis into the DeppDoc. And put the patient's clinical data points into the
      DeepDoc to get a DeepdDoc diagnosis.
