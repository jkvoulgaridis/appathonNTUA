  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      College women are at risk for eating disorders, which have profound health impacts.
      Cross-sectional studies have shown that the use of dietary self-monitoring is associated with
      eating disorder risk among college students. However, causality cannot be established with
      cross-sectional studies.

      This study utilizes a randomized controlled trial design to examine how the use of a popular
      dietary self-monitoring smartphone application impacts college females' well-being, including
      eating disorder risk. We hypothesize those who are randomized to dietary self-monitoring will
      have a greater increase in eating disorder risk compared to the control group.

    <description>Eating disorder risk will be measured on a survey via the Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire Short Form (EDE-QS). The EDE-QS is a validated 12 question scale. Each question has a score range 0-3, and the average of all scores is the overall score. A higher score indicates higher risk.</description>

    <measure>Eating Disorder Risk</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days</time_frame>
    <description>Measured via survey using the validated SCOFF questionnaire which consists of five questions. Each question is a yes/no and a yes receives one point with a total score ranging from 0-5. Higher scores indicate higher risk. Modified to ask about pounds instead of stone as a measure of weight.</description>

    <time_frame>30 days</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed using the Brunnsviken Brief Quality of Life Scale (BBQ) on a survey. The BBQ has 12 questions, each ranging from 0-4. Higher scores indicate higher subjective quality of life.</description>

    <measure>Anxiety</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days</time_frame>
    <description>State anxiety as measured via survey using the short-form of the state scale of the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. The scale consists of 6 questions with a range of scores 1-4 for each question. Three positive questions are reverse coded and scores are added together with higher scores indicating higher state anxiety.</description>

    <measure>Depression Symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days</time_frame>
    <description>Measured via survey using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale Revised (CESD-R-10). The CESD-R-10 is a 10 item scale with each question having the possibility of a score 0-3. Two questions are reverse coded, then scores from each question are added to give an overall score. Higher scores indicate more depressive symptoms.</description>
