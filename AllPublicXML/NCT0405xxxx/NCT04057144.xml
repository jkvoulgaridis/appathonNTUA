  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As non-pharmacological alternatives, psychosocial treatments have been recommended for
      chronic pain management. One such treatment is Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT). ACT
      is a cognitive behavior therapy based on Relational Frame Theory, a comprehensive theory
      about language and cognition. This treatment intends to help patients identify values (&quot;what
      is truly meaningful to them&quot;) and to set goals and take action according to their values. ACT
      has research support in the treatment of several mental health problems. Moreover patients
      are taught mindfulness skills to increase acceptance of pain, thoughts and feelings so that
      these will have less impact on functioning and action. Among patients with chronic pain,
      several small clinical trials have shown that ACT is more effective than other treatments in
      terms of increasing function and improving mental health. ACT in combination with mindfulness
      training has not been tested so far. Further methodologically robust trials are required.
      This study will therefore examine whether ACT is more effective for chronic pain than an
      education program, and whether adding daily mindfulness training will improve the outcome, in
      a large sample of patients from four multidisciplinary pain centers.
