  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, there are two study medicines: NNC0385-0434 (the new medicine being tested)
      and placebo (a 'dummy' medicine). Participants will only get one of these medicines - which
      one is decided by chance. The study medicine for each person is chosen by a computer. A dummy
      medicine (placebo) looks like the study medicine but has no effect on the body. The dummy
      medicine needs to be used in the study to find out if the study medicine works as expected.
      The dose of the study medicines that participants receive will depend on which group they get
      into. The study has 4 groups of 8-15 participants in each. Each group will get a different
      dose of NNC0385-0434 or placebo. Participants and the study doctor will not know which of the
      study medicine/dose participants will get. However, if a participant's safety is at risk, the
      study doctor will be told in order to decide the future treatment. NNC0385-0434 may help to
      clear cholesterol from the blood. When there is less cholesterol circulating in the blood
      over a long period of time, then there is less risk of arteries (blood vessels) being clogged
      or developing diseases of the heart and blood vessels. Each participant will get one
      injection under the skin and will be in the study for about 4 months.

    <intervention_model_description>Four (4) cohorts are planned. In 3 cohorts, healthy subjects will be randomised in a 3:1 manner to receive either: 1) NNC0385-0434 or 2) Placebo (NNC0385-0434). Each cohort will last 10 weeks and there will be 3 weeks between cohorts. Following safety observation, a fourth cohort will be initiated with patients with hypercholesterolaemia. Patients will be randomised in a 2:1 manner to receive either: 1) NNC0385-0434 or 2) Placebo (NNC0385-0434).</intervention_model_description>
