    <textblock>
      This is an open label, multi-center, phase I study of oral Simmitinib in subjects with
      advanced solid tumors including gastric cancer [including gastroesophageal cancer],
      cholangiocarcinoma, lung squamous cell carcinoma, urothelial transitional cell carcinoma, and
      estrogen-receptor-positive breast cancer patients [ER+], etc. This phase I study will
      evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and the preliminary efficacy of the
      FGFR/KDR/CSF1R multi-target inhibitor Simmitinib.
