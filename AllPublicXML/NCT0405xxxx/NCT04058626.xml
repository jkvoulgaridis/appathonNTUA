  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will focus on determining;

        -  How accurate the test is in detecting poor circulation

        -  How it's accuracy compares to other commonly used tests, and

        -  Whether test results are linked to the chance of ulcer healing or amputation. Across 2
           hospitals, 305 diabetic patients will be scanned using the focused ultrasound test as
           well as other commonly used tests to detect poor circulation. Their results will be
           compared to a full version of the ultrasound test to identify the most accurate.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the UK, over 7,000 amputations are performed each year because of diabetes. Most of these
      (80%) occur when a foot wound, also known as an ulcer, does not heal. The most important
      cause of this is poor circulation to the feet. Currently, there are no accurate tests that
      foot specialists can use to detect poor circulation when they see patients. Because of this,
      poor circulation can be missed and its treatment delayed.

      A focused ultrasound test at the ankle, using a sensor and gel on the skin, can detect poor
      circulation. It is safe, painless and I have previously proven that it can be learned and
      performed quickly. It may help avoid amputations by detecting poor circulation so that it can
      be treated quickly.
