      This is a single-arm, open-label and exploratory clinical study of Anlotinib Hydrochloride
      Capsules combined with Sintilimab injection in the treatment of advanced Hepatocellular
      Carcinoma (HCC).

      In oder to observe and evaluate the efficacy and safety of Anlotinib Hydrochloride Capsules
      combined with Sintilimab injection. Subjects with pathological confirmed Hepatocellular
      Carcinoma will be enrolled.

      21 days as a treatment cycle, Anlotinib 12mg/day(D1-D14 ) and Sintilimab injection 200mg Q3W
      (D1). Sintilimab injection will be administered until disease progressioncor un-tolerable
      toxicity. Anlotinib will be administered until disease progression. If anlotinib is not
      tolerated, the dose can be reduced to 10mg or 8mg ,until un-tolerable toxicity again.
