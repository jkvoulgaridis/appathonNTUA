  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Extensive intraductal carcinoma of the breast refers to a type of breast cancer in which ≥
      25% of ductal carcinoma in situ is present in invasive tumors and there is a scattered
      distribution of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) in or around the invasive carcinoma. Compared
      with DCIS negative for extensive intraductal component, DCIS positive for extensive
      intraductal component is not sensitive to radiotherapy. Mckissock surgery was applied in
      breast-conserving surgery for breast cancer in 2016. Jianyi Li and the team members
      (Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang, China) applied this technique in
      breast-conserving surgery with preservation of the nipple-areola complex. This surgical
      technique is suitable for low-grade malignant tumors and has better prognosis than radical
      mastectomy. The purpose of this study is to investigate postoperative disease-free survival
      and quality of life after modified radical mastectomy versus expanded Mckissock surgery for
      extensive intraductal carcinoma of the breast. Results from this study will indicate the
      efficacy of expanded Mckissock surgery in the treatment of extensive intraducatal carcinoma
      of the breast.

      Extensive intraductal carcinoma of the breast refers to a type of breast cancer in which ≥
      25% of ductal carcinoma in situ is present in invasive tumors and there is a scattered
      distribution of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) in or around the invasive carcinoma. Studies
      have shown that patients with DCIS positive for extensive intraductal component have more
      residual tumors than patients with DCIS negative for extensive intraductal component. There
      are still many subclinical tumors in the residual mammary gland after removal of the main
      invasive tumor foci. This provides the condition for tumor recurrence after breast-conserving
      surgery, and the risk of tumor recurrence in DCIS positive for extensive intraductal
      component is 2.52 times that in DCIS negative for extensive intraductal component. Compared
      with DCIS negative for extensive intraductal component, DCIS positive for extensive
      intraductal component is not sensitive to radiotherapy.

      Mckissock surgery is originated from a breast reduction surgery developed by American doctors
      in 1970, which can remove glands to the maximum extent. This technique was applied to
      breast-conserving surgery in 2016, which initiated the application of this operation in
      malignant tumors. Jianyi Li and the team members (Shengjing Hospital of China Medical
      University, Shenyang, China) first applied expanded Mckissock surgery in breast-conserving
      surgery with the nipple-areola complex preserved. This surgical technique is suitable for
      low-grade malignant tumors. This surgical technique has been performed in 30 patients and
      results showed that the expanded Mckissock surgery has better prognosis than radical
      mastectomy. Therefore, this prospective cohort study will compare the postoperative
      disease-free survival and quality of life between modified radical mastectomy and expanded
      Mckissock surgery.

    <description>Expanded Mckissock surgery: (1) According to patient's preoperative imaging results and subjective expectations of their own breast morphology, the incision design and breast surface marking will be performed under the standing position. (2) After general anesthesia, the upper limbs will be abducted, and the upper body will be tilted by 15°-20° to dermatize the labeled skin around and below the areola. (3) The medial and lateral flaps will be dissociated to remove the total gland with nipple and areola preserved. (4) The cutting-edge of nipple-areola complex will be sent for cancer screening. The axillary lymph node biopsy or cleaning will be performed along the outer edge of the pectoralis major muscle. (5) The vertical subcutaneous pedicle flaps will be W-folded, and the flaps on both sides will be pulled to the vertical pedicle to reshape the breast. During this process, the breast and armpit drainage tubes will be indwelled.</description>
