  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine if a 6-week exercise training program promotes
      exercise-induced metabolic flexibility, that is, the ability to switch fuel sources for
      energy, in older prediabetic adults.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an investigator initiated single group intervention trial. All participants will
      receive a 6-week exercise training program with testing occurring before and following the
      training program. Participants will be provided with 3 days of a high fat diet prior to each
      of the three testing sessions at the Clinical Research Unit. All who agree to participate
      will undergo the same intervention.

      The goal of this proposal is to study the impact of a 6-week moderate intensity walking
      training program on exercise induced lipid metabolic flexibility in older adults with
      prediabetes. Study Investigators will seek to determine if exercise induced lipid oxidation
      following a high fat diet is increased in trained individuals relative to their baseline.

    <description>Metabolic rate will be measured by gas exchange using indirect calorimeter. For the first (baseline test) and second (follow up test 1) time we monitor gas exchange, participants will exercise for 20 minutes at a workload that elicits 50% of maximal oxygen consumption as determined by Graded Exercise Test #1 done before the exercise training program. The third time (follow up test 2), participants will exercise for 20 minutes at a workload that elicits 50% of oxygen consumption as determined by Graded Exercise Test #2 done after the exercise training program.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline (Pre-exercise training)</time_frame>
    <description>The gold standard for assessing cardiovascular fitness is exercise capacity as determined from peak volume of oxygen consumption (VO2peak) and treadmill time during a graded exercise test. A physician supervised, individualized ramp treadmill protocol will be performed on each participant. In this protocol, participants walk at a brisk pace with the speed based on their comfort and fitness. For lower fit individuals, the grade will be increased at a rate of 1%/minute, and for higher fit individuals, the grade will be increased at a rate of 2%/minute. The treadmill test will be performed according to guidelines set by the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM, 2014), to evaluate the subject's cardiovascular response to exercise.</description>

    <description>Prior to the submaximal exercise testing visits, all participants will be provided with 3 days of a standardized isoenergetic high fat diet (20% of kcals from carbohydrate, 65% fat; 15% protein) to promote lipid oxidation. The meals will be prepared and provided by the Clinical Research Unit of Wake Forest Baptist Health. Participants will pick up 3 days' worth of food and snacks 4 days prior the testing visit. For the 3 days leading up to the visit, participants will eat the provided foods and complete a compliance assessment.</description>
