      This research is studying the safety and effectiveness of AMD3100 and pembrolizumab in
      participants with metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety
      and effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the drug combination works in
      treating a specific disease. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the drug is being studied.

      Because AMD3100 and Pembrolizumab have not been administered together to individuals before,
      there will be a Run-In phase prior to the beginning of Phase II. This Run-In Phase is
      designed to identify what dosing schedule is best for participants on this study.
      Participants will be participating in the Run-In Phase.

      The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved Pembrolizumab as a treatment option
      for this disease.

      The FDA has not approved AMD3100 as a treatment option for this disease, however it has
      approved the drug for use in individuals who have recently had bone marrow transplants.

      Pembrolizumab is thought to block a receptor called PD-1. This receptor usually acts as a
      &quot;brake&quot; to prevent the body's immune system from attacking cancer cells. The antibody
      &quot;removes the brake&quot; to allow parts of the body's immune system (usually T cells) to attack
      the tumor

      AMD3100 is a drug that inhibits CXCR4, which is a biological mechanism called a chemokine.
      CXCR4 is over-expressed in cancer cells and promotes cancer cell growth, spread, and survival
      and controls immune cell trafficking. Researchers believe that inhibiting CXCR4 expels the
      immune-suppressive cells out of the tumor and attract the cancer-killing immune cells into
      the tumor environment so that the body's immune system may be able to better attack the
      cancer cells.

      In this research study, the investigators are assessing the safety and effectiveness of
      AMD3100 and pembrolizumab in participants with aggressive head and neck squamous cell
      carcinoma.

    <description>A safety run in will be conducted with AMD3100 administered weekly or every three weeks, both in combination with pembrolizumab administered every three weeks. The number of participants that experience dose limiting toxicities will be reported for each arm.</description>

    <measure>Overall Response Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>From the start of treatment up to 24 months, or until disease progression or intolerable toxicity, whichever occurs first</time_frame>
    <description>Overall response rate will be evaluated using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). A participant is considered to have achieved a response if the achieve either of the following:
Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to &lt;10 mm
Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression Free Survival</measure>
    <time_frame>From the time of randomization until disease progression or death, up to approximately 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>The duration of time from randomization until disease progression or death. Disease progression is assessed using RECIST criteria.
Confirmed Progressive Disease(CPD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. (Note: the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression). Disease progression must be confirmed on a subsequent scan.</description>

    <measure>The Number of Participants With Treatment-Related Serious Adverse Events</measure>

    <description>Adverse events are assessed using the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0. A treatment-related adverse event is an adverse event deemed to be possibly, probably, or definitely related to study treatment by the investigator.</description>

    <measure>Duration of Response</measure>
    <time_frame>From the time of first response until disease progression, up to 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Duration of response is measured from the time measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started, or death due to any cause. Participants without events reported are censored at the last disease evaluation).</description>

             lesions

          -  Have progressed on or after immune checkpoint therapy (anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1, as a
             monotherapy or in combination with other agents). Anti-PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint

        A male participant must agree to use a contraception as detailed in Appendix C of this
        protocol during the treatment period and for at least 120 days after the last dose of study
        treatment and refrain from donating sperm during this period.

        -Female participants:

        A female participant is eligible to participate if she is not pregnant (see Appendix C),

             Calmette-Guérin (BCG), and typhoid vaccine. Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection
             are generally killed virus vaccines and are allowed; however, intranasal influenza
             vaccines (eg, FluMist®) are live attenuated vaccines and are not allowed.

             within the past 3 years. Note: Participants with basal cell carcinoma of the skin,
             squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, or carcinoma in situ (e.g. breast carcinoma,
             cervical cancer in situ) that have undergone potentially curative therapy are not
             excluded.

          -  Has known active CNS metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis. Participants with
             previously treated brain metastases may participate provided they are radiologically
             stable, i.e. without evidence of progression for at least 4 weeks by repeat imaging
             (note that the repeat imaging should be performed during study screening), clinically
             stable and without requirement of steroid treatment for at least 14 days prior to

             (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive
             drugs). Replacement therapy (eg., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid

             reactive) or known active Hepatitis C virus (defined as HCV RNA [qualitative] is
             detected) infection. Note: No testing for Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C is required
             unless mandated by local health authority.

          -  Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality
             that might confound the results of the study, interfere with the subject's
             participation for the full duration of the study, or is not in the best interest of
             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.

             with cooperation with the requirements of the trial.

          -  Is pregnant or breastfeeding or expecting to conceive or father children within the
             projected duration of the study, starting with the screening visit through 120 days

          -  A WOCBP who has a positive serum pregnancy test within 72 hours prior to registration
             (see Appendix C). Note: In the event that 72 hours have elapsed between the screening
             pregnancy test and the first dose of study treatment, another pregnancy test (urine or
             serum) must be performed and must be negative in order for subject to start receiving
             study medication.
