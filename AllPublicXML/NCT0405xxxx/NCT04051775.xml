  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of the project are to investigate feasibility, safety, and health-related
      outcomes in patients with psychosis who choose not to use antipsychotic drugs (APs). The
      instruction from the Ministry of Health and Care Services to establish &quot;Medication Free&quot;
      (non-pharmacological (NonPharm)) treatment services, which has received substantial critique
      for being given without support in scientific evidence, provides a window of opportunity for
      research in an under-investigated field. The study will prospectively follow a cohort over 1
      year who seeks NonPharm treatment, with repeated measurements of symptoms, functional
      outcomes, quality of life, adverse events, as well as biological parameters including
      genetics and brain imaging, and environmental factors, and compare the findings to a control
      group of users of antipsychotic drugs, matched for age, gender and diagnosis. Current
      unanswered questions in the treatment of psychosis include which patients can successfully
      and safely discontinue antipsychotic medication; and what are the long-term symptomatic,
      biological and functional outcomes after use or non-use of APs, respectively. Taken together
      there is a fundamental lack of high-quality evidence to guide the treatment options in people
      who cannot or do not want to use APs in psychosis. This is also a major challenge in the
      study, as a more rigorous design that could directly compare different treatment options is
      not feasible, because no alternatives to APs have proven to be sufficiently effective and
      safe in controlled trials. The study is accordingly expected to provide new exploratory
      information that could be the basis of intervention studies which in its turn could provide
      important information for consumers and the mental health services regarding treatment
      options in psychosis.
