  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II pilot trial of Paclitaxel Protein Bound and Gemcitabine based chemotherapy
      and the addition of Paricalcitol upon attainment of stable or progressive disease in eligible
      patients with untreated metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pancreatic cancer is the fourth-highest cancer killer worldwide with an overall 5 year
      survival of about 8%. The only potentially curative procedure, surgical excision, is feasible
      in a minority of patients, but even in these patients the majority (~80%) die within 5 years.
      This study aims to see if adding paricalcitol (a vitamin D analogue) to chemotherapy can slow
      down tumour growth in patients with previously untreated metastatic pancreatic cancer.

      Studies have shown vitamin D can change the pancreatic tumour microenvironment from an
      immunologically suppressive (tumour growth promoting) to an immunologically hostile one,
      slowing down tumour growth in this way.

      Patients with pancreatic cancer that has spread to other organs and who have adequate hepatic
      and renal function are eligible. Participants will receive chemotherapy (paclitaxel and
      gemcitabine, with or without cisplatin). On development of stable disease or disease
      progression, paricalcitol will be added to the chemotherapy regimen and participants will
      continue on this treatment until their cancer stops responding to treatment. After that
      participants will be followed up 3 monthly for the collection of disease status and survival
      data.

      Participants will be asked to donate tumour and blood samples to allow the research team to
      look at the effects on the tumour biology.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Willing and able to provide written informed consent.

          2. Ability to comply with the protocol.

          3. Aged ≥ 18 years; male or female.

          4. Histologically or cytologically confirmed metastatic (stage IV) pancreatic ductal
             adenocarcinoma.

          5. Karnofsky performance status ≥70.

          6. At least one lesion that can be measured accurately at baseline as ≥10mm in the
             longest diameter (except lymph nodes which must have a short axis ≥15mm) with CT/MRI
             and which is suitable for repeated measurements per RECIST v1.1

          7. Adequate haematological and end-organ function, as per the local institutions
             reference ranges, within 21 days prior to day 1 of cycle 1 of treatment defined by the
             following:

               1. Haematology: ANC &gt;1.5 x 109/L (&gt;1500 cells / mm3); Platelet count &gt; 100 x 109/L
                  (&gt;100,000 cells/mm3); haematocrit level &gt;27% for females or &gt;30% for males

               2. Coagulation: INR and aPTT ≤1.5 x ULN.

               3. Biochemistry: serum creatinine &lt; 1.5mg/dl, bilirubin &lt; 1.5 x ULN; AST / ALT ≤ 2.5
                  x ULN (or ≤ 5 x ULN in the presence of liver metastasis) calculated creatinine
                  clearance ≥ 50ml/min (as measured by Cockcroft &amp; Gault)

          8. Life expectancy ≥ 12 weeks.

          9. Women of childbearing potential must agree not to become pregnant (e.g.
             post-menopausal for at least 1 year, surgically sterile, or using effective
             contraception) for the duration of the study and for 1 month after last dose of study
             treatment. Women of child bearing potential must have a negative serum or urine
             pregnancy test within 14 days of Cycle 1 Day 1 (preferably as close to the study
             treatment day as possible). Both male and female patients of reproductive potential
             must agree to use effective contraception from 2 weeks before the start of study
             treatment and until 6 month (female participants) or 6 months (male participants)
             after completion of treatment (as per protocol section 6.10.5).

         10. Tumour sites amenable to repeated biopsies.

         11. Willingness to undergo paired tumour biopsies during the trial

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients must have received no previous radiotherapy, surgery, chemotherapy or
             investigational therapy for the treatment of metastatic disease. Prior treatments in
             the adjuvant setting with gemcitabine and/or 5-FU or gemcitabine administered as a
             radiation sensitizer are allowed, provided at least 6 months have elapsed since
             completion of the last dose and no lingering toxicities are present. In exceptional
             circumstances, if a patient has received paclitaxel protein bound and gemcitabine as
             first line chemotherapy for metastatic disease in exactly the same way as mandated in
             the current trial, they can be considered eligible to be enrolled directly to the add
             on paricalcitol component of the trial.

          2. Palliative surgery and/or radiation treatment less than 4 weeks prior to initiation of
             study treatment.

          3. Exposure to any investigational agent within 4 weeks prior to initiation of study
             treatment.

          4. Evidence of central nervous system (CNS) metastasis (negative imaging study, if
             clinically indicated, within 28 days of Cycle 1 Day 1).

          5. History of other malignancies (except cured basal or squamous cell carcinoma,
             superficial bladder cancer, prostate cancer in active surveillance, or carcinoma in
             situ of the cervix) unless documented free of cancer for ≥2 years.

          6. Current, serious, clinically significant cardiac arrhythmias as determined by the
             investigator.

          7. History of HIV infection.

          8. Active, clinically significant serious infection requiring treatment with antibiotics,
             antivirals or anti-fungals (see Section 6.10).

          9. History of symptomatic genitourinary stones (e.g. kidney stones) within 12months of
             Cycle 1 Day 1.

         10. Pre-existing, clinically significant peripheral neuropathy ≥ G2

         11. Hypersensitivity to the active study drug substance or to any of its excipients as
             listed in section 6 of the SmPC of each study drug.

             vitamin D and calcium supplements must be stopped at the time of enrolment and for the
             duration of study treatment.

         16. Any other disease, metabolic dysfunction, physical examination finding or clinical
             laboratory finding that, in the investigator's opinion, gives reasonable suspicion of
             a disease or condition that contraindicates the use of study treatment, may affect the
             interpretation of the results, render the patient at high risk from treatment
             complications or interferes with obtaining informed consent.

         17. Female patients who are pregnant or nursing.
