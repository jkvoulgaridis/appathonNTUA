  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Participants will be randomized either to home-based exercise or to intradialysis exercise
      guided by nurses of the renal unit. The programs will last 16 weeks. The intradialysis
      exercise consists of combined aerobic and resistance training exercise. The home-based
      exercise consists of resistance exercise and walking.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During 16 weeks one group will follow an intradialysis exercise program. The exercise program
      consists of strengthening exercises for lower limbs and for the upper limb free of fistula.
      The exercise program includes isotonic exercises for quadriceps, triceps surae, psoas,
      glutei, and brachial biceps; and isometric exercises for hip adductors and hamstrings.
      Elastic bands will be used to apply resistance. Progression will be achieved by increasing
      from 1 set of 10 repetitions until 3 sets of 15 repetitions. This first part of the exercise
      session will last no more than 30 minutes. The program will also include aerobic exercise
      (cycling) for up to 30 minutes. Intensity will adapted through the duration of the study so
      that the participant feel the exercise from hard to somewhat hard (13 to 15 at the rate of
      perceived exertion 6 to 20). Time and resistance will be adapted progressively. After an
      initial training period by a physiotherapist, the nursing staff will be responsible for
      monitoring and implementing the program.

      The other group will follow a home-based program. A booklet with resistance exercise and
      recommendation of walking between exercises will be provided. An initial training phase will
      be applied by the physiotherapists from the rehabilitation department.
