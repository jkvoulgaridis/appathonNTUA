  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      DEFINIT-P is a prospective pilot study of frailty in cardiac device recipients, comprised of
      a registry and randomized control trial. The RCT is a supervised exercise program and
      nutritional supplement intervention for pre-frail and frail cardiac device participants. The
      registry will be used to describe all cardiac device recipients, regardless of frailty
      status.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      DEFINIT-P is a single center randomized controlled trial and registry.

      This pilot study will determine the feasibility of a larger, multi-center randomized clinical
      trial which aims to evaluate the efficacy of a supervised exercise program and nutritional
      supplement program in reversing or preventing progression of frailty in cardiac device
      recipients.

      The future trial would also examine the physiologic effects of exercise and nutritional
      supplementation to understand their effects on blood biomarker profiles, which will provide
      insight into potentially targetable mechanisms underlying frailty.
