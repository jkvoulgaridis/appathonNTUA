  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to better understand the structural and functional changes
      that the CNS undergoes following stroke and how these changes relate to clinical measures.
      Both macroscopic and microscopic changes of the brain and the spinal cord will be examined in
      stroke patients and compared to healthy controls. In terms of structural plasticity, we aim
      to identify MR biomarkers that allow predicting the course of the patient's neurological
      status and accurately describe the course of the disease and the recovery. Importantly, we
      aim to investigate which factors scale the patients' symptoms.

      In terms of functional plasticity, we will combine fMRI with behavioural motor and sensory
      testing to understand i) the structural and functional interplay between spinal and
      supraspinal neural circuits after stroke possibly driven by beneficial
      plasticity/regeneration vs. maladaptive plasticity/degeneration and ii) which clinical and
      behavioural determinants drive functional hand representations in the primary somatosensory
      and motor cortices to be maintained and which determinants drive reorganisation of functional
      representations following sensory input loss. We will further investigate the contribution of
      brainstem reorganisation to plasticity observed at the cortical level and, by doing so, aim
      to better understand the mechanistic underpinnings of functional reorganisation.
