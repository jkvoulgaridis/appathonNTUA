      Each subject enrolled in the study will be requested to complete an intake questionnaire
      including diabetes quality of life questions. The subject will use Dario Blood glucose
      monitoring system and will be contacted by a Certified Diabetes Educator (CDE) two to three
      times a month as well as have a direct communication using other communication channels such
      as mail, chat and text messaging (SMS) for lifestyle and diabetes management coaching for a
      total duration of three months. In the end of study, the subject will complete a diabetes
      quality of life questionnaire and have a blood test to evaluate its clinical parameters.

      This study is designed to assess the effect of digital self-monitoring platform used with the
      remote support of a Health coach on clinical outcomes and Diabetes quality of life.

      Study design will be an open-label randomized trial of adults with Type 2. Patients are
      recruited through the Diabetes and Endocrinology Consultants center setting. Upon
      randomization to the intervention group, study participants will receive three months
      diabetes health coaching comprising of:

        1. Two scheduled phone sessions with a Diabetes health coach a month;

        2. Ongoing dual communication with the coach using digital communication channels such as
           chat, SMS and emails

        3. Diabetes education, behavior modification, goal setting and reinforcement. The Dario App
           will record participant's glucose measurements and additional information captured by
           the patient such as medication intake, food and physical activity results.

      The coach will get access to the patients' App captured information and will intervene ad
      necessary in the context of the clinical information.
