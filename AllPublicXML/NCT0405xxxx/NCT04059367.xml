  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study looks at how the study medicine (NNC9204-1177) affects other medicines in the body.
      Participants will get the study medicine and 5 other medicines which have all been approved
      by the authorities. Participants will get 1 injection of the study medicine each week for 11
      weeks. The study medicine is injected under the skin in the stomach area. All injections will
      be given by study staff. Participants will get 5 medicines as tablets, capsules or syrup to
      be taken with water at the beginning of the study and after 10 weeks of treatment with the
      study medicine. The study will last for about 4 months. Participants will have 14 visits to
      the clinic with the study staff and study doctor. Participants will have blood draws and 2
      different kinds of electrocardiograms taken during the study. They will be asked about your
      mental health. People who use any medication, including herbal products, cannot take part in
      the study. Women cannot take part if pregnant, breast-feeding or planning to become pregnant
      during the study period or if they use birth control pills or other hormonal birth control
      products.
