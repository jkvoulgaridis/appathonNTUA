  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be a randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled, single-ascending dose
      (SAD), sequential group study. It is a SAD study in healthy Non-Asian subjects (Part 1) and
      healthy Japanese subjects (Part 2) to assess the safety and tolerability of AZD6615 and to
      characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) of AZD6615.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be a randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled, single-ascending dose,
      sequential group study. This study part is planned to consist of 3 cohorts of Non-Asian
      subjects (Part 1) and 2 cohorts of Japanese subjects (Part 2). Part 2 will be initiated no
      earlier than after completion of the last Safety Review Committee (SRC) review in Part 1.
      Healthy male and/or female subjects aged 20 to 60 years will be included in both Parts 1 and
      2 of the study. Female subjects must be of non-childbearing potential. Study Part 1 is
      planned to be conducted in 24 subjects but may be conducted in up to 40 subjects. Study Part
      2 is planned to be conducted in 16 subjects but may be conducted in up to 32 subjects.

      Within each cohort of Parts 1 and 2, 6 subjects will be randomized to receive AZD6615 and 2
      subjects will be randomized to receive placebo. Dosing and food intake should be supervised
      and documented by study staff when subjects are in the clinic.

      The study will comprise of:

        -  A Screening Period of maximum 28 days.

        -  A Dosing Session during which subjects will be resident at the Clinical Unit from the
           day before IMP administration (Day -1) until at least 78 hours after Investigational
           medicinal product (IMP) administration; discharged on Day 4.

        -  A Follow-Up Period of 12 weeks that will consist of 6 Follow-Up Visits, for which the
           subjects will return to the Clinical Unit at 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 weeks post-dose.

      Within each cohort, site personnel remain blinded until the SRC meeting.

      Following review of the data, the SRC may also decide to adjust the following for subsequent
      cohorts:

        -  The time window between the sentinel dose group and the main dose group in Part 1.

        -  The length of the stay at the study site, the timing and number of assessments and/or
           samples.

        -  The length of the follow-up period.

        -  The length of the data collection period for the SRC review.

             study, or influence the results or the subject's ability to participate in the study.

          2. History or presence of gastrointestinal, hepatic or renal disease or any other
             condition known to interfere with absorption, distribution, metabolism or excretion of
             drugs.

             out of range: (Alanine aminotransferase &gt; upper limit of normal [ULN], Aspartate

             antibody and human immunodeficiency virus.

          7. Abnormal vital signs, any clinically important abnormalities in rhythm, conduction or
             morphology of the resting ECG and any clinically important abnormalities in the
             12-Lead ECG as considered by the Investigator, that may interfere with the
             interpretation of QTc interval changes.

          8. Known or suspected history of drug abuse, current smoker or those who have smoked or
             used nicotine products within the previous 3 months before the Screening Visit.

          9. History of alcohol abuse and/or severe allergy/hypersensitivity.

         10. Previous bone marrow transplant.

         11. Males who are unwilling to use an acceptable method of birth control during the entire
