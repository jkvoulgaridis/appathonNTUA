  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Study design: Multicenter, experimental, randomized, crossed, double blind study (patient and
      results analysis).

      Aim: To evaluate the effect of different neurostimulation techniques on the
      neurophysiological and biomechanical swallowing mechanisms of patients with dysphagia
      associated with chronic stroke and select those techniques with the best results to be
      evaluated in the second phase of the study (medium-term effects).

      Outcome measures:

        -  Videofluoroscopy: prevalence of impaired efficacy and safety of swallow (penetrations
           and aspirations), penetration aspiration scale (PAS: from 0 to 8), biomechanical
           parameters (time to laryngeal vestibule closure, upper esophageal sphincter opening).

        -  Pharyngeal sensory evoked potentials (pSEP): latency and amplitude of obtained evoked
           potentials. Higher latency (0 onwards) means worse outcome and higher amplitude (0
           onwards) means better outcome.

        -  Pharyngeal motor evoked potentials (pMEP): latency, amplitude, duration and area of
           obtained evoked potentials. Higher latency (0 onwards) means worse outcome and higher
           amplitude (0 onwards) means better outcome.

      Treatments and patients: 36 post-stroke patients with oropharyngeal dysphagia (PAS superior
      or equal to 2) randomized patients in 3 treatment arms (3 groups of 12 patients).

        -  Active and sham repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS): 90% of the resting
           motor threshold, 1250 pulses, 5 Hz.

        -  Active and sham Intrapharyngeal Electrical Stimulation (PES): 75% of tolerance
           threshold, pulses of 0.2 ms, 5 Hz, 10 min.

        -  Oral Capsaicin (active intervention, 10-5M, TRPV1 agonist) and placebo solution (sham):
           100 mL, single administration.

      Administration of study therapies:

      The study will be performed in two visits separated for one week. In each visit patients will
      randomly receive active or sham treatment and a pre-post evaluation of biomechanics of
      deglutition (with VFS) and neurophysiological mechanisms (swallowing afferent and efferent
      pathways) will be performed in each visit.

      Acute randomized administration -&gt; 1 active session (pre/post evaluation with VFS/pSEP/pMEP)
      + 1 separate control session 1 week apart (pre/post evaluation with VFS/pSEP/pMEP).

    <description>Seizures are the most feared side effect associated with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Seizures are a rare side event during and/or subsequent to a TMS session (1.4%, Bae et al., 2007) commonly not occurring beyond a few days after the last session. No other major or significant side effects are expected associated with the interventions.</description>
