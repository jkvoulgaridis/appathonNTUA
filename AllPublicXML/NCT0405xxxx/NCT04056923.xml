    <textblock>
      Implementation of lung cancer screening using low-dose computed tomography has increased the
      rate of detection of small peripheral pulmonary nodules. However, it is hard to localize
      these nodules by palpation because of their small volume and long distance to the nearest
      pleural surface. To further clarify the confounding factors, we developed our own 3D printing
      localization procedure. In contrast to traditional CT-G percutaneous puncture localization,
      our procedure was performed in the operating room without CT scan evaluation.

    <textblock>
      Pulmonary wedge resection is one of the most common types of operations performed by thoracic
      surgeons, especially given that more and more patients with ground glass nodules are being
      detected recently. One of the most significant current discussion concerning wedge resection
      is nodule localization. At present, a commonly used localization method is the CT-guided
      percutaneous lung puncture methylene blue staining marker localization, but this method has
      two main disadvantages: 1. the methylene blue dye is easy to spread, affecting the
      intraoperative judgment of nodule position by surgeon; 2. patients often suffer additional CT
      radiation. In recent years, the three-dimensional (3D) printing technique has been gradually
      applied to clinical therapy. However, 3D-printed template-guided (3D-G) localization required
      pre-evaluation by CT scanning. If deviation of more than 2 cm was found on the CT scan, the
      3D-G method was regarded as a failure and traditional CT-G hookwire localization was used. To
      further clarify the confounding factors, the investigators developed their own 3D printing
      localization procedure. In contrast to traditional CT-G percutaneous puncture localization,
      the 3D printing localization procedure was performed in the operating room without CT scan
      evaluation.
