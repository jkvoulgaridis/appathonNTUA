  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single site pilot trial to assess the feasibility and safety of treating severe CDH
      with Fetal Endoscopic Tracheal Occlusion with the Goldballoon Detachable Balloon (GOLDBAL2)
      along with the Delivery Microcatheter (BALTACCI-BDPE100) at Michigan Medicine. The study will
      enroll pregnant women that meet study criteria. Participants will have placement of FETO
      between gestational age at 27 weeks plus 0 days and 29 weeks 6 days. The timing for removal
      of FETO will ideally be between 34 weeks 0 days and 34 weeks and 6 days but ultimately
      decided by the Fetal Diagnosis and Treatment Center at Michigan Medicine.

      This study requires that study participants live within 30 miles of the Von Voigtlander
      Women's Hospital and C.S. Mott Children's Hospital in order to maintain weekly follow up
      appointments while the balloon is in place and up to delivery. Additionally, there are
      lifestyle considerations where participants would be unable to carry on normal daily
      activities including exercise and sexual intercourse, not be able to work the remainder of
      the pregnancy, as well as have a support person that is available to stay with such as a
      spouse, friend, partner, parent.
