    <textblock>
      This study assesses the effect of the low fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides,
      monosaccharides, and polyols (FODMAP) diet on gastrointestinal (GI) and behavioral problems
      in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The objectives of this study are: -To
      determine whether the low FODMAP diet causes a decrease in gastrointestinal problems related
      to ASD -To determine whether the low FODMAP diet causes a decrease in behavioral problems -To
      assess the effect of decreased gastrointestinal problems on reduction of behavioral problems

    <textblock>
      In this study, participants were children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) ages 6-17
      years. Children with ASD were randomized to the low FODMAP diet or habitual diet for 2 weeks.
      At baseline and after a two-week intervention period, the parent/caregiver completed the
      Aberrant Behavior Checklist-Community and Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory
      Gastrointestinal Module. The parent/caregiver also completed a dietary food record, and stool
      consistency/frequency record (three days before start to intervention and the last three days
      of the intervention) of their children.

    <measure>Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) Gastrointestinal Module-Parent Report</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Before the study period and at the end of the two weeks, the effect of the low FODMAP diet on the severity of GI disorders was assessed with the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) Gastrointestinal Module-Parent Report. A 74-item survey with 14 scales items: stomach pain and hurt (6 items), discomfort when eating (5), food and drink limits (6), trouble swallowing (3), heartburn/reflux (4), nausea/vomiting (4), gas and bloating (7), constipation (14), blood in poop (2), diarrhea (7), worry about going poop (5), worry about stomachaches (2), medicines (4), and communication (5). Total Score: Sum of all the items over the number of items answered on all the Scales. Items are reverse-scored and transformed to a 0-100 scale so lower scores reflect worse GI dysfunction (As follows: 0=100, 1=75, 2=50, 3=25, 4=0). Response choices are in Likert-scale format ranging from 0 to 4 (0=Never, 1=Almost Never, 2=Sometimes, 3=Often, 4=Almost Always).</description>

    <measure>Assessment of stool consistency</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Consistency of the stool were recorded for 3 days before the study period and the last three days of the study using the Bristol stool scale. According to Bristol stool scale human stool is categorized into seven groups. Types 1 and 2 are defined as indications of constipation, Types 6 and 7 are indications of diarrhea, and Types 3, 4, and 5 show normal stool consistency. Daily stool consistency score was recorded. This was averaged and compared to the baseline and two weeks.</description>

    <measure>Assessment of stool frequency</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Frequency of the stool were recorded for 3 days before the study period and the last three days of the study. Daily number of stools were recorded. This was averaged and compared to the baseline and two weeks.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Assessment of behavioral problems</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Behavioral problems were determined before the study period and end of the study (after two weeks) using the Aberrant Behavior Checklist-Community (ABC-C). ABC-C checklist have 5 domains: 1) Irritability (includes agitation, aggression and self-injurious behaviors, 15 items); 2) Social Withdrawal (16 items); 3) Stereotypies (7 items); 4) Hyperactivity (16 items); and 5)Inappropriate Speech (4 items).The ABC-C is a 58-item questionnaire for caregivers/parent/caregivers and each item is scored as 0 (never a problem), 1 (slight problem), 2 (moderately serious problem), 3 (severe problem). it is not computed a total score based on the summation of all 58 items, as the subscales are largely independents. Higher scores indicate a higher severity of behavioral problems.</description>

    <measure>Energy and Nutrient Intake</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The parent/caregiver recorded food consumption of children for three days before the study period and the last three days of the study.The data for the three day dietary record were entered into a computerized database. Energy, macronutrients and micronutrients were calculated using The Food Processor SQL - ESHA Research. 2006</description>
