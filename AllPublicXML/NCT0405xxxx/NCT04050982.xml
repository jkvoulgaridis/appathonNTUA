  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary outcome of this prospective, RCT study is to determine the feasibility of
      utilizing AF CARE to provide lifestyle modification support to patients with AF.

      The secondary outcome will compare the cardiovascular risk factors, AF knowledge, AF Symptom
      Severity and Burden, and QOL between and within the UC group and the CARE AF group at
      baseline, 3, and 6 months and 15 months.

    <description>AF symptom severity and burden will be assessed with the Atrial Fibrillation Symptom Severity Scale. The AFSS is a patient self-reported questionnaire that contains 21 questions and provide calculated scores for AF Burden that is calculated in the following manner; AF Burden = AF frequency + AF duration + AF severity. Each of the 3 measures contribute equally to the AF burden score, and each measure ranges from 1-10 to yield Total AF Burden scores ranging from 3-30. Higher scores indicate greater AF burden.</description>
