  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is therefore to examine the clinical effectiveness and provide an
      economic analysis of individual versus group physiotherapy, following corticosteroid
      injection, for management of Subacromial Impingement (SAI) of the shoulder.

    <textblock>
      This trial was a single blind, randomised, equivalence trial comparing rotator cuff
      rehabilitation classes with traditional individual physiotherapy in subacromial impingement
      of the shoulder. A total of 200 patients were planned to be recruited from patients with
      painful shoulder referred to the Ulster Community and Hospitals Trust and community
      physiotherapy at the Ulster, Ards and Bangor sites or injection clinics at the Ulster
      Hospital. Local General Practitioners were also informed of the study and invited to refer
      appropriate patients.

      Intervention - Triamcinolone 40 mg (1 ml) and 6 weekly rotator cuff rehabilitation classes
      Control - Triamcinolone 40 mg (1 ml) and routine physiotherapy 6 sessions weekly for 6 weeks

      The injection technique involving a lateral approach to the subacromial space was used. An
      interval of between 1 and 3 weeks was allowed between injection and commencement of classes
      or physiotherapy.

      Classes were planned to be run by a rotating group of physiotherapists with at least 1 year
      of musculoskeletal outpatient's experience. They were to receive instruction on the protocol
      to use in the classes. Classes were to consist of six 30 min sessions on a weekly basis. A
      minimum of 5 and maximum of 10 participants were to attend. Advice was to be given on the
      nature of the condition. Subjects were to be instructed and supervised in exercises for
      scapulo-humeral mobility, scapulo-humeral stability and specific rotator cuff rehabilitation
      exercises. Subjects were to be introduced to ongoing classes as they are recruited to the
      trial.

      Six sessions of routine physiotherapy at weekly intervals were to be undertaken. Treatment
      was to be based on evidence-based guidelines for the treatment of shoulder impingement
      (Evidence-based clinical guidelines for the diagnosis, assessment and physiotherapy
      management of shoulder impingement syndrome Chartered Society of Physiotherapists 2005) and
      consist of mobilisation techniques and supervised exercises and stretches. A therapist with
      at least 1 year of musculoskeletal outpatients experience was to provide treatments.

    <description>The SF-36 consists of eight scaled scores, which are the weighted sums of the questions in their section. The eight sections are, vitality, physical functioning, bodily pain, general health perceptions, physical role functioning, emotional role functioning, social role functioning and mental health.
Each scale is transformed into a 0-100 scale. The lower the score the more disability. The higher the score the less disability i.e., a score of zero is equivalent to maximum disability and a score of 100 is equivalent to no disability.</description>

    <time_frame>26 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>EuroQol's EQ-5D is a generic instrument to measure and evaluate health status. The EQ-5D 3L version, describes general health based on five distinct dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 3 Levels (indicating no problem, some or moderate problem and extreme problem). EQ-5D comprises of five domains, each with three possible levels, a combination of the characteristic levels produces 243 possible health states (ranging from 11111 to 33333). The EQ-5D index scores are utilities derived from the respondents profile and ranges from 0 to 1; 0 meaning death and 1 complete health.</description>

    <measure>Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)</measure>
    <time_frame>26 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The HAD questionnaire comprises seven questions for anxiety and seven questions for depression. The anxiety and depression questions are interspersed within the questionnaire but are scored separately. Cut-off scores are available for quantification, for example a score of 8 or more for anxiety has a specificity of 0.78 and a sensitivity of 0.9, and for depression a specificity of 0.79 and a sensitivity of 0.83. Each scale has a range of 0-21. Scores of 15-21 indicate severe, 11-14, moderate and 8-10 mild, 7 or less indicates no case</description>

             Shoulder pain is defined as pain in the shoulder region, including the upper arm,
             elicited by active or passive shoulder movement. The diagnosis of &quot;subacromial pain&quot;
             is defined by range as no limitation in passive range of movement or restriction of
             passive range of movement mainly in abduction rather than external rotation.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  inability to give informed consent

          -  physiotherapy or injection treatment for current shoulder pain in previous 3 months

          -  blood coagulation disorders

          -  bilateral shoulder pain

          -  evidence of systemic infection

          -  abnormal shoulder X-ray defined as significant glenohumeral or subacromial joint space
             narrowing suggesting osteoarthritis of glenohumeral joint or complete rotator cuff
             rupture,

          -  evidence of rotator cuff tear, tested by external rotation lag sign, drop sign,
             internal rotation lag sign and static muscle resistance in external rotation, internal
             rotation and abduction,

          -  history of significant trauma to the shoulder,

          -  inflammatory joint disease,

          -  history of cerebrovascular accident,

          -  allergy or contraindication to Triamcinolone/contraindication to injection.

          -  evidence of referred pain from cervical spine disease.

          -  pregnancy or breast feeding

          -  patients whose first language is not English
