      Title: Older adults' experience and acceptance of a 'gamified' rehabilitative device for
      Total Knee Arthroplasty Background: Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA) is a common surgical
      procedure. Good post-operative rehabilitation is needed for successful functional recovery.
      Patients in our institution demonstrated reduced exercise compliance and accuracy during
      early post-operative rehabilitation. Root cause analysis identified 'reduced feedback',
      'reduced care continuity' and 'lack of engagement' to be key contributing factors. Yet,
      healthcare resource limitations necessitate new ways of care continuation and patient
      activation. In response, Fun-Knee™, an app-based innovation was created. Using 'gamification'
      of rehabilitative exercises, Fun-Knee™ guides and tracks rehabilitation from post-surgery to
      after hospital discharge, till outpatient physiotherapy review. The experience and opinions
      of older adults towards such 'gamified' rehabilitative technology is unknown.

      Purpose: This feasibility study aims to evaluate and develop Fun-Knee™, a novel, app-based
      rehabilitation device that 'gamifies' post-TKA exercises to improve exercise compliance,
      effectiveness, and patient activation. Our prototype of Fun-Knee™ was introduced to two
      cohorts of healthy older adults. Users' experience with hardware and software components of
      Fun-Knee™, and their acceptance of Fun-Knee™ for rehabilitation were surveyed. Feedback from
      the first cohort guided prototype refinement. User experience was re-evaluated in the second
      cohort.

      Methods: Community-dwelling adults with no knee pain, 50 years old and above were recruited
      if they met inclusion criteria. Participants were introduced to two 'gamified' exercises
      within Fun-Knee™ with standardised instructions. They were instructed to complete one round
      of the two games at their own time. Thereafter, a survey consisting of quantitative responses
      was administered. Statistical analysis were performed using Stata (version 13.1, College
      Station, TX: StataCorp LP), Fisher's exact tests were performed 2-sided at the 5%
      significance level. Qualitative feedback was obtained during individual interview.
      Suggestions for hardware or software refinements to Fun-Knee™ were collated and implemented.
      The above process was repeated for the second cohort of participants, using the latest
      version of Fun-Knee™.

    <intervention_model_description>Convenience sampling will be used. Participants will be recruited through email.
Participants will be number-coded.Participants will be guided to put on the Fun-Knee sleeve. They will perform 3 repetitions of maximal knee flexion and maximal knee extension. A delegated study team member will teach the participant to use the mobile game application that is preloaded on a provided smartphone. Thereafter, they will be given time to complete two games at their own pace, inside a quiet, conducive room. After their trial use of the Fun-Knee prototype, participants will be asked to complete a survey on their experience and impression of Fun-Knee. Following that, a few open-ended questions will be asked.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Device: Fun-Knee Portable and low cost sensors are used in the Smart Knee Sleeve. The sensor system is composed of two inclinometers and one Bluetooth transmitter.
Fun Knee™ contains total knee replacement exercises that are gamified and supported on mobile device running on Android or iOS platforms. The mobile apps is able to capture the angle a and position data from the two inclinometers on smart knee sleeve.The free-sized knee sleeve prototypes are purchased and assembled by our collaborating vendor.</description>
