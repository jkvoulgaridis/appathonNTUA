  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate functional and aesthetic outcomes of combined facial
      and upper extremity composite tissue allografts on patients who have not achieved functional
      and aesthetic outcomes with conventional reconstructive surgical strategies and prosthetic
      devices.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if an investigational surgery that transfers tissue from
      a non-living donor to a living individual will help restore greater function, appearance, and
      sensation to the face and upper extremity areas of individuals who have suffered injury to
      those areas. Upper extremity constitutes the part of the body including arm, forearm and
      hand. This procedure is called combined craniomaxillofacial and upper extremity
      allotransplantation or &quot;combined face and upper extremity transplant&quot;.

      This study will also collect data on how patients do during and after having a combined face
      and upper extremity transplant from a nonliving donor. Recovery and outcomes will be observed
      through clinical exams, x-rays, blood and tissue tests, and other associated evaluations at
      all follow up visits.

      Participants are invited to take part in this research study who have suffered severe injury
      to the face and upper extremity and previous surgeries to repair the injury have not restored
      function, appearance, and sensation. Participants must have attempted a trial of prosthetics
      (artificial upper extremity), if at all possible.

             evaluations prior to and post-transplant surgery.

          -  The subject is able to complete pre-transplant examination and screening procedures.

          -  Patient has been approved by Patient Selection Committee for placement on the
             recipient waiting list.

          -  The subject is willing to continue immunosuppression regimen as directed by treating
             physician.

          -  Subject is willing and able to return to follow-up visits as described in treatment
             plan.

          -  Subjects must have autogenous tissue options available for reconstruction in event of
             graft failure.

          -  Normal glomerular filtration rate (GFR) &gt;60.

          -  Negative pregnancy test within 48hrs of transplant for women of childbearing age and

             recipient from transplantation

          -  Serious co-morbidities

          -  Positive serology for HIV; Hepatitis B Antigen

          -  Substance abuse disorders not currently under control (as determined by the Michigan
             Alcohol Screening Test - see Appendix N.1: Subjects with a score of 3 or more will be
             excluded)

          -  Body Dysmorphic disorder (see Appendix N.2 for screening tool). Less severe
             psychiatric conditions are addressed on a case by case basis

          -  Active Severe Psychiatric Illness

          -  Cognitive limitations affecting the patient's ability to provide informed consent

          -  Recent history of medical non-adherence

          -  Unstable social situation as evidence by lack of stable housing and/or lack of a
             supportive significant other.

          -  Recent history of medical non-adherence.

             any organic neurological disorders

          -  Any other psychological status that would hinder the success or safety of the
             transplantation.

          -  Level of amputation proximal to mid-humerus: some presence of proximal muscles is
             required to motor a functioning hand.

          -  Congenital Abnormalities: co-existent absence/atrophy/agenesis of any tissue may
             affect post-transplant results

          -  History of amputation of less than six months: subject must be allowed to attempt
             prosthetic use prior to hand transplantation. This can be waived in cases where the
             recipient requires amputation/revision of the transplant site at the time of
             transplantation. However, if at all possible, it is highly encouraged that the patient
             has ruled out prosthetics as an alternative to transplantation.

          -  Blindness: blind amputees may be poor candidates because sensory return in the hand
             may not provide sufficient protective sensation

          -  Pregnancy
