      Evaluation of the combination of avelumab + bempegaldesleukin (NKTR-214 ) in locally advanced
      squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck ( metastatic SCCHN) and avelumab +
      bempegaldesleukin (NKTR-214) + talazoparib or enzalutamide in metastatic castration resistant

      Phase 1b/ Phase 2 Design

      Phase 1b will be the sequential dose-finding study.

      Once the Phase 1b component is completed, Phase 2 will be initiated to further evaluate the
      safety and anti-tumor activity across combinations of therapy.

      Combination A will enroll participants with SCCHN.

      Combination B and C will enroll participants with mCRPC
