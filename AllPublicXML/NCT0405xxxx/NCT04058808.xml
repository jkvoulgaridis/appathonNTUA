  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to look at the impact that support and motivation has on patients with
      Atrial Fibrillation's ability to lose weight and maintain this. We believe that weight loss
      has a positive impact on the reduction of symptoms of atrial fibrillation and can decrease
      the likelihood of the arrhythmia returning following cardio version.

      This study is designed for patients who have a diagnosis of Atrial Fibrillation and have a
      Body Mass Index greater than 27.

      In the study, we plan to provide support and motivation to patients with atrial fibrillation
      to encourage weight loss. There are several weight loss strategies available to follow.
      Information will be provided about each strategy to encourage informed choices. If the
      initial strategy chosen is not working, this can be change to a more suitable one as
      required. Follow up will be by telephone at 2 and 4 weeks then every month thereafter where
      you will be asked your weight and to clarify the weight loss strategy you are following. You
      will be seen at 6 and 12 months where you will have an ECG, BP check and your weight
      measured. A final telephone assessment will take place at 24 months.

      We hope that the research will in the future help patients with Atrial Fibrillation manage
      and maintain their weight loss to improve their symptoms and prevent recurrence of the
      arrhythmia. The results of this study could potentially change practice in our centre by
      providing more structured weight loss clinics for patients with Atrial Fibrillation

Each member has a specific number of points per day to use on their meals. The healthier foods have fewer points therefore you can eat more of them.</description>
