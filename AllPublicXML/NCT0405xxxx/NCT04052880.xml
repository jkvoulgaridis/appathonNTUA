    <textblock>
      This is a single center, open-label, phase 2 study in elderly (age &gt; 70) subjects with newly
      diagnosed multiple myeloma who are transplant ineligible. Subjects will receive subcutaneous
      daratumumab, dose-attenuated bortezomib, revlimid, and dexamethasone until confirmed disease
      progression, discontinuation of study treatment due to unacceptable drug toxicity, or other
      reasons. Throughout the study, subjects will be monitored closely for adverse events,
      laboratory abnormalities, and clinical response.

      This is a single center, open-label, phase 2 study in elderly (age &gt; 70) subjects with newly
      diagnosed multiple myeloma who are transplant ineligible. The main study consists of the
      following phases: a 28-day screening phase; followed by initial therapy with 12 cycles of
      daratumumab in combination with dose-attenuated VRd; and a maintenance phase that starts
      after Cycle 12 of therapy. Cycles are 28 days in length. Treatment can continue until disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. After 12 cycles of initial therapy, maintenance therapy
      will begin with 28 day cycles of daratumumab with either lenalidomide or ixazomib and the
      choice of maintenance therapy will be based on cytogenetic risk status at diagnosis. All
      subjects will continue maintenance treatment until disease progression, except maintenance
      daratumumab will be discontinued after 2 years if subjects remain on maintenance treatment at
      that time. All subjects will be followed in the longterm follow-up for at least 1 year after
      last dose of study treatment and will continue until death, withdrawal of consent for study
      participation, or the end of study definition is met. The end of study is defined as when all
      subjects have completed at least 1 year of long-term follow up and until death, withdrawal of
      consent for study participation, or 5 years after first patient begins daratumumab therapy,
      whichever occurs first.

Maintenance treatment cycles are 28 days in duration with daratumumab and either lenalidomide or ixazomib. The choice of maintenance therapy will be based on cytogenetic risk status at diagnosis. For patients with high-risk MM defined by FISH with t(4;14) only; maintenance therapy will consist of daratumumab with ixazomib. For all other patients, maintenance therapy will consist of daratumumab with lenalidomide. All subjects will continue maintenance treatment until disease progression, except maintenance daratumumab will be discontinued after 2 years if subjects remain on maintenance treatment at that time.</intervention_model_description>

However, the dexamethasone 20 mg oral or IV (only if oral is not available) dose administered as a preinfusion medication on daratumumab infusion days replaces the oral dexamethasone dose for that day. Dexamethasone will be administered until the subject experiences disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
In the maintenance phase, dexamethasone/steroid premedications may be tapered or discontinued in the absence of daratumumab related infusion reactions/based on patient tolerance. In the event of persistent daratumumab related infusion reactions, the least amount of steroid premedications needed to prevent the same may be used.</description>
