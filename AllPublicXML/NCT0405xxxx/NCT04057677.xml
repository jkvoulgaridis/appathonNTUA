    <description>Older adults with Type 2 diabetes. We are examining the muscle-specific effects of the recovery exercise program on the muscle groups of interest. We will use an exercise recovery program that has demonstrated substantial increases in quadriceps muscle size and strength in elderly people. During the first 4 weeks of recovery, participants will perform a combination of aerobic and resistance exercise training</description>

    <description>Older adults with Type 2 diabetes. Participants in the ambulatory recovery group will not receive any exercise intervention or advice on exercise.

    <intervention_name>Bed Rest Intervention</intervention_name>
    <description>The participant will remain in bed rest for 10 days. The metabolically balanced study diet will be individually formulated for each participant based on their energy needs and food preferences. Participants will maintain strict bedrest and remain flat as much as possible during bed rest; however, participants can have the head elevated to 30 degrees (by study staff) for meals. This is an intervention that has been shown by our group to produce robust reductions in lean mass in older adults</description>

    <intervention_name>Resistance Exercise Program</intervention_name>
    <description>Strength training will consist of upper and lower body exercises. Participants will participate in strength training 3 days per week (12 total sessions). Each resistance exercise will be performed with a resistance that will allow 8-10 repetitions (approximately 70-80% of 1 RM). Three sets of 8-12 repetitions of each exercise will be performed to target the major upper and lower body muscle groups after appropriate rests.</description>
