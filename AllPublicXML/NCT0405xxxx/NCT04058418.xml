  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Some women are more likely to get breast cancer as it runs in their family, they are at risk
      of familial breast cancer. There are medications, called chemoprevention, which may lower
      their risk of developing breast cancer by a third. However chemoprevention can also cause
      serious side effects, like womb cancer and blood clots. This makes decision to start them
      difficult. Researchers found that not all women who can have these medications are on them.

      The investigators want to ask familial breast cancer specialists whether they recommend
      general practitioners (GP) to prescribe chemoprevention, by sending them a short survey.
      These specialists look after women where breast cancer runs in the family. The specialists
      assess a women's chance of getting breast cancer and advice those with increased risk what
      can be done to prevent breast cancer.

      The investigators will then look at whether specialist recommendation makes a difference to
      whether GPs prescribe chemoprevention medication. This will be done by linking the
      specialists' survey response to information on GP prescribing that the government regularly
      publishes. This may help the investigators understand why chemoprevention is not used as
      often as it potentially can be.

      Phase I: Short survey of lead clinicians of familial cancer services, descriptive analysis of
      recommendations by areas of the country

      Phase II: Prescribing data analysis (using OpenPrescribing) comprising:

        1. t-test to compare the chemoprevention prescribing rate in general practices where
           chemoprevention is recommended versus not recommended;

        2. interrupted times series analysis to assess the change in the chemoprevention
           prescribing after recommendation from specialist compared with changes occurring in
           practices where chemoprevention is not recommended and

        3. panel regression across all practices, in order to distinguish the relative impacts of
           national versus local recommendation, and the change over time.

    <description>2.1. The chemoprevention prescribing rate in general practices where chemoprevention is recommended versus not recommended. The rate will be measured as the number of average daily quantities (ADQs) of chemoprevention prescribed per 1000 registered female patients aged between 35 and 74 per practice. For our primary outcome we will measure only tamoxifen items, and assess other therapies used in chemoprevention in supplementary analyses.
2.2. The change in chemoprevention prescribing rate (described in outcome 2.1) in general practices after recommendation from local specialist, compared with changes occurring in practices where chemoprevention is not recommended.
2.3. The relative change in the chemoprevention prescribing rate (described in outcome 2.1) in general practice in response to local recommendation, compared with change occurring in response to national recommendation.</description>
