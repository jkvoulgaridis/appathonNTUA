    <textblock>
      This project aims to determine whether neurofeedback augmented mindfulness intervention
      increases the plasticity in brain areas affected by exposure to early life adversity in
      youth. The study will first establish the augmented mindfulness training protocol targeting
      the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) with real-time fMRI neurofeedback for use with healthy
      control and ELA-exposed youth. Next, in addition to ongoing data collection with healthy
      controls, ELA-exposed youth will be randomly assigned to either complete the neurofeedback
      augmented mindfulness training (AMT) or sham condition protocol. Effect of augmented
      mindfulness training on state measures of mindfulness, perceived stress, and affect will be
      examined.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Early life adversity (ELA) is a major public health crisis that results in significant
      disruptions in neurobiological processes and long-term psychiatric and health consequences,
      yet very little is known about interventions that may prevent them and the optimal time to do
      so. Not only is ELA associated with earlier onset and greater severity and comorbidity of
      depression, anxiety, and substance abuse, these individuals also evidence significantly
      poorer responses to psychological and pharmacological interventions when treated for these
      conditions. Consequently, there is a dire need to develop preventive interventions that
      target individuals with ELA exposure. The first step in this process is to establish
      malleability of neural mechanisms disrupted by ELA exposure to acute interventions. We use
      augmented mindfulness training, that is, a standard mindfulness training combined with
      real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging neurofeedback (rtfMRI-nf) to influence and
      increase the plasticity of brain areas affected by ELA, in turn affecting state changes in
      symptoms in youth with ELA exposure. These fMRI tasks are designed to engage the PCC and
      mindfulness practice.

      Over the course of three years, 120 eligible youth with early life adversity or healthy
      controls will be recruited into the study. All healthy controls will receive AMT, and
      ELA-exposed youth will be randomly assigned to AMT, consisting of real-time fMRI with
      neurofeedback during mindfulness practice, or Sham, consisting of artificially calculated
      neurofeedback signals during mindfulness practice. Adolescents will complete self-report
      measures to assess state affective symptoms before and after receiving mindfulness training
      and scanning, and again one week later.

    <measure>State Mindfulness Scale (SMS) scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion (average: 2 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The SMS is a 21-item measure rated on a 5-point Likert scale (not at all - very well). Items may be summed or averaged, with greater scores indicating greater levels of state mindfulness. SMS scores will evidence a greater increase from pre- to post-training and 1-week follow-up in the AMT relative to the Sham group.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion (average: 2 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The PSS is a 10 item measure on a 5-point Likert scale (never - very often), with 4 items reverse scaled. Items are summed, with greater scores indicating greater levels of perceived stress. PSS scores will evidence a greater decrease from pre- to post-training and 1-week follow-up in AMT relative to the Sham group.</description>

    <measure>Positive and Negative Affect Schedule for Children (PANAS-C) scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion (average: 2 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The PANAS-C assesses domains of positive and negative affect on a 5-point Likert scale (not much or not at all - a lot) with 30 items. Scores for each domain are summed, with greater scores indicating greater levels of its respective affective domain. PANAS-C scores will evidence a greater change from pre- to post-training and 1-week follow-up in AMT relative to the Sham group.</description>
