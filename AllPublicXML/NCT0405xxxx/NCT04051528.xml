  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of this study are to: (1) determine the effects of combinatorial training
      (i.e. combinatory of aerobic exercise with cognitive training and guiding training) vs. the
      sequential training (i.e. a combination of aerobatic exercise with cognitive training) on
      cognitive function, physical function, and daily function/participation and psychological
      function in persons with cognitive impairments post Traumatic brain injury (TBI); (2)
      determine the long-term effects of these two types of interventions on these outcome
      measures.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cognitive deficits and dysfunction in daily participation are common in patients with
      traumatic brain injury. Previous studies have reported positive effects on cognitive function
      after computerized cognitive training, aerobic exercise, or a combination of the two,
      however, the effects are variable and hardly be transferred to enhance daily participation.
      It is thus still inconclusive that which types of interventions are better for cognitive
      remediation and daily participation in patients post traumatic brain injury. Several
      pioneering studies used guided training for patients with brain injury to acquire
      problem-solving skills, improve life function and promote participation. After the training,
      the effect lasted for six months. However, due to insufficient research samples, it was
      inferior in generalizability.

      In the present project, the investigators design an innovative combinatorial training that
      composites of guided training, computerized cognitive training, and aerobic exercise. The
      investigators expected that this combinatorial training not only improve cognitive ability
      but also facilitate daily participation in patients with traumatic brain injury. The
      investigators plan to recruit 50 patients with traumatic brain injury who have cognitive
      deficits and will assign them randomly into two groups: sequential training group, and
      combinatorial training group.

      There will compare the immediate effects and long-term effects of combinatorial training and
      combined training (computerized cognitive training plus aerobic exercise) on cognitive
      function and daily function/participation and psychological function of persons with
      traumatic brain injury.

    <measure>Change scores of Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, post test immediately after completing 16 intervention sessions (around 8 weeks after baseline), follow up test (6 months after completing intervention sessions)</time_frame>
    <description>The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) will be used to assess general cognitive functions. It examines several cognitive domains with a total score of 30 and higher values indicate better cognitive functions. The MoCA has been shown to be a valid and promising tool to evaluate the global cognitive function in patients with stroke. The psychometric properties of MoCA are good to excellent for patients with cerebrovascular diseases.</description>

    <measure>Change scores of Stroop Color-Word test</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, post test immediately after completing 16 intervention sessions (around 8 weeks after baseline), follow up test (6 months after completing intervention sessions)</time_frame>
    <description>The Stroop Color-Word test assesses the abilities of selective attention, inhibition and executive function. The participants will be tested under congruent and incongruent conditions. In the congruent condition, the participant will name the color ink of a word which is consistent with the written color name; whereas in the incongruent condition the participant will name the color ink differs from the written color name. In both conditions, the number of colors correctly named within 45 seconds will be measured and the performance in the congruent condition will be compared with the incongruent condition (Quaney et al., 2009).</description>

    <measure>Change scores of Trail Making Test (TMT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, post test immediately after completing 16 intervention sessions (around 8 weeks after baseline), follow up test (6 months after completing intervention sessions)</time_frame>
    <description>The TMT is a neuropsychological test of visual attention and task switching. It consists of two parts (TMT-A and TMT- B) in which the subject is instructed to connect a set of 25 dots as quickly as possible while still maintaining accuracy. The Chinese version of the TMT has been suggested to be a reliable instrument for measuring executive function among older adults. The scores for both TMT A and B are reported as the number of seconds required to complete the task. According to the TMT directions for administration, an average score for the TMT Part A is 29 seconds and a deficient score is greater than 78 seconds. For the TMT Part B, an average score is 75 seconds and a deficient score is greater than 273 seconds. Therefore, higher scores reveal greater impairment.</description>

    <measure>Change scores of Berg Balance Scale (BBS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, post test immediately after completing 16 intervention sessions (around 8 weeks after baseline), follow up test (6 months after completing intervention sessions)</time_frame>
    <description>The Berg balance scale is a test of a person's static and dynamic balance abilities. This scale comprises a set of 14 simple balance related tasks, ranging from standing up from a sitting position, to standing on one foot. The degree of success in completing each task is given a score of zero (unable) to four (independent), and the final measure is the sum of all scores. The range of score is 0-56 and a below average score indicates a high risk for falls. Excellent test-retest reliability has been reported in acquired brain injury.</description>

    <measure>Change scores of Functional Independence Measure (FIM)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, post test immediately after completing 16 intervention sessions (around 8 weeks after baseline), follow up test (6 months after completing intervention sessions)</time_frame>
    <description>The FIM assesses the dependence level of individuals with stroke to perform 18 activities (13 motor and five cognitive tasks) in daily living. The score ranges from 18 to 126 and higher scores demonstrate greater independent participation in daily activities (Ottenbacher, Hsu, Granger, &amp; Fiedler, 1996). The FIM has good interrater reliability and validity (Hsueh, Lin, Jeng, &amp; Hsieh, 2002).</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, post test immediately after completing 16 intervention sessions (around 8 weeks after baseline), follow up test (6 months after completing intervention sessions)</time_frame>
    <description>The AM-PAC assess difficulties in daily participation with 58 items containing the following aspects: physical functioning, self-care, daily routine, communication, and interpersonal interaction. The items and scoring system are adopted from the ICF framework. The AM-PAC has adequate reliability and validity. There are three specific functional domains: basic mobility(score range=18-72), daily activity(score range=15-60) and applied cognitive(score range=19-76). For each subtest, a higher score indicates better performance.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change scores of Participation Measure-3 Domains, 4 Dimensions (PM-3D4D)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, post test immediately after completing 16 intervention sessions (around 8 weeks after baseline), follow up test (6 months after completing intervention sessions)</time_frame>
    <description>The PM-3D4D includes 24 items measuring participation in productivity(6 items), social(12 items), and community(6 items) domains across 4 dimensions: diversity of participation(Y/N), frequency of participation(0-6), desire for change(Y/N), and difficulty in participation(1-4). The score of diversity of participation is percent of the number of items in which a person answered yes divided by the total number of items within each domain. The score of frequency of participation is sum of the ratings divided by the total number of items within each domain. The score of desire for change is percent of the number of items in which a person answered yes divided by the total number of items within each domain. The score of difficulty in participation is total score within each domain. The PM-3D4D has been shown adequate reliability and validity in rehabilitation patients.</description>

    <measure>Change scores of Goal Attainment Scaling (GAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, post test immediately after completing 16 intervention sessions (around 8 weeks after baseline), follow up test (6 months after completing intervention sessions)</time_frame>
    <description>The GAS assesses the extent to which patient's individual goals are achieved in the course of intervention. The GAS has been shown responsive to the change in cognitive rehabilitation. It used to quantify the extent to which treatment goals were achieved. Individual goals were evaluated in a standardized way, using predefined levels of achievement based on current and expected performance. A 5-point Goal Attainment Scale was used: the baseline level (-2), partial achievement (-1), the expected level of achievement (0), small better than expected levels (1), remarkably better than expected levels(2).</description>
