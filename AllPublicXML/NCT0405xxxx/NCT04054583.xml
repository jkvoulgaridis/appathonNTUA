      A long-term care facility in central Canada has planned to renovate their existing dementia
      care units. The overarching objective of this study is to examine the effects of the
      renovations on residents, family, and staff.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A long-term care facility in central Canada is renovating their existing dementia care units,
      which accommodates 60 residents with intermediate and advanced stages of dementia. The
      primary features of the renovation include physical upgrades and the addition of a large
      u-shaped activity pavilion. The overarching objective of this study is to examine the effects
      of these design transformations in the facility and grounds on residents, family, and staff.
      The overall project will address the following questions:

        -  How does the long-term care unit renovation affect the health outcomes, quality of life,
           and lived experiences of residents?

        -  What are the effects of the long-term care unit renovation on care staff and family
           members?

        -  What aspects of the transformation were responsible for observed changes? And what
           aspects worked or did not?

      A multi-component, mixed-methods (qualitative and quantitative) research plan will be used in
      this project. Personal (resident, families, staff) and environmental variables (social
      interactions, implementation and use of technology and physical space) will be assessed
      pre-renovation (spring/summer 2017) and post-renovation (summer 2019 and 2020). With this
      mixed-methods research plan, wthe investigators will gain valuable information about the
      renovation that will be important for long term care facilities.

    <measure>Satisfaction of Space on Resident Quality of Life and Family Interactions from Pre- to Post-renovation from Family Perspective Using Photovoice and Photo Elicitation</measure>
    <time_frame>Perspectives taken a pre- and post-renovation (approximately 2 years later or whenever renovations are complete).</time_frame>
    <description>Family member's perspective regarding whether the renovations have had an effect on the resident's quality of life and the quality of their family's interactions with the resident. This will be gathered using photovoice (participant taken photos) and photo elicitation (researcher taken photos). In this method, both photo types will be discussed in one interview at pre- and one interview at post-renovation to gather impressions of the space and its impact on resident quality of life and family interactions. This is a qualitative research method. It will assess impressions at pre-renovations and at post-renovations.</description>

    <description>Staff perspective of how the space is used and functions before and after renovations. This survey measures variables such as overall environmental satisfaction, including satisfaction with acoustics, lighting, indoor air quality, and thermal comfort. Participants are also asked to provide descriptions of personal workspace, window proximity and workstation tenure, job satisfaction and demand, and method of working/time allocation. This survey has demonstrated reliability (Cronbach's alpha=0.728 to 0.873) and validity when compared with physical environment measures. There are no sub-scales. Each question will be evaluated independently.</description>

    <time_frame>Data will be taken pre- and post-renovation (approximately 2 years later or whenever renovations are complete). The QUALID takes approximately 10 minutes to complete whereas DCM occurs over 2 days.</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of Life in Late stage Dementia (QUALID) questionnaire total score will be compared before and after renovations. The QUALID is completed by family who have visited a resident at least three of the last seven days. This is an 11-item interview that asks a family member or caregiver to rate how often a specific resident exhibits behaviours associated with quality of life (e.g., smiling, enjoying a meal). A 5-point scale captures the frequency of each item (total score ranging from 11 to 55). Lower scores reflected a higher quality of life (QOL). This interview takes 5-10 minutes to complete for each resident for whom we have consent/assent.</description>

    <measure>Changes in the Quality of Life of Residents: Dementia Care Mapping</measure>
    <time_frame>Data will be taken pre- and post-renovation (approximately 2 years later or whenever renovations are complete). The QUALID takes approximately 10 minutes to complete whereas DCM occurs over 2 days.</time_frame>
    <description>Dementia Care Mapping (DCM) involves observing residents over several hours. The goal of this assessment is to collect in-depth data regarding resident's behaviours and use of space/time during a discrete time period. Mapping takes place using a designated instrument by a certified mapper, and in communal care and living spaces. One to twenty four different domains are tracked that can be said to account for a high level or a low level of well-being or quality of life. Observations of family members may also occur for those who have provided consent. Observational data will be entered into a computer program that provides profiles of residents' mood, engagement and well-being. This provides a useful index of the relative well-being or detriments that affect an individual in a given space and given specific relational and care activities.</description>
