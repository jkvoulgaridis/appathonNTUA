      1. The safety and tolerability of single-dose of SCB-313 will be evaluated by
           intraperitoneal injection;

        2. The safety and tolerability of repeated-dose of SCB-313 will be evaluated by
           intraperitoneal injection once a day for 3 days, and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of
           SCB-313 will be determined;

               1. if tumor cells are detectable in the ascites ,

               2. if previous surgical operation reveals extensive abdominal cavity metastasis,

               3. if there is image evidence of extensive metastasis in the abdominal cavity,

               4. if it is determined by ascites routine and ascites biochemical examination as
                  exudate.

          3. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status: 0 to 3.

             of normal (ULN), (c) Absolute neutrophil count ≥1.5×109/L, and (d) Hemoglobin ≥ 9
             g/dL.

          8. Adequate renal function, defined as serum creatinine ≤ 2.0 times ULN and creatinine
             clearance &gt; 50 mL/minute.

             aminotransferase ≤ 3 times ULN for patients without liver metastases, or ≤ 5 times ULN
             in the presence of liver metastases, and (b) Bilirubin ≤ 2.0 times ULN, unless patient
             has known Gilberts syndrome.

         10. Albumin ≥ 2.8 g / dL (patient can use albumin to meet the standard)
