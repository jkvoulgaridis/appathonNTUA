  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase Ib trial studies the best dose of M6620 when given together with the usual
      treatment (radiation therapy) in treating patients with triple negative or estrogen receptor
      and/or progesterone receptor positive, HER-2 negative breast cancer. M6620 may stop the
      growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Radiation
      therapy uses high energy rays to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. Giving M6620 and
      radiation therapy may kill tumor cells more effectively than radiation alone or shrink or
      stabilize breast cancer for longer than radiation therapy alone.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To determine the recommended phase 2 dose of twice weekly berzosertib (M6620) administered
      concurrently with conventionally fractionated radiation therapy (RT) to the breast/chest wall
      and regional nodes.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe the nature of toxicity that develops when an ATR inhibitor is administered
      concurrently with RT for breast cancer using provider assessments.

      II. To assess long-term locoregional control, disease-free survival, distant disease-free
      survival, and overall survival of patients treated with this approach.

      III. To explore symptomatic adverse events and tolerability of M6620 being administered
      concurrently with RT using patient-reported outcomes (PROs).

      IV. To assess for germline and somatic alterations in deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage
      response and repair genes, including effectors and regulators of homologous recombination
      (HR), in pre-chemotherapy biopsy specimens and post-chemotherapy surgical resection specimens
      using whole exome sequencing (WES), and to correlate HR deficiency with disease-free
      survival.

      V. To identify somatic alterations in circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) at baseline,
      mid-treatment, end-of-treatment, and follow-up and to correlate cfDNA with disease-free
      survival.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare the baseline and post-treatment skin microbiome and make exploratory
      correlations with severe provider and patient-reported toxicity.

      II. To assess for germline DNA repair alterations and correlate with severe provider and
      patient-reported toxicity.

      III. To explore dose-volume parameters associated with acute and late toxicity provider and
      patient-reported toxicity following M6620 administration concurrent with RT.

      IV. To identify circulating tumor cell (CTC) positivity at baseline, mid-treatment,
      end-of-treatment, and follow-up and to correlate CTC positivity or the combination of CTC
      positivity and cfDNA with disease-free survival.

      V. To evaluate pre-treatment and post-treatment differential abundance of peripheral blood
      immune cell populations identified by cytometry by time-of flight (CyTOF).

      VI. To evaluate associations of the pre-treatment and post-treatment peripheral blood immune
      phenotype (as assessed by CyTOF) with disease-free survival, distant disease-free survival
      and overall survival.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of berzosertib.

      Patients receive berzosertib intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes twice weekly (BIW) for 5
      weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also undergo
      RT 5 days a week for 5-6 weeks depending on the type of surgery undergone.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up weekly for 4 weeks, at 12
      months, then yearly for up to 3 years.

               -  Negative urine or serum pregnancy test for individuals of childbearing potential.
                  Note: The effects of M6620 (VX-970) on the developing human fetus are unknown.
                  For this reason and because DNA-damage repair inhibitors as well as radiation
                  used in this trial are known to be teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential
                  and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of
                  birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study
                  participation, and for 6 months after completion of M6620 administration. Should
                  a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is
                  participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician
                  immediately. Men treated or enrolled on this protocol must also agree to use
                  adequate contraception prior to the study, for the duration of study
                  participation, and 6 months after completion of M6620 (VX-970) administration

               -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent
                  document

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have had chemotherapy within 4 weeks prior to entering the study

          -  Prior RT to the ipsilateral chest wall or ipsilateral breast or thorax. Individuals
             with prior RT to the contralateral breast or chest wall are eligible

          -  Patients who have not recovered from adverse events due to prior anti-cancer therapy
             (i.e., have residual toxicities &gt; grade 1) with the exception of alopecia and grade
             1-2 taxane-induced neuropathy which will be permitted

          -  Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents or concomitant
             anti-neoplastic treatment, except endocrine therapies and bisphosphonates which are
             permitted without restriction even during protocol treatment

          -  Patients with definitive clinical or radiologic evidence of metastatic disease, as
             documented by the treating institution

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to M6620 (VX-970)

          -  M6620 is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4; therefore, concomitant administration with
             strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin,
             ritonavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, and saquinavir) or inducers of CYP3A4 (e.g.,
             rifampin, phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, St. John's wort) should be avoided.
             Patients requiring any medications or substances that are strong inhibitors or
             inducers of CYP3A during the course of the study and for 14 days prior to enrollment
             are ineligible. Because the lists of these agents are constantly changing, it is
             important to regularly consult a frequently-updated medical reference. As part of the
             enrollment/informed consent procedures, the patient will be counseled on the risk of
             interactions with other agents, and what to do if new medications need to be
             prescribed or if the patient is considering a new over-the-counter medicine or herbal
             product

          -  Patients with uncontrolled intercurrent illness. This includes but is not limited to,
             ongoing uncontrolled serious infection requiring IV antibiotics at the time of
             registration, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris,
             symptomatic/uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations
             that would limit compliance with study requirements.

          -  Active systemic lupus, scleroderma, or dermatomyositis with a CPK level above normal

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because M6620 as a DNA damage repair
             inhibitor may have the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient. Because there is an
             unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to
             treatment of the mother with M6620, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother
             is treated with M6620

          -  Patients with known hereditary syndromes predisposing to radiosensitivity such as Li
             Fraumeni syndrome and ataxia telangiectasia are excluded from the study. Patients with
             mutations in breast cancer predisposition genes such as BRCA1, BRCA2, PALB2, CHEK2,
             and ATM are eligible

          -  Patients with a prior or concurrent malignancy, excluding non-melanoma skin cancers
             and non-invasive cancers whose natural history or treatment does not have the
             potential to interfere with the safety or efficacy assessment of the investigational
             regimen
