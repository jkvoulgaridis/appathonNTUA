  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is the first line therapy for Obstructive Sleep
      Apnea Syndrome (OSAS) but has limited impact for reducing cardio-metabolic risk.

      Combined treatment strategies including physical activity and weight loss management have
      emerged in association with CPAP. Patient's engagement might be supported by connected
      devices and smartphone applications measuring physical activity, blood pressure, weight and
      sleep duration. Data fusion of these parameters with CPAP-remote telemonitoring will allow
      personalized coaching and integrated care of OSAS with cardio-metabolic co-morbidities.

      &quot;SLEEPCONNECT&quot; is a prospective multicenter observational study with:

        -  Evaluation of the impact of multimodal remote monitoring using connected devices and a
           dedicated smartphone application on the control of blood pressure after 3 months of
           CPAP.

        -  Evaluation of impact of such an integrated care on physical activity and body weight

      This study is supported by the S.BOXTM CPAP device and its companion connected devices
      (physical activity, blood pressure, sleep duration, weight) and smartphone application
      collecting CPAP telemonitoring and assessing patients reported outcomes (PROMs). Patients
      have a continuous access to their own data.

      Digital health system will be complemented by physical activity and nutrition coaching.
      Coaching persons will be inform during the follow-up by data collected by connected devices
      and app.
