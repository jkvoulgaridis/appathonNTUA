      This is a multi-site, open-label gluten challenge study to characterize peripheral blood and
      intestinal gluten specific CD4+ T cell subsets in participants with celiac disease (CeD).
      Participants will receive 8 grams (g) of gluten daily for 13 consecutive days. Blood samples
      will be taken at pre-dose, Day 6, and Day 14. Duodenal biopsy samples will also be collected
      on Day 14. Participants will also complete a symptom diary.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Participant must have documented diagnosis with celiac disease (CeD) by
             duodenal/jejunal biopsy at least 6 months prior to entrance into the study.

          2. Participant must be on a gluten-free diet (GFD) for at least the past 12 months.

          3. Female participants must not be a woman of childbearing potential (WOCBP), pregnant or
             breastfeeding

          4. Must be Human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DQ2.5 positive, assessed at screening. If
             participants have already been genotyped, results from previous testing may be used in
             lieu of genotyping at screening.

          5. Has anti-tissue transglutaminase (anti-tTG) &lt;2x upper limit of normal (ULN) as
             measured by serology.

          6. Be judged to be in good health based on medical history, physical examination
             (including a targeted neurological exam), versus (vs.) measurements and
             electrocardiogram (ECG) performed prior to treatment allocation.

          7. Have a body mass index (BMI) 18-35 kg/m2, inclusive.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Has any chronic active gastrointestinal (GI) disease (eg, clinically active CeD
             despite being on GFD for past 12 months, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis,
             lymphocytic colitis). Inactive, stable/well-treated lactose intolerance, Fermentable

          5. Has a history of significant multiple and/or severe allergies (eg, food, drug, latex
             allergy), or has had an anaphylactic reaction or systemic allergic reaction to
             prescription or nonprescription drugs or food.

          6. Subject has a history of severe acute symptomatic reactions to sporadic gluten
             ingestion.

          7. Is positive for hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis C antibodies or human
             immunodeficiency virus (HIV).

          8. Had major surgery, donated or lost 1 unit of blood (approximately 500 mL) within 4
             weeks prior to the prestudy (screening) visit.

          9. Is on Coumadin™ or other anticoagulants.

         10. Is unable to refrain from or anticipates the use of systemic anti-inflammatory,
             immunosuppressive, or immunomodulatory medications, which may include ibuprofen &gt; 2400
             mg/day, naproxen &gt;750 mg/day, prednisone &gt;10 mg/day, or methylprednisolone &gt; 8 mg/day,
             within 48 hours prior to the start of and throughout the entire gluten challenge.

         11. Has participated in another investigational study within 4 weeks (or 5 half-lives,
             whichever is greater) prior to the prestudy (screening) visit. The window will be
             derived from the date of the last visit in the previous study.

         12. Has a corrected QT (QTc) interval ≥470 msec (for males) or ≥480 msec (for females).
