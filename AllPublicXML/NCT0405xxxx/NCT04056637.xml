  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess the impact of providing medication abortion-seeking clients a choice
      for follow-up in practice. Clients presenting at or less than 63 days pregnant (based on last
      menstrual period) at the study site for first trimester medication abortion will be invited
      to participate. We hypothesize that providing clients with flexible follow-up options will
      improve follow-up rates.

      This study is not to assess efficacy or safety of follow-up methods--that has been well
      established in practice and research. This is to assess choice of follow-up.

    <description>The Multi-level pregnancy test (MLPT) strategy involves the use of the MLPT to estimate a pregnant person's baseline hCG range prior to beginning their abortion (i.e. prior to mifepristone administration). A follow-up test is then administered one week later to again estimate the woman's hCG range. A decline in hCG range reliably signifies absence of an ongoing pregnancy. Among clients â‰¤63 days' LMP at initiation of treatment, this strategy has shown to be highly effective: 100% of clients (n=1487/1487) with a decline in hCG range did not have an ongoing pregnancy and 100% of clients (n=21/21) with an ongoing pregnancy showed steady or increase in hCG range on their follow-up MLPT.</description>
