  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to prospectively obtain reliable data on the bleeding and
      treatment pattern of patients with VWD undergoing on-demand treatment with a VWF-containing
      product over a period of 6 months. The data obtained will be used as a basis for historical
      comparisons with the bleeding and treatment pattern obtained from a clinical study on the
      efficacy of prophylactic treatment with a VWF/FVIII concentrate.

    <measure>Total annualized bleeding rate (TABR)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The total annualized bleeding rate (TABR) will be calculated as the total number of spontaneous bleeds, traumatic BEs, menstrual BEs of major severity, and other BEs occurring in the time period between the start of data collection for each patient and the Study Completion Visit, divided by the duration (in years) between the start of data collection and the Study Completion Visit. Surgery periods, and BEs occurring within these surgery periods, will be excluded from the calculation of TABR.</description>

    <measure>Effectiveness of VWF-containing product in the treatment of Bleeding Events (BEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Effectiveness of VWF-containing product in the treatment of BEs based on the proportion of BE's successfully treated. Treatment efficacy will be assessed at the end of a BE by the patient using predefined criteria of 'Excellent', 'Good', 'Moderate' or 'None'. All effectiveness ratings assessed as either &quot;excellent&quot; or &quot;good&quot; will be considered &quot;successfully treated&quot;.</description>

    <measure>Effectiveness of VWF-containing product in surgical prophylaxis</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Effectiveness of VWF-containing product in surgical prophylaxis based on the proportion of surgeries successfully treated. Overall treatment efficacy will be assessed at the end of the postoperative period by the treating physician using predefined criteria of 'Excellent', 'Good', 'Moderate/Poor' or 'None'. All effectiveness ratings assessed as either &quot;excellent&quot; or &quot;good&quot; will be considered &quot;successfully treated&quot; surgeries.</description>

    <measure>Quality of Life (QoL) assessed using the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS-29)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>QoL assessment based on the results from the PROMIS-29 survey to monitor and evaluate the physical, mental, and social health in all patients, using a scale of a minimum score of 0 and a maximum score of 10. The survey covers seven domains from the most relevant areas of self-reported health (depression, anxiety, physical function, pain interference, fatigue, sleep disturbance and ability to participate in social roles and activities) for the majority of people with chronic illness.</description>

    <measure>Quality of Life (QoL) assessed using a 36-Item Short Form Health Survey, version 2 (SF-36v2)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>QoL assessment based on the results from the SF-36v2 questionnaire to measure functional health and well-being in patients ≥16 years. SF-36v2 ranks 8 different domains using a scale standardized with a scoring algorithm to obtain a score ranging from 0 to 100.The eight health domains include physical functioning (PF), role physical (RP), bodily pain (BP), general health problems (GH), vitality (VT), social functioning (SF), role emotional (RE) and general mental health (MH). Higher scores indicate better health status, and a mean score of 50 has been articulated as a normative value for all scales.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of Life (QoL) assessed using a 10-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-10)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>QoL assessment based on the results from a SF-10 parent-completed questionnaire for patients ≥5.5 and &lt;16 years of age, in order to score physical and psychosocial health. SF-10 uses norm-based scoring where scales have a standardized mean value of 50 and standard deviation of 10.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Joint health status assessed using Hemophilia Joint Health Score (HJHS)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Joint health status will be assessed using the Hemophilia Joint Health Score (HJHS), which has been specifically validated for the assessment of the clinical outcome in VWD. HJHS evaluates six index joints to produce a score between 0-124. Higher scores indicate worse joint health.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Menstrual bleeding assessed using Pictorial Blood Loss Assessment Chart (PBAC) score</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Bleeding information from each menstrual period while in this study will be collected using the Pictorial Blood Loss Assessment Chart (PBAC). The PBAC will be provided to all female patients of child-bearing potential. The data documented in the PBAC and the investigator-calculated final score will be recorded in the eCRF. The PBAC score is from 0 onwards, with a score of &gt;100 defining abnormal coagulation and heavy menstrual bleeding (&gt;80ml of blood loss per menstrual cycle).</description>
