    <textblock>
      Despite recent pharmacological and technological advantages, hypoglycemia remains to be the
      key limiting factor in achieving optimal glycemic control in people with type 1 diabetes.
      State-of-the-art treatment for type 1 diabetes is insulin in pens or pumps that focus on
      reducing hyperglycemia after relative insulin deficiency e.g. after food intake. In recent
      years, we focused on adding low-dose glucagon to insulin therapies for the treatment and
      prevention of hypoglycemia - referred to as &quot;dual-hormone treatment&quot;. We have shown that
      low-dose glucagon is efficient in treating mild hypoglycemia and that several factors may
      affect its glucose response. Our next step is to test whether the combined delivery of
      insulin and glucagon can improve glucose control in individuals with type 1 diabetes. In this
      proposal, we want to test the efficacy, safety and feasibility of a dual-hormone closed-loop
      system, also known as an artificial pancreas. The closed-loop system involves automatic
      infusion of glucagon and insulin based on continuous glucose measurements. The system will be
      tested in a 33-hour in-clinic study comparing the glucose control by the combined automatic
      delivery of insulin and glucagon with the automatic delivery of insulin-only. The study is
      performed at Steno Diabetes Center Copenhagen (SDCC) in collaboration with the Technical
      University of Denmark (DTU). We expect that the study will clarify whether low-dose glucagon
      added to insulin therapy can improve the glucose control in adults with type 1 diabetes. We
      believe that the utilization of glucagon will allow for a weight neutral optimization of
      glucose control, reduce risk of hypoglycemia and reduce disease burden that will reduce
      diabetes complications and cardiovascular diseases.

      Rationale: We hypothesize that our newly developed dual-hormone insulin-glucagon closed-loop
      system (DCL) is safe, efficient and superior to our single-hormone insulin-only closed-loop
      system (SCL). The study aims to compare the glucose control achieved by DCL with our SCL.

      Design: A randomized single-blinded placebo-controlled cross-over 33-hour in-clinic study of
      glucose control achieved with DCL versus SCL in adults and adolescents with type 1 diabetes.

      Participants: 13 insulin-pump treated T1D participants will be included, if they are 15-80
      years old, have T1D for ≥ 3 years, use insulin pumps with FiAsp®, and have an HbA1c≤ 8.5% (69
      mmol/mol).

      Procedures: In this two-phase study 1) we test the operability of our closed-loop systems and
      2) compare glucose control by DCL with SCL. The two studies are identical except for the
      blinding procedures. In the first phase (pilot study), four participants are included, and
      the glucagon/saline pump is not masked. In the second phase (main study), 13 participants are
      included, and are as well as the investigators blinded for the content in the glucagon/saline
      pump.

      Two days prior to study visit, a CGM (Dexcom® G6) is place on the participant's abdomen. At
      study visits, participants arrive in the evening at our research unit and get their insulin
      pump disconnected. Two study pumps (Dana Diabecare RS®, SOOIL) are attached: one pump infuses
      insulin (FiAsp®, Novo Nordisk) and the other infuses either glucagon (GlucaGen®, Novo
      Nordisk) or saline. Once a sampling cannula is placed in an antecubital vein, the study is
      initiated and the closed-loop system (DCL vs SCL) takes over the glucose control for the next
      33 hours. Except from the control algorithm (SCL vs DCL), the study days are identical.
      Participants can move around freely in the clinic for 33 hours but will perform a 45-min
      moderate (50% VO2max) exercise session, consume three meals with variant carbohydrate
      content, and sleep during two overnight periods. Participants will be monitored frequently
      with blood samples (drawn from the antecubital vein), blood pressure, pulse, and VAS scale
      for nausea.
