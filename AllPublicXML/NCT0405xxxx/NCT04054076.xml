  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A combination of diabetes and neuropathy can cause an altered gait, increased tissue
      stiffness, limited joint mobility, muscle weakness, foot deformities, thus leading to
      excessive plantar pressure. The presence of an increased plantar pressure and the loss of
      sensation is a serious risk factor in the risk of development of diabetic foot ulcers (DFU).
      Therefore, appropriate shoes and insoles are recommended to redistribute high peak pressure
      (PP) and reduce pressure time integral (PTI) . Shoe modifications and insoles, when used, is
      effective to prevent the recurrence of plantar ulcer.

      The primary aim of the study was to: explore gait characteristics, kinetics and kinematics in
      a cohort of patients diagnosed with diabetes, with and without neuropathy, assigned to use
      different types of insoles. The second aim was to assess the relation between gait
      characteristics, kinetics and kinematics to high plantar PP and PTI. The third aim was to
      compare gait characteristics, kinetics and kinematics of patients with diabetes and healthy
      controls.

      A combination of diabetes and neuropathy can cause an altered gait, increased tissue
      stiffness, limited joint mobility, muscle weakness, foot deformities, thus leading to
      excessive plantar pressure . The presence of an increased plantar pressure and the loss of
      sensation is a serious risk factor in the risk of development of diabetic foot ulcers (DFU).
      Therefore, appropriate shoes and insoles are recommended to redistribute high peak pressure
      (PP) and reduce pressure time integral (PTI). Shoe modifications and insoles, when used, is
      effective to prevent the recurrence of plantar ulcer.

      Patients presenting with mild or absence of neuropathy have lower PP compared to those having
      more severe stages of neuropathy. However, these findings are not unambiguous. In a study
      patients walked in a standardize speed of 1.2 m/s, and it was only under the first metatarsal
      phalangeal joint that the group with neuropathy had higher PP compared to patients with
      diabetes without neuropathy. In the remaining parts of the foot sole, there was no
      difference. In a study comparing custom-made insoles and prefabricated insoles used in a
      walking shoe, a cohort of patients with no history of foot ulcers was studied and there were
      no differences in PP for the sub groups with and without neuropathy.

      More knowledge is needed regarding risk factors such as neuropathy, gait deviation and
      differences in kinematics and kinetics in order to prevent the onset of the &quot;first&quot; plantar
      ulcer.

    <intervention_model_description>This study is a 10 year follow-up of an original randomized clinical trial (RCT) study (n= 114 patients) with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. The participants were referred to the department of Prosthetics &amp; Orthotics (DPO) at Sahlgrenska University Hospital and were randomised to: 1) use prefabricated insoles, 2) soft custom-made insoles or 3) hard custom-made insoles. The groups were followed 2 years with follow-ups every 6 months. Data regarding plantar pressure, gait characteristics, kinetics and kinematics and presence of risk factors will be collected 10 years after inclusions. Comparisons will be made with a group of patients with diabetes being first times visitors to the Department of Prosthetics &amp; Orthotics.</intervention_model_description>
