  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Thyroid carcinoma on struma ovarii (TCSO) is a rare ovarian tumor, derivate from monodermic
      teratomas. It represents about 0.01% of overall ovarian tumours, and 5 to 10% of struma
      ovarii. The diagnosis is histologic and retrospective after pelvic surgery. Because of its
      rarity, the treatment of TCSO is not consensual and should be validated in multidisciplinary
      team involved in rare ovarian carcinoma. TCSO should be taken care of as a thyroid carcinoma,
      in case of relapse, with systemic treatment, as tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), without any
      clinical trial proving this benefit. Indeed, molecular profiles and genomic expression is
      unknown, because of studies with few patients (less than 10) contrary to thyroid carcinomas
      with the TCGA genomic classification. The study purposes are the outcome of the patients
      after the first treatment and the comparison of the genomic profil in next generation
      sequencing (NGS) with TCGA thyroid carcinoma profile. Thus, the treatment could be tailored,
      confirming the same therapy as in thyroid carcinoma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a retrospective cohort with collection of tissues samples (FFPE or frozen), including
      female patients &gt;18-year-old treated in French between 2009 and 2016 for a thyroid carcinoma
      on struma ovarii. Clinical data and tissues will be centralized for assessment. One of the
      endpoint is the description of the population (such as baseline clinical and pathologist
      characteristics, first treatment, survival, treatment relapse) ; the other endpoint is the
      comparison between the genomic profile of the tumor tissues obtained in NGS and those of the
      thyroid carcinomas obtained from the TCGA.
