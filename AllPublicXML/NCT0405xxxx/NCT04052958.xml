  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For some diseases, regular respiratory muscle training could delay the start of ventilation.
      For DM1, however, there are no clinically high-quality studies. Only a case description from
      the year 2006 showed a missing improvement of the symptoms after respiratory muscle training
      in one patient, accordingly there are no recommendations in this issue. Within the scope of
      this monocentric, three-arm, controlled intervention study, 45 patients with genetically
      confirmed type 1 myotonic dystrophy will be randomized in three groups of 15 patients each,
      age-, gender- and symptom-corrected by the MUSCULAR IMPAIRMENT RATING SCALE (MIRS). The DM1
      patients will receive regular respiratory muscle training for a period of 9 months. The aim
      of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of regular inspiratory
      strength-breathing muscle training on 15 patients, the safety and effectiveness of regular
      inspiratory endurance respiratory muscle training on 15 patients, and the comparison to the
      natural course in 15 patients without training. Subsequently, we will provide treatment
      recommendations for respiratory training in DM1.

    <description>Intervention-related (serious) adverse events will be assessed as described in protocoll DM-IMT Version 1.2 (26/June/2019). For example a deterioration of &gt; 15% of the FVC compared to the baseline measurements is defined as AE, as is the development of unusual myalgia of the respiratory muscles for more than 12 hours after the respiratory training. Detailed lists of patients experiencing adverse events or SAEs are reported. The severity of the adverse event is classified as mild, moderate or severe. Relationships of an AE to the training are categorized as unassociated, unlikely to be associated, possibly associated or associated. A separate list will be provided for patients who drop out of the study due to AEs. The frequency of adverse events leading to study termination is also summarized. Safety parameters also include lung function tests (PFT, including FVC, FEV1, MIP, MEP), physical examination, vital signs and clinical laboratory tests as required.</description>
