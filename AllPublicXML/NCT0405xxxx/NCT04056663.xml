  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background - There is a high potential for hospitalization prevention through: (i) a greater
      continuity of care, achieved by facilitating collaborative work among professionals at
      different levels of care, and (ii) improving the self-efficacy of patients. For both
      objectives, the support of appropriate information and communication technologies is
      essential. The study raises the hypothesis that an industry 4.0 system, Health-Circuit, based
      on communication technologies and intelligent collaboration, will facilitate a greater
      continuity of care and an improvement in patients' self-efficacy.

      Objective - Analysis of Health-Circuit's potential for improving the continuity of care and
      self-efficacy of chronic patients at risk of hospitalization.

      Material and methods - Controlled, single-blinded, randomized trial by primary care teams,
      with a 2:1 intervention-control ratio. The first phase of the study (September-November 2019)
      will be carried out in 75 patients from the primary care area of Barcelona Esquerra under the
      influence of Hospital Clínic of Barcelona (CAPSBE, 110k inhabitants). In the intervention
      group, the patients, and the corresponding healthcare professionals, will communicate and
      collaborate though Health-Circuit, while the control group will receive conventional
      treatment. In a second phase (beginning December 2019), the study will be extended to the
      entire healthcare area of Barcelona Esquerra (AISBE, 520k inhabitants).

      Expected results - From a clinical perspective, a reduction in the number of urgent
      face-to-face visits is expected at: (i) Hospital; (ii) Primary Care, or, (iii) Primary Care
      Emergency Centers, due to better continuity of care and greater self-efficacy of patients.
      However, the results sought in Phase I of the study will be, fundamentally: (i) the
      evaluation of the usability and acceptability of Health-Circuit for patients and
      professionals, and (ii) the analysis of the potential of the digital tool for the management
      of complex clinical processes with the help of intelligent bots. In phase II of the study,
      the central objectives will be (i) increase in the capacity to resolve events, and (ii)
      improvement of patients' self-efficacy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The present investigation develops in the framework of the EU project CONNECARE &quot;Personalized
      Connected Care for Complex Chronic Patients (H2020 - BHC25 - 689802), whose registration
      number in the medical research ethics committee of Hospital Clínic of Barcelona is HCB /
      2018/0803. CONNECARE assumes that (i) the improvement of the continuity of care, associated
      with facilitating collaborative work among professionals of different levels of care, and,
      (ii) the increase in patients' self-efficacy, results in an optimization of the management of
      chronic patients with the consequent decrease in unplanned consultations, whether at primary
      care or at the hospital. This necessarily leads to an increase in the resolving capacity of
      primary care teams and an increase in the prevention of hospitalizations.

      Although the role of digital technologies, as an element of support for integrated care
      services, is well-demonstrated, at present, we still do not have adequate digital tools that
      provide adequate support for collaborative work between professionals and, in turn, encourage
      the empowerment for self-management of patients. We understand as such, technologies: (i)
      compliant with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), (ii) interoperable with
      existing health information systems, and, that (iii) facilitate the adaptive and
      collaborative management of chronic patients.

      The present study evaluates the potential of an industry 4.0 system, Health-Circuit, based on
      communication technologies and intelligent collaboration, for the improvement of the
      management of chronic patients, with the consequent increase of the resolving capacity of the
      community health teams. Health-Circuit allows patients and professionals to interact,
      bilaterally or in groups, from various information systems and devices, regardless of their
      physical location. The base technology platform, Circuit, is robust (TRL 9), located in the
      cloud (private, mixed or public) and complies with the General Data Protection Regulation
      (GDPR). Circuit allows multimedia corporate communication (chat, call, video-call, file
      exchange, etc.) between healthcare levels, increasing coordination among professionals with
      the consequent improvement of health outcomes. Its potential can be increased in the future
      with the use of intelligent Chatbots to guide patients and professionals through complex care
      processes, providing decision support for personalised service selection by means of enhanced
      health risk assessment and patient stratification.

    <description>The intervention contemplates. (i) management of unexpected events; and, (ii) empowering the patient to improve self-efficacy.
Users of the intervention arm will have the Health-Circuit mobile application, which will offer them the possibility of contacting the case managers to notify a health event at any time and that this can be resolved by their health professionals through Health -Circuit. The improvement of the patient's self-efficacy for the management of their health problems through the use of Health-Circuit is considered through the virtual visits of follow-up with the manager, the possibility of interacting with the manager and the consultation of the shared documents reminders of the action plan agreed with the patient.</description>
