    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects of SD-101 when given together with nivolumab and
      radiation therapy in treating patients with pancreatic cancer that does not respond to
      treatment with chemotherapy (chemotherapy refractory) and has spread to other places in the
      body (metastatic). Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as SD-101, work in different ways to stop
      the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or
      by stopping them from spreading. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab,
      may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of
      tumor cells to grow and spread. Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays to kill tumor cells
      and shrink tumors. Giving SD-101, nivolumab, and radiation therapy may work better in
      treating patients with pancreatic cancer compared to nivolumab or radiation therapy alone.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety and tolerability of intratumoral cytidine-phospho-guanosine
      oligodeoxynucleotide (CpG) in combination with nivolumab and radiotherapy (RT) in
      chemotherapy-refractory metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma using Common Terminology
      Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version (v)5.0 criteria.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To obtain preliminary data on disease control rate (DCR), duration of response (DOR),
      progression free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) of intratumoral CpG in combination
      with nivolumab and RT in chemotherapy refractory pancreatic adenocarcinoma.

    <description>Patients receive TLR9 agonist SD-101 intratumorally on days 1 and 8 of cycle 1 and day 1 of cycles 2-5. Treatment repeats every 2 weeks for up to 5 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients undergo radiation therapy on days 1, 3, 5, 8, and 10 of cycle 1. Patients also receive nivolumab IV over 30 minutes on day 2. Cycles with nivolumab repeat every 2 weeks for 24 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.</description>
