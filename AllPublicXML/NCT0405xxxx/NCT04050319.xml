  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators goal is to provide a mechanism that allows for a better understanding of
      athlete management from injury prevention through maintenance of health or development of
      injury and rehabilitation. The goal is to describe best practice for prevention and treatment
      to maximize return to health, sport, and patient reported outcomes following time. This
      includes collection of pre-existing risk factors, prevention program participation, treatment
      initiatives, functional outcomes measured by standardized and validated tools from the
      published literature. It incorporates comorbidities and patient demographic characteristics.
      All of these components come together to form a remarkably comprehensive picture of athlete
      health, influencing factors, and their associated outcomes.

      health, influencing factors, and their associated outcomes.

      Data are collected via the athletic training electronic medical record system EMR and
      integrated with data from the investigators proprietary EMR system and are genuine to the
      community through clinical process. The data are collected in real-time with athletes and
      patients and the scores are immediately provided to the providing athletic trainer and
      therapist as well as archived for later Registry and scientific use.

      Subsequent reporting can be adjusted to any variable collected which yields robust insights
      as to athlete health. However, no PHI information will be available.
