  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial studies how well a web-based legacy intervention works in improving the quality of
      life in caregivers and younger patients with cancer that has come back (recurrent) or does
      not respond to treatment (refractory). Legacy-making, defined as doing or saying something to
      be remembered, may reduce the suffering of children with cancer and their caregivers.
      Currently, there is little information about what kinds of legacy-making activities are
      helpful from the perspective of children. Using a web-based digital storytelling
      intervention, this study may help researchers examine what children think about these
      legacy-making activities and what kinds of activities might be helpful to them.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To examine the impact of legacy-making on coping strategies and adjustment outcomes among
      children with refractory or relapsed cancer.

      II. To examine the impact of legacy-making on coping strategies and adjustment outcomes among
      parent caregivers.

      III. To examine the process of implementing a web-based legacy-making intervention for
      children with refractory or relapsed cancer and their parent caregivers by obtaining parent
      self-reports (e.g., What did you and your child-like/not like about the intervention? How
      difficult was it to complete the intervention? What made it difficult? What else you would
      like to teach us?).

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.

      GROUP I: Patients participate in a web-based legacy intervention by answering questions about
      themselves and uploading videos, photographs, and music to create a digital story within 2
      weeks.

      GROUP II: Patients receive standard of care. Patients have the option to participate in the
      web-based legacy intervention after 2 months.

    <description>Will be measured using the Response to Stress Questionnaire (RSQ). The 57 items are rated from 1-4 indicating frequency of responses to stress, resulting in 5 factors: (a) primary control coping, (b) secondary control coping, (c) disengagement coping, (d) involuntary engagement, and (e) involuntary disengagement. The total score is the total sum of all 57 items, ranging from 57-228. The 5 factor scores are computed as the sum of the appropriate subscales.</description>

    <description>Will be measured using 27-item Pediatric Quality of Life (PedsQL) Inventory Cancer Module to assess child quality of life. We used Child Self-Report versions for ages 5-7, 8-12, and 13-17. Parents completed Parent Proxy-Reports. Items for 7-year-olds were rated on a 3-point Likert scale. Items for children aged 8-17 years and parents were rated on a 5-point Likert scale. Multidimensional scales include pain and hurt, nausea, procedural anxiety, treatment anxiety, worry, cognitive problems, perceived physical appearance, and communication. Scores are transformed to a 0-100 scale. To calculate scores by dimensions, the mean score = sum of the items over the number of items answered. The total score is the sum of all the items over the number of items answered on all the scales. Higher scores indicate lower problems.</description>

    <description>Will be measured using the Parent-Adolescent Communication Scale (PACS) to assess parent-child communication. Children and parents complete 20-40 items to assess parent-child communication. A total score is calculated ranging from 20-100 with higher scores indicating more positive communication.</description>

Scores in relation to norms for each gender and age are based on national probability samples. Higher scores indicate the item is true for the individual.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Children ages 7-17 years will be included so the sample will reflect similar
             developmental understandings that death is permanent and universal. Ages 18 and up are
             excluded because they begin very different developmental stages of independence as
             they often leave home and begin college and careers. The principal investigator (PI)
             or trained clinical trials associate (CTA) will determine the primary parent caregiver
             by gathering objective information (e.g., number of hours spent per week with the
             child) from the child's legal guardian during the initial recruitment process

          -  Relapsed or refractory cancer disease states: This will be determined by parent
             self-report. This determination will be made at any point within the illness
             trajectory

          -  Able to speak, understand, read, and type English: Participants will be limited to
             those who meet this criterion because the instruments and methods proposed in this
             research have not been translated in foreign languages

          -  Participants will be limited to those who have internet access to allow us to
             successfully examine the feasibility of a web-based intervention

          -  Absence of cognitive impairment: Cognitive impairment will be determined by the PI or
             CTA during the consent process. If the child or parent does not understand the consent
             process (e.g., does not understand project goal, does not understand study
             procedures), the PI or CTA will gently conclude the recruitment process. Any data
             already collected will not be included in data analysis, and the participant will be
             considered withdrawn
