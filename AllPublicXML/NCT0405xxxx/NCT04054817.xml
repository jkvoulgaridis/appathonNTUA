      Purpose:

      Investigate the safety of ABCcolla Collagen Ophthalmic Matrix used for anterior lamellar
      keratoplasty in patients suffering from fungal keratitis which cannot be treated with drugs.

      Investigational medical device:

        1. Product name: ABCcolla Collagen Ophthalmic Matrix

        2. Manufacturer: ACRO Biomedical Co., Ltd.

        3. Address of manufacturer: 3rd Floor, No.57, Luke 2nd Rd., Lujhu District, Kaohsiung City
           82151, Taiwan (R.O.C.)

        4. Indication: to replace human cornea in anterior lamellar keratoplasty

        5. Classification: Class III

      Study overview:

      Each volunteer will be assigned a set of subject screening No. after signing the ICF. After
      review of basic information and medical and drug history, screening of inclusion and
      exclusion criteria and relevant assessment and record, the doctor will make the final
      decision of whether to enroll the subject. Enrolled subjects will be assigned a subject
      enrollment No. They will undergo keratoplasty using the investigational product and be
      followed up for observation. Subjects are required to complete 9 visits (V2~V10) and will be
      followed up for 24 weeks.
