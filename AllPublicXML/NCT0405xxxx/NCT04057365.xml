  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research is studying the effect of the combination of how two study drugs (Nivolumab and
      DKN-01) works in people with advanced biliary tract cancer.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety
      and effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the drug works in treating a
      specific disease. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the drug is being studied.

      The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved DKN-01 as a treatment for any
      disease.

      The FDA has not approved nivolumab for this specific disease but it has been approved for
      other cancers.

      DKN-01 and nivolumab are both antibodies. An antibody is a protein that attaches to other
      cells to fight off infection. DKN-01 is believed to work by attaching to and inhibiting
      (stopping) a specific pathway in the cells that is responsible for processes such as cell
      growth. Nivolumab is believed to work by attaching to and inhibiting a specific protein in
      the cancer that controls parts of the immune system (the system in the body that fights off
      infections and diseases) by shutting down certain immune responses. The investigators believe
      that nivolumab will inhibit the protein, thus allowing the immune cells to recognize and
      destroy cancer cells.

    <description>Overall response is evaluated using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors criteria (RECIST 1.1). A participant is considered to have responded if they achieve either of the following outcomes:
Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to &lt;10 mm
Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Median Progression Free Survival</measure>
    <time_frame>From the time of randomization until disease progression or death, up to approximately 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>The duration of time from randomization until disease progression or death. Disease progression is assessed using RECIST 1.1 criteria.
Progressive Disease(PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. (Note: the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression).</description>
