  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) are currently used for evaluating orthopaedic
      procedures. Nevertheless, there is no consensus in the different studies, making them
      difficult to compare . The score mapping (or cross walk) is a statistical model for
      estimating a score associated with an unmeasured score.

      Moreover , Minimal clinically important differences (MCID) is the smallest change in a
      treatment outcome that a patient would identify as important. The MCID is also not clearly
      identified for the French population for the hip and knee orthopaedic scores.

    <measure>Oxford Hip Score</measure>
    <time_frame>The day Before surgery</time_frame>
    <description>t is a 12-item patient-reported outcome measure designed to assess disability after surgery to the hip. Each item was scored between 0 and 4, with 4 been the best outcome per question producing overall scores running from 0 to 48(48 being the best outcome); &gt; 41 is excellent, 34 - 41 is good,27 -33 as fair, and &lt;27 is poor.</description>

    <measure>HOOS Score</measure>
    <time_frame>The day Before surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The HOOS (Hip disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score) is a patient questionnaire evaluating patients' feelings about their operated hip. It consists of 40 questions divided into 5 subgroups: pain, symptoms, daily living, quality of life, sports and recreational activities. Each category is scored on 100 points, 0 being the worse outcome and 100 the best outcome.</description>

    <description>Oxford Knee Score is a tool which measures 6 post operative items (pain,flexion contracture, extension lag, total range of flexion, alignment of varus and valgus,stability (antero-posterior and mediolateral). The scoring is: below 60 is poor, scoring 60-69 fair, scoring 70-79 good, 80-100 excellent.</description>
