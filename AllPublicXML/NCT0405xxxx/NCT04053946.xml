  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 64-patient, 90-day, open -label study on adult patients undergoing below knee
      amputation for various etiologies. The objective of this study is to assess surgical wound
      healing and wound bioburden using combination treatment of Next Science SurgX™ Antimicrobial
      Wound Gel and BlastX™ Antimicrobial Wound Gels as compared to standard of care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized, 90 day, open-label study of patients undergoing below the
      knee amputation (BKA) with primary closure or completion.

      Patients who present for BKA with primary closure or completion will have had a pre-op
      medical evaluation prior to being screened against the protocol's inclusion/exclusion
      criteria. If criteria are met, patients will be presented with the option to participate in
      the study and informed consent procedures will be carried out, in compliance with currently
      applicable participants' rights and safety regulations.

      A minimum of 64 participants, with up to 70 participants, may be enrolled. A participant
      requiring bilateral BKA will be excluded. Eligible subjects will need to complete the study
      to meet the primary endpoint.

      It is estimated that the study enrollment period will last approximately eighteen months, and
      the duration of each participants' participation will be three months. Visits in the
      treatment portion of the study will be carried out at day 0, 3, 14, 21, and 28 days with a
      scheduling window of 3 days before or after each due date. A phone call follow-up will be
      conducted at 60 days post-surgery with a window of 7 days before or 14 days after to inquire
      about the incision (appearance of incision or any noted changes since prior study visit), and
      overall health of the participant. All participants, regardless of treatment arm, will
      complete Visit 6 (90 day follow up) with a scheduling window of 7 days before or 21 days
      after. The key parameters of the study include: percentage of surgical wound area reduction,
      time patients are deemed ready prosthetic healing, and microorganism type and amounts.
      Bacterial identification and quantification will occur at days 0, 14, and 28 for all
      participants.

    <description>Following amputation, SurgX™ will be applied directly to the surgical incision in the operating room under sterile conditions and covered with SOC dressing. The surgical dressing will not be removed until post-operative day 3, except if deemed necessary by the treating surgeon. At that time, direct application of the BlastX™ to the incision will be placed, then covered with a SOC dressing. BlastX™ will be applied every day and covered with SOC dressing.</description>

             discuss to withdraw the patient, if it is felt that continuing in the study will be
             detrimental to the patient. For example, if the incision cannot be closed, or if it
             requires a muscle flap, or if the incision site encounters contamination or infection
             not recognized prior to the start of surgery. The decision to withdraw the patient
             will be made in the OR, prior to being randomized.
