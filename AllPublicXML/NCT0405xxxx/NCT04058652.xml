    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to determine the efficacy of TENS therapy in reducing
      the pain experienced by patients during and after the injection of biological medications.
      The study team is interested in recording the level of pain reduction from TENS therapy to
      determine if this intervention is effective at reducing discomfort associated with medication
      administration so that it may possibly be applied to other patients in an effort to reduce
      treatment-related discomfort, anxiety, and possibly increase adherence.

      A total of 10-20 subjects at one research site will be recruited to participate,
      specifically, individuals who receive the injection of medication in two separate sites. The
      inclusion criteria will be an age of &gt; 18 years old, a diagnosis of psoriasis, and currently
      receiving biologic medication injection in two sites during their dermatology clinic visit.

      The first step is to administer the biologic medication in one thigh without the use of TENS
      therapy. This is done to establish a control, or baseline, for how painful the injection
      experience is. The second step involves a study team member applying two to four TENS unit
      pads (made of adhesive gel) to the skin of your thigh approximately two centimeters from the
      site where injection of the biological medication takes place. The device will be turned on
      during the injection of the medication. Medication injection will take place by either the
      patient or nursing staff as it would normally take place without involvement in this study.
      Immediately after both steps, subjects will be given a brief survey to determine their pain
      level.

    <description>Determining the change in discomfort associated with medication before and after the administration of the TENS therapy. The Visual Analogue Scale consists of a straight line with the endpoints defining extreme limits such as &quot;0&quot; 'no pain at all' and &quot;8&quot; 'pain as bad as it could be'. The patient is asked to mark his pain level on the line between the two endpoints &quot;0&quot; - &quot;8&quot;. The distance between &quot;0&quot; 'no pain at all' and the mark then defines the subject's pain.</description>

    <description>the first step would be to administer the biologic medication in one thigh without the use of TENS therapy. Biologic medications are administered in two doses, with one in each thigh. Administering the first biologic medication injection is done to establish a control, or baseline, for how painful the injection experience is. The second step would be a study team member applying two to four TENS unit pads (made of adhesive gel) to the skin of subject's other thigh approximately two centimeters from the site where injection of the biological medication takes place. There will be no extra injection of biologic medication during this procedure. The prescribed dose will be used one time, split into two legs (which is the standard protocol for administration). The device will be turned on during the injection of the medication. Immediately after both steps, the subject will be given a brief survey to determine your pain level. The subject's involvement would last roughly 10-15 minutes.</description>

    <intervention_name>transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) unit</intervention_name>
    <description>The transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) unit is a noninvasive, inexpensive, battery-operated device that was originally designed to provide modulation of the afferent nervous system to relieve pain. By providing alternating current through cutaneous electrodes, TENS activates large-diameter afferent fibers of the nervous system (A-delta, A-beta, C fibers), whose ascending signals are subsequently relayed to the central nervous system.</description>
