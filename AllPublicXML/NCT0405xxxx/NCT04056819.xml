  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a first-in-human assessment of safety of using UCMSC in patients with AMI via a
      combination of IC and IV stem cell administration. The novelty of the current UMSC01
      treatment study is the dual route of administration. Since dual administration of UCMSC via
      IC and IV had never been conducted in humans, there may be unknown risks to humans not
      predicted from the preclinical studies. However, the risk to patients in this trial will be
      minimized by rigorous adherence to the eligibility criteria, use of appropriate dose and
      concentration of stem cells, standardized techniques of stem cell infusion, and intensive
      patient monitoring during and after stem cell infusion.

      Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in the developed world, with global
      deaths due to coronary artery disease estimated to increase from 7.3 million in 2008 to 25
      million by 2020 WHO, 2011.

      The leading symptom that initiates the diagnostic and therapeutic cascade in patients with
      suspected acute coronary syndromes (ACS) is chest pain.

      Most patients will ultimately develop an ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). The
      mainstay of treatment in these patients is immediate reperfusion by primary angioplasty or
      fibrinolytic therapy. Basically, STEMI comprises approximately 25% to 40% of myocardial
      infarction (MI) presentations. Acute STEMI is a major cause of morbidity, mortality, and
      disability.

      This product is a new cell therapy product for treating AMI and produced by Ever Supreme Bio
      Technology Co., Ltd in Taiwan. For animal studies, UMSC01 has been demonstrated its
      effectiveness for AMI and stroke. The rats with coronary artery ligation receiving
      intravenous injection of UMSC01 showed significantly improved cardiac function.
