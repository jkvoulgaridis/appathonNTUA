  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) accounts for 10-15% of lung cancer. More than 70% of SCLC
      patients are diagnosed with advanced stage initially. SCLC is highly chemo-sensitive, the
      first-line treatment is platinum-containing double-drug chemotherapy. Although the objective
      response rate (ORR) of first-line chemotherapy is as high as 60-80%, the duration of response
      is very short, and there is little effective follow-up treatment. The outcome of SCLC
      patients is poor with an overall survival (OS) of about 10 months.

      In August 2018, the FDA approved Nivolumab as a third-line treatment for advanced SCLC
      patients, which is the only immunotherapeutic drug approved for SCLC till now. Sintilimab is
      another PD-1 inhibitor produced by China and has been approved by cFDA for lymphoma.
      Anlotinib is a novel multi-target tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) with effect of anti-tumor
      angiogenesis and tumor growth inhibition. The results of ALTER1202 show that compared with
      placebo, Anlotinib single-agent as three-line treatment in advanced SCLC was effective, the
      median progression free survival (PFS) were 4.1 versus 0.7 months, respectively (P &lt; 0.0001).

      Immunotherapy combined with anti-angiogenic therapy has been proven effective and tolerable
      in non-small cell lung caner (NSCLC), while its efficacy and safety in SCLC has not been
      reported. Therefore, the investigators conduct this study to evaluate the efficacy and safety
      of Sintilimab combined with Anlotinib versus Anlotinib alone in third line or beyond among
      advanced SCLC patients.
