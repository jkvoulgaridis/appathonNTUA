      a cohort of 120 affected patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Goldenhar syndrome belongs to the heterogeneous spectrum of oculoauriculovertebral dysplasia.
      Several chromosomal abnormalities have been described associated with this spectrum, and
      furthermore mutations in different genes of development cause abnormalities of the jaw or
      facial asymmetries in human or mouse. To date, no gene has been identified as formally
      involved in the genesis of the OAVS, despite evidence of familial cases, mostly with
      autosomal dominant inheritance.

      The aim of this study is to identify of the first gene involved in the Goldenhar syndrome in
      a cohort of 120 affected patients.
