  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Several studies have been done on the efficacy of the herbal medicine Iberogast. In this
      study researcher want to learn more about the time needed for Iberogast to start to work
      after the patient took the drug. This study plans to enroll 300 adult male and female
      patients suffering from disturbance of stomach and intestine normal function and treated by
      their doctor with Iberogast drops. Patients will be asked to document on a diary card the
      changes of symptom severity of the stomach and intestine complaints and the time needed for
      the symptoms to improve after drug intake. At the end of the study the treating doctor and
      the patients will be asked about the overall changes of symptoms. In addition information on
      the safety of the drug and how well the drug is tolerated by the patients will be collected
