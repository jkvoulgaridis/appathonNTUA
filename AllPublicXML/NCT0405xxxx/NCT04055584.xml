  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Molecular testing for mutations in M. tuberculosis genes associated to resistance of anti
      tuberculosis (TB) drugs is already part of standard laboratory TB diagnostic.

      This implicates earlier knowledge of possible resistance and thus prevents unnecessary
      treatment and the chance of treatment failure or treatment related toxicity.

      The molecular laboratory diagnostics is widely spread in high income, low TB endemic
      countries. However, the low income countries lack widespread facilities to test for
      susceptibility, either genotypic or phenotypic. Performing molecular diagnostics on sputum
      collected with a spot card could improve accessibility to molecular testing.

      This study examines if sputum collected and put on spot cards could be used for multiple
      molecular tests for the detection, identification and susceptibility prediction of TB. This
      means that DNA extraction of the sputum from the spot card should be feasible.

      The study is a pilot study with adult patients of the tuberculosis department of University
      Medical Centre Groningen (UMCG) Beatrixoord, Haren as subjects. The sputum produced will be
      collected, dried on spot cards, and DNA extraction from the card will be tested. If molecular
      detection is positive for the tuberculosis bacteria additional tests will be performed. Based
      on the present/absent of mutations in the genes associated to resistance susceptibility can
      be preditec, different molecular techniques will be performed to identify possible mutations.
      Furthermore, sputum will be collected as patients produce so. Sputum samples with low
      bacterial load can be tested as well and can test the sensitivity of the procedure.

      Lastly, techniques like RNA detection will be tested to identify the bacterial load. This can
      be done if more than one sample of patients were collected.

      Subjects will be selected on age, participation in standard TDM and drug use. Demographic
      parameters will be analysed. Sputum samples will be taken twice a week (on Tuesday and
      Friday).
