    <measure>Change from baseline in ALSFRS-R score at Month 12 (or last measurement before death in case of censoring) and survival time.</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The amyotrophic lateral sclerosis functional rating scale-revised, or ALSFRS-R, measures the functional status of subjects with ALS. It is based on 12 items, each of which is rated on a 5-point scale (0 to 4). The rate of total functional disability thus ranges from 0 (maximum disability) to 48 (normal function) points.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean change from baseline of muscle strength measured by hand-held dynamometry</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Treatment Phase Week 6, Months 3, 6, 9 and12 time points.</time_frame>
    <description>Hand-held dynamometry, or HHD, is used to measure the force generated by each muscle. The scale ranges from 0 (no visible movement of the part) to 10 (holds test position against strong pressure). Thus, the higher the total score, the higher muscle strength is observed.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean change from baseline on quality of life assessed by ALSAQ-5 at Month 12</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Assessment Questionnaire, or ALSAQ-5, is a patient self-report questionnaire specifically designed to measure 5 areas of health: physical mobility, activities of daily living and independence, eating and drinking, communication and emotional functioning. The subject is asked about 5 different areas of difficulties in their daily lives: ability to stand up, use of limbs, consuming solid food, level of speech coherence, and degree of hope about the future.Each question provides 5 choices from which to choose: Never, Rarely, Sometimes, Often, and Always or cannot do at all.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean change from baseline of functional activity measured by ALSFRS-R at Month 12</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The ALSFRS-R assessment tool measures the functional status of subjects with ALS. It is based on 12 items, each of which is rated on a 5-point scale (0 to 4). The rate of total functional disability thus ranges from 0 (maximum disability) to 48 (normal function) points. In this context, the ALSFRS-R total score change (lower, same, higher) is documented.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants with Treatment-Related Adverse Events as Assessed by CTCAE v4.0</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), severity (mild, moderate, severe), as well as relationship to study treatment (not related, possibly related, probably related) and whether they are considered serious.</description>

    <measure>Changes from Baseline in Laboratory Values</measure>
