      Prospective, single centre, evaluator-blind, split face study of the efficacy of fractional
      radiofrequency (RF) for the treatment and reduction of acne scarring and facial wrinkles. The
      study will evaluate the progress of 15 subjects requesting treatment of scarring or facial
      wrinkles. The study will involve three treatments on both sides of the face with 3-5 week
      intervals between each treatment. Subjects will be followed at 6 and 12 weeks after their
      last treatment. Analysis will be performed on all subjects who receive at least one
      treatment.
