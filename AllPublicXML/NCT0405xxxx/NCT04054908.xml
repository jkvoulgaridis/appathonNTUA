    <textblock>
      This is a pilot feasibility study designed to investigate the alterations in the gut
      microbiome that occur during the course of treatment for colorectal cancer (CRC). Three
      patient cohorts will be followed. Cohort A: patients treated with oral fluoropyrimidine CAP
      as part of standard of care (SOC) chemotherapy. Cohort B: patients treated with TAS-102
      including those receiving it in combination with Y-90 radioembolization as part of a clinical
      trial. Cohort C: patients receiving CAP plus immunotherapy (pembrolizumab) and bevacizumab as
      part of a clinical trial. Investigators will replace participants as needed to ensure a
      minimum of 10 evaluable participants per cohort (or minimum total of 30 evaluable patients).
      Evaluable participants are defined as patients with two analyzable stool samples including a
      baseline sample and at least one on-treatment sample to be used in endpoint analysis

        Recruitment will include both patients who will be taking TAS-102 and those taking CAP with
        or without other cancer-directed therapies, including those receiving CAP in combination
        with concurrent rectal radiation. Patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) expected to receive
        CAP or TAS-102 will be screened by the study PI, co-investigators, or study coordinators.
        The study coordinator may identify potential participants by various mechanisms: direct
        referral from a treating physician, review of schedules of medical and oncology providers
        at UCSF and participating sites, or phone calls from patients or referring physicians.

             inhibitors, is permitted.

          4. Combination of CAP with concurrent radiation is permitted, including patients
             undergoing radiotherapy to a rectal primary or a metastatic site.

          5. Male or female patient aged 18 years of age or older at the time of obtaining the
             signed and dated informed consent (no upper age limit).

          7. Be willing and able to provide written informed consent for the study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient has had prior chemotherapy, biologic or immunotherapy in the previous 2 weeks.

          2. Patient has completed a course of antibiotics longer than 2 weeks in preceding six
             months or a course of antibiotics of any duration in the 4 weeks prior to starting
             oral chemotherapy. Any patient who requires treatment with antibiotics during the
             study may be removed at the investigator's discretion.

          3. Known HIV positive.
