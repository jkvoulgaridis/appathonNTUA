  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are two main aims for this study:

        1. conduct a proof-of-concept study illustrating how radio-frequency identification
           technology can be used to document the timestamps and duration of stair walking
           (ascending and descending stairs), and detect if an individual is stationary in the
           stairwell.

        2. assess the association of a 4-min bout of self-paced stair walking with changes in blood
           pressure, mood, and perceived exertion.

      Objective, passive methods for measuring physical activity participation can minimize error
      associated with self-report bias and cognitive processing. This study will test the utility
      of radio frequency identification (RFID) for the measurement of stair walking within
      buildings. RFID readers will be placed at stairwell entrances on each floor. Participants
      will wear a RFID tag. As the participant walks past the different readers going up and down
      the stairs, the reader will log the date and time. The frequency and duration of time in the
      stairwell can be calculated, as can an estimated speed.

      There are known effects for blood pressure (hypotensive) and moodafter exercise. However, few
      studies have assessed this effect for short bouts (&lt;10 minutes) of exercise. Participants
      will have their pre- and post-stair walking blood pressure measured to determine the
      hypotensive and mood enhancing effects of four minutes of stair walking at a comfortable
      pace. Participants also will rate the exertion level of four minutes of stair walking at a
      self-selected pace.
