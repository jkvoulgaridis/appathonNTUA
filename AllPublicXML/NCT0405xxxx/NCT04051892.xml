      This is a Prospective, Open label, Single arm, Multicenter Study enrolling female patients
      with a history of breast cancer following breast conservation surgery or mastectomy with
      breast reconstruction, seeking reconstruction of the breast nipple and areola complex.

      The study is designed to evaluate the long-term safety and performance of the FixNip NRI in
      patients undergoing nipple reconstruction procedure.
