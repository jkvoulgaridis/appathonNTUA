      The overarching goal is to pilot the Attachment and Biobehavioral Catch-up (ABC) intervention
      for mothers with heightened depressive symptom and their children with heightened
      internalizing symptoms.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Exposure to maternal depressive symptoms increases children's risk for developing anxiety and
      depressive symptoms (&quot;internalizing symptoms&quot;). Maternal depressive symptoms and children's
      internalizing symptoms may be reciprocally related over time. Optimal interventions for
      children's internalizing symptoms may involve treatment components for mothers, children, and
      the maternal-child relationship. The Attachment and Biobehavioral Catch-up (ABC) intervention
      is a empirically-supported, family-based treatment program that has been shown to be
      beneficial for children in varied high-risk family environments, but has yet to be tested
      among mothers and children recruited on the basis of heightened depressive and internalizing
      symptoms, respectively. The overarching goal is to examine the acceptability, feasibility,
      and preliminary effects of the ABC program on a sample of mother-child dyads (n = 20) with
      heightened depressive and internalizing symptoms. Our specific aims are:

        1. To evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of ABC for mothers with depressive
           symptoms and their offspring with internalizing symptoms

        2. To explore whether children who receive ABC show improvement in internalizing symptoms
           from pre- to post-intervention

        3. To explore whether mothers who receive ABC show improvement in depressive symptoms from
           pre- to post-intervention

        4. To explore whether parents and children who receive ABC show more adaptive physiological
           responses to stress from pre- to post-intervention

    <description>ABC delivers therapy through 10, home-based, in-person sessions led by a trained professional. Treatment content is based on attachment theory and an understanding of children's stress neurobiology. Components aim to improve parental sensitivity, nurturance, and responsivity, as well as children's biological and behavioral reactivity through dyadic interactions between parents and children.</description>
