      The aim of this study is to evaluate the clinical performance of lithium disilicate crowns
      restoring endodontically treated teeth with two occlusal preparation schemes.

      Statement of the problem:

      The endodontically treated teeth need to be restored back to form, function and aesthetics.
      The quality of the coronal restoration will directly impact on their survival and success.
      The aim of the coronal restoration of endodontically treated teeth is to provide the
      necessary strength for the restoration/tooth complex through tooth preparation in order to
      withstand functional stress and prevent crown and/or root fracture. The use of ceramic crowns
      has increased substantially in recent years because of their superior esthetics and high
      mechanical properties. Long term success of all ceramic crowns is affected by many factors
      and the failure patterns of these all ceramic crowns should be inspected closely to detect
      their clinical performance.

      Rationale for carrying out the trial:

      Endodontic treatment weakens posterior teeth and ought to be covered by crowns.The capability
      of these crowns to bear load relies on the preparation of an appropriate design and the
      selection of a crown material with adequate fracture strength and thickness. In vital teeth,
      the anatomic occlusal preparation design is followed such that the occlusal surface is
      reduced uniformly, maintaining the cusps and normal inclined planes but at a reduced height.
      This aids in minimizing the risk of pulp injury. In contrast, in non-vital teeth, this design
      can be modified such that the occlusal surface is prepared in two planes (buccal and lingual
      planes). A flat prepared occlusal surface provides less quantitative and better qualitative
      stresses when compared to an anatomically prepared surface

    <description>Clinical trials lacks information about flat occlusal preparation design in case of endodontically treated teeth. Therefore, this is tested during preparation when compared to planer occlusal preparation while the final restoration in both arms is lithium disilicate (e.max) crowns.</description>
