    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to characterize the effect of repeated oral administration of
      TAK-788 160 milligram (mg) once daily on the single oral and intravenous dose
      pharmacokinetics (PK) of midazolam.

    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-788. The study will characterize the effect
      of repeated oral administration of TAK-788 160 mg on the single oral- and intravenous-dose PK
      of midazolam, and will assess the safety and tolerability of TAK-788 in participants with
      advanced NSCLC.

      The study will enroll approximately 26 participants. The study will be conducted in 2 parts:
      Part A (Cycle 1: PK Cycle) and Part B (Cycle 2 to Cycle 24: Treatment Cycles). In Part A,
      participants will receive midazolam as an oral dose and intravenous infusion, along with oral
      dose of TAK-788 in a single 30-day cycle. After completion of Part A, eligible participants
      may enter Part B. In Part B, participants will continue to receive oral dose of TAK-788 that
      they were receiving and tolerating at the end of Part A in a 28-day treatment cycle for up to
      23 cycles of treatment, or until progressive disease (PD), intolerable toxicity, or another
      discontinuation criterion is met. Based on the opinion of investigator, if a participant
      continue to experience clinical benefit, treatment with TAK-788 may be continued after PD.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in Australia, Singapore and the Netherlands. The
      overall time to participate in this study is 3 years. Participants will make multiple visits
      to the clinic and will be followed up for 30 days after the last dose of study drug for a
      follow-up assessment.
