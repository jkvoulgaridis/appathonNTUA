  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In an unbiased metabolomics approach with subsequent pathway analyses, the current study
      seeks to examine the effect of Liraglutide treatment on the metabolic signature in treated
      patients as well as the effect of Liraglutide on various echocardiographic parameters of
      cardiac function and rhythm profile, thus paving the way for future research to explain the
      effects of Liraglutide on cardiovascular mortality and overall mortality in treated patients.
