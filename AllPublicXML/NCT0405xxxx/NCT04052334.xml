    <description>Participants will undergo tumor resection from which the tumor infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) product will be generated. All participants will receive nonmyeloablative lymphodepleting chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide and fludarabine to enhance T-cell persistence and effectiveness in vivo. Cyclophosphamide will be administered at 60 mg/kg/day IV in 250 mL normal saline (NS). Fludarabine will then be infused at 25 mg/m^2 intravenous piggyback (IVPB). All participants will receive not less than 10^9, and up to 1x10^12 T cells in ≥250 mL NS as an inpatient by intravenously (IV).
Eight (8) to sixteen (16) hours after completing the T cell infusion, all participants will receive high-dose interleukin-2 (IL-2) on an inpatient basis at the standard dose of 600 000 IU/kg as an intravenous bolus over an approximate 15-minute period every 8 to 16 hours for up to 15 doses on days 1 to 5, as tolerated.</description>
