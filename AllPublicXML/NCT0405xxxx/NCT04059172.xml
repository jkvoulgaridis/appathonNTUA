  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of a combined ibuprofen and
      acetaminophen regimen in controlling discomfort for 4 days after initial orthodontic
      appliance placement as compared to ibuprofen alone or a placebo. The hypothesis is that
      combined ibuprofen and acetaminophen therapy will effectively provide better pain control
      than ibuprofen alone or a placebo after orthodontic appliance placement.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Orthodontic pain is often reported for the first 4 days after the appliances are attached.
      This study will investigate two modes of pain management versus a placebo. Consented subjects
      will be randomly assigned to one of 3 groups: Group A, a combined and simultaneous therapy of
      200 mg ibuprofen and 650 mg acetaminophen (3 pills total) taken orally at set time intervals
      (0 h, 6 h, 12 h, and 24h, 48h, 72h, and 96h); Group B, ibuprofen alone (200 mg) taken orally
      at same time intervals (1 ibuprofen and 2 placebo pills); Group C, placebo taken orally at
      the same time intervals (3 placebo pills).

      The study will be blinded for the investigators, patients, and statisticians.
