    <textblock>
      The investigators aim to evaluate the efficacy of surgical diaphragmatic plication (SDP) for
      the management of unilateral diaphragmatic paralysis (UDP) and its effect on improving
      patients' symptoms and their performance status.

      Background:

      Diaphragm eventration is not an uncommon problem, it may be asymptomatic, but most of the
      patients suffer from dyspnoea and deterioration of their sports activities. General
      practitioners are not aware of the surgical benefit, especially diaphragmatic plication.

      Methods:

      A retrospective analysis of all patients who underwent surgical diaphragmatic plication (SDP)
      at our both centres in the last 5 years (Jan. 2014-Dec. 2018). The data of all patients were
      obtained from hospital patients records, family doctors and personal patients contact. All
      patients underwent routine preoperative workup and besides chest X-ray, chest computed
      tomography, chest sonography, fluoroscopy and spirometry with the assessment of FEV1, FVC
      (forced vital capacity ), FEV1/FVC, as well as a clinical dyspnoea evaluation according to
      MRC (medical research council) score. These investigations were done preoperatively as a
      baseline, one month and 6 months postoperatively. The data were compared and the statistical
      analysis was done using multivariate analysis.

    <description>The plication was done by the same surgeon either via a 7-8 cm long lateral thoracotomy and entrance to the pleural cavity through the eighth intercostals space on the affected side or using VATS (video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery) procedure. It was performed under single lumen intubation general anaesthesia. The diaphragm with the abdominal content was pushed caudally till the normal position of the copula achieved. At this position a fold of about 5 cm is made using traction forceps of the reluctant diaphragm. Polypropylene sutures (zero or 1) were used to perform the plication of the diaphragm. in making a fold on itself. The plication was performed using interrupted polypropylene U-stitches; usually, it started from posterior part to the anterior part of the diaphragm. We merged every two rows with continuous polypropylene sutures. The diaphragm became tough and firm and returned to its normal position. An intercostal tube was inserted, and the thoracotomy was closed in layers.</description>
