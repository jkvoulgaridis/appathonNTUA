  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, non-randomized, no placebo-controlled interventional study.

      The study aims to assess the safety of the web-based symptom checker SMASS-Triage and its
      tolerability in terms of incidence of under-triaged self-assessments and the potential risk
      to be life-threatening or harmful.

      The patient's self-triage using a symptom checker will be compared with the urgency
      assessments conducted sequentially by three interdisciplinary panels of physicians (panel A,
      B and C). The risk assessments will be based on the structured reports generated by the
      symptom checker and the discharge summaries of the WIC/ED.

    <description>The study will be performed at the Walk-in-Clinic (WIC) and Interdisciplinary Emergency Department (ED) of the cantonal hospital of Baden, Switzerland. During their stay at the WIC or ED the patients will be invited to use the triage-symptom-checker SMASS-Triage.
In this study, the patient's self-triage using a symptom checker will be compared with the urgency assessments conducted by three interdisciplinary panels of physicians (panel A, B and C). In order to appropriately reflect the complex interaction in medical decision-making, which usually leads to a low inter-rater reliability, the cases assessed to be undertriaged by panel A, are subsequently assessed a second time by two panelist of panel B. Cases which are adjudged to be undertriaged by all panelist (panel A and B), are assessed for a risk to health or life by panel C. The risk assessments of panel C will be based on the structured reports generated by the symptom-checker and the discharge summaries of the WIC/ED.</description>

    <description>SMASS-Triage is a web-based symptom checker developed by In4medicine Ltd. SMASS-Triage is based on a computerized transparent neural network, which was trained with the evidence of more than 1200 studies and the expertise of various panels of specialists in the field of preclinical medical triage. SMASS-Triage provides digitalized questionnaires of 87 frequent reasons of encounters (e.g. fever, cough, abdominal pain) and their associated red flags. The triage-result of SMASS-Triage encompasses the appropriate time-to-treat (T2T) and the adequate point-of-care (PoC).</description>
