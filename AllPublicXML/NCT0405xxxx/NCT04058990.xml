      A Randomized Trial Comparing the Agent Paclitaxel-Coated PTCA Balloon Catheter vs SeQuent
      Please Drug Eluting Balloon Catheter for the Treatment of a Small Vessel De Novo Native
      Coronary Artery Lesion.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Primary objective is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the Agent ™
      Paclitaxel-Coated PTCA Balloon Catheter for the treatment of Japanese subjects with a small
      vessel de novo native atherosclerotic coronary artery lesion or in-stent restenosis (ISR) of
      a previously treated lesion.

      Primary endpoint: Target Lesion Failure (TLF) rate at 6 months post index-procedure. TLF is
      defined as any ischemia driven revascularization of the target lesion (TLR), myocardial
      infarction (MI, Q-wave and non-Q-wave) related to the target vessel, or cardiac death.
