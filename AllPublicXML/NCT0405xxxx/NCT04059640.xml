      This PMCF study has been set up to investigate and assess residual risks in relation to the
      CE-marked LiquiBand FIX8® OHMF Device. The purpose of this study is primarily to collect
      clinical follow-up data on the LiquiBand FIX8® OHMF device, as CE-marking was based on
      equivalence. The data and conclusions obtained from this study will be used to provide
      clinical evidence of safety and effectiveness for the clinical evaluation process.

    <measure>Effectiveness of the LiquiBand FIX8 OHMF device</measure>
    <time_frame>Time of surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Effectiveness will be defined as successful fixation of the hernia mesh (ie not requiring additional fixation by an alternate device) using the LiquiBand FIX8 device at the time of surgery. Based on data pooled from published studies of a similar device (which employs the same cyanoacrylate glue to fix hernia mesh, via a laparoscopic rather than open surgical approach), there has been an observed failure rate of 0.8% in mesh fixation. This study aims to demonstrate non-inferiority of the LiquiBand FIX8 device to a failure rate of 5% (medically acceptable inference).</description>

    <measure>Safety of the LiquiBand FIX8 OHMF device</measure>
    <time_frame>0 (intra-operatively), up to 2 days (discharge from hospital) and 12-months post surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The incidence of adverse events (whether or not determined to be related to the LiquiBand FIX8 Device) will be recorded. Complications assessed during the study will include:
Haematoma
Seroma
Testicular ischaemia and atrophy
Surgical site or wound infection/dehiscence
Mesh infection
Chronic post-operative pain (lasting ≥ 12 months post-surgery</description>

    <measure>Assessment of acute post-operative pain using the Visual Analogue Scale: the minimal clinically important difference and patient acceptable symptom state.</measure>
    <time_frame>12-months post-surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Acute post-operative pain will be assessed using the following measures:
Improvement in post-operative pain from baseline to 12 months post-surgery as measured by the Visual Analogue Scale (0 = no pain to 10 = most pain imaginable); and
Analgesic requirements in the 12 months post-surgery</description>

    <measure>Long term performance of the study device</measure>
    <time_frame>12-months post surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Long-term performance will be assessed by rate of hernia recurrence.</description>

    <measure>Comparison of cost-effectiveness of patients treated with the LiquiBand FIX8 OHMF device compared with costs for those treated using standard surgical technique.</measure>
    <time_frame>12-months</time_frame>
    <description>A study-specific outcome model will be used, which will calculate an incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) in terms of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) achieved with the introduction of the LiquiBand FIX8 OHMF device compared with using a standard surgical technique (suture fixation).</description>

    <description>A study-specific outcome model will be used which will calculate an incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) given in terms of clinical events avoided achieved with the introduction of the LiquiBand FIX8 OHMF device compared with using a standard surgical technique (suture fixation).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinician satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>0 (Post Surgery) and upto 2 days (hospital discharge)</time_frame>
    <description>Users will be asked to rate the device on factors relating to ease of use and satisfaction, compared with their experience of other hernia mesh fixation devices. Satisfaction will be assessed using a Likert-type scale (e.g. Very satisfied (1), Satisfied (2), Neither (3), Dissatisfied (4), Very dissatisfied (5))</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Cosmesis of wound closure using the Visual Analogue Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>12-months</time_frame>
    <description>Cosmesis of the wound closure will be assessed by the investigator and patient, and measured by Visual Analogue Scale (0 = Very poor cosmetic outcome; to 10 = very good cosmetic outcome).</description>

          -  Subject has a primary inguinal hernia.

          -  Subject is scheduled to undergo open inguinal hernia repair using the LiquiBand FIX8®
             OHMF device.

          -  Subject is willing and able to comply with the protocol assessments at time of surgery

             surgery was also open. Subjects with recurrent hernia whose primary surgery was
             laparoscopic are not excluded.

          -  Subject has an anatomical defect or had prior surgical procedures that in the opinion
             of the investigator makes them unsuitable for open hernia repair with the LiquiBand
             FIX8® OHMF device.

          -  Subject is known to be non-compliant with medical treatment.

          -  Subject is pregnant or actively breastfeeding.

             the study.

          -  Subject has a known sensitivity to cyanoacrylate or formaldehyde, D&amp;C Violet No.2 dye
             or any other component of LiquiBand FIX8® OHMF device.

          -  The hernia mesh to be used in the repair is constructed from Polytetrafluoroethylene
             (PTFE) or absorbable materials.

          -  The hernia mesh to be used in the repair is a self-gripping mesh (e.g. ProGrip).

          -  Subject has active or potential infection at the surgical site.

          -  Subject has a history of keloid formation.

          -  Subject has a known vitamin C or zinc deficiency.

          -  Subject has a connective tissue disorder.
