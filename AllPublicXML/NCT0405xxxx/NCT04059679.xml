  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase IV, prospective biomarker study that will be conducted at Sinai Hospital of
      Baltimore. After screening for patients who were treated with aspirin, thirty patients will
      be treated with 81 mg enteric coated (EC) aspirin for 7 days in the &quot;lead-in&quot; period and then
      will be randomly treated with EC aspirin (81mg qd) or EC aspirin (81mg qd) plus rivaroxaban
      (2.5 mg bid) for 12 weeks. Platelet aggregation, soluble markers of platelet activation and
      inflammation, thrombin generation kinetics and tissue factor (TF)-induced platelet-fibrin
      clot strength will be assessed at baseline (after 7 days of treatment with 81 mg EC aspirin),
      and 4 and 12 weeks after randomization of the study drug administration.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria: to qualify, all subjects must meet have CAD and PAD as according to
        criteria specified below:

          -  Subjects meeting criteria for CAD$ must have one or more of the following:

          -  Myocardial infarction within the past 20 years, or

          -  Multivessel coronary disease* with symptoms or with history of stable or unstable
             angina, or

          -  Multivessel percutaneous coronary intervention, or

          -  Multivessel CABG surgery (* Refers to stenosis of ≥ 50% in 2 or more coronary
             arteries, confirmed using invasive coronary angiography, or noninvasive imaging or
             stress studies (eg, exercise or pharmacologic) suggestive of significant ischemia in 2
             ≥ coronary territories; or in 1 coronary territory if at least 1 other territory has
             been revascularized.)

        $Subjects with the qualifying criteria of CAD must also met at least one of the following
        criteria:

          -  Age &gt; 65 years, or

          -  Age &lt;65 years and documented atherosclerosis or revascularization involving at least 2
             vascular beds+, or at least 2 additional cardiovascular risk factors:

               5. Non-lacunar ischemic stroke &gt; 1 month ago

                    -  Because CAD involves disease in the coronary vasculature, only one
                       additional vascular bed is required: e.g. the aorta and arterial supply to
                       the brain, gastro-intestinal tract, lower limbs, upper limbs, or kidneys.

                         -  Subjects meeting criteria for PAD must have one or more of the
                            following

          -  Previous aorto-femoral bypass surgery, limb bypass surgery, or percutaneous
             transluminal angioplasty revascularization of the iliac, or infrainguinal arteries, or

          -  Previous limb or foot amputation for arterial vascular disease (i.e., excludes
             trauma), or

          -  History of intermittent claudication and one of the following

               -  An ankle/arm blood pressure (BP) ratio &lt; 0.90,

               -  Significant peripheral artery or venous stenosis of ≥50% documented by
                  angiography or by duplex ultrasound

               -  Previous carotid revascularization or asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis ≥ 50%
                  as diagnosed using duplex ultrasound or angiography.

                    -  Subject may be of either sex and of any race, and must be &gt;18 years of age.

                    -  Subject agrees to not participate in any other investigational or invasive
                       clinical study for a period of 4 months during the study period

                    -  The subject is able to read and has signed and dated the informed consent
                       document including authorization permitting release of personal health
                       information approved by the investigator's Institutional Review Board (IRB).

        Exclusion Criteria: Subjects will be excluded from entry if ANY of the criteria listed
        below are met:

          -  Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)&lt;15 mL/min

          -  Need for dual antiplatelet therapy, other non-aspirin antiplatelet therapy, or oral
             anticoagulant therapy

          -  Known non-cardiovascular disease that is associated with poor prognosis (e.g.,
             metastatic cancer) or that increases the risk of an adverse reaction to study
             interventions.

          -  History of hypersensitivity or known contraindication for rivaroxaban, aspirin, or its
             excipients. Systemic treatment with strong inhibitors of both CYP 3A4 and

             human immunodeficiency virus [HIV]-protease inhibitors, such as ritonavir), or strong
             inducers of CYP 3A4, i.e. rifampicin, rifabutin, phenobarbital, phenytoin, and
             carbamazepine.

          -  Participation in any investigational study within the last 60 days.

          -  Active liver disease or hepatic dysfunction, defined as AST or ALT &gt;3 x ULN as

             renal).

          -  Subjects with prosthetic heart valves.

          -  Known major active infection or major hematologic, renal, metabolic, gastrointestinal,
             or endocrine dysfunction in the judgment of the investigator.

          -  Malignancy (except non-melanoma skin cancers, cervical in situ carcinoma, breast
             ductal carcinoma in situ, or stage 1 prostate carcinoma) within the last 5 years.

          -  Subject is pregnant or breast feeding, or planning to become pregnant or to breastfeed

             treatment.

          -  Female subject who is unwilling to use at least 2 effective birth control methods for
             at least 1 month before screening and 15 weeks after the end of treatment with
             investigational products, unless the subject is sterilized or postmenopausal.

          -  Subject likely to not be available to complete all protocol-required study visits or
             procedures, to the best of the subject's and investigator's knowledge.

          -  History or evidence of any other clinically significant disorder, condition, or
             disease other than those outlined above that, in the opinion of the investigator, may
             compromise the ability of the subject to give written informed consent, would pose a
             risk to subject safety or interfere with the study evaluation, procedures, or
             completion.
