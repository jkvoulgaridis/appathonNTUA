      This study will use a socially assistive robot to deliver cognitive training in the form of a
      music (piano) learning intervention to socially isolated older adults with mild cognitive
      impairment.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cognitive training has been shown in past research to improve cognitive function in older
      adults with and without mild cognitive impairment. Music learning has been previously shown
      to be a particularly effective form of cognitive training: in addition to the cognitive
      demands of learning notation, hand positioning, coordination and timing, those who engage in
      music learning also benefit from emotional connection to the music and social engagement with
      a music teacher.

      Not all older adults are able to access music lessons. Older adults who are homebound, live
      in rural areas and do not have access to reliable transportation (or a monthly income with
      sufficient funds for recurring payments for lessons) are unlikely to be able to access these
      benefits. Socially assistive robots that can deliver both education and companionship on an
      ongoing basis within the home environment may be a viable solution to these limitations.

      The purpose of this study is to deliver cognitive training in the form of a music (piano)
      learning intervention to older adults who are socially isolated, and who may be able to
      benefit from the cognitive training aspects of the intervention. A socially assistive robot
      will deliver the intervention.
