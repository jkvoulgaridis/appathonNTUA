  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During the course of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), several complications can occur. One of
      these is the development of diastolic and systolic dysfunction (even in the absence of
      ischemic, valvular or hypertensive heart disease). Such cardiac dysfunction and adverse
      remodeling is more common in adolescents with T1DM with a worse glycemic control (as
      evidenced by higher blood glycated hemoglobin HbA1c) concentrations. Even though an
      association has been observed between higher blood HbA1c concentrations and a worse cardiac
      function/structure in adolescents with T1DM, less is known about the specific characteristics
      of the glucoregulation (e.g. number and duration of hyperglycemic or hypoglycemic episodes,
      age of onset of T1DM,..) in relation to cardiac function/structure in this population.
      Therefore, the first aim of this study is to identify specific parameters related to
      glucoregulation which correlate with cardiac function and structure in adolescent with T1DM.

      In T1DM, exercise training is generally recommended and included in the guidelines for the
      care of T1DM (due to beneficial effects on HbA1c levels, cardiovascular risk profile,..).
      However, as exercise training may increase the risk of hypoglycemic events, many patients may
      fear exercise, leading to inactivity or sedentarism. Logically, physical activity volumes are
      diverse in cohorts of this patient population, in which the long-term physically active T1DM
      patient will display an optimal or preserved cardiopulmonary exercise capacity, while a
      suboptimal cardiopulmonary exercise capacity will be noticed in mostly sedentary T1DM
      patients. The second aim of this study is to evaluate the association between cardiac
      function/structure and cardiopulmonary exercise capacity in adolescent T1DM patients (in the
      perspective of their physical activity behavior). This study thus may provide greater
      insights in the etiology and consequences of a disturbed cardiac function/structure in
      adolescents with T1DM.
