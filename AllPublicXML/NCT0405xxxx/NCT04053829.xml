  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will utilise an assessor blinded, randomised controlled design to investigate the
      acceptability and feasibility of providing a novel tele-rehabilitation balance training
      system (HOLOBalance) for community dwelling older adults at risk for falls. Older adults (age
      65-80) who meet the inclusion criteria (e.g. independently living, no neurological
      conditions) will be recruited from falls services and from the wider community (via AgeUK)
      and will be randomly allocated to receive either a prescribed exercise programme delivered
      by: 1) the HOLOBalance tele-rehabilitation system or 2) an exercise booklet (The OTAGO Home
      Exercise Programme). Participants will be required to perform a series of prescribed
      exercises each day (duration of up to 30 minutes per day) for the entirety of the 8-week
      exercise programme. These exercises will be provided via the HOLOBalance tele-rehabilitation
      system (intervention arm) or by written instructions (control arm).

      Primary objectives for this study are to assess recruitment rate, compliance with exercise
      programmes (exercise diaries) and drop-out rates within the intervention group and a control
      group undertaking standard practice, home based balance rehabilitation (the OTAGO Home
      Exercise Programme) to explore whether HOLOBalance is acceptable to participants.
      Furthermore, acceptability to older adults will also be investigated via exit interviews
      performed within the HOLOBalance tele-rehabilitation intervention arm.

      Feasibility will be assessed by documenting adverse events (and SAE's), adverse device
      effects (and SADE's), deviations from protocol and feedback from treating clinicians.
      Implementation issues such as technology break down, service delivery and usability issues
      will also be documented. Secondary outcomes to explore trends for effectiveness will
      investigate performance of both groups at baseline and after the 8 week intervention across a
      range of outcome measures associated with balance function and falls risk, cognitive
      function, Physical activity and social participation, and subjective report of mobility and
      balance.

    <intervention_model_description>This multi-centre, assessor-blinded, randomised proof of concept study will explore the acceptability and feasibility of providing a home-based balance tele-rehabilitation programme to older adults at risk for falls. It will 1) compare acceptability of the tele-health programme (e.g. compliance, drop-out rate) to an established home exercise programme (the OTAGO HEP) and 2) explore trends for effectiveness across a number of validated outcome measures to explore whether a future trial is warranted, and if so to provide data for a sample size estimate.
Data will be collected at baseline (week 0) and at completion of the intervention (week 9). The flow of participants through the trial will be recorded in compliance with the CONSORT statement. The blinded outcome assessor will collect all measures at baseline and follow up and will be asked to record any incidences of unblinding and detail how this occurred.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Falls Self-Efficacy Scale International. This is a short, easy to administer tool measuring an individual's level of concern regarding falling during social and physical activities inside and outside the home, whether or not the person actually does the activity. Level of concern is measured on a four-point Likert scale (1=not at all to 4=very). It has excellent internal validity and test-retest reliability. Scores of &gt;23 for the long form and &gt;10 for the short form have been suggested as cut points for indicating high concern about falling</description>

    <description>EQ-5D-5L. This is a standardized, valid and reliable simple, generic measure of health status for clinical and economic appraisal. The EQ-5D-5L has 5 dimensions (mobility, selfcare, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression) and includes the EQ visual Analogue scale (EQ VAS). The respondent is asked to rate their health status on these five dimensions from 1 to 5 respectively as no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, and extreme problems. The EQ VAS records the respondent's self-rated health on a 20 cm vertical, visual analogue scale with endpoints labeledlabelled 'the best health you can imagine' and 'the worst health you can imagine'. The respondent is asked to mark an X on the scale to indicate &quot;how your health is TODAY&quot;.</description>

    <description>Environmental Mobility Scale. This is a self-report scale assessing the effect of the physical environment on community mobility. Twenty-four features of the physical environment are identified. For each feature, an encounter question (How often do you?) is paired with an avoidance question (How often do you avoid?). Subjects report on frequency of encounter and avoidance behaviour using a five-point ordinal scale (never, rarely, sometimes, often, always). The test-retest reliability of the questionnaire is good.</description>

    <description>The comparator for this study is the OTAGO home exercise programme. The OTAGO is a systematic, progressive strength and balance training programme and is supported by a comprehensive workbook that provides written and pictorial instructions for each exercise. The OTAGO is well-established and is widely used in clinical practice in the UK for the management of older adults who fall or have increased risk for falling. It has been shown to be well tolerated in older adults in community settings with good adherence rates, and reduces falls rate in older adults by 35%, with greatest effects observed in frailer older women</description>

    <description>The HOLOBalance tele-rehabilitation system will be used to deliver an evidence based, multi-sensory balance rehabilitation programme to participants, and will deliver a series of exercises prescribed by an expert balance physiotherapist following an initial balance assessment.
The HOLOBalance system will use a head mounted augmented reality display to deliver exercises and games to participants and will record task performance via a combination of body worn sensors and a depth camera. The HOLOBalance tele-rehabilitation system will provide feedback to the supervising clinical team regarding task performance, participant usage and user feedback. The system will have daily presence in the users' home with users expected to complete their prescribed rehabilitation on a daily basis, which mirrors the prescribed exercise routines often provided by balance physiotherapists.</description>

    <description>The OTAGO is a systematic, progressive strength and balance training programme and is supported by a comprehensive workbook that provides written and pictorial instructions for each exercise. It is well-established and widely used in clinical practice in the UK, and has been shown to reduce falls rate in older adults by 35-40%. It is well tolerated in older adults in community settings with good adherence rates.The OTAGO has also been used as the standard intervention in previous investigations of MSR interventions in older adults. To match intervention and control interventions, participants in the OTAGO group will be asked to complete the OTAGO programme every day for the duration of the 8 week programme.</description>
