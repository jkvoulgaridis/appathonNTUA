      Controlled, open label, prospective Post Market Clinical Follow-Up, single-center clinical
      study to investigate visual performance after implantation of a trifocal IOL (PhysIOL Pod L
      GF) in patients that underwent refractive surgery.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This clinical investigation is a controlled, open label, prospective Post Market Clinical
      Follow-Up, single-center clinical study whereby patients undergoing routine cataract surgery
      that previously underwent refractive surgery prior to being screened will have bilateral
      implantation of trifocal intraocular lens FineVision POD L GF (PhysIOL, Li√®ge, Belgium).

      The study purpose is to collect clinical data on visual acuity, contrast sensitivity and
      patient reported outcomes obtained on patients with cataracts and/or suffering from
      presbyopia that underwent refractive surgery prior to the IOL implantation.

      The device under investigation (FineVision POD L GF) is a trifocal glistening-free
      hydrophobic acrylic intraocular lens (IOL) manufactured by the sponsor of this study PhysIOL
      sa/nv. The IOL will be implanted as part of the routine cataract surgery on patients
      suffering from cataract development.

      In total 28 patients will be recruited for this clinical study and receive a bilateral
      implantation of FineVision POD L GF intraocular lens.

      Subjects participating in the trial will attend a total of 9 study visits (1 preoperative, 2
      operative and 6 postoperative) over a period of 6 months.

    <description>The slitlamp examination is one examination to analyse the integrity of eye structures and the implanted IOL. The examination is performed and documented according to the guidelines in ISO 11979-7:2018.
With the slitlamp the ophthalmologist can observe the eyes stereoscopically. A focussed slit of light, which can be width-adjusted, is projected on the eye to be examined. The investigator observes this projection on the eye through a reflected light microscope. The slitlamp is used to observe the anterior and posterior part of the eye, including cornea, lens and anterior chamber. By dilating the pupil the fundus can also be examined. Following conditions shall be examined with the slitlamp:

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Cataracteous eyes with no comorbidity;

          -  Post LASIK, post PRK/surface ablation or post RK (radial keratotomy) patients with day
             of refractive surgery minimum 24 months before IOL implantation;

          -  Calculated IOL power is within the range of the study IOLs;

          -  Fulfill CHRU (Centre Hospitalier Regional Universitaire) internal criteria for
             multifocal lenses implantation on post-refractive surgery patients.

          -  Male or female adults ages 45 years or older on the day of screening who have
             cataract(s) in one or both eyes or suffer from presbyopia;

          -  Clear intraocular media other than cataract;

          -  Availability, willingness and sufficient cognitive awareness to comply with
             examination procedures;

          -  Signed informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Age of patient &lt; 45 years;

          -  Irregular topographic examination where limitation in clinical outcomes are expected.

          -  Patients that underwent presbyopia correcting refractive surgery (e.g. PresbyLASIK,
             SUPRACOR, INTRACOR)

          -  Subjects with diagnosed degenerative visual disorders (e.g. macular degeneration or
             other retinal or optic disorders) that are predicted to cause future acuity losses to
             a level of 20/30 or worse;

          -  Subjects with AMD suspicious eyes as determined by OCT examination;

          -  Subjects who may be expected to require retinal laser treatment during the course of
             the study or at a greater risk of developing cystoid macular edema;

          -  Traumatic cataract;

          -  History or presence of macular edema;

          -  Concurrent or previous (within 30 days) participation in another drug or device
             investigation;

          -  Instability of keratometry or biometry measurements;

          -  Ocular hypertension or glaucoma;

          -  Significant dry eye;

          -  Unsuitable for study participation for any other reason, as determined by
             Investigator's clinical judgement (reason to be documented on the CRF).
