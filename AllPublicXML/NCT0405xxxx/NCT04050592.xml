  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although the impact of postmenopausal hormone therapy (HT) on cardiovascular disease risk has
      been studied in several large randomized trials, little is known about the acute
      cardiovascular consequences of HT discontinuation. In this randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled trial, the investigators will compare the cardiovascular consequences of
      abrupt and tapered modes of HT discontinuation in 150 Finnish healthy postmenopausal women
      under age 60 years. The primary outcome is brachial artery flow-mediated dilatation. In
      addition, biochemical markers will be measured during the study period of 20 weeks.
      Health-related quality of life, frequency of hot flush recurrence and other menopausal
      symptoms will be also assessed in these groups. The trial will provide new high-quality
      information about the cardiovascular safety as well as the correct timing and method of HT
      discontinuation.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (FMD)</measure>
    <time_frame>8 and 14 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome in this study is brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (FMD) to assess endothelial function. To induce reactive hyperemia, a sphygmomanometer cuff is placed on the forearm and inflated to a suprasystolic pressure for five minutes, after which the cuff is deflated. The brachial artery diameter is measured at baseline and during reactive hyperemia, and the relative change in diameter (in millimeters) is calculated. We measure FMD at baseline (at study week 5) and after HT discontinuation (at study weeks 13 and 19).</description>

    <description>Participants will keep a symptom diary reporting the exact number, severity and timing of hot flashes during three periods each lasting three weeks: the first period at baseline, the second starting on the 10th week and the third starting on the 18th week. Based on the diary notes, we can assess, how frequent, severe and durable the symptoms are during each period.</description>

In the second part of the questionnaire, there is a visual analogue scale ranging from 0, &quot;worst imaginable health state&quot;, to 100, &quot;best imaginable health state&quot;. Thus, the participant receives from 0 to 100 points from this part of the questionnaire.</description>
