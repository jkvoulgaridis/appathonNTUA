  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Wound infections are a frequent complication in abdominal surgery. The investigators
      hypothesize that the antiseptic solution 0.04 % polyhexanide (serasept) may reduce occurrence
      of postoperative wound infections compared to NaCL (saline) solution in a prospective
      randomized setting.

      Invstigator initiated monocenter randomized controlled trial. Intraoperative irrigation of
      subcutaneous tissue with NaCl (saline) solution or antiseptic solution 0.04 % polyhexanide
      (Serasept) in elective abdominal surgery. Primary endpoint: SSI 30 days postoperatively
      according to CDC criteria.

    <description>Intervention: after closure of abdominal fascia, an intraoperative irrigation of the subcutaneous tissue with 250 ml antiseptic solution (0.04% polyhexanide) will be done once for ten minutes.
No subcutaneous suture. Closure of skin with either staples, interrupted sutures or running suture.</description>

    <description>Experimental arm: irrigation of subcutaneous tissue after fascia closure with polihexanide (ten minutes).
A single dose of perioperative antibiotics (cefuroxim alone or cefuroxim and metrodidazole in bowel surgeries) was given 30 minutes before skin incision.
Hair removal was done with electronic clippers and preoperative skin antisepsis was performed with propanol and povidone-iodine.
Before closure of fascia, instruments and gloves were changed. No subcutaneous suture was used. Skin was closed either with skin staples, continuous intracutaneous suture or interrupted suture.
All surgeries were done according to the Standard Operating Procedures of the Department for General, Visceral and Vascular Surgery, Charité Campus Benjamin Franklin.</description>
