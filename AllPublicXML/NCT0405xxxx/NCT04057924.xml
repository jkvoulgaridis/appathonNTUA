  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study proposes to describe and evaluate the rate of spontaneous regression of CIN2 at 2
      year of follow up in women between 18 and 39 year old. This follow-up is proposed as an
      alternative to the treatment of reference (conization) with a possible extension to 4 years

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The INCa recommendations of December 2016 propose the destruction or abstention-monitoring of
      high-grade histological cervical lesions (HSIL) as an alternative to conization under certain
      conditions. These are women under 30 years old, with a small lesion in colposcopy, without
      any sign of invasion, with a squamocolumnar junction seen. These women must accept the
      principle of regular monitoring by cytology and colposcopy +/- biopsy every 6 months for a
      maximum of 2 years. HSIL group 2 histological entities CIN2 and CIN3. It is recognized that
      CIN2 are associated with CIN1 and CIN3 biology whose diagnosis is the result of the
      subjectivity of colposcopy allowing cervical biopsy and the variability of pathological
      interpretation due to poor reproducibility of histological diagnosis. CIN2 regress
      spontaneously in more than 50% of cases at 1 year, either completely (no lesion) or partially
      (LSIL low grade lesions). No invasive lesions are diagnosed over 2-year observation periods.
      Among the clinical, pathological and virological criteria, only the initial HPV genotyping
      seems to have a prognostic influence. There is therefore no strong scientific argument for
      routine conization in a woman over 30 years of age with a CIN2 lesion extended over more than
      two quadrants. In addition, conization is associated with an obstetrical risk (prematurity)
      and post-therapeutic colposcopic cervical stenosis complicates subsequent monitoring in case
      of abnormal smears. These considerations encourage the extension of the indications of
      abstention monitoring in the management of women with CIN2 wishing to procreate with an
      extension of the age to 39 year old, with no limit of size of the lesion and to satisfactory
      colposcopy
