    <textblock>
      In patients with chronic pulmonary disease, impaired pulmonary function and limited exercise
      capacity, is a complex clinical syndrome with a wide range of underlying causes, which may
      result in worse quality of life and high economic burden. This is a longitudinal study of
      following chronic pulmonary disease patients, recording the clinical, pathophysiology, and
      psychological parameters, to observe and predict the clinical outcomes of these patients.
