  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many patients with fibromyalgia have little understanding of their condition, leading to
      maladaptive pain cognitions and coping strategies. Current research has suggested the use of
      physiotherapy and rehabilitation in addition to cognitive patient education in the treatment
      of fibromyalgia syndrome. This study aimed to explore the effectiveness of pain neuroscience
      education in patients with fibromyalgia.

    <description>A total of 4 NPE (Neuroscience paine education) sessions were held, once each week in addition medical treatment similar to control group. The NPE sessions were conducted by an experienced physiotherapist certified in NPE in face-to-face, group sessions lasting 40-45 minutes. In NPE, the patient is taught about the physiology of pain, central sensitization, representation of the different body regions in the brain, pain-related changes in body perception, and the psychosocial dimensions of pain.</description>
