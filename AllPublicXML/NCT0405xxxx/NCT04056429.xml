  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical study is being conducted to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the
      Bone Healing Accelerant (BHA) product when applied to tibia (leg bone) fractures with an
      external wound or skin break (also called open tibia fractures). It is hypothesized that by 6
      months, the number of subjects with successful bone healing will be greater in the
      BHA-treated group compared to subjects treated with standard of care alone. Open tibia
      fractures were chosen for this study because healing rates are typically longer than for
      other bone fractures due to the limited vascular supply, limited soft tissue coverage, and
      higher risk of infection.

A binary (Yes/No) outcome for overall healing will be derived from the following three outcomes: Radiographic healing as measured by a score of at least 13 on the modified Radiographic Union Scale in Tibia fractures (mRUST, range bad to good 1-16), ambulation as measured by a score of at least 2 on the Function IndeX for Trauma scale (range bad to good 0-3), and no secondary intervention to promote bone healing. All three components must be met for a &quot;yes&quot; on composite healing.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patient is between the ages of 18-75 inclusive at time of randomization. Patient has an
        acute open Gustilo-Anderson Type IIIA or IIIB fracture of the tibia shaft, with or without
        a fibula fracture, secondary to trauma.

        Patient received antibiotic treatment within 2 hours of presentation at initial medical
        facility.

        Patient underwent their first operative debridement within 24 hours of presentation at
        initial medical facility.

        Patient is scheduled to have DWC within 14 days of initial injury. The tibia fracture
        requires open fracture reduction and internal fixation with intramedullary (IM) nailing;

        - IM nailing has been cross-locked for stability with a 4-5mm interlock, with a minimum of
        1 static screw above the fracture site and 1 static screw below the fracture site, and All
        IM nails have a diameter between 8.5-12mm with 1.0-1.5mm over-reaming of the canal.

        The temporary use of external fixation prior to IM rodding and DWC is allowed.

        Upon stabilization of the tibia fracture, the patient has a cortical deficit of less than
        or equal to 1.0cm involving no more than 50% of the tibia circumference. The cortical
        deficit of the residual 50% circumference must be less than 1.0cm. Gap assessments to be
        made with calibrated radiographs or visual inspection. In addition, patients are not likely
        to require a secondary procedure(s) to promote bone healing.

        BHA is able to be applied through existing soft tissue defects created by the injury or
        those created during surgical treatment. No new incisions should be required specifically
        for application of BHA.

        Patient is willing and able to comply with all study procedures including all
        pre-operative, post-operative and rehabilitation requirements.

        Patient is able to give voluntary IC to participate and has signed an IC form specific to
        this study prior to study treatment and DWC.

        Patients of childbearing potential must use adequate methods of contraception during the
        duration of follow-up (12-months). Adequate methods include abstinence, female and male
        sterilization, hormonal contraceptives, intrauterine devices (IUDs), implants, injectables,
        and double barrier methods.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Patients who are currently participating in another investigational trial or having
        participated in a clinical investigation within the last 90 days or intend to during the
        course of the study.

        Patients who are currently prisoners. Patients who are unable to give informed consent.
        Patients who are skeletally immature (&lt;18 years of age or radiographic evidence of open
        tibial physes).

        Patients with Type I, II, or IIIC open tibia fractures according to the Gustilo-Anderson
        classification.

        Current injury is a pathological fracture. Patients with additional injuries that could
        impact their ability to complete the required assessments and postoperative rehabilitation.

        Patients with immune deficiency or history of auto-immune disease.

        Patients with an active malignancy or a history of any invasive malignancy (except
        non-melanoma skin cancer), unless the patient has been treated with curative intent and
        there have been no clinical signs or symptoms of malignancy for at least 5 years.

        Patients with any medical condition or life circumstances that in the surgeon's opinion
        could impact their ability to return for follow-up visits and/or complete the required
        assessments and postoperative rehabilitation.

        Patients who are known to have anaphylactic or severe systemic reaction to human blood
        products, genipin, Î²-TCP, glycerin or to other components of the investigative product
        formulation.

        Female patients of child-bearing potential who meet any of the following criteria:

        Patient is currently pregnant (prior diagnosis or a positive pregnancy test at baseline),
        or planning to become pregnant any time during the course of the study Currently
        breastfeeding or planning to breastfeed at any time during the course of the study Upon
        stabilization of the tibia fracture, the patient has a bone gap greater than 1.0cm apparent
        by calibrated radiographs or by visual inspection and/or the patient is highly likely to
        require secondary intervention procedure(s), surgical or nonsurgical (e.g., bone
        stimulation or ultrasound treatment) for the index fracture.

        Patients who have mal-alignment post-IM nailing of &gt;10Â° in the coronal plane or &gt;15Â° in the
        sagittal plane.

        Patients who received only plates and screws for tibia fracture stabilization. At the time
        of the DWC surgery, patients who have a planned secondary intervention procedure, surgical
        or nonsurgical (e.g., bone stimulation or ultrasound treatment) for the index fracture.

        Patients being treated with any form of local antibiotics at the time of DWC.
