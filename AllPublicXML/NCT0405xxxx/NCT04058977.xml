  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients surviving critical illness experience significant skeletal muscle dysfunction and
      weakness. Muscle atrophy suffered during critical illness has a long-term impact on the
      functionality and mobility of these individuals. As a result, individuals surviving critical
      illness have a significant reduction in quality of life, even up to 5 years post discharge.
      Research including large randomized controls demonstrates that rehabilitation focused on
      active mobilization may positively influence patient outcomes. Thus, early mobilization is an
      important intervention that has many purported benefits. Current rehabilitation practice in
      the intensive care unit (ICU) and recommendations from clinical practice guidelines such as
      the Society of Critical Care Medicine, PADIS Guidelines support these interventions to reduce
      the detrimental effects of immobilization during critical illness. Early mobilization is
      routinely thought of as standard of care for patients admitted for acute respiratory distress
      syndrome and sepsis. However, a significant number of recent randomized controlled trials
      implementing early rehabilitation and mobilization interventions fail to demonstrate
      immediate or long-term benefits.10,11,18,19 Interesting, active mobilization and
      rehabilitation analyzed in systematic review had no impact on mortality and &quot;no consistent
      effects of function, quality of life and ICU or hospital length of stay.&quot;18 There are a few
      potential explanations for interventions not leading to reduction in impairment or functional
      benefit.

      Scientific Premise: From our preliminary data (Figure 1) and my clinical experience, a
      significant cause of the physical impairments in these patients is reductions in muscular
      power. Muscular power is a critical determinant of functional mobility.20 Preliminary data
      demonstrate that lower extremity muscle power is significantly reduced in this population and
      furthermore, these deficits are strongly correlated to physical function. Muscle power
      training is a potential therapeutic intervention that could lead to more robust improvements
      in physical function. This concept has been explored extensively in community-dwelling older
      adults. A recent systematic review of controlled trials demonstrates that power training is
      superior to traditional resistance training at improving functional performance when
      comparing the two training modalities.21 Furthermore, power training is feasible for older
      adults and clinical populations of Parkinson's Disease, Stroke, and frailty.22-27 Thus the
      feasibility and pragmatic nature of power training is not a concern. Of interest, a
      randomized controlled trial was completed in institutionalized frail nonagenarians (&gt;85 years
      or older).27 In this study, no patients drop-out of study due to power training and
      significant benefits in function were achieved.27 Therefore, the investigators propose a
      interventional trial to study the effect of a standardized muscle power training program for
      patients admitted to the ICU for critical illness.

    <time_frame>6-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>This outcome measure is scored from 0-12 with lower scores representing disability and higher scores representing better physical function. This test has three components including balance, chair rise time, and habitual gait speed. There is a pre-defined scoring system with participants scoring 0-4 on each test, higher representing better function.
These individual components can then be further analysed based on continuous variables of five repetitions of chair rise and habitual 4-meter gait speed. Faster times to complete the the chair-rise test and faster gait speed represents better physical function.</description>

    <description>The Eq-5d is a validate quality of life questionnaire that the participant completes. It has five components each on a scale from 1 to 5, which higher scores representing poor or worse quality of life. A total score can be assessed out of possible 25.</description>

    <description>The 6-mwt is a test of physical function and strength in which participant walks as far as possible in six-minutes. Final distance is analysed as a continuous variable with higher distances being better.</description>
