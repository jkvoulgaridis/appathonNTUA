    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blinded, 2 arms study concerning patients with bone sarcoma
      after the first line therapy.

      In the first arm, patients will be treated with regorafenib for a maximum of 12 months as
      maintenance therapy after first line therapy (chemotherapy and surgery), whereas in the
      second arm, patients will be treated with placebo (standard of care).

      The comparison between this two arms will allow to determine whether or not regorafenib is
      efficient for disease control, in terms of Relapse-Free Survival improvement.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bone sarcomas are rare primary bone cancers, although, their frequency has been increasing by
      0.3% per year over the last decade. They include a very large number of tumour types
      belonging to the family of primary malignant bone tumours and originate from bone as
      Osteosarcomas (OS), Chondrosarcomas (CS), Fibrosarcomas, Chordomas, …

      Current conventional treatments for OS combine chemotherapy and surgery. Compared with
      surgery alone, multimodal treatment of high-grade sarcomas increases disease-free survival
      probabilities from only 10%-20% to 50-65% depending on the bone sarcoma type. In general,
      despite second-line treatment, the prognosis of recurrent disease has remained poor, with
      long-term post-relapse survival of &lt;20%.

      The outcome of bone sarcoma has been dramatically improved by the addition of chemotherapy in
      the 70' and 80' but has remained remarkably stable in the last 3 decades, with a survival
      rate largely plateaued, despite introduction of novel regimens, both in localized and
      metastatic disease, in children and in adults. Primary bone cancer presented challenges in
      new drug development partly because of their rarity and heterogeneity. Thus, improving
      treatments for these diseases is a high priority, but advances have been few in recent years.
      In this context, maintenance therapy may be an interesting option as a way to prolong the
      benefit of first-line chemotherapy.

      Regorafenib may play a role in the maintenance setting for bone sarcomas (as improved
      Progression-Free Survival and sustained responses were observed in the REGOBONE study) in
      maintaining the initial response to chemotherapy and delaying the need for further treatment
      at relapse, while exerting a manageable associated toxicity and minimal negative impact on
      health-related quality of life.

      Currently there is no available agent used as maintenance therapy after first-line
      chemotherapy. In the context of a clinical trial with close monitoring, it is, thus,
      acceptable to consider a placebo-control group.

      On this basis, this study propose to conduct a double-blinded randomized controlled trial to
      evaluate the efficacy of regorafenib versus placebo in the treatment of patients with bone
      sarcomas, who have no evidence of disease after neoadjuvant and/or adjuvant chemotherapies.

      The main goal of the present study is then to explore whether sequential addition of
      regorafenib after completion of a standard induction chemotherapy in patients with bone
      sarcomas would improve outcomes in term of event-free-survival (EFS) defined by local or
      distant recurrence of the disease.

      Results will be stratified on the &quot;high-risk&quot; versus &quot;low-risk&quot; of relapse. As response to
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy and metastatic status at time of diagnosis are known to be important
      on patient's outcome, stratification will rely on a combined criteria taking into account
      these two factors. Thus, &quot;high-risk&quot; of relapse will be defined by the group of patients who
      are poor responders to neoadjuvant chemotherapy and/or in metastatic setting at diagnosis,
      whereas &quot;low-risk&quot; of relapse will be defined by the group of patients who have no metastatic
      disease at time of diagnosis and are good responders to neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

    <measure>Relapse-Free Survival (RFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>RFS will be defined as the time from randomization to relapse, or death from any cause, whichever occurs first. Patients alive without relapse at the time of the analysis will be censored at the date of last tumour assessment. The Kaplan-Meier approach will be used to estimate median RFS for each study arm. The two-sided log-rank test, stratified on randomization stratification factors, will be used to compare RFS between the investigational arm and the control arm. The stratified Cox-regression (with proportional hazards) will be used to estimate the hazard ratio and to calculate the 95% confidence intervals of the hazard ratio.</description>

    <measure>Time to Treatment Failure (TTF)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>TTF will be defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of permanent discontinuation of the study treatment, whichever is the cause. Patient not known to have withdrawn treatment before 12 months (study treatment duration) will be censored at the time of treatment stop. TTF survival will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method, and will be described in terms of medians along with the associated 2-sided 95% confidence interval for the estimates.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Survival (OS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>OS will be defined as the time from date of randomization to the date of death, from any cause. Patient not known to have died at the time of analysis will be censored based on the last recorded date on which the patient was known to be alive. OS survival will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method, and will be described in terms of medians along with the associated 2-sided 95% confidence interval for the estimates.</description>

    <measure>Patient's Quality of Life (QoL)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>The patient's Quality of Life will be assessed using the EORTC QLQ-C30. Scores will be calculated at each time point according to the scoring manuals. Descriptive statistics will be used to evaluate baseline scores and evolution of scores from baseline to each time point (Every 3 months since baseline, then every 4 months after second year surveillance). Data will be compared between arms using the Student's t-test. The QoL data will also be presented graphically if deemed relevant.</description>
