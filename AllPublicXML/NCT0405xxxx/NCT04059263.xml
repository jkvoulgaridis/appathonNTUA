  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sepsis, a multi organ failure caused by infectious diseases, is a major health burden with an
      average mortality rate of 26%. Cells of the innate immune system of hosts recognize specific
      patterns of pathogenic bacteria and trigger an inflammatory response. In case of sepsis, this
      inflammatory response takes a deregulated course, expressing an overwhelming amount of
      pro-inflammatory cytokines leading to a loosening of endothelial tight junctions, evasion of
      intravasal fluids and proteins into the interstitium, as well as direct tissue damage
      throughout an overproduction of reactive oxygen species by neutrophils. These pathological
      changes of the host's proper immune system lead to a multi organ failure, which characterize
      a clinical pathomechanism of sepsis. Several studies confirmed an immunomodulatory effect of
      sevoflurane's primary metabolite hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP) attenuating pro-inflammatory
      cytokine expression with a consecutive improvement of organ function and survival in rodent
      models of sepsis. Until now, there are no data available confirming this effect in septic
      patients as well. With this study, the direct impact of sevoflurane's primary metabolite HFIP
      on cytokine expression in the blood of septic patients will be investigated for the first
      time.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients admitted to the emergency ward with suspicion of infection and a qSOFA Score
             ≥ 2 points (Respiratory frequency &gt; 22/minute, Systolic blood pressure &lt; 100 mmHg,
             Glasgow Coma Scale &lt; 15).

          -  Male and Female subjects with at least 18 years of age.

          -  Written informed consent by the participant after information about the project. In
             emergency cases where a written consent cannot be obtained immediately, due to the
             patient's medical conditions, the existence of a patient decree and of a
             representative in the emergency situation is evaluated according to the Swiss Civil
             Code. Informed consent will be obtained from the representative. A medical doctor,
             furthermore, not participating in the investigation, guarantees the medical care of
             the patient by the defending of his/her interests. After recovery, the patient will be
             informed as soon as possible about the trial and consent is requested.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome

          -  Anti-IL-6 therapy (e.g. Kevzara®) within the last 60 days

          -  Application of a cytokine absorber

          -  Pregnancy and/or Breast feeding
