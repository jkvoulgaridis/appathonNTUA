    <textblock>
      Participants will be 18-59 years old who are recruited through a convenience sample from the
      UMHB/Belton community. There will be a randomized control trial consisting of three groups.
      Each participant will be assigned based on their order of entry to the study group assignment
      and then randomly organized via computer generation into 3 groups of 20 participants
      including a control group, a dry needling group (DN), and a dry needling E-stim group
      (DN-ES), resulting in approximately 60 total participants. Participants in the DN and DN-ES
      groups will be treated four times; at weeks 0, 2, 4 and 6 of the study. Data will be
      collected at weeks 4, 6 and 12 in all groups.

      Interventions per group:

      Control: none

      DN: 20-30 seconds of DN per trigger point in each involved trapezius muscle, needles rest in
      situ 10 min, needles removed.

      DN-ES: 20-30 seconds of DN per trigger point (TrP) in each involved trapezius muscle, DC ES
      attached to needles crossing the most reactive TrP and current set to strong, but comfortable
      intensity at 10 MHz for 10 min, needles removed.

It is reported as a whole number out of 10, and multiple ratings, i.e. worst, average, and best pain scores over the past 48 hours, can be averaged and reported as a single score.</description>

    <description>Between group difference in within group disability changes. The NDI is a questionnaire with 10 items including personal care, pain, reading, lifting, headaches, concentration, sleeping, work, driving, and recreation. Each section is scored on a 0 to 5 rating scale. Zero means 'No pain' and 5 means 'Worst imaginable pain'. Al the points can be summed to a total score. The test can be reported as a raw score, with a maximum score of 50, or as a percentage.</description>

    <description>One to three filament needles (similar to an acupuncture needle) with no medication will be inserted into the trigger point(s) of the muscle. The needles will be repositioned a few times to make the muscle twitch (local twitch response). After several twitches occur, the researcher will leave the needles as they are, and the subject will lie on a treatment table without moving arms or head, for 10 minutes. After 10 minutes the needles are removed and discarded.</description>

The needles will be repositioned a few times to make the muscle twitch (local twitch response). After several twitches occur, the researcher will leave the needles as they are, and attach alligator clips to the needles to provide electrical stimulus for 10 minutes while the subject lies on a treatment table without moving arms or head. After 10 minutes, the electrical stimulus will be turned off and detached, and the needles removed and discarded.</description>
