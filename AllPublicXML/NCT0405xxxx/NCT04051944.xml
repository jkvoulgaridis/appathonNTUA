    <description>An Adverse Event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product, which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE could therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject who has completed one of the previous rozanolixizumab study(ies) that allow
             access to the present study (e.g. study CIDP01)

          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential must agree to use a highly effective method
             of birth control, during the study and for a period of 3 months after their final dose
             of investigational medicinal product (IMP)

          -  Male subjects with a partner of childbearing potential must be willing to use a condom
             when sexually active during the study and for 3 months after the final administration
             of IMP

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has any medical (acute or chronic illness) or psychiatric condition that, in
             the opinion of the investigator, could harm the subject or would compromise the
             subject's ability to participate in this study

          -  Subject has a clinically relevant active infection (eg, sepsis, pneumonia, abscess)

          -  Subject has a known hypersensitivity to any components of rozanolixizumab

          -  Subject intends to have a live vaccination during the course of the study or within 7
             weeks following the final dose of rozanolixizumab

          -  Subject has an ongoing serious adverse event (SAE) or a medical condition in the
             parent study that the investigator considers to put the subject at a significantly
             increased risk of participating in CIDP04

          -  Subject has any planned elective surgery due to occur during the study dosing period
             which in the opinion of the investigator could interfere with study procedures

    <ipd_description>Data from this study may be requested by qualified researchers six months after product approval in the US and/or Europe, or global development is discontinued, and 18 months after trial completion. Investigators may request access to anonymized IPD and redacted study documents which may include: raw datasets, analysis-ready datasets, study protocol, blank case report form, annotated case report form, statistical analysis plan, dataset specifications, and clinical study report. Prior to use of the data, proposals need to be approved by an independent review panel at www.clinicalstudydatarequest.com and a signed data sharing agreement will need to be executed. All documents are available in English only, for a pre-specified time, typically 12 months, on a password protected portal. This plan may change if a determination is made that the data cannot be adequately anonymized.</ipd_description>
