  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      All ceramic crowns are indicated in case of mild to moderate discoloration, restoration of
      traumatized or fractured teeth and abnormal tooth anatomy. The success of dental restorations
      is determined by four main factors: biocompatibility, aesthetic value, resistance to fracture
      and marginal adaptation. . An inadequate marginal fit may compromise the longevity of the
      restoration since cement film exposure to the oral environment can lead to its dissolution .
      .

      Polyetheretherketone (PEEK) is a polymer that has many potentials uses in dentistry.
      Polyetheretherketone (PEEK) can be used to support fixed dental prostheses. However,
      information about physio mechanical characterization is still scarce.

      Aim of the study:

      - The aim of this study is to evaluate the internal fit of milled BioHPP PEEK-based versus
      zirconia-based single crowns.
