  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test whether oxalate stimulates urinary crystals and impacts the immune
      system in healthy subjects using two controlled diets (low and high oxalate).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Oxalate is a small molecule found in plants and plant-derived food. It has been shown that
      meals containing high amounts of oxalate can increase urinary oxalate excretion, which is a
      risk factor for calcium oxalate kidney stones (CaOx KS). Small increases in oxalate can
      stimulate urinary crystals to form which can elicit an immune response. This study consists
      of having healthy subjects consume both low and oxalate enriched diets to evaluate the effect
      of oxalate on urinary crystals and immune responses. Participants will receive a low or high
      oxalate diet for 4 days prior to having a wash out period for 6 days. Participants will then
      crossover to the opposite oxalate diet for four more days.

    <description>Subjects will consume a low oxalate diet for four days, with blood and 24-hour urine collections occurring at baseline and post diet. A six day wash out period will follow, during which the subject will consume the low oxalate diet. Subjects will then consume the high oxalate diet for the final four days, with blood and 24-hour urine collections once again occurring at baseline and post diet.</description>
