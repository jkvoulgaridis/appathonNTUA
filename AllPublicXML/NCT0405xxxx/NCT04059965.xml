  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anticoagulants are a leading cause of acute injury from adverse drug events, leading to
      ~20,000 serious injuries reported to the Food and Drug Administration per year and more than
      220,000 emergency department visits annually. Therefore, we propose to implement a health
      information technology (HIT) population management tool at two distinct anticoagulation
      clinics that will allow the care team to assign and track tasks essential for timely patient
      monitoring. We will examine its effect on anticoagulation management outcomes through a
      randomized trial, hypothesizing that such interventions can be effective as well as
      cost-effective strategies to improve patient safety in the context of anticoagulation
      management services.
