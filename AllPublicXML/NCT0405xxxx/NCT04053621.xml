  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic non-infectious diseases have a bigger impact and a higher prevalence every day
      world-wide. Among them, diabetes stands out being the number one cause of death from
      degenerative chronic illness in Mexico. Diabetes not only affects quality of life, it can
      also lead to severe complications that have a great economic impact as well as a health
      impact on the patient and their family. Some of the complications include liver failure and
      hypertension. This whole problem can be dated back to an initial hyperglycemic state that
      when left untreated further develops into insulin resistance, chronic inflammation, metabolic
      syndrome and diabetes. The purpose of this study is to stop this chain reaction that starts
      with every hyperglycemic patient by adding thiamine pyrophosphate to the treatment plan of
      patients diagnosed with type 2 diabetes that are poorly managed with metformin monotherapy.
      Thiamine pyrophosphate is a form of B1 vitamin that plays an important role as a coenzyme in
      multiple metabolic routes including the link between glycolysis and Krebs cycle, fatty acids
      metabolism and branched-chain amino acid metabolism. By doing so, these pathways improve
      their function and efficiency and thereby utilize plasma glucose. This in turn, decreases the
      formation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) which prevents the formation of reactive
      oxygen and nitrogen species, ultimately there is also an anti-oxidative mechanism involved
      that improves the inflammatory state the patient is living with. Our hypothesis is that by
      adding thiamine pyrophosphate to the treatment of patients taking metformin, there will be
      important progress regarding the inflammatory and metabolic control of patients with type 2
      diabetes.

      The study will have a duration of approximately 4 months after the total sample is recruited.
      During this time, subjects will first be examined to determine their eligibility according to
      the pre-established criteria, in case of inclusion in the study they will sign an informed
      consent after reading it thoroughly and having answered all their questions. Baseline labs
      will be taken for every subject for future comparison. They will then be randomized into two
      parallel groups: an experimental group that will receive weekly infusions of saline infused
      with 1 gram of thiamine pyrophosphate or a placebo group that will also receive weekly
      infusions of pure saline. The patients as well as the doctors treating them will be blinded
      to the assignment of either group. This model will be carried out for a duration of 12 weeks
      total, during which every patient will continue their metformin treatment with their
      tolerated dose. There will be verification of treatment adherence by counting the metformin
      pills during every weekly visit. For the assessment of dependent variables there will be a
      visit every month with a blinded doctor. These visits will be for: physical and clinical
      evaluation, evaluation of adverse events, evaluation of treatment adherence and a heart rate
      variability study. The first and third months a questionnaire about lifestyle will be added
      to the visit schedule. On the third month, final lab tests will be performed. Finally, one
      month after completing the treatment, a final visit will be scheduled for a clinical and
      physical evaluation to make sure there are no problems.
