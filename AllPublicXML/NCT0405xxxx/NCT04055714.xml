    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to demonstrate that balloon dilation of the Eustachian tubes
      can be done successfully for treatment of chronic dilatory Eustachian tube dysfunction under
      local anesthesia with acceptable patient discomfort levels.

      This study is a prospective, non-significant risk, multi-center trial of patients with
      Eustachian tube dysfunction who are refractory to medical management. Patients will undergo
      balloon dilation of the Eustachian tubes in the office under local anesthesia. We will assess
      assess the peri-procedural and post-procedure pain levels, and determine the proportion of
      subjects experiencing normalization of tympanometry and improvement in quality of of life at
      6 weeks, 12 weeks, and 52 weeks post-treatment.

             palatini failure, severe dysfunction) as assessed by endoscopic observation of
             swallows and yawns

         21. Treatment is planned for one ear, but the opposite ear has normal (Type A) tympanogram
             and the subject complains of ETD symptoms in that ear

         22. Treatment is planned for one ear, but the opposite ear has abnormal (Type B or C)
