      Compare wait list mortality and time to liver, heart or kidney transplant for registrants
      listed to consider allografts from Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) Nucleic Amplification Testing
      (NAT)+ donors versus those who are not . The umbrella protocol has been set up to include
      heart and kidney transplant recipients.

      The research project will take place within each transplant center and can be incorporated
      into routine pre- and post-transplant care (i.e., no extra visits are needed). Enrolling in
      this study will enable patients to accept offers of HCV NAT+ livers, in addition to the
      regular waitlist. All other transplant eligibility criteria have to be met per routine care.
      The multi-site project will establish a biorepository and prospective data collection with
      the goal of obtaining more generalizable results than single-center studies alone can.

      Patients who enroll in the study but receive an HCV- organ instead, will be (data collection
      only) as part of the study.

      Aims are to evaluate sustained virologic response (SVR) rates post-transplant with Direct
      Acting Anti-Viral (DAA) therapy, as well as long-term patient and graft outcomes.

      Evaluate the financial impact of timely transplant and DAA therapy compared to traditional
      wait time health care expenditure.

      Create a blood and tissue biorepository for future evaluation of HCV NAT+ allografts and
      their outcomes
