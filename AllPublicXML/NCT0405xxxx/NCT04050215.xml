      This phase II trial studies the impact of 68GA-PSMA-11 positron emission tomography
      (PET)/computed tomography (CT) scan on treatment strategies for patients with prostate
      cancer. Diagnostic imaging procedures, such as 68GA-PSMA-11 PET/CT scan, may help doctors
      plan the best treatment for prostate cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the impact of gallium Ga 68-labeled PSMA-11 (68Ga-PSMA-11) PET/CT on initial
      and subsequent treatment strategies of patients with prostate cancer.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive 68Ga-PSMA-11 intravenously (IV) and undergo PET/CT scan over 3 hours.
      Patients may be reenrolled in the study, if 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT is performed for subsequent
      management decision.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up within 3-12 months.

    <measure>Intended and implemented management changes after gallium Ga 68-labeled PSMA-11 (68Ga-PSMA-11) positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3-6 months after completion of imaging</time_frame>
    <description>A separate analysis of initial versus subsequent management will be performed. Will be evaluated using descriptive statistics for both the treatment modality analysis and the disease stage based management analysis. Questionnaires will be collected to determine the intended patient management before and intended management changes after PET/CT, and to determine whether intended management changes were implemented. The outcome measure is the rate of change (%) as assessed by the questionnaires before and after PET.</description>

    <time_frame>From inclusion to date until first site of disease is found to progress or death (whichever occurs first), assessed up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Nodal and visceral disease will be evaluated on cross-sectional imaging using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 1.1/Prostate Cancer Working Group 3 (PCWG3) criteria. Bone metastases will be evaluated using bone scintigraphy and new lesions have to be confirmed on a second scan (2+2 rule) using PCWG3 criteria.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Positive predictive value (PPV) on a per-patient and per-region basis of 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET for detection of tumor location</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Confirmed by histopathology/biopsy or follow-up assessed separately for initial staging and restaging. Will be calculated and reported along with the corresponding two-sided 95% confidence intervals. The confidence intervals will be constructed using the Wilson score method. PPV will be reported for each of the three blinded readers independently. Detection rates on a per-patient basis of 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET stratified by prostate-specific antigen (PSA) value will be summarized in tabular format and compared between PSA strata using chi-square analysis. Detection rate is defined as number of patients with PSMA positive disease, independent of pathology, imaging or clinical follow-up. A detection rate will be reported for each reader independently stratified by PSA.</description>

                  for any of the following strategies:

                    -  Surgery

                    -  External radiation therapy (RT)
