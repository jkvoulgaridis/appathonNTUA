    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 36 months</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with the treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a pharmaceutical product, whether or not considered related to the pharmaceutical product. Preexisting conditions which worsen during a study are also considered as adverse events.</description>

             hepatitis B Surface Antigen (HBsAg) or hepatitis C Virus (HCV) antibodies at screening
             stage must pass further detection of hepatitis B Virus (HBV) DNA titer (no more than
             2500 copies/mL or 500 IU/mL) and HCV RNA (no more than the lower limit of the
             detection method) in the row. In addition to active hepatitis B or hepatitis C
             infections requiring treatment, group trials can be conducted. Hepatitis B carriers,
             stable hepatitis B (DNA titer should not be higher than 2500 copies/mL or 500 IU/mL)

             block;

         20. Past psychiatric history; incapacitated or restricted;

         21. According to the researchers' judgment, patients' underlying condition may increase
             their risk of receiving research drug treatment, or confuse their judgment on toxic
             reactions;

         22. Other researchers consider it unsuitable for patients to participate in this study.
