  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In a randomized controlled trial, the investigators intend to measure the health impact of
      TRE in patients with metabolic syndrome (with three or more of the following criteria:
      increased waist circumference, abnormal cholesterol levels, elevated blood pressure, or
      elevated blood sugar), who habitually eat for more than 14 hours every day. Patients will be
      randomly assigned to a control group of behavioral nutrition counseling (standard of care) or
      the intervention group of behavioral nutrition counseling with the addition of adopting a 10
      hour eating window for 12 weeks (TRE).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Circadian rhythms optimize nutrient homeostasis by orchestrating catabolic and anabolic
      metabolism to appropriate times of the 24 hour day. Chronic circadian rhythm disruption
      predisposes individuals to metabolic diseases including obesity and type 2 diabetes.
      Conversely, maintaining a daily rhythm of feeding and fasting cycles sustains a robust
      circadian rhythm which improves cellular bioenergetics and results in improved metabolism.
      Time-restricted eating (TRE) is a specific feeding-fasting pattern in which feeding is
      restricted to 8-12 hours a day.

      At the beginning and end of the study (which will be three months in duration), the following
      parameters will be measured: height, weight, body mass index, percent body fat, waist/hip
      circumference and blood pressure. Blood sugar levels will be monitored continuously for 2
      weeks at a time at the beginning and end of the study using a continuous glucose monitor.
      Additionally, a dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scan will be used to collect
      information about body composition. Information will be collected about the mitochondria with
      a muscle biopsy. Participants will use a smartphone application (called myCircadianClock
      (mCC), developed by the Salk Institute) to keep track of food/beverage intake and will wear a
      wrist-worn actigraphy device to monitor physical activity levels and sleep.
