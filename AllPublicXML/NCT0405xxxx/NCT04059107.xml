  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study being performed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of 3D printed
      myoelectric prosthetic devices in children with a congenital upper limb deficiency.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn more about whether myoelectric prosthetic devices would
      be beneficial and useful for children. The study protocol specifies 4 study visits over the
      course of a year at the following intervals: baseline, 3 month, 6 month, 12 months. In
      following the protocol, each study visit will use the Assessment of Capacity for Myoelectric
      Control (ACMC) functional testing. The study participants will also complete several
      parent-child reported health related quality of life and musculoskeletal questionnaires.
      Specifically, the Pediatric Outcomes Data Collection Instrument (PODCI), the Pediatric
      Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL), and the Children's Hand-Use Experience Questionnaire
      (CHEQ) will be used to measure efficacy of the myoelectric devices..

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Children between the ages of 6 to 17 with congenital/infant upper limb deficiency
             identified by Limbitless Solutions will be referred to OHSU for evaluation and
             selection.

          -  All approved and consented subjects will receive a Limbitless 3D printed myoelectric
             device as delivered by established protocol.

          -  Preference will be given to children with long term previous experience with
             Limbitless Solutions' bionic systems.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Non English-speaking children and families. Due to the entirely volunteer nature of
             this project, the investigators are unable to hire appropriate translation services or
             create translated forms and surveys in other languages currently.

          -  Shoulder or wrist disarticulation will be excluded.
