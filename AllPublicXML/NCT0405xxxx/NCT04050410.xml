  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS) is a relatively common condition affecting mostly
      otherwise healthy young women. It is the cause of significant disability and an impairment in
      quality of life. These patients have high heart rate and symptoms during standing. Many of
      these patients are disabled and have a poor quality of life. The sympathetic nerves are part
      of the nervous system that helps to maintain normal blood pressures and heart rates during
      activities of daily life. The purpose of this study is to determine the importance of
      sympathetic activation as a cause of orthostatic symptoms. The investigators will assess the
      effects of a blood pressure medication (Moxonidine) on the symptoms during standing.
      Moxonidine lowers sympathetic activity. The investigators believe patients with high resting
      sympathetic activity might benefit from Moxonidine. It might reduce high heart rate and
      improve symptoms during standing. This study should help clinicians and the growing
      population of patients with POTS gain a better understanding of this disorder and find more
      personalized treatment.

      Postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS) is a relatively common condition affecting mostly
      otherwise healthy young women. It is the cause of significant disability and an impairment in
      quality of life of a magnitude comparable to patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary
      disease or congestive heart failure. It is characterized by sympathetic activation with an
      exaggerated orthostatic tachycardia that responds to low doses of beta-blockers. The
      underlying pathophysiology of this disorder and the nature of this sympathetic activation is
      not clear and is likely heterogeneous. In many patients this sympathetic activation could be
      an appropriate compensatory response to hypovolemia, deconditioning or partial neuropathy.

      The investigators have identified a subset of patients in whom sympathetic activation appears
      to be a primary phenomenon. These patients are characterized by high central sympathetic
      outflow, as determined by muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) above the upper 95%
      confidence interval for the group. This &quot;hyperadrenergic&quot; phenotype is associated with a
      paradoxical increase in blood pressure on standing and exaggerated pressor response to the
      vasoconstrictive phase of the Valsalva maneuver, and clinical observations suggest they
      improve clinically when treated with central sympatholytics.

      The investigators propose to test the hypothesis that there is a subset of POTS patients with
      a central sympathetic activation as the primary pathophysiology. In an acute double blind,
      placebo-controlled, randomized study, the investigators propose that administration of the
      central sympatholytic moxonidine will improve orthostatic symptoms and abnormalities in
      orthostatic hemodynamics, as well as sympathetic outflow.

    <time_frame>after 30 min supine to after 15 min upright (delta VOSS), 2-3 hours after placebo or moxonidine intake [delta (delta VOSS)].</time_frame>
    <description>VOSS is a validated questionnaire that consists of 9 items: mental clouding, blurred vision, shortness of breath, rapid heartbeat, tremulousness, chest discomfort, headache, lightheadedness, and nausea. Each item is scored on a 0 to 10 scale (with 0 reflecting absence of symptoms), and the change of the total scores (range: 0-90) from supine to upright postures (delta VOSS) will be used as a measure of orthostatic symptom burden. The primary outcome measure will be the difference in orthostatic symptom burden [delta (delta VOSS)] following placebo vs. moxonidine administration.</description>
