  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      While the majority of patients with acute pancreatitis suffer a mild and uncomplicated course
      of disease, up to 20% develop a more severe course with development of pancreatic and/or
      peripancreatic necroses. With time, these necroses become encapsulated with a well-defined
      inflammatory wall, so called walled-off necroses (WON). Up to 30% of WONs become infected,
      which prolongs the length of hospital stay, increases morbidity and mortality significantly,
      and generally requires an invasive intervention. During the last decade, minimally invasive
      therapies consisting of percutaneous and endoscopic, transluminal drainage followed, if
      necessary, by percutaneous or endoscopic necrosectomy, have replaced open surgery as the
      standard treatment resulting in better patient outcomes. The investigators have for nearly
      two decades been practicing an endoscopic step-up approach as standard treatment for infected
      WON.

      Recently, lumen apposing metal stents (LAMS) have been introduced for the treatment of
      pancreatic fluid collections. The stent is fully-covered and shaped with two bilateral anchor
      flanges with a saddle in between. A dedicated through-the-scope delivery system, where the
      tip serves as an electro cautery device enables extra-luminal access and deployment of the
      stent. Initial results from primarily retrospective case series were promising. However, a
      recent randomized controlled trial failed to demonstrate superiority in terms of number of
      necrosectomies needed, treatment success, clinical adverse events, readmissions, length of
      hospital stay (LOS), and overall treatment costs. Furthermore, a number of serious adverse
      events with development of pseudoaneurisms probably due to collapse of the cavity have led to
      alterations in treatment with sequential computed tomography (CT) scans and insertion of
      double pigtail stents within the metal stent. In that trial, the mean diameter of the treated
      necroses was limited and in addition, the study was launched before the introduction of a
      novel 20 mm in diameter LAMS. The investigators hypothesize, that use of a 20 mm LAMS in
      large caliber WON is superior to the standard double pigtail technique.

      Aim To compare the use of a novel 20 mm lumen apposing metal stent (LAMS) (Hot Axios, Boston
      Scientific) with a conventional double pigtail technique for endoscopic transluminal drainage
      of large (&gt; 15 cm) pancreatic and/or peripancreatic walled-of necrosis (WON).

    <description>LAMS shall be the Hot AXIOS stent with electrocautery-enhanced delivery system (Boston Scientific). The stent is a through-the-scope, fully covered, self-expandable metal stents with a diameter of 20 mm and a length of 10 mm. Before placement of the LAMS, the WON shall be punctured with a 19 GA Access needle (Cook Medical) and fluid in WON aspirated for microbiological assessment. Thereafter the LAMS shall be placed as follows: After directly puncturing the WON using the electrocautery tip (without the use of a guidewire to assist in stent insertion), the delivery catheter is advanced into the WON and the distal flange is deployed under EUS-guidance. The proximal flange is then released under EUS guidance or endoscopic view. After placement of the LAMS, a 7-Fr/4cm double pigtail and a 7-Fr nasocystic irrigation catheter shall be placed through the LAMS.</description>

    <description>Whenever possible, randomisation and intervention shall be postponed until 4 weeks after onset of pancreatitis in line with international guidelines. All procedures in this study shall be performed by three experienced endoscopists (PNS, EFH, SN), who all have an extensive experience in endoscopic ultrasound (EUS-) guided drainage of pancreatic collections and the use of self-expanding stents. They have together performed more than 300 endoscopic, transmural drainage and debridement procedures in patients with WON since 2005. Endosonography-guided, transgastric drainage of the WONs shall be performed using a curve-linear echoendoscope (endoscope: Olympus GF-UCT180; ultrasound scanner: Hitachi Arietta 850 or Olympus EU-ME2). All collections shall be treated by single tract transmural cystogastrostomy (single-gate technique). T</description>

          1. Patients with acute, necrotizing pancreatitis and

               1. WON exceeding a diameter of 15 cm (measured on contrast-enhanced CT (CECT); see
                  details on imaging tests below). WON is defined based on the revised Atlanta
                  criteria as a mature, encapsulated pancreatic or peripancreatic necrosis with a
                  well-defined inflammatory wall[12].

               2. Imaging test(s) must be done within 1 week before the index drainage procedure.

               3. Debut of pancreatitis must be within 3 months before the index drainage
                  procedure.

          2. One or more indication(s) for endoscopic, transmural drainage must be established:

        1. Confirmed or suspected infection.1 2. Severe intraabdominal hypertension or abdominal
        compartment syndrome. 3. Persisting abdominal pain, early satiety, or general discomfort.
        4. Obstruction of the GI or biliary tract. 5. Leakage of pancreatic juice, e.g. ascites or
        pleural effusion.

        3. Preoperatively, the WON must be considered eligible for endoscopic, transgastric
        drainage with both conventional double pigtail and LAMS technique. Distance between the
        gastric wall and WON must not exceed one cm and there must be no major interposed vessels.

        Infection in WON:

          1. Confirmed infected necrosis is defined as a) positive culture from WON obtained by
             fine- needle aspiration prior to or at the first drainage procedure or b) presence of
             gas in WON on CECT prior to drainage with no earlier puncture/drainage and no signs of
             perforation to the GI tract.

          2. Infected necrosis is suspected when a patient with WON present with clinical signs of
             persistent sepsis without other causes of infection.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients under the age of 18.

          2. Pregnancy.
