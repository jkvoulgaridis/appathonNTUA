  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An innovative HIV-testing strategy is developed based on mathematical modeling results on
      undiagnosed HIV and being implemented in primary care settings in Belgian's Flemish region.

      The systematically developed intervention aims at increasing the number of targeted HIV tests
      in primary care in order to identify people with undiagnosed HIV.

      The intervention tool is an HIV-screening advice targeting general practitioners (GPs),
      combining indicator-condition based screening and target-group based screening. A group-level
      training to apply this advice in routine practice is being delivered as part of the
      continuing medical education through GP-associations.

      The intervention is implemented across Flanders adopting a modified stepped wedged design:
      two different intervention levels (delivering written/online information on the HIV testing
      advice versus information plus group-level training) are being compared with a control
      condition (no intervention, i.e. standard practice) based on surveillance data. A
      mixed-method study evaluates the intervention's effectiveness, feasibility, and
      acceptability.

      An innovative HIV-screening strategy is developed based on mathematical modelling on
      undiagnosed HIV and being implemented in primary care settings in Belgian's Flemish region.

      A multidisciplinary advisory board including stakeholders from the public sector,
      community-based organizations and primary care physicians (general practitionners; GPs) has
      been set up to advise on the different phases of the intervention's systematic development
      and implementation.

      Mathematical modelling using a back-calculation approach with national HIV-surveillance data
      delivered estimations of undiagnosed HIV and time-distribution between HIV-acquisition and
      diagnosis: 2805 (confidence interval: 2478 - 3186) people living with HIV remained
      undiagnosed in 2015, with highest rates among non-Belgian men having sex with men, and
      sub-Saharan African (SSA) women followed by SSA men (Marty et al., 2017) . These results
      informed the intervention objectives: to increase the numbers of HIV-tests performed, of new
      HIV-diagnoses among the priority groups with undiagnosed HIV, and of timely HIV diagnoses in
      these groups to link HIV positive individuals to care.

      A systematic literature review (Deblonde et al., 2018) indicated that many diagnostic
      opportunities were missed in primary care. Therefore, formative qualitative research was
      conducted with 122 purposively selected GPs to understand their perceived barriers and
      facilitators for HIV-testing. Based on these results, the following intervention determinants
      are addressed: HIV-knowledge, motivation to test and skills to proactively offer an HIV-test
      in a non-judgmental manner. Formative research and input from the advisory board also
      informed the delivery mode of the intervention.

      The intervention consists of an HIV-screening advice combining indicator-condition based
      screening (adapted for primary care) and target-group based screening. A multidisciplinary
      group-level training (one evening session) to apply this advice in routine practice is being
      delivered as part of the continuing medical education through GP-associations.

      The intervention is implemented across Flanders using a modified stepped wedged design t
      evaluate its effectiveness: two different intervention levels (1) delivering written/online
      information only on the HIV testing advice versus (2) information plus group-level training,
      are being compared with a control condition (standard of care or no specific intervention).
      regional HIV surveillance data are being used for the outcome evaluation. A mixed-method
      study evaluates the intervention's effectiveness, feasibility, and acceptability.

    <intervention_model_description>This mixed methods study adopts a modified stepped wedged design. The classical stepped wedged cluster design involves a random and sequential crossover of clusters from control to intervention until all clusters are exposed. It includes an initial period in which no clusters are exposed to the intervention. We adopt a modified version: the two different intervention levels are added stepwise, while a control condition is retained until the end of the study period.</intervention_model_description>

    <measure>GP's fidelity to the HIV-testing advice assessed qualitatively by in-depth telephone interviews</measure>
    <time_frame>17 months after start intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Fidelity in implementation is measured by assessing GPs' coherence of HIV-testing in routine GP care with the HIV-testing advice. This is assessed qualitatively during in-depth telephone interviews with participants, assessing if the intervention is implemented exactly as designed. This includes questions on the content of the intervention (e.g. proposed reasons for offering an HIV-test to patients), and frequency (i.e. which patients are proactively targeted for HIV-testing by the GPs).</description>

    <description>Feasibility of implementation is measured by assessing determinants (i.e. influencing factors) of routinely offering HIV-tests in GP practices. This is assessed with a mixed-methods approach: both by a self-developed online questionnaire for GPs (using a Likert scale from 1-10 expressing agreements to statements on feasibility indicators) and qualitatively during in-depth telephone interviews with GPs assessing their personal experiences with the HIV-testing advice.</description>
