  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current RCT is designed to:

        1. test the efficacy of the group based mSMT in persons with TBI on NPE, the current
           gold-standard for measuring memory functioning

        2. assess the effectiveness of the group mSMT on more global measures of everyday life,
           including an objective measure shown through our previous work to be sensitive to memory
           changes following the mSMT, as well as additional questionnaires to be completed by both
           the participant and a significant other

        3. evaluate the changes in brain functioning following treatment with the mSMT via fMRI and

        4. evaluate the long-term effects of the treatment protocol.

      To accomplish these goals investigators will conduct a double-blind, placebo-controlled, RCT,
      applying the group mSMT to a sample of 60 participants with moderate to severe TBI (30
      treatment; 30 control).

      Outcome measures will assess objective memory abilities, everyday memory abilities and
      patterns of cerebral activation during learning. A long-term follow-up assessment will be
      conducted, designed to measure the impact of the mSMT 3 months following treatment
      completion. Alternate forms will be utilized wherever available.
