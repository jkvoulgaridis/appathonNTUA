  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      High blood pressure (present in 1 of 5 Canadian adults) increases the risk of heart attack
      and stroke. Blood pressure lowering pills reduce this risk - but perhaps not optimally. A
      Spanish study suggests that using blood pressure pills at bedtime, instead of in the morning
      (when they are most commonly used), reduces death, heart attack, and stroke by more than 50%.
      If true, a switch to bedtime prescribing would have more impact on the health of those with
      high blood pressure than whether high blood pressure is treated at all.

      BedMed, a community-based Canadian primary care trial, is already running and looking both to
      validate the findings of this Spanish study and to determine whether there might be
      unrecognized harms of bedtime use (such as more falls and fractures as a result of lower
      overnight blood pressure). One very important population that is likely to be more sensitive
      to the effects of medications, and almost always excluded from randomized trials, are the
      frail elderly (such as those who are resident in nursing homes). In order to have the
      greatest information about the safety and effectiveness of bedtime blood pressure
      medications, the BedMed team is additionally conducting a similar trial to BedMed in nursing
      homes (&quot;BedMed-Frail&quot; - the subject of this trial registration) to determine whether the
      risks and benefits of bedtime prescribing differ in this highly understudied population.

      Basics of the trial: When patients are admitted to nursing homes, neither they nor their
      physicians are consulted about the timing of blood pressure medication. Unless explicitly
      stated to be otherwise, blood pressure pills are instead largely arbitrarily assigned for
      morning use by default. Given there is evidence that bedtime administration may be safer, the
      nursing homes participating in BedMed-Frail will have each hypertensive resident randomized
      to either continue with morning blood pressure medication use, as is their norm, or to have
      their facility's pharmacist gradually switch each residents blood pressure pills to bedtime.
      Over a period of roughly 2 years, health outcomes in these facilities will be tracked using
      routinely collected electronic health data to determine differences in things like
      hospitalization, death, or hip fractures - and at the end of the study the investigators hope
      to determine whether or not the recommendations for blood pressure medication timing in frail
      older adults should differ from those for the general population.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The BedMed trial (led out of the University of Alberta and funded by both Alberta Innovates
      Health Solutions, and the Canadian Institutes for Health Research) is a pragmatic
      multi-provincial trial intended to determine whether bedtime antihypertensive use, as
      compared to conventional morning use, reduces major adverse cardiovascular events in
      community dwelling primary care patients.

      BedMed-Frail, led by the same group of investigators, is a complementary but separate
      randomized trial evaluating whether the risks and benefits of bedtime antihypertensive use
      differ in a long-term care (LTC) population. To accomplish this, within participating Alberta
      LTC and supportive living facilities, eligible residents with hypertension will be randomized
      at the patient level to the antihypertensive medication timing intervention (i.e. bedtime
      versus continued morning use). Trial outcomes and baseline characteristics are drawn from
      routinely collected electronic health data - using both provincial administrative health
      claims data and the Resident Assessment Instrument Minimum Data Set (RAI-MDS), which is a
      standard instrument for collecting clinical information in Canadian LTC facilities.

      BedMed-Frail is event driven, receiving quarterly reporting of total events from the Alberta
      Support for Patient Oriented Research (SPOR) Unit's Data Platform. The trial will end upon
      observation of 368 primary outcome events. Upon observation of half that number, an
      independent data safety monitoring board (IDSMB) chaired by Dr. James Wright (Cochrane
      Hypertension Review Group Co-ordinating Editor) will examine all available outcomes. If p is
      ≤ 0.001 for benefit (the Haybittle-Peto boundary - recommended to reduce the chance of
      stopping too early and magnifying benefit), or if p is ≤ 0.05 for harm, the IDSMB will apply
      clinical judgement and make recommendations to the steering committee on whether the trial
      should break early.

      The outcomes of BedMed-Frail are primarily designed to be analogous to the cardiovascular and
      safety outcomes monitored for in the community BedMed study. However BedMed-Frail is also
      examining for differences in behaviour issues between groups. Both behavioural problems, and
      blood pressure, have circadian rhythms. Blood pressure is normally lower overnight and
      behavioural problems in long term care residents typically worsen during the same period - a
      phenomenon known as &quot;sundowning&quot;. Conceivably, there could be a relationship between the two
      such that behaviour problems might improve, or worsen, with bedtime antihypertensive use. The
      investigators will report the behavioural outcomes as a secondary analysis, in a separate
      publication, with the primary outcome for that secondary analysis being an MDS record by the
      care team that problem behaviours are present a minimum of 4 days per week and not easily
      altered (see detailed description below).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Personal history of glaucoma or use of glaucoma medications. Glaucoma is an exclusion
             because nocturnal hypotension (i.e. excessively low blood pressure while sleeping) has
