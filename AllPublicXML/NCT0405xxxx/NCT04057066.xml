      This study evaluates the feasibility of a 12-week internet-based exercise and physical
      activity counseling intervention for people with Multiple Sclerosis (MS).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Due to high inactivity rates in persons with Multiple Sclerosis (pwMS) physical activity
      promotion for this target group is needed. The internet is an attractive and feasible medium
      for physical activity promotion, however interventions have to be adapted to the special
      needs of pwMS. This study aims to evaluate the feasibility of a 12-week internet-based
      exercise and physical activity counseling intervention.

      26 pwMS will be enrolled in the study. All of them receive the intervention. Focus groups and
      interviews will be conducted with participating pwMS to determine acceptability of the
      intervention and to explore participants experiences. Compliance with the intervention will
      be monitored. Additionally, changes in objective physical activity, subjective physical
      activity, fatigue, walking ability and level of depression will be calculated.

    <description>With those participants that cannot take part in the focus groups, semistructured interviews (30 min) will be conducted to determine extent to which participants' perceived intervention as appropriate. Interview questions are based on focus group questions. The wording is slightly adapted to fit the interview situation.</description>

    <time_frame>1 week before start of the intervention (T0), 1 week after the end of the intervention (T1)</time_frame>
    <description>The physical activity level of participants is measured over a 7 day period with the accelerometer Actigraph GT3X+. The Actigraph GT3X+ measures acceleration on three axes. Steps per day, physical activity per day (activity counts) and time in moderate and vigorous physical activity per day will be calculated.</description>

    <time_frame>1 week before start of the intervention (T0), 1 week after the end of the intervention (T1)</time_frame>
    <description>This questionnaire contains 17 items that form a physical and cognitive subscale. The total score ranges from zero to a maximum of 68 points (maximum fatigue). The cut-off value for the presence of fatigue is above 32.</description>

    <description>German version of the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, 20 item questionnaire. Each item is rated on a 4-point Likert scale. Answers are scored from 0 to 3. The scores for all items are added up to receive the total score. The total score ranges from 0 to 60 with higher scores representing higher levels of depression.</description>

    <description>12-item questionnaire measuring self reported walking ability. Each item is answered on a 5-point Likert scale. Answers are scored from 1 to 5. The scores for all items are added up to receive a total score. The total score ranges from 12 to 60 with higher scores representing higher levels of depression. As a last step the total score is transformed into the walk12-score ranging from 0 to 100 ((total score -12)/48 x 100 = walk12-score).</description>
