  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The effect of SMS follow-up on drug compliance and efficacy in patients with FGIDs has not
      been reported in the literature. We, therefore, conducted a prospective randomized controlled
      trial to investigate whether SMS follow-up could improve treatment adherence in patients with
      FGIDs, which in turn would help symptom relief and improve treatment outcomes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and other functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs)
      are common and pose significant burdens to patients. Although regular medications have
      substantial benefits for disease remission, many patients do not follow the recommendations
      of standard medication regimens given by physicians at the time of the visit, so how to
      improve patient compliance becomes even more important. Many factors can affect drug
      compliance. Forgetting seems to be one of the important reasons for poor compliance. In order
      to solve this problem, many studies such as drug charts/calendars, mini kits, etc. have been
      conducted in previous studies. At present, with the popularization of mobile phones,
      SMS-based interventions are gradually being applied to various medical environments. Compared
      with the phone, SMS consumes less time and can be easily integrated into the patient's daily
      life. Therefore, short messages may be more suitable for follow-up of patients outside
      hospital.

    <measure>Treatment compliance in outpatients with FGIDs</measure>
    <time_frame>week2</time_frame>
    <description>Compliance is assessed by the medication possession ratio (MPR). The MPR is often defined as the sum of the days' supply of medication divided by the number of days between the first fill and the last refill plus the days' supply of the last refill. This calculation usually results in a ratio less than 1.0 if there are lapses in prescription refilling.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Improvement of abdominal pain in outpatients with FGIDs</measure>
    <time_frame>week2</time_frame>
    <description>Improvement of abdominal pain symptom was assessed by comparison of symptom score after treatment to that before treatment. The pain symptome was assessed by Visual Analog Score for pain with the following creteria: 0, no pain; 1, mild; 2, related; 3, severe; 4, very severe. Higher values represent a worse outcome.</description>
