  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In participants with inadequate response/intolerance to ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) taking
      obeticholic acid (OCA) who experience pruritus (due to primary biliary cholangitis [PBC],
      OCA, or both) the addition of linerixibat to OCA therapy may be considered following
      marketing approval. It is therefore important to characterize any potential effect of
      linerixibat on the pharmacokinetics of OCA in humans at clinically relevant dosages.
      Accordingly, a drug-drug interaction (DDI) study with linerixibat (potential perpetrator) and
      OCA (potential victim) will be conducted to inform both future clinical trials with
      linerixibat and the potential concomitant administration of these drugs in a clinical
      setting. This is a single-center, one part (with optional second part) open-label, single
      sequence crossover, drug interaction study to investigate the effect of linerixibat on plasma
      concentrations of OCA and OCA conjugates in healthy participants. Approximately 19
      participants will be enrolled in part A and further 19 participants in part B (if performed)
      in the study and will have a phone call follow-up till 7-14 days post-last linerixibat dose.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Between 18 and 80 years of age inclusive, at the time of signing the informed consent.

             laboratory tests, and ECG. A participant with a clinical abnormality or laboratory
             parameter (i.e., outside the reference range for the population being studied), which
             is not specifically listed in the eligibility criteria, may be included only if the
             investigator agrees in consultation with the GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) medical monitor and
             documents in the source documentation that the finding is unlikely to introduce
             additional risk factors and will not interfere with the study procedures or outcomes.

          -  Body weight &gt; 50 kilogram (kg) and body mass index (BMI) within the range 18.5 to 32
             kg per square meter (inclusive).

          -  Capable of giving signed informed consent which includes compliance with the

             contraceptive guidance during the treatment period and until at least 4 weeks after
             the last dose of study treatment. The investigator is responsible for review of
             medical history, menstrual history, and recent sexual activity to decrease the risk
             for inclusion of a woman with an early undetected pregnancy.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any active dermatologic disorder leading to or with the potential to cause pruritus or
             a recent history of unexplained clinically significant itching locally or generally

             interpretation of data

          -  Any clinically relevant abnormality identified at the screening medical assessment
             (physical examination/medical history) clinical laboratory tests, or 12-lead ECG

          <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant, temporally associated with the use of a study treatment, whether or not considered related to the study treatment. An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose; results in death, is life-threatening, requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent disability/incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect or any other situation according to medical or scientific judgement.</description>

        <description>Urine samples were collected from participants for urinalysis for measuring potential of hydrogen (pH) and glucose, protein, blood, ketones, bilirubin, urobilinogen, nitrite, leukocytes levels by dipstick. Abnormal urinalysis was sent for microscopic examination for cellular casts, erythrocytes, granular casts, hyaline casts, and leukocytes and were counted as cells per high-power field (cells/HPF). Baseline was considered as Day -1. Number of participants with worst case urinalysis result by microscopic examination have been presented.</description>
