  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current guidelines for non-specific CLBP, recommend a conservative approach with exercise
      therapy, as first line treatment. Endurance and resistance training are two examples of
      recommended exercise therapies. However, it appears that none is recommended as superior over
      the other.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The lack of studies using HIIT in CLBP subjects, is the reason why it is needed to conduct an
      investigation about its effects.

      However, firstly it is needed to assess the feasibility and safety of the HIIT protocol, to
      integrate it in the daily practise and future research.

      In a single-center, single-blinded randomized feasiblity study, the investigators aim to
      prove the feasibility and safety of a 12 week HIIT programm.
