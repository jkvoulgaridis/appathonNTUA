  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Test whether an intervention, consisting of frequently feedback of performance outcomes and
      education will improve patient care, expressed in better functional outcomes, fewer
      complications and more quality improving interventions.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A randomized controlled trial will be conducted where hospitals will be randomized to an
      early versus late group, stratified by teaching status as this might influence the time
      available for quality improvement. Randomization will be done using a computer generated
      randomization table in a 1:1 ratio. During the study only orthopedic surgeons performing THA
      and TKA will receive monthly feedback by email.

      The intervention will consist of the following components:

        -  Monthly feedback of performance outcomes;

        -  Education on how to use joint registry data for quality improvement;

        -  Create awareness by sending monthly feedback about performance; education and by asking
           what improvement activities have been introduced;

        -  Hospitals will be linked to hospital with opposite performance outcomes to exchange
           information and find areas for improvement.

      During the trial, the investigators will conduct monthly measurement on intermediate outcomes
      showing whether the intervention reaches the target group (process evaluation). The following
      measurements will take place:

        -  Knowledge among orthopaedic surgeons on their recent performance and how that relates to
           others;

        -  Number of quality improvement activities undertaken with the aim to improve the quality
           of care;

        -  Planned improvement activities (e.g. record review to figure out why performance is not
           as good as in other centers) together with who is responsible and by which time;

        -  Number of people attending the meetings, number of times a specific account has accessed
           the LROI site to ensure that information has reached the target group;

        -  Survey among orthopaedic surgeons at the end of the intervention period on knowledge
           learned and the extent to which they think this is sustainable in daily practice.

      In addition, the investigators will compare the outcomes between the early and the late group
      to test the effectiveness of the intervention, using the appropriate regression techniques.
      In the second period the investigators will test the sustainability of this approach in daily
      practice by comparing the outcomes within the early group with the first period, and compare
      with the late group to test whether outcomes in the sustainability phase are similar as when
      actively supported.

This will be send monthly by email to the intervention group. Further, hospitals with worse performance for a certain outcome will be linked to hospitals with good performance for this outcome.</description>
