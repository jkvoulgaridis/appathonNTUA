  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Per Oral Endoscopic Myotomy has been established as a safe and effective treatment of
      Achalasia type I and II; however, it is limited by post-procedure gastroesophageal reflux.
      Transoral Incisionless Fundoplication (TIF) has been introduced as the endoscopic gold
      standard for anti-reflux procedure. Recently, combined POEM-TIF has been performed
      successfully as a standard of care treatment for patients with severe GER after POEM. We aim
      to study the safety and feasibility of performing POEM-TIF (POEM and TIF in the same
      endoscopic session). This study will also put the groundwork for a randomized clinical trial
      to further study the clinical outcome of the POEM-TIF procedure.

    <measure>Safety of POEM-TIF as assessed by the American Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE) lexicon scoring system</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Safety will be evaluated by the frequency of severe adverse events with probable or definite attribution to the procedure based the ASGE lexicon scoring system. ASGE lexicon's severity grading system classify the adverse events into one of the four categories of mild, moderate, severe, and fatal. Mild adverse event means an adverse event that result in (1) Procedure aborted (or not started) because of an adverse event, (2) Post-procedure medical consultation, or (3) Unplanned hospital admission or prolongation of hospital stay for lesser or equal to 3 nights. Fatal grade adverse event happens when the procedure cause death.</description>
