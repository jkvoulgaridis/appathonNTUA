  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with fibromyalgia (FM) are more sensitive to things that cause pain. Music lowers
      self-reported pain in patients with chronic pain. The investigators are able to measure pain
      sensitivity and pain tolerance using tools that cause pain and give accurate measurements of
      how much pressure is put on the body (QST). Previous studies have shown that after a few
      minutes of listening to music patients with FM have less self-reported pain, can get up and
      move from sitting more quickly, and have more activity in part of the brain that tells the
      body to stop sending pain signals. The investigators will study 40 patients with FM using the
      QST tools. All patients will have testing done as usual, with no sound. Then half of the
      patients will have testing done while listening to instrumental Classical music, and the
      other half will have testing done while listening to nature sounds. The investigators will
      test 1) whether listening to anything lessens pain compared to listening to nothing at all;
      and 2) whether listening to music lessens pain more than listening to nature sounds. Our
      study will be the first to study whether objectively measured pain sensitivity is less while
      listening to music in these patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fibromyalgia can be thought of as a centralized pain state where pain is manifested and
      experienced in different body regions at different times. Individuals with centralized pain
      feel more pain than would be normally expected based on the level of nociceptive input. Music
      has previously been shown to have a positive effect on pain, anxiety, and depression in
      chronic pain patients. However, the impact of music listening on objective measures of pain
      sensitivity in patients with chronic pain have not yet been described. The goal of this pilot
      study is to begin to understand the possible analgesic effects of music listening on
      objective measures of pain sensitivity in patients with fibromyalgia. Previous studies in
      patients with FM have shown that patients have reduced self-reported pain, increased
      mobility, and activation of the descending pain modulatory system in the brain after even a
      short, 5 to10-minute music listening intervention. Our proposed study will be the first to
      investigate whether objectively measured pain sensitivity is reduced by music listening in
      these patients.

      This two-arm parallel randomized controlled pilot study will enroll 40 patients with
      fibromyalgia. Patients' pain thresholds and sensitivity will be measured using a battery of
      quantitative sensory tests (QST). All patients will have two testing sessions: one under
      testing as usual conditions with no-sound, and one while listening to either instrumental
      Classical music, selected by the researchers with careful consideration of the musical
      characteristics, or a nature sound placebo control condition. This careful experimental
      design will allow us to test whether music listening elicits greater analgesic effects over
      simple auditory distraction. To minimize potential bias the investigators will employ sound
      cancelling headphones and randomization of conditions so that the researcher collecting the
      QST measures will be blinded to whether the patient is hearing music, nature sounds, or
      nothing. The proposed study is significant as it will identify whether music listening has an
      analgesic effect during pain threshold and tolerance testing for patients with FM that
      supercedes any effect of auditory distraction. Results from the proposed study may provide
      objective evidence that music listening objectively improves analgesia and pain management
      and thus could be considered therapeutic during situations where acute pain is expected

    <description>The investigators will manipulate the audio environment the participant experiences 10 minutes before and throughout pain threshold testing (~1 hour). All participants will have one testing session with silence (testing as usual control). On the other testing session, participants will hear music.
The musical selections will be professional recordings of instrumental Classical music selected by the researcher. All participants will hear the same pieces in the same order. Instrumentation ranges from piano solo to full orchestra, but they are without lyrics or heavy percussion. Pitch ranges across the pieces, but is standard across participants and not controlled by either the participant or the researcher. Tempo for all of the pieces is slow (~60 beats per minute). The pieces are in either major keys or minor keys, but all consist primarily of consonant harmonies and sustained melodic phrases. Participants will control the volume to their individual comfort level.</description>

All participants will have one testing session with silence (testing as usual control). On the other testing session, participants will hear nature sounds.
Professional recordings of nature sounds selected by the researcher without added music will be used as the active placebo control condition. All participants will hear the same recording. This active control condition will allow for non-musical analgesic effects, such as distraction, to be controlled in the experimental design. Participants will control the volume to their individual comfort level.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Ability to read and speak English to allow for written informed consent, phenotyping,
             and patient- reported outcomes measures

          -  Willingness to refrain from alcohol and nicotine on day of QST

          -  Willingness to refrain from physical activity or exercise that would cause muscle
             and/or joint soreness for 48 hours prior to testing (routine exercise or activity that
             does not lead to soreness is acceptable)

          -  The investigators will attempt to recruit individuals with no chronic daily use of
             adjunctive pain medications, including tricyclic antidepressants,
             serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, and gabapentinoids as these drugs can
             influence QST findings, or have individuals be weaned off of these meds at least two
             weeks prior to being studied. If the investigators do need to allow individuals into
             these cohorts while on such medications because of pragmatic issues, this information
             will be recorded and patients will be asked to remain on a stable dose for at least
             two weeks prior to QST assessments.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Individuals receiving or applying for compensation or disability and other aspects
             associated with potential secondary gain

          -  Inability to provide written informed consent

          -  Peripheral neuropathy or loss of sensation in the upper or lower extremities which
             would preclude QST testing

          -  Severe physical impairment (e.g., blindness, deafness, paraplegia)

          -  Co-morbid medical conditions that may significantly impair physical functional status
             (e.g., history of non- skin malignancy, or autoimmune disorder)

          -  Illicit drug or unreported opioid use (unreported opioid use would be considered
             opioid abuse and thereby excluded)

          -  Medical or psychiatric conditions that in the judgment of study personnel would
             preclude participation in this study (e.g., malignancy, psychosis, suicidal ideation)

          -  Pregnant or nursing

          -  Liver failure

          -  Self-reported liver cirrhosis

          -  Self-reported hepatitis

          -  Severe Cardiovascular disease (examples: history of myocardial infarction, unstable
             angina, severe coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, or severe valvular
             abnormalities) that are self-reported by patient or by medical record

          -  Average daily opioid dosing of &gt;15 mg oral morphine equivalents preoperatively (e.g.,
             &gt; two 5 mg oxycodone tablets/day or &gt; three 5 mg hydrocodone tablets/day). Conversions
             will be made based on well-accepted conversion tools used previously. The rationale to
             include some patients taking low dose opioids is to enhance the generalizability of
             the findings (opioids are common in patients with many pain states), while not causing
             confounding by including patients on very high doses of opioids which may be a cause
             of opioid induced hyperalgesia which closely resembles central sensitization
