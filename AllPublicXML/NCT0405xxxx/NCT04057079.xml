  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Post-operational pain is the most common problem relating to haemorrhoidectomy. This study
      aims to evaluate the postoperative effects of Anugel a hydrogel impregnated multi component
      sponge vs gelatine sponge comparatively.

      The patients were placed in the lithotomy position. Haemorrhoids (piles) were later located
      through exploration. The piles were dissected using ligasure. After completing the
      dissection, bleeding was controlled and either Anugel or the gelatine sponge (SpongostanTM)
      is inserted in to the rectum as determined by patient allocation.

      The patients were monitored post operation and 5 days following the surgery. Pain was
      measured using the VAS scale and use of pain medication was monitored.

    <intervention_model_description>Research staff used a computer-based tool to allocate the ligasure haemorrhoidectomy patients randomly to either Group 1 (n=56) who received standard anal gelatine sponge (SpongostanTM) or Group 2 (n-54) to a layered hydrogel sponge (AnugelTM) following surgery. Encryption concealed the allocation until the patient's details had been logged.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>In this arm, after the surgery a hydrogel impregnated sponge will be placed in the rectum.
The patient is evaluated after the operation and the following day when the sponge is removed.
A hydrogel impregnated foam pad is applied on the surface of the wound the following 5 days.
The patient is evaluated on post op, on day 1 (usually before discharge) and day 5
The pain of the patients are evaluated according to the VAS scale and the use of analgesics and opioids is monitored.</description>
