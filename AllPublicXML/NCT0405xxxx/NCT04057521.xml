      The University of Illinois Health and Health Sciences System (UI Health) developed an
      integrated care management quality improvement model designed to provide comprehensive care
      coordination for Medicaid insured minority children and young adults with chronic health
      conditions living in Chicago. This program, called CHECK (Coordinated HEalthcare for Complex
      Kids), was funded by a Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Innovation (CMMI) Award.
      The CHECK model took a broad approach to health promotion by addressing social determinants
      of health, caregiver wellness and mental health needs; in addition to disease management. The
      program targeted children and young adults from birth to age 25 with diagnoses of asthma,
      diabetes, sickle cell disease, seizure disorder or prematurity. All participants were
      enrolled in either the traditional (fee-for-service) state Medicaid program or a Medicaid
      Managed Care Organization (MCO) in Illinois. CHECK provided access to care coordination
      delivered by community health workers; mental health services and health education.

      CHECK was designed as a demonstration program and participants were enrolled passively over
      time and received different services depending on their level of risk and need. One primary
      aim of the CHECK program was to decrease Medicaid expenditures over a three-year period by
      decreasing unnecessary emergency department visits and hospitalizations.

      Though CHECK was designed as a care delivery demonstration program, in April, 2016 we had the
      opportunity to prospectively randomize 6,259 participants who met eligibility criteria for
      CHECK, for the purpose of program evaluation.

    <intervention_model_description>For the purpose of program evaluation; 6,259 participants who met eligibility criteria for CHECK were randomized. These participants had no previous exposure to CHECK and were randomized to either enrollment into the CHECK program or to usual care (comparison group). Purposive randomization to CHECK or usual care by age, disease and risk level was conducted by Mathmatica.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Number of inpatient hospitalizations/1000 patient years obtained from the Illinois Medicaid paid claims for CHECK participants using the Care Coordination Claims Data (CCCD) provided by the Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family Services (HFS).Claims for the same patient identifier with overlapping service dates were considered one hospitalization. Due to the fact that professional service claims may be submitted independent from facility claims, those claims with the same patient identification number, national provider ID (NPI), and service date were considered the same event to avoid duplication.</description>

    <description>Number of emergency room visits/1000 patient years obtained from the Illinois Medicaid paid claims for CHECK participants using the Care Coordination Claims Data (CCCD) provided by the Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family Services (HFS). The number of inpatient hospitalizations per patient were identified using inpatient facility claims. The number of ED visits per patient were identified from outpatient facility claims or professional claims with revenue codes indicating an ED place of service or Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes for emergency services. Due to the fact that professional service claims may be submitted independent from facility claims, those claims with the same patient identification number, national provider ID (NPI), and service date were considered the same event to avoid duplication.</description>

    <description>Number of outpatient visits/1000 patient years obtained from the Illinois Medicaid paid claims for CHECK participants using the Care Coordination Claims Data (CCCD) provided by the Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family Services (HFS).Outpatient visits were defined as outpatient facility claims or professional service claims with evaluation and management CPT codes for office visits (excluding observation or outpatient surgery).Due to the fact that professional service claims may be submitted independent from facility claims, those claims with the same patient identification number, national provider ID (NPI), and service date were considered the same event to avoid duplication.</description>

    <description>Annual &quot;other&quot; healthcare expenditures are reported as expenditures/patient/year (US dollars). Expenditures not attributable to inpatient, ED, outpatient visits, or prescription costs were considered 'other' and include services such as observation, outpatient surgery, dental, mental health, labs, and radiology.</description>

    <measure>Annual total healthcare expenditures per patient</measure>
    <time_frame>Three years</time_frame>
    <description>Annual total healthcare expenditures are reported as expenditures/patient/year (US dollars). Expenditures were measured for each patient overall, and by category of service (e.g., inpatient, ED, outpatient visits, prescriptions, and other). Outpatient visits were defined as outpatient facility claims or professional service claims with evaluation and management CPT codes for office visits (excluding observation or outpatient surgery). Prescription expenditures were obtained from the prescription drug file of the CCCD. For the inpatient, ED, and outpatient visit expenditures, costs associated with any remaining outpatient or professional claims with overlapping dates of service were considered part of the event. Total expenditures per patient were defined as the sum of all paid claims for any covered service - (e.g., inpatient, ED, outpatient visits, prescriptions, and other).</description>
