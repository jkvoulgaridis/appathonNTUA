    <description>The Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI75) response assessments are based on at least 75 % improvement in the PASI score from Baseline. The PASI score is a measure of the average redness, thickness, and scaliness of the psoriatic skin lesions with a score of 0 (clear) to 4 (very marked).</description>

    <description>The Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) consists of questions concerning patients' perception of the impact of skin diseases on different aspects of their health-related quality of life over the last week. The DLQI score ranges from 0 to 30 with higher scores indicating lower health-related quality of life (HRQoL).</description>
