  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is a major cause of morbidity and mortality for recipients of
      allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation(HSCT). Recently, strategies based on
      immunotherapy adoptive cells (IAC) with anti-CMV Cytolitic T Lymphocytes (CMV-CTLs) has been
      incorporated to prevent or treat CMV after HSCT. The aim to study donor derived CMV-CTLs
      after haploidentical HSCT (HAPLO) as prophylaxis for CMV infection in transplant patients.
      CMV-CTLs will be administer at day 21 (+-7 days) post-HAPLO. CMV DNA levels with quantitative
      PCR will be weekly monitored.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In HAPLO, CMV infection and disease are more frequent than in other type of HSCT, this is
      related to delayed immune reconstitution after transplant increasing post-transplant
      infectious complications. Approximately 60% of patients reactivated CMV infection after HAPLO
      and 15%, developed CMV disease afecting organs and causing the death of the patient in 8% of
      CMV disease cases.

      If patient and donor are eligible, it will take 1x10^9 cells from donor leukapheresis. Donor
      cells will be selected and procesed by CliniMACs PRODIGY and after 12h it will obtain 7mL of
      CMV-CTLs. It will use 6mL of CMV-CTLs to infused a dose of 1x10^5 cells/kg in our patient.
      The donor derived CMV-CTL cells will be transfused into the patients' intravenous line. The
      patients will receive the dose of CMV-CTL cells when they are sero-positive for CMV-DNA 21
      (+- 7 days) days after transplant.

      The CMV-DNA levels will be monitored weekly for at least 100 days after the transplant. If
      after the initial dose of CMV-CTL cells the patient develops a viral infection, then the
      patient will receive treatment with anti-CMV comercial drugs.
