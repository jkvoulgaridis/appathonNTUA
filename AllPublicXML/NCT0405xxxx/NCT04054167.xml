  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well ultra low dose radiation works before or after
      chemotherapy-free targeted therapy in treating patients with mantle cell lymphoma that has
      come back or does not respond to treatment. Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays to kill
      cancer cells and shrink tumors. Ultra low dose radiation is generally associated with a lower
      risk of side effects which may allow patients to be able to receive low-dose radiation
      therapy more often than high-dose radiation therapy. This trial may help doctors learn if
      giving ultra low dose radiation helps control mantle cell lymphoma and improves response to
      chemotherapy free targeted therapy.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the efficacy of adding ultra low dose radiation (ULDR) to chemotherapy
      free-targeted therapy (CTFTT) in contributing to a durable overall response in treated
      locations by estimating overall response rate (ORR) at 3 months.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate if ULDR can improve progression-free survival and overall survival.

      II. To evaluate the prognostic factors associated with inferior progression-free survival,
      including patient related and previous treatment related and if radiation can overcome these
      prognostic factors.

      III. To evaluate if radiation helps to bridge patients to other investigational drugs, by
      decreasing the disease bulk, controlling their symptoms, and maintaining a good performance
      status.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo ultra low dose radiation for 1-2 days before chemotherapy free-targeted
      therapy. Patients may receive a second, longer course of radiation if the lesion treated does
      not respond.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for up to 5
      years.

    <measure>Overall response rate (ORR)</measure>
    <time_frame>At 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>ORR will be based on the tumors residing within the radiated field using the sum of the longest tumoral axes treated. Responses are defined as follows: i) complete response (CR): &gt; 75% reduction in the sum of the longest tumoral axes treated within a radiation field; ii) partial response (PR): 50 to 75% reduction; and stable disease (SD): a reduction &lt; 50%. Progressive disease will be defined as any relative increase in the sum of the longest tumoral axes within the radiated field. ORR will be assessed by positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) at 3-months after the conclusion of ultra low dose radiation (ULDR). The Lugano Classification will be used to assess tumor response. Will estimate ORR at 3 months by providing an exact 95% confidence interval for the evaluable study population.</description>

             Physician can include as many fields to respect the 40% of marrow volume and come back
             in 4-6 weeks later to address the rest of the disease after insuring that the blood
             counts are adequate. Blood counts should be back to back to the numbers prior to
             starting the first phase of radiation + or - 10% variance.

          -  If giving radiation prevents them from going through an alternative phase I trial that
             could be beneficial like chimeric antigen receptor (car) T cell treatment.
