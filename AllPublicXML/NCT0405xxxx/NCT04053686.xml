  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is to assess the feasibility of an intervention to reduce and
      break up prolonged sitting time in full-time police staff. The secondary aims of this study
      are to assess preliminary effects on patterns of sedentary behaviour (number of breaks,
      number of prolonged sitting bouts, average duration of prolonged sitting bouts, and total
      prolonged sitting duration), additional measures of sedentary behaviour (total sitting time,
      standing, and stepping), cardiometabolic risk markers, physiological stress (cortisol
      levels), physical health (self-report and postural stability), psychological wellbeing and
      mood, work stress (self-reported), and work performance (job satisfaction and productivity).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prolonged sedentary behaviour is associated with a higher incidence of cardiovascular disease
      and type 2 diabetes. A large proportion of daily sedentary time (sitting) occurs in the
      workplace. On average, full time office workers spend upwards of 70% of their working day
      seated with the majority of this time accumulated in sitting bouts ≥ 20 minutes. A recent
      cross-sectional investigation into the occupational characteristics of over 5,000 British
      police force employees reported at least 30% identifying as having mainly office-based
      duties. When trying to reduce prolonged sitting in the workplace, one of the most effective
      strategies is the use of multi-component interventions. At the present time, sedentary
      workplace intervention studies in the police are limited.

      The primary aim of this study is to assess the feasibility of an intervention to reduce and
      break up prolonged sitting time at work in full-time police staff. The secondary aims of this
      study are to assess preliminary effects on sedentary behaviour, cardiometabolic risk markers,
      physiological stress, physical health, psychological wellbeing and mood, work stress, and
      work performance.

      Participants will be randomised by clusters to the intervention or control group. The
      intervention group will receive a multi-component intervention to break up and reduce
      prolonged sitting including: a presentation/workshop, electronic support, minor environmental
      modifications, organisational support, and team competition. The control group will continue
      with their usual work routine. At the end of the study, control group participants will have
      access to the intervention components. Assessments will take place at baseline and
      post-intervention (week 10).

    <measure>Warwick-Edinburgh mental well-being scale (WEMWBS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and at week 11</time_frame>
    <description>The Warwick-Edinburgh mental well-being scale (WEMWBS) is a 14-item questionnaire used to assess various aspects of positive mental health (e.g., &quot;I've been feeling optimistic about the future&quot;). Participants are asked to rate their experience of each wellbeing statement between 1 and 5 (1 = none of the time and 5 = all of the time). Item scores are then combined to provide a total score (between 14 - 70). The higher the score the better the overall mental wellbeing. For intervention purposes, a change in the total score of 3-8 points between two time points may be considered a &quot;meaningful change&quot;.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Positive and negative affect schedule (PANAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and at week 11</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in self-reported mood via the positive and negative affect schedule (PANAS) consisting of two 10-item subscales to measure positive and negative affect (i.e., mood). A number of words that describe different feelings and emotions (e.g., &quot;interested&quot;, &quot;distressed&quot;, &quot;excited&quot;) are presented and participants are asked to indicate on a 5-point scale to what extent over the past week they have felt these feelings/emotions (1 = very slightly or not at all and 5 = extremely). These scales are internally consistent with very good convergent and discriminant correlations.
Negative Affect subscale Item scores on the negative affect scale are then combined to provide a total score (between 10 - 50). The higher the score the more negative emotions experienced.
Positive Affect subscale Item scores on the positive affect scale are then combined to provide a total score (between 10 - 50). The higher the score the more positive emotions experienced.</description>

    <measure>Operational police stress questionnaire (PSQ-Op)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and at week 11</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in ratings of 20 operational stressors for police (PSQ-Org). Participants will be asked to rate items on &quot;how much stress it has caused you over the past 6 months&quot; using a 7-point Likert scale (1 = no stress at all and 7 = a lot of stress). Item scores are then combined to provide a total score (between 20 - 140). The higher the score the worse the stress level. This instrument has demonstrated acceptable reliability and validity for measuring police-specific occupational stressors.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and at week 11</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in ratings of 20 organisational stressors for police (PSQ-Org). Participants will be asked to rate items on &quot;how much stress it has caused you over the past 6 months&quot; using a 7-point Likert scale (1 = no stress at all and 7 = a lot of stress). Item scores are then combined to provide a total score (between 20 - 140). The higher the score the worse the stress level.

    <description>Changes in self-reported job satisfaction and will be evaluated via a single-item questionnaire (&quot;How satisfied are you with your job in general?&quot;) assessed on a 7-point Likert scale (1 = dissatisfied and 7 = extremely satisfied). A higher score represents more satisfaction with one's job.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Job performance</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and at week 11</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in self-reported job performance will be evaluated via a single-item questionnaire (&quot;How well do you think you have performed in your job recently?&quot;) with a 7-point Likert scale (1 = very poorly and 7 = extremely well). A higher score represents a more positive assessment of job performance.</description>
