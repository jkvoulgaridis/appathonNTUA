  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      National early warning score (NEWS) enables early detection of patient deterioration in
      hospital floors. However, there is limited data on the prognostic value of NEWS among actual
      general ward patients. Further, there is no data on how changes in NEWS-values impact patient
      outcomes. Very little is known on how post-operative nausea and vomiting (PONV) and pain
      influences NEWS values and vital signs in general.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators aim to collect detailed data on patients' vital signs, NEWSs, pain scores
      and PONV scores through electronic data records, where these values are automatically stored
      with mobile mobile smart devices used by nursing staff. The expected volume of the cohort is
      50,000 patients and 300,000 recordings of vital signs.

      In addition to the scores and vital signs, the registry will include patients' identification
      numbers (IDs), dates and times of the recordings, and ward numbers. With the IDs, 90-day
      mortality of the patients will be obtained from the national population register centre. All
      data will be handled in a pseudonymized form in a secure computer inside hospital, and
      approval to use the registry in study purposes will be obtained from the Ethics Committee of
      Tampere University Hospital.
