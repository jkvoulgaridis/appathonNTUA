  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effect of slow and deep breathing on lowering blood pressure in
      women with pregnancy-induced hypertension. Slow and deep breathing will be practised daily
      for 10 minutes from enrolment until the woman gives birth. This feasibility study aims to
      investigate the practicality of conducting a proposed future randomised controlled trial.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In addition to the slow and deep breathing intervention the women will undertake a short
      protocol investigating the physiological responses to slow and deep breathing during their
      initial meeting. The women will undertake 4 separate 5-min breathing exercises with a 5
      minute rest period between each exercise. The breathing exercises are normal breathing, and
      fixed breathing frequencies of 4, 6 and 8 breaths per minute. Blood pressure, heart rate and
      breathing rate will be monitored continuously, and non-invasively, throughout each breathing
      protocol.

      The women will also have the opportunity to provide feedback on the intervention and their
      experiences in an online survey at 36 weeks gestation.
