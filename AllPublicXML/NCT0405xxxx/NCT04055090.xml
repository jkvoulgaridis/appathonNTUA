  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is explore the overall safety profile and durability of efficacy of
      VM202 in painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy.

      All subjects still in follow-up for the VMDN-003 study or who have completed the Day 270
      visit within the prior 90 days will be approached to enroll in the long-term safety extension
      study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the phase III VMDN-003 study, subjects received 2 treatments of either VM202 or placebo
      administered as intramuscular (IM) injections into bilateral calves on Days 0 and 14, and
      Days 90 and 104. Primary efficacy was evaluated 90 days following the first injection. The
      growth potential for HGF make long-term follow-up important both for safety and efficacy: in
      order for VM202 to be a candidate for chronic treatment of PDPN, it must be demonstrated not
      to induce unexpected adverse events with repeated dosing; and the potential for reversal or
      stabilization of diabetic neuropathy using only one or two treatments of VM202 may make it
      especially attractive compared to current treatments which must be taken daily for the
      duration of the disease. A safety extension to the VMDN-003 study is therefore warranted.
