    <textblock>
      Observational study of patients at Boston Childrens Hospital with type 1 diabetes (T1D) who
      elected to treat their diabetes with the Medtronic 670 G hybrid closed loop insulin pump.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Outcome study of 90-100 patients with type 1 diabetes who elected to use the Medtronic 670G.

      Major outcome measure was to assess the percent of patients who were able to successfully
      continue to use the 670G technology over time.

      Additional outcome variables included hemoglobin A1c pre and post treatment with the 670G,
      time in desired glucose range 70-180.
