  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to develop, implement, and evaluate a theory-driven parental
      disclosure intervention to assist parents living with HIV (PLH) to make a planned,
      developmentally appropriate disclosure of their HIV status to their uninfected children or,
      for PLH with younger children, to articulate a clear plan for disclosure to their children
      when developmentally appropriate. The majority of the 33.4 million individuals living with
      HIV worldwide reside in low-resource settings and are also of reproductive and child-rearing
      age. It is therefore important to the field of public health to develop an evidence-based
      parental disclosure intervention that can be effectively delivered to parents by a broad
      range of paraprofessionals. The investigators hypothesize that the proposed intervention will
      demonstrate efficacy in helping PLH to make developmentally appropriate disclosure to
      children or make a developmentally appropriate plan of disclosure and will demonstrate short,
      medium, and long-term efficacy in improving the well-being of parents, children, and
      families. The proposed scientifically rigorous evaluation includes mixed methods of data
      collection, a cluster randomized controlled trial, multiple data sources, and a 36-month
      longitudinal follow-up involving a large sample of parents, children, and providers. The
      intervention program to be developed and the evaluation data to be collected in the current
      study will inform the practice and clinic guidelines aimed at improving both parental HIV
      disclosure and the well-being of PLH, children and families in China and other low-and
      middle-income countries (LMICs).

    <textblock>
      Because programs preventing prenatal HIV transmission are reaching a greater number of
      pregnant women worldwide and are successfully reducing vertical transmission, an ever
      increasing majority of children born to HIV-positive mothers are uninfected. In addition, new
      medical innovations and increasing availability of antiretroviral therapy (ART) have improved
      the health and longevity of HIV-positive parents, which means they are more likely to raise
      their children for many years after the initial diagnosis. For parents living with HIV
      (&quot;PLH&quot;), disclosing their HIV infection to their seronegative children (&quot;parental HIV
      disclosure&quot;) becomes an increasingly important issue in terms of well-being of parents,
      children and families. The global literature in parental HIV disclosure suggests that
      developmentally appropriate, well-planned disclosure can greatly benefit the well-being of
      PLH, their children and families. However, for multiple reasons including fear of stigma and
      the psychological burden such knowledge might place on their children, PLH often struggle
      about whether, when, what, and how to talk to their children about their HIV infection. Many
      of them do not disclose their HIV infection to children primarily because they lack the
      confidence and behavioral skills to appropriately and effectively accomplish this task. To
      date, the issues surrounding parental HIV disclosure have been understudied, particularly in
      low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) including China where the HIV epidemic has been
      steadily expanding. In this application, the investigators propose to adapt relevant
      components from two evidence-based programs developed in the US to produce a theory-driven
      developmentally appropriate parental HIV disclosure intervention in Guangxi, China, where the
      investigators have built a strong research infrastructure and community collaboration through
      NIH-funded research since 2004. The proposed project consists of three main operational
      phases. Phase I includes formative research to examine current practices, barriers and
      facilitators, cultural influences, and effects of disclosure on PLH and their children. The
      data to be collected in this phase will complement the data the investigators have collected
      and will inform the adaption of intervention content and delivery modality. Phase II includes
      the development and pilot-testing of a theory-guided parental HIV disclosure intervention
      program with two components (a primary parent component and a secondary care provider
      component) by culturally adapting and integrating aspects of two US-based programs that were
      efficacious in either helping parents to make appropriate HIV disclosure or improving mental
      health status of PLH and their children. Phase III will rigorously evaluate the efficacy of
      the proposed intervention on well-being of PLH, children and families over 36 months through
      a cluster randomized controlled trial involving 800 PLH (either fathers or mothers) and their
      children (6 to 15 years of age). The research will also identify contextual and individual
      factors that potentially mediate or moderate the effect of the proposed intervention on
      parent, child, and family outcomes. The proposed research will address the dearth of targeted
      interventions supporting parental efforts in disclosing their HIV status to their children by
      examining whether a theory-based intervention can improve parental HIV disclosure in a
      low-resource setting. The proposed study will also provide cross-cultural evidence to support
      the role of parental disclosure in the well-being of parents, children, and families.

    <description>The Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale. Depression is measured using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Short Depression Scale (CES‚ÄêD 10) with a 4-point ordinal response: 0 = rarely or none of the time (less than 1 day); 1 = some or a little of the time (1-2 days); 2 = occasionally or a moderate amount of the time (3-4 days); 3 = most or all of the time (5-7 days). A summary score of all 10 items is calculated with higher scores indicating higher levels of depression. The summary score ranges between 0 to 30, and a score of 10 or greater is considered depressed.</description>
