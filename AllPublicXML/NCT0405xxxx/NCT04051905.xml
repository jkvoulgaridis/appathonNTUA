  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the bone loss after extraction. The surgery protocol is
      flapless, and the teeth are mandibular premolars or molars leaving sockets with 4 walls
      intact or at least 3 walls intact and the buccal wall at 80% . This study will include 40
      patients

      Primary objective :

      Estimate the percentage of bone volume loss o and the percentage thickness loss of the buccal
      and palatal cortical for patients who underwent natural healing in the mandibular molar and
      premolar areas.

      Methods :

      Before tooth extraction of a premolar or molar in mandibular area by flapless technique, a
      CBCT preoperative is performed to verify the integrity of cortical and measure the height and
      width of the residual cavity. Caliper measurements will also be performed during surgery in
      order to integrate also the thickness of the bone tables and gingival thickness.

      After natural healing , the pre-implant scan performed at six months postoperatively will
      measure the height and width of the grafted cell, to compare measurements and evaluate the
      dynamics of alveolar resorption.
