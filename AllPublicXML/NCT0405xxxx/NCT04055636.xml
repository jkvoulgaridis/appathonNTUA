  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Advances in treatment have led to improved survival of patients with cancer, but have also
      increased morbidity and mortality due to cancer treatment side effects. Cardiotoxicity is one
      the most frequent side effect which may lead to premature morbidity and death among cancer
      survivors. The most concerning cardiovascular complications of cancer therapy is myocardial
      dysfunction, leading to heart failure, and fatal arrhythmias, especially those induced by
      QT-prolonging drugs.

      PROMETEY (PROspective Multidisciplinary obsErvational Trial of cardiotoxicity in patiEnts
      undergoing anticancer therapy) - is Russian multicenter observational study assessing
      cardiotoxicity and its clinical, biochemical and genetic factors in patients on cancer
      therapy.

      The objectives of the study are:

        -  to reveal prevalence of cardiotoxic effects of cancer therapy in routine clinical
           practice in Russian Federation,

        -  to assess contribution of these effects to mortality of patients on cancer therapy,

        -  to evaluate clinical and economic consequences of cardiotoxicity in patients with
           cancer,

        -  to develop an individualized model of cardiotoxicity risk factors based on clinical and
           laboratory parameters.

      Patients: 400 cancer patients with toxic cardiomyopathy and 100 patients with idiopathic or
      family dilated cardiomyopathy.

      Study duration: 60 months. All patients will undergo complex examination after signing
      informed consent form(ICF): physical exam, echocardiography with speckle tracking analysis,
      ambulatory 48-hours ECG monitoring, biochemistry, analysis of biomarkers of myocardial
      injury, fibrosis and inflammation.

      Primary endpoint: all-cause mortality, heart transplantation, cardioverter-defibrillator
      implantation, hospitalization with heart failure decompensation.

      Secondary endpoints:

        -  thromboembolism,

        -  fatal/ nonfatal myocardial infarction, stroke,

        -  sudden cardiac death,

        -  surgical therapy of heart failure or arrhythmias,

        -  cardiovascular death,

        -  all-cause mortality,

        -  heart transplantation,

        -  cardioverter-defibrillator implantation.
