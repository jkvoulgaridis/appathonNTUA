  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/lamivudine/dolutegravir (TLD) is being used more widely across
      the world to treat HIV. This is an observational study (a type of study in which participants
      are observed and certain outcomes are measured). The aim of this study is to observe how
      successful TLD is at treating HIV, in the following groups of people:

        -  People switching to TLD, after taking anti-HIV medication that contains a nonnucleoside
           reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) drug (such as Efavirenz or Nevirapine) (Group
           1).

        -  People switching to TLD, after taking anti-HIV medication that contains a boosted
           protease inhibitor (PI) drug (such as Lopinavir or Atazanavir) (Group 2).

        -  People taking TLD and receiving medication for TB that includes the drug rifampicin
           (RIF) (Group 3). These people must be starting one or both of these medications when
           they enter the study.

        -  People starting TLD who have not taken anti-HIV medication before (Group 4).

      Another goal of this study is to use genetic testing of the virus (HIV) to see how often HIV
      is resistant to TLD. Genetic testing of the virus is one way to see if the TLD medication is
      not working to treat a person's HIV infection.

          -  Prior enrollment in any group in this study.
