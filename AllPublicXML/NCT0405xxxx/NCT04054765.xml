  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The use of the Invite Only VR, with the aim to prevent the initiation of e-cigarette use in
      teens by increasing their knowledge, decreasing their intentions to use e-cigarettes,
      influencing their harm perceptions and attitudes associated with e-cigarettes, and increasing
      self-efficacy associated with refusing peers involving e-cigarettes.

      Specific Aim #1: DEVELOPMENT: The researcher will update our current VR prototype into a
      polished videogame intervention using input from 4 focus groups of 5 adolescents each (n =
      20), aged 12-17 and the extant literature. These focus groups will inform the development of
      the VR videogame intervention, Invite Only VR, for e-cigarette prevention among teens.

      Specific Aim #2: EVALUATION: Conduct a pilot non-randomized cluster trial with 230 teens ages
      12-15 comparing the Invite Only VR intervention vs. an attention/control non-health-related
      VR videogame, collecting assessment data at baseline, post-gameplay, three months and six
      months to determine:

        1. the preliminary impact of the intervention on knowledge, intentions, perceptions,
           attitudes, social norms, self-efficacy and behaviors related to: i) initiation of
           e-cigarette use, ii) e-cigarette use cessation.

        2. the intervention's acceptability and feasibility by collecting quantitative and
           qualitative data on teens' satisfaction and gameplay experience of the intervention.

        3. preliminary evidence of the impact of Invite Only VR on players' perception and
           experience of social pressure and social norm development
