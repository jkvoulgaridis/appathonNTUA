      The objective of the study is to evaluate Tolerability, Safety, and primary Efficacy of
      Gentuximab Injection at different dosage in combination with Paclitaxel in Advanced Gastric
      or Gastroesophageal Junction Cancer patients, to ensure adequate treatment dosage for further
      study. Meanwhile, the study also evaluate Pharmacokinetics of Gentuximab Injection at
      different dosage in combination with Paclitaxel.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study includes dose-limiting toxicity （DLT）observing period and randomization period with
      two cohorts as low-dose group（Gentuximab Injection 8mg/kg+ paclitaxel） and high-dose
      group（Gentuximab Injection 12mg/kg+ paclitaxel）. During the study，the anti-cancer efficacy,
      safety and anti-drug antibody were evaluated in all patients. DLT observation is only to
      subjects enrolled in DLT observation period and it lasts one treatment period. PK were doing
      in part of subjects.
