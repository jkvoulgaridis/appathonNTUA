  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Previous study reported that propofol binded to glutamate receptors in the hypothalamus and
      inhibits AVP release mediated by endogenous γ-aminobutyric acid, as well as directly inhibits
      the regulated calcium currents leading to normal neuronal depolarization and AVP release.
      However, there is no clinical data demonstrating the mechanism of propofol can induce
      transient DI by inhibiting the release of AVP from the hypothalamus when applied to humans.
      Remifentanil, binding to the μ-receptor or partly κ-receptor, have been used in total
      intravenous anesthesia combined with propofol, also reported inhibiting AVP relaese in both
      the hypothalamus (κ receptor mediator mechanism) and posterior pituitary (μ receptor mediator
      mechanism). However, the effects of anesthetics on water homeostasis during surgery have been
      not well established. Therefore, we aim to investigate the changes of intraoperative water
      homeostasis, and related hormones and osmolality in patients with propofol based total
      intravenous anesthesia due to neuromonitoring for spine surgery.

      &quot;All patients will get the total intravenous anesthesia with propofol-remifentanil via an
      effective site-controlled infusion (TCI). For this, TCI continuous infusion pump will be used
      with Schnider pharmacokinetic model for propofol and Minto pharmacokinetic model for
      remifentanil. Propofol and remifentanil will be initiated with target effective site
      concentrations of 3 μg.ml-1 and 3 ng.ml-1, respectively, and controll these concentrations
      considering patient's consciousness loss and vital signs. And then 0.6 mg kg-1 rocuronium for
      muscle relaxation will be administered for intubation. Anesthesia will be maintained with BIS
      level 40-60 and vital signs will not be more than 20% of the baseline or less. In order to
      prevent the sudden movement of the patient during surgery, rocuronium will be infused
      continuously about 50% of TOF until the end of intraoperative neuromonitoring.
