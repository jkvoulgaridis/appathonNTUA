    <textblock>
      This study will be a randomized control trial providing an educational component to study
      participants and a pre-operative and post-operative survey with a goal to show an improvement
      in pain control, decrease in narcotic use, and increase in patient knowledge in the study
      group.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The use of opioid pain medications in surgical patients is contributing to an epidemic of
      opioid pain medication use. It is known that the quality of pain control after surgery is a
      large factor of the patient's perception of their experience. However, little research has
      been done to improve pain control in plastic surgery patients. To the investigators
      knowledge, no study has yet looked at education of breast surgery patients to improve pain
      experience. The study goal is to survey breast surgery patients in the Plastic Surgery
      department before and after surgery to evaluate the participants experience with pain and
      pain medications. Half of the participants in the study will be randomized to receive an
      information sheet about pain control at the participants pre-operative appointment.

    <intervention_model_description>All study participants received a study folder with information about the study and consent; the instrument was included in this folder for the intervention group. The control group received standard of care, including standard patient counseling from the surgical teams. In conjunction with oncologic psychology and plastic surgery, an instrument was developed to be provided as a single-paged paper handout to the intervention group. The instrument included information about expectations for pain control, information about the pain scale, and examples of opioid and adjunct medications which may be used as part of a multi-modal approach to pain control during the perioperative period.</intervention_model_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Opioid consumption</measure>
    <time_frame>1-2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Opioid consumption will be calculated from patient report of remaining narcotics at the postoperative appointment and the total opioid amount prescribed, from the medical record.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain control: survey</measure>
    <time_frame>1-2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Patient report of subjective and objective pain control after surgery will be collected on a postoperative survey. Objective pain control will be scored by asking patients to circle a pain score on a scale of 0 to 10. This is a continuous scale used to score pain with 0 being no pain and 10 being the worst pain. Subjective pain will be rated by asking participants to state yes or no for control of pain and state yes or no if pain interfered with walking, sleeping, and activities of daily living.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Patient knowledge of pain control</measure>
    <time_frame>1-2 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>Patient reported knowledge of pain control will be collected on the preoperative and postoperative survey. Patients will be asked to circle yes or no to feeling like the participant had enough information about pain control and about surgery.</description>

    <description>The handout was single-paged (front and back), and was titled Pain After Surgery: What to Expect. The handout starts with information on rating pain and expectations for control of pain, not complete absence of pain, after surgery. Mutli-modal approach to pain control is then discussed, including pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic methods that may be used for pain control by the perioperative team and postoperatively.</description>
