    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the efficacy of an accelerated schedule of theta-burst stimulation for
      treating manic episodes in bipolar disorder. In this open-label study, all participants will
      receive accelerated theta-burst stimulation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is an established technology as therapy
      for treatment-resistant depression. The approved method for treatment is 10Hz stimulation for
      40 minutes over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (L-DLPFC). This methodology has been
      very successful in real-world situations. The limitations of this approach include the
      duration of the treatment (approximately 40 minutes per treatment session over 4-6 weeks).
      Recently, researchers have modified the treatment parameters to reduce treatment times with
      some preliminary success. In a recent study, an accelerated paradigm showed a significant
      antidepressant effect (90% remission rate) in individuals with treatment-resistant depression
      (TRD), in only 5 days. Additionally, 5 participants from this study carried a bipolar
      diagnosis and responded similarly, with no adverse events experienced or manic/hypomanic
      conversion observed during the treatment series. In parallel to this, evidence in the
      literature shows that right prefrontal rapid TMS is safe and efficacious in the treatment of
      bipolar mania showing laterality opposed to the proposed effect of rapid TMS in depression.

      The current trial intends to utilise this modified design, i.e., an accelerated theta burst
      stimulation treatment over the right prefrontal cortex, for manic episodes in bipolar
      disorder. The trial also aims to look at the change in clinical measures and neuroimaging
      biomarkers.

    <measure>Change from baseline Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and immediate post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) is one of the most frequently utilized rating scales to assess manic symptoms. The scale has 11 items and is based on the patient's subjective report of his or her clinical condition.
There are four items that are graded on a 0 to 8 scale (irritability, speech, thought content, and disruptive/aggressive behavior), while the remaining seven items are graded on a 0 to 4 scale. These four items are given twice the weight of the others to compensate for poor cooperation from severely ill patients.
Typical YMRS baseline scores can vary a lot. They depend on the patients' clinical features such as mania (YMRS = 12), depression (YMRS = 3), or euthymia (YMRS = 2).</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and immediate post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>A ten item diagnostic questionnaire used to measure the severity of depressive episodes in patients with mood disorders.
The MADRS uses a 0 to 6 severity scale, scored following the interview. Scoring/Interpretation: Higher scores indicate increasing depressive symptoms. ... Cut-off points include: 0 to 6 - symptom absent, 7 to 19 - mild depression, 30 to 34 - moderate, 35 to 60 - severe depression.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and immediate post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>A self-report measure of the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-CSSRS). This questionnaire was developed to rate suicidal ideation and behavior.
It rates a person's degree of suicidal ideation on a scale, ranging from &quot;wish to be dead&quot; to &quot;active suicidal ideation with specific plan and intent and behaviors.
The scale identifies specific behaviors which may be indicative of a person's intent to complete suicide. An person exhibiting even a single behavior identified by the scale was 8 to 10 times more likely to complete suicide.</description>
