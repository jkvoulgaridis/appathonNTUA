  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II/III randomized controlled trial to evaluate efficacy of platinum-based
      chemotherapy vs conventionally prescribed non-platinum monochemotherapy in patients with
      platinum-resistant ovarian cancer
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recurrent ovarian cancer (ROC) is usually subdivided to platinum-sensitive (platinum-free
      interval [PFI] ≥6 mo.) and platinum-resistant ovarian cancer [PROC] (PFI &lt;6 mo.) subtypes.
      Prognosis for the latter group is dismal and current guidelines recommend treating these
      patients with non-platinum based chemotherapy. However, the evidence behind this is quite
      unconvincing and according to recent data patients with non-platinum refractory
      platinum-resistant ovarian cancer could derive benefit from platinum rechallenge. This trial
      is designed for head-to-head comparison of platinum and non-platinum therapy efficacy in
      treatment of platinum-resistant ovarian cancer.
