  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our overall objective is to evaluate the efficacy of therapist-assisted, internet-based
      cognitive-behavioural therapy (iCBT) for depressed cardiac patients with respect to clinical
      outcomes, and the feasibility of the program. Our primary outcome will be depression
      severity; secondary outcomes will be hospitalization for a cardiac cause, recurrent
      myocardial infarction or revascularization. The study will inform a proposal to incorporate
      iCBT into the resources routinely available to cardiac patients following hospitalization for
      a cardiac event.

      We are planning we are planning a single-arm, open label trial to evaluate the feasibility,
      acceptability and efficacy of iCBT among persistently depressed cardiac patients. Cardiac
      patients will be recruited from inpatient units in a university-affiliated hospital and
      screened for depression at 4 and possibly 8 or 12 weeks following discharge. Eligible
      patients will be enrolled in the iCBT program.Data regarding the primary outcome, improvement
      in depression severity, will be collected at completion of the intervention and at 8 weeks
      after completion. In addition to depression severity data, we will also obtain other data
      related to clinical feasibility, such as treatment adherence and the acceptability of the
      intervention to patients. Self-reported rates of hospital readmission or emergency visits for
      a cardiac cause will also be tracked.

    <description>Designed for general clinical use (but not specifically cardiac patients), it consists of 5 online modules outlining cognitive-behavioural skills for depression, completed over 7-8 weeks. The participants will be guided step-wise through the modules by the therapist. Participants can work more or less at their own pace, but are expected to proceed to the next module within 1-2 weeks. Because the content is identical for each participant, fidelity to the web-based component of the intervention is ensured.</description>
