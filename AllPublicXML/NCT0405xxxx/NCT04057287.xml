      The study aim to identify the risk factors of liver fibrosis among first degree relatives.
      This study consists of 2 parts (Cross Sectional and Case Control Study).

      Part 1: The first primary objective will be achieved by following study design. Study
      population: First degree relatives of NRC. Study design: A Cross Sectional Study

      Part 2 The second Primary objective will be achieved by following study design. Study design:
      A Case Control Study

      Study population:

      Case: NASH related Cirrhosis patients Control-1: Healthy Control. Control-2: HBV Disease
      Control Study period: 3 Years

      All the patients diagnosed with NASH cirrhosis attending Institute of Liver and Biliary
      Sciences OPD/IPD will be enrolled. An informed consent will be taken. Complete details of the
      subject will be taken. The data will be collected on socio-demographic by (socio-demographic
      questionnaire), alcohol by AUDIT-C (Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test), Tobacco by
      FTND (Fagerstrom Test Nicotine Dependence), physical activity by IPAQ (International Physical
      Activity Questionnaire), Diet by FFQ (Food Frequency Questionnaire) &amp; physical measurement.

      Blood will be collected and analyzed for Platelets, PT/INR, Serum Creatinine, LFT, FBS,
      HOMA-IR, Lipid Profile, HBsAg, AntiHBs, Anti HBc, Anti HCV, Anti HAV, IgM anti HAV, IgM anti
      HEV, auto-Immune markers, Ceruloplasmin, Transferrin, S.Ferritin, Alpha1antitrpsin and
      genetic markers.

      The stool will be collected and analyzed for gut microbiota profiling.

      The data will be collected on socio-demographic by (socio-demographic questionnaire), alcohol
      by AUDIT-C (Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test), Tobacco by FTND (Fagerstrom Test
      Nicotine Dependence), physical activity by IPAQ (International Physical Activity
      Questionnaire), Diet by FFQ (Food Frequency Questionnaire), 24-hour dietary recall method &amp;
      physical measurement.

      Blood will be collected and analyzed for CBC, LFT, KFT, PT/INR, FBS, HOMA-IR, Lipid Profile,
      HBsAg, AntiHBs, Anti HBc, Anti HCV, Anti HAV, IgM anti HAV, IgM anti HEV, auto-Immune
      markers, Ceruloplasmin, Transferrin, S.Ferritin, Alpha1antitrpsin and genetic markers.

      The stool will be collected and analyzed for gut microbiota profiling. Controlled Attenuation
      Parameter and liver stiffness will be measured by using transient elastography. Ultrasound
      abdomen will be done First degree relatives of indexed patients will be enrolled. First
      degree relatives who will not accompanying the indexed subject will be contacted
      telephonically and will be requested to participate in the study.

      The data on first degree relative will be collected on similar parameter as of the indexed
      patient. This will be a cross sectional study.

      For each case, 3 healthy controls will be taken. Healthy Control will be identified from the
      OPD/IPD of ILBS. Liver transplant donors, hospital volunteers, healthy attendants who are
      accompanying other patients of different specialties will be enrolled. An informed consent
      will be taken. The data will be collected on similar parameter as of the indexed patient.
      This will be case control study.

      We will also have disease control (HBV control) for each case enrolled. Subject suffering
      from HBV infection will be included as disease control. For each case, 1 disease control will
      be included. Disease Control will be identified from the OPD/IPD of ILBS. An informed consent
      will be taken. The data will be collected on similar parameter as of the indexed patient.

      Genetic markers and stool microbiota profiling will be done in 30% of the subsets of sample
      i.e NRC, first degree relatives, Healthy Control and Disease control.
