  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study to use Self-system therapy (SST), to treat depression and
      lung-cancer-related distress in older adults (65 years and older).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigator will examine whether delivering the SST intervention will be both feasible
      and acceptable to study participants. The investigator will also examine whether
      participation in SST can help alleviate symptoms of depression and distress while helping
      improve overall functioning in older adults with advanced lung cancer.

    <measure>Number of patients that complete SST treatment sessions</measure>
    <time_frame>End of study, week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Completion of at least 85% of 12 SST treatment sessions.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient satisfaction with treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>End of study, week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ-8), which assesses treatment credibility (pre-treatment) and effectiveness of/satisfaction with services (post-treatment). An overall score is calculated by summing the respondent's rating (item rating) score for each scale item. For the CSQ-8 version, scores therefore range from 8 to 32, with higher values indicating higher satisfaction.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in General Distress as measure by the CORE-10</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 weeks, 1 month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The CORE-10 measure will be used for rating general distress. The measure comprises ten questions about how participants have been feeling over the past week. Scores range from 0-40, with higher scores indicating greater distress.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Depression as measured by the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 weeks, 1 month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Depression will be measured using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II). The measure has 21 items. The BDI-II is scored by summing the ratings for the 21 items. Each item is rated on a 4-point scale ranging from 0 to 3. The maximum total score is 63. Higher scores indicate greater depression.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Functioning as measured by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy- Lung</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 weeks, 1 month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Functioning will be measured using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy- Lung (FACT-L), a 36-item measure with a five-point scale from 0 (not at all) to 4 (very much). Higher scores indicate poor functioning.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Mobility as measured by patient physical activity</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 weeks, 1 month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Mobility indices will include participant report of difficulty walking across a room without help from another person or equipment (none, a little vs some, a lot, unable), difficulty walking two to three blocks without help from another person or equipment (none, a little vs some, a lot, unable), and use of assistive device (yes vs no).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Physical Activity as measured by the Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 weeks, 1 month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Physical Activity will be measured using the Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly (PASE)The instrument is comprised of self-reported occupational, household and leisure activities items over a one-week period. PASE scores are calculated from weights and frequency values for each of 12 types of activity.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Self-Discrepancy as measured by a Computerized Selves Questionnaire (CSQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Self-Discrepancy will be measured using the Computerized Selves Questionnaire (CSQ). The CSQ is a computer-based version of the original self-discrepancy questionnaire used by Higgins and colleagues (1986) in which a person is asked to produce a list of eight personal attributes that s/he would ideally like to possess and eight attributes s/he feels s/he ought to possess. To score qualities in the actual self column are compare with those in either the ought self column.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in self-regulation as measured by a Regulatory Focus Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Self-Regulatory Orientation will be measured using the Regulatory Focus Questionnaire (RFQ).The measure has 11 items using 5-point scales, along two sub scales measuring the extent to which an individual believes s/he has been successful in attaining promotion or prevention goals. Six questions quantify Promotion and five questions quantify Prevention the promotion sums must be divided by 6, and the prevention sums must be divided by 5 in order to place scores for both orientations on the same 1-5 scale.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Treatment session fidelity as measured by counts of whether a skill was introduced</measure>
    <time_frame>End of study, week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Trained raters will listen to audio recordings of treatment sessions and use a pre-defined checklist of session content and strategies of the treatment to indicate if session coping skills were taught (yes/no) coded as 1 for yes and 0 for no. Higher scores indicate greater session fidelity.</description>

    <description>Older adults with stage III or stage IV lung cancer will be enrolled in the Self-System Therapy intervention to treat illness-related distress, depression, and to enhance self-efficacy via delivery of behavioral coping skills across a period of 12 weeks.</description>

    <intervention_name>Self-System Therapy for Older Adults with Advanced Lung Cancer (SST-LC)</intervention_name>
    <description>The SST-LC is a brief structured intervention deliverable by video conference. The new SST-LC protocol will incorporate behavioral strategies designed to meet the needs of older adults with lung cancer, including examining individual and shared expectations for lung cancer care, identifying discrepancies between expectations and realistic possibilities, and modifying stress-exacerbating behaviors.</description>
