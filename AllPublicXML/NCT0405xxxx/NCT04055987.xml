  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this proposed study is to examine the benefits of using electropalatography
      (EPG) during speech therapy with adult individuals who are either congenitally deaf or
      adventitiously deaf and use a cochlear implant.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It has been established in numerous research studies that there is a definitive link between
      speech perception and speech production, in that what one can perceive, one can produce.
      Hearing loss disrupts this link and while cochlear implants make a significant difference in
      perception of sound, adults who are deaf and receive a cochlear implant (CI) do not gain the
      same perceptual benefits as children who are deaf and are implanted at a young age. Thus, the
      speech production of the adult CI user is reported to be less intelligible. The purpose of
      this proposed study is to examine the benefits of using electropalatography (EPG) during
      speech therapy with adult individuals who are either congenitally deaf or adventitiously deaf
      and use a cochlear implant. The investigators have proposed to study 10 CI users (5 in each
      etiological group) who will undergo speech intelligibility testing, and receive speech
      therapy (1x/week for 10 weeks) using EPG that provides both visual (biofeedback) and auditory
      feedback. It is hypothesized that the biofeedback in addition to the auditory feedback from
      the CI will result in an increase in articulation skills and thus the speech intelligibility
      in these individuals will improve significantly.

    <description>Prior and post speech training, participants will read aloud a standard paragraph (Rainbow passage), complete a traditional speech test (Goldman Fristoe Test of Articulation - 3) to assess the sounds of the English language in all word positions (initial, medial, final) and read a list of consonant-vowel-consonant (CVC) combinations. Individual treatment will be provided once a week for 10 consecutive weeks. Traditional speech intervention with visual biofeedback from the EPG will be used. Auditory feedback will be provided through the participants own cochlear implant.</description>

    <description>The EPG software program allows the speech clinician to model and comment upon the visual patterns during tongue/palate contact and to replay the participant's production for additional correction or reinforcement productions. Auditory feedback will be used to facilitate participant's perception of differences in production.</description>
