  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diagnosing periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) remains a major clinical challenge. The
      diagnosis of PJI is based on a composition of clinical judgment, serologic test from
      peripheral blood, synovial fluid cytology and biomarkers, radiography, microbiology,
      histopathologic evaluation of periprosthetic tissue, and intraoperative findings. The
      importance of PJI diagnosis give the subsequent treatment options, like the removal of
      prosthesis, debridement and prosthesis retention and the time of reimplantation.

      Currently, The Second International Consensus Meeting (ICM) has announced its criteria for
      the diagnosis of PJI. The preoperative diagnosis includes serologic tests (C-reactive
      protein, D-dimer, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate) and synovial fluid biomarkers (white
      blood cell and differential, leukocyte esterase and ⍺-defensin). The intraoperative diagnosis
      includes a single positive culture, positive histology, and positive intraoperative
      purulence. However, some of the markers used in the 2018 ICM criteria, such as ⍺-defensin,
      leukocyte esterase, and synovial fluid C-reactive protein, are not available in every
      hospital and cannot be immediately available to clinicians in decision making.

      The microfluidic technologies have made a notable impact on the evolution of diagnostic tools
      by providing a rapid and cost-effective platform for the application of immunoassay
      techniques. The microfluidic system integrates the complex processing steps of the laboratory
      protocols into a single chip through logical integration and optimization of processes. Chang
      Gung Memorial Hospital and National Tsing Hua University have conducted preliminary research
      to confirm the feasibility of their microfluidic systems.

      Therefore, the project will develop a &quot;microfluidic biomarker detection chip&quot; to detect the
      concentrations three important biomarkers for PJI, including ⍺-defensin, leukocyte esterase
      and C-reactive protein in synovial fluids. This will be a three-year project. In the 1st
      year, 50 patients who will be scheduled to undergo unilateral revision total joint
      arthroplasty (RTJA) will be collected with the synovial fluid and tested on a laboratory
      platform. In the 2nd year, based on laboratory results, 50 patients undergoing RTJAs will be
      recruited to develop a microfluidic chip system, and their on-chip performance will be
      fine-tuned and optimized. In the 3rd year, 50 patients undergoing RTJA will be collected, and
      the verification of the microfluidic system will be realized. This system will be validated
      in PJIs cohorts in the first stage of debridement and implant removal, in the interim period,
      and the second stage of reimplantation. It is expected that biomarker detection chip will
      improve medical distress and bring important information to clinical decision-making.

        Given the lack of published data regarding the application of 2nd ICM criteria, we will not
        perform a power analysis for sample size calculation before the study. All consecutive
        patients undergoing revision total joint arthroplasty (hips and knees) will be eligible for
        recruitment.
