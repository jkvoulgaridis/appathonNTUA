  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label extension study of IMR-687 in adult patients who completed Imara's
      blinded Phase 2a study (IMR-SCD-102). The open-label extension study will evaluate long-term
      safety and tolerability.

      This is an open-label extension study of IMR-687 in adult patients with SCA who were
      previously participants in the Phase 2a study titled &quot;A Phase 2a, Randomised, Double-Blind,
      Placebo-Controlled Study of IMR-687 in Adult Patients with Sickle Cell Anaemia (Homozygous
      HbSS or Sickle-β0 Thalassemia).&quot;

      This open-label extension study with IMR-687 will evaluate the long-term safety and
      tolerability of IMR 687 in adult SCA patients. Exploratory long-term PD parameters will also
      be examined. Patients in this study will not be stratified on the basis of prior baseline
      hydroxyurea use.
