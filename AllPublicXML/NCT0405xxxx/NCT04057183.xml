  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the accuracy of a new non-invasive device, the
      Carotid Stenotic Scan (CSS), to check for stenosis of the internal carotid artery (ICA) as
      compared to a carotid duplex ultrasound study.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Currently, carotid duplex ultrasound is the primary diagnostic tool for the evaluation for
      ICA stenosis and must be performed by a trained and certified vascular technologist using
      advanced duplex imaging equipment and with subsequent interpretation by a trained physician.
      this test is not considered suitable for screening for disease. It would be of value to
      develop an accurate, reliable, low-cost, and easily accessible tool to screen for
      extra-cranial ICA disease in an office based setting. However, such a tool would require
      novel technology that allows for quick, accurate, reproducible, and safe evaluation.

      This study will evaluate a new technology called the Carotid Stenotic Scan (CSS) developed by
      CVR Medical. The CSS instrument uses sensitive transducers to detect low frequency pressure
      fluctuations associated with flow disturbances downstream from areas of arterial narrowing.

      Subjects will undergo a clinically ordered clinical carotid duplex ultrasound as part of
      standard of care. Subjects will have a noninvasive CSS assessment either before or after the
      carotid duplex ultrasound.

        Inclusion criteria identify an &quot;at-risk&quot; population with unknown carotid artery status. The
        literature indicates that patients who meet the criteria have a prevalence of significant
        carotid artery stenosis (&gt;50%) of 7-10%. Current estimates are that 3 million adults in the
        United States have this degree of carotid artery disease with an annual stroke risk of
        5-10%.

        Exclusion criteria are in place to identify patients in whom the status of the carotid
        arteries is already likely known (prior CEA or stent), have significant heart disease which
        will impact flow hemodynamics and create false negative or positive studies (CHF, aortic
        stenosis), or have excessive subcutaneous neck tissue that will attenuate and mask the CSS
        signal (elevated BMI).
