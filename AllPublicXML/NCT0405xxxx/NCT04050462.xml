    <textblock>
      A phase II clinical trial is utilized to examine whether BMS-986253 (25 subjects) or
      Cabiralizumab (25 subjects) when combined with Nivolumab offers improved radiographic
      objective response rates (ORR) over Nivolumab monotherapy (25 subjects) in advanced HCC
      patients.
