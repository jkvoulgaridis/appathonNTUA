      To compare treatment with preservative-free dexamethasone 0.1% (Monofree Dexamethason) and
      diclofenac 0.1% (Dicloabak) eye drops versus preserved dexamethasone 0.1% (Maxidex) and
      diclofenac 0.1% (Voltaren Ophtha) eye drops after cataract surgery in terms of postoperative
      inflammation, iatrogenic dry eye disease and cystoid macular edema.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cataract surgery is a standardized procedure yielding excellent visual outcomes in most
      patients. According to Daien et al., the incidence of cataract surgery in 2012 in France was
      11/1000 person-years. Although there are few complications related to the surgery, patients
      often experience ocular discomfort in the postoperative period.

      Postoperative treatment usually includes topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and
      topical steroids for four weeks to control anterior chamber inflammation, to relieve ocular
      pain after surgery and to reduce the incidence of cystoid macular edema.

      Benzalkonium chloride (BAK) is the most common eye drop preservative and is associated with
      several ocular adverse effects, including dry eye and ocular surface inflammation. Moreover,
      in two clinical trials comparing the effects of BAK-containing and preservative-free eye
      drops, anterior chamber inflammation was reported in response to BAK after 1 month of
      exposure. Finally, besides the fact that intra-ocular inflammation increases the risk of
      macular edema, there is some evidence in the literature suggesting that BAK may also
      contribute to the development of macular edema.

      Because of these well-established detrimental effects of preservatives, pharmaceutical
      industry has invested in the development of preservative-free eye drops in the past decade,
      which has led to preservative-free alternatives for almost all the eye medications.

      The aim of this project is to investigate whether omitting preservatives from the
      postoperative topical treatment after cataract surgery can reduce symptoms and signs of
      ocular surface disease, intra-ocular inflammation and the incidence of cystoid macular edema.
