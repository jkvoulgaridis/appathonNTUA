  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine whether moderate alcohol use in the context of HIV infection
      exacerbates inflammatory signaling in the immune system and brain. The study will recruit
      healthy individuals and people living with HIV infection who are otherwise in good health to
      participate. Participants will complete an experimental protocol that involves controlled
      alcohol administration and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Primary outcomes are plasma
      biomarkers of inflammation and MRI markers correlated with neuroinflammation. Results will
      advance understanding of the effects of alcohol use in people living with HIV infection.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A sample of 56 participants, to include equal numbers of PLWH and uninfected controls, will
      be recruited to complete the experimental protocol. Participants will be randomized to one of
      the two beverage conditions (0.60 g/kg alcohol beverage, 0.00 g/kg placebo beverage). Blood
      samples will be collected at baseline (prior to beverage administration) and for three hours
      afterward. Cognitive performance and subjective intoxication will be assessed using
      standardized measures. MRI scans will be collected 4-5 hours after beverage consumption to
      capture neurobiological outcomes on the descending limb of blood alcohol.
