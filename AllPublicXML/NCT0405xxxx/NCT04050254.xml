      The purpose of this study is to assess the effects on pain of transcranial direct current
      stimulation combined with therapeutic exercise in fibromyalgia patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fibromyalgia is one of the rheumatic diseases with the greatest impact on the quality of
      life, whose etiology and pathophysiology is not yet fully demonstrated. Perhaps this is why
      its therapeutic approach is refractory to current treatments.

      Based on the theory that fibromyalgia is characterized by a sensitization at the level of the
      central nervous system that leads to an increase in the perception of pain, any therapeutic
      approach aimed at modulating the central nervous system may be beneficial. Electrical
      stimulation with transcranial direct current (tDCS) is among these techniques.

      In the same way, therapeutic exercise has shown to have, like the tDCS, a beneficial effect
      on pain in different chronic pathologies.

      The present study aims to investigate the effect on pain of a combination therapy of tDCS and
      therapeutic exercise in patients with fibromyalgia.

    <measure>Change in referred pain area after suprathreshold pressure stimulation from baseline to post-treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; immediately after intervention; 1-month after intervention</time_frame>
    <description>A pressure algometer (Force Ten™, Wagner Instruments, USA) will be used. It will be performed on the infraspinatus muscle (point equidistant between the midpoint of the spine of the scapula, the inferior angle of the scapula and the midpoint of the medial border of the scapula) at a constant suprathreshold pressure (20% above the pressure pain threshold) for 60 seconds.
After the stimulation, the subject should draw the induced pain area on a digital bodychart using the Navigate Pain application (Navigate Pain, Aalborg University, Denmark).</description>

    <measure>Change in pain intensity from baseline to post-treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; immediately after intervention; 1-month after intervention</time_frame>
    <description>It will be measured with a visual analog scale (VAS) of 100 millimeters in length. The subject has to indicate the level of pain he feels, being 0 the absence of pain and 100 the maximum imaginable</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Fibromyalgia Impact Quality-of-Life</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; immediately after intervention; 1-month after intervention</time_frame>
    <description>It will be measured with the version adapted to the Spanish of the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ). The scale ranges from 0 to 100. Higher values represent a worse result.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Anxiety</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; immediately after intervention; 1-month after intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The version adapted to Spanish from the State Scale (STAI-ES) of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) will be used. The scale ranges from 0 to 60. Higher values represent a worse result.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain catastrophizing</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; immediately after intervention; 1-month after intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The Spanish version of the Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS) will be used. The scale ranges from 0 to 52. Higher values represent a worse result.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Depression</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; immediately after intervention; 1-month after intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The adaptation to the Spanish of Beck Depression Inventory II will be used. The scale ranges from 0 to 63. Higher values represent a worse result.</description>
