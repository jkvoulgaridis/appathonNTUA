  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to investigate the effectiveness of a memory
      enhancement technique in persons with a Traumatic Brian Injury (TBI). The study is designed
      to research how well this technique can help people with TBI improve their memory and their
      ability to function better in everyday life

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Impairments in higher level cognitive processing, such as new learning and memory, are common
      in Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI)and negatively impact multiple aspects of everyday life,
      including occupational and social functioning. Despite this, few studies have attempted to
      remediate these cognitive deficits in order to improve everyday functioning. While not
      applied in traditional rehabilitation protocols as of yet, many techniques from cognitive
      psychology significantly improve learning and memory in healthy persons. These techniques
      include the generation effect (GE), the spacing effect (SE), and the testing effect (TE).
      These techniques have recently been incorporated into an 8-session treatment protocol,
      Stylistic Memory Enhancement (SME), designed to teach participants about each of the
      techniques, train them on how to apply the techniques in daily life and practice their
      application to daily life memory demanding situations. The protocol includes teaching
      participants how to restructure a memory demanding situation in order to make optimal use of
      self-generation, spaced learning and self-testing.
