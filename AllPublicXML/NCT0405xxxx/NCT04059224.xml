  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase 2 trial will investigate the efficacy and safety of trametinib and dabrafenib in
      patients with advanced BRAF V600 (v-Raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B) wild-type
      melanoma (stratified according to BRAF V600 wild-type/NRAS (neuroblastoma Ras viral oncogene
      homolog) mutant and BRAF V600 wild-type/NRAS wild-type melanoma patients) that have been
      pretreated and progressed following treatment with PD-1- (programmed cell death-1) and
      CTLA-4-blocking (cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4) immune checkpoint inhibitors.
      The investigators hypothesize that treatment with trametinib will result in objective
      antitumor activity. In order to improve the tolerability and optimize the dose intensity of
      trametinib, a minimal dose of dabrafenib will be added to prevent and manage
      trametinib-related skin toxicity.

      This will be a non-randomized stratified dual-arm open-label two-stage single-centre phase 2
      trial.

      Patients are eligible if they are diagnosed with BRAF V600 (v-Raf murine sarcoma viral
      oncogene homolog B) wild-type unresectable AJCC (American Joint Committee on Cancer) stage
      III or IV melanoma and are documented with progression of disease following treatment with a
      PD-1- (programmed cell death-1) and CTLA-4-blocking (cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated
      antigen 4) immune checkpoint inhibitor or who have a contraindication for treatment with
      immune checkpoint inhibitors.

      Patients will be considered for study participation not earlier than 4 weeks after the last
      dosing of the prior therapy.

      Patients will be stratified according to their NRAS (neuroblastoma RAS viral oncogene
      homolog) mutation status: arm A involves patients with advanced pretreated BRAF V600
      wild-type/NRAS mutant melanoma; arm B involves patients with advanced pretreated BRAF V600
      wild-type/NRAS wild-type melanoma.

      All patients will be treated with trametinib 2 mg once a day and dabrafenib 50 mg twice a
      day. Throughout their study participation, patients will be continuously monitored for safety
      and evaluated for tumor response every 8 weeks or sooner if there is clinical suspicion of
      progressive disease. Patients will be treated until progression of disease, unacceptable
      toxicity or withdrawal of consent.

      The primary endpoint of the study is the objective response rate. Secondary endpoints are
      progression-free survival, overall survival and safety.
