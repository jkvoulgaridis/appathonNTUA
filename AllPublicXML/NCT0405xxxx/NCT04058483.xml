  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine if hypnotizability can be reliably tested over the
      phone, without having to see or touch a patient. The scores from a new test for
      hypnotizability by phone will be compared to the scores from a standard in-person test, to
      make sure the results are similar.
