      The main objective of the study will be to investigate whether treatment with non-invasive
      vagus nerve stimulation (nVNS) on top of best medical practice in acute ischemic stroke
      patients results in less infarct growth in the penumbra and smaller infarct volumes compared
      with those of patients not treated with nVNS. The study will be a prospective randomized
      clinical trial with blinded outcome assessment (PROBE design). 150 patients will be
      randomized to nVNS with the gammaCore Sapphire™ device on top of best medical practice versus
      best medical practice alone (including intravenous thrombolysis and/or thrombectomy if
      indicated). If patients are randomized to nVNS, two stimulations of two minutes each will be
      applied in the neck every 15 minutes in the first 3 hours. Thereafter two stimulations will
      be applied every 8 hours over the next 5 days or until discharge, whichever occurs first. The
      stimulation side in the neck will be the radiological side of the stroke. The co-primary
      endpoints will be the infarct growth in the penumbra between admission and day 3 on CT
      perfusion scan (CTP) and the final infarct volume on MRI scan on day 5 of patients treated
      with nVNS compared with those of patients not treated with VNS.
