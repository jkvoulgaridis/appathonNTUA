  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), makes its appearance during childhood and youth, but
      management implications last till late adulthood. Its treatment includes the combination of
      multiple daily glucose measurements, insulin administration and balanced nutrition. The goals
      of therapy are to achieve glycemic control (HbA1c &lt; 7.5%), and minimal glycemic excursions.
      Furthermore, recent studies imply that keeping HbA1c within target range is not sufficient to
      prevent complications, attributed mainly to blood glucose level fluctuating from high to low,
      associated with food intake and adolescents behavior. The current implication of glycemic
      control on the central nervous system (CNS) includes abnormal electrical brain activity,
      structural changes in brain's white and grey matter, and cognitive impairment. Still, little
      is known on the effect of sleep pattern, including circadian rhythm reversal (&quot;biological
      clock) on asymptomatic glycemic excursions, and on CNS functions. There is no data regarding
      the association of the biologic clock on CNS functionality among adolescents, nonetheless
      among T1DM adolescents, for whom behavior and circadian rhythm alterations may have harmful
      effect. The investigators propose a cross-over designed study by examining adolescents with
      and without T1DM during 2 weeks of regular sleeping pattern (night sleep), and during 2 weeks
      of sleeping during the day as happens during summer vacation. The main objective of the
      proposed study is to offer proof of the clinical and metabolic relevance and cognitive
      effects of the reversal of the circadian clock in adolescents with and T1DM during summer
      vacations and weekends. Study is designed to demonstrate a difference among healthy and
      diabetics during reversed night/day circadian clocks in the time spent within target range of
      glucose, performance on neuro cognitive tasks, electrical brain activity, and hormonal
      profile.
