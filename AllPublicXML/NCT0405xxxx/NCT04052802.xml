  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate the retention, marginal integrity and potential to
      prevent lesion progression of a bioactive resin material compared to a conventional
      resin-based flowable composite during management of initial carious lesion in adult
      population over an 18 months period.

      Bio-active resin materials aim to possess the mechanical properties of resin materials in
      terms of higher wear resistance and dimensional stability over time. They also aim to mimic
      the biological activity of glass ionomers in terms of ion recharge and release. These new
      bio-active resin materials, with their lower particle size and better adaptability and
      polishability, might offer a substantial addition as fissure sealants if they fulfil the
      requisities satisfactory mechanical properties of resins and of ion recharge and release of
      glass ionomers.

      The study will be conducted on demineralized fissures of permanent molars by application of a
      newly introduced giomer in one group while the other group will recieve a conventional resin
      material where they will be assessed for retention, marginal integrity and caries
      progression.
