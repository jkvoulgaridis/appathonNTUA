  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In France, a national prospective cohort for monitoring children and adolescents with
      autoimmune cytopenia OBS'CEREVANCE is in place since 2004. It is coordinated in Bordeaux by
      the Center's team. Reference Rare Diseases CEREVANCE. It has been validated by the French
      Data Protection Authority in 2009 (information note and written consent). It had mid 2013
      more of 900 patients, and the data collected make it possible to study intentionally to treat
      the therapeutic management of patients with Chronic Immune-Thrombocytopenic Purpura, from
      Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia, or from EVANS syndrome.

      This study evaluates efficacy and tolerance at 6 months of treatment immunomodulators
      prescribed in France in real conditions of use, in children and adolescents under the age of
      18, for a Chronic Immune-Thrombocytopenic Purpura, an Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia or a
      simultaneous EVANS syndrome.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic immunological thrombocytopenic purpura and anemia hemolytic autoimmune are rare
      autoimmune hematologic diseases, primary or secondary, affecting the child often very young,
      sometimes associated simultaneously or sequentially (Evans syndrome). They can be
      life-threatening, they in 20 to 50% of cases of prolonged dependence on immunosuppressants.
      The incidence of Immune-Thrombocytopenic Purpura is 2 to 5 / 100,000 inhabitants of under 18,
      the Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia 5 to 10 times lower.

      For the pediatric population, the experience reported in the literature is limited to
      individual cases or small series often retrospective and not comparative. It does not allow
      to have in 2013 a reasoning based on on evidence to define the second-line therapeutic
      strategy, in especially for Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia where the therapeutic data are almost
      nonexistent. Splenectomy remains to this day the reference treatment of the Chronic
      Immune-Thrombocytopenic Purpura of the adult. In children, the therapeutic goal is to avoid
      it or to prevent it delay it. After failure of first-line treatments (immunoglobulins or
      corticosteroids) used for treatment of relapses or continuously, the main immunomodulatory
      treatments used in second line are azathioprine, ciclosporin, hydroxychloroquine, rituximab,
      mycophenolate mofetil, romiplostim, eltrombopag.

      The benefit / risk balance of these 7 immunomodulatory treatments prescribed to the child for
      autoimmune cytopenia is presumed to be favorable based on the very limited data from the
      pediatric literature and the experience of most adults do not benefit from a specific
      marketing authorization.

        Immune-Thrombocytopenic Purpura, Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia , or EVANS syndrome, in one of
        the 30 centers of the CEREVANCE network, will be identified and selected by the team

    <ipd_description>Through this program, a coordinated and centralized analysis of reliable pharmacovigilance data will be transmitted in real time to the National Agency for Medicines. It will enable National Agency for Medicines to ensure the safe use of these treatments for the pediatric population, vulnerable, and optimize monitoring in the short and long term identified or potential risks of these treatments on a developing immune system. It will also ensure the monitoring of off-label or Temporary Therapeutic Protocol / Temporary recommendation for use prescriptions and to argue recommendations for good use. For treatments whose benefit will be confirmed, these results will be useful to the medical community to define the best second-line therapeutic strategy.</ipd_description>
