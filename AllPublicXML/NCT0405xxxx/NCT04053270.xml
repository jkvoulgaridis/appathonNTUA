  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was a phase III, multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, to
      evaluate the safety and efficacy of subcutaneous bioresorbable afamelanotide implants in
      patients with Erythropoietic Protoporphyria (EPP).

      The study was conducted with two parallel study arms with crossover between treatments every
      60 days.

      Eligible patients were randomised to a treatment group, and received implants of active
      treatment (afamelanotide 16mg) or placebo, in an alternating crossover fashion according to
      the following dosing regime:

        -  Group A was administered active implants on Days 0, 120, 240 and placebo implants on
           Days 60, 180, 300

        -  Group B was administered placebo implants on Days 0, 120, 240 and active implants on
           Days 60, 180, 300

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Afamelanotide is a man-made drug being studied for use as a preventative medication for
      Erythropoietic Protoporphyria (EPP) sufferers. It is a synthetically produced analogue of
      human alpha melanocyte stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH).

      The study will involve the use of an implant, which comes in the form of a small rod to be
      administered under the skin. The implant may contain the study drug afamelanotide or a
      placebo (inactive medication).

      This study aims to provide insight into the effectiveness of afamelanotide under normal
      conditions of use in EPP patients.

    <measure>Cumulative Number of Days of Phototoxic Reactions (Study Efficacy Population)</measure>
    <time_frame>0-360 days or Early Termination</time_frame>
    <description>The cumulative number of days where a phototoxic reaction occurred was recorded in the patient diary. The reported data represent a cumulative total for days of phototoxic reactions.
The participant scored the level of pain using an 11-point Likert pain scale, with minimum of 0 and maximum of 10. The 11-point Likert Pain scale with a value of 0 represents no pain and 10 represents worst imaginable pain.
The primary analysis population for efficacy was revised, to analyze only participants who reported cumulative total Likert pain scores of at least 26 during the study (0-360 days). This population, which was comprised of 60 patients, is identified as the Efficacy population. Participants with less than 26 Likert pain scores were not included in the analysis.</description>

    <measure>The Mean Number of Phototoxic Reactions (Study Efficacy Population)</measure>
    <time_frame>0-360 days or Early Termination</time_frame>
    <description>The mean number of phototoxic reactions that occurred whilst patients were on active compared with placebo implants.
The days on which the participant experienced pain as a result of phototoxic reactions (caused by exposure to natural light) was recorded in a study diary. On each day such a reaction occurred, the participant scored the level of pain using an 11-point Likert pain scale, with minimum of 0 and maximum of 10. The 11-point Likert pain scale with a value of 0 represents no pain and 10 represents worst imaginable pain.
The primary analysis population for efficacy was revised, to analyze only participants who reported a cumulative total Likert pain score of at least 26 during the study (0-360 days). This population, which was comprised of 60 patients, is identified as the Efficacy population.

    <measure>Cumulative Number of Days With Sunlight Exposure (Study Efficacy Population)</measure>
    <time_frame>0-360 days or Early Termination</time_frame>
    <description>The number of days with sunlight exposure was recorded in the patient diary. The sunlight exposures were divided into the following categories: none, &lt; 1 hour, 1 to 3 hours, 3 to 6 hours and &gt; 6 hours per day.</description>

    <description>Changes in melanin density (MD) (measured by spectrophotometry) at each visit by group.
Participants had their skin pigmentation measured by a non-invasive quantitative skin chromaticity (reflectance) reading. Reflectance by the skin of light measured at the wavelengths of 400 nm and 420 nm was recorded using a Minolta cm-2500d spectrophotometer at the following skin sites: forehead, left cheek, right inside upper arm, left medial forearm, right side of abdomen (avoiding implant insertion site), left side of sacral region/buttock.
Melanin density was determined for each skin site using the method of Dwyer et al 1998.</description>

    <measure>Change in Quality of Life Using SF36 Questionnaire (Physical Component Score) for Study Completers Population</measure>
    <time_frame>Day0, Day60, Day120, Day180, Day240, Day300, Day360 or Early Termination</time_frame>
    <description>The Summary of SF36 change from Baseline of Physical Component Score (PCS) to the scores during treatment on Days 60, 120, 180, 240, 300 and 360 using the SF36 questionnaire.
The SF-36 (The Short Form 36 Health Survey) consists of eight scaled scores, which are the weighted sums of the questions in each section. Each scale is directly transformed into a 0-100 scale on the assumption that each question carries equal weight.
The higher scores represent better health-related quality-of-life.</description>

        <title>Cumulative Number of Days of Phototoxic Reactions (Study Efficacy Population)</title>
        <description>The cumulative number of days where a phototoxic reaction occurred was recorded in the patient diary. The reported data represent a cumulative total for days of phototoxic reactions.
The participant scored the level of pain using an 11-point Likert pain scale, with minimum of 0 and maximum of 10. The 11-point Likert Pain scale with a value of 0 represents no pain and 10 represents worst imaginable pain.
The primary analysis population for efficacy was revised, to analyze only participants who reported cumulative total Likert pain scores of at least 26 during the study (0-360 days). This population, which was comprised of 60 patients, is identified as the Efficacy population. Participants with less than 26 Likert pain scores were not included in the analysis.</description>

        <description>The mean number of phototoxic reactions that occurred whilst patients were on active compared with placebo implants.
The days on which the participant experienced pain as a result of phototoxic reactions (caused by exposure to natural light) was recorded in a study diary. On each day such a reaction occurred, the participant scored the level of pain using an 11-point Likert pain scale, with minimum of 0 and maximum of 10. The 11-point Likert pain scale with a value of 0 represents no pain and 10 represents worst imaginable pain.

Participants had their skin pigmentation measured by a non-invasive quantitative skin chromaticity (reflectance) reading. Reflectance by the skin of light measured at the wavelengths of 400 nm and 420 nm was recorded using a Minolta cm-2500d spectrophotometer at the following skin sites: forehead, left cheek, right inside upper arm, left medial forearm, right side of abdomen (avoiding implant insertion site), left side of sacral region/buttock.
Melanin density was determined for each skin site using the method of Dwyer et al 1998.</description>

          <description>Changes in melanin density (MD) (measured by spectrophotometry) at each visit by group.
Participants had their skin pigmentation measured by a non-invasive quantitative skin chromaticity (reflectance) reading. Reflectance by the skin of light measured at the wavelengths of 400 nm and 420 nm was recorded using a Minolta cm-2500d spectrophotometer at the following skin sites: forehead, left cheek, right inside upper arm, left medial forearm, right side of abdomen (avoiding implant insertion site), left side of sacral region/buttock.
Melanin density was determined for each skin site using the method of Dwyer et al 1998.</description>
          <population>The secondary analysis population for efficacy included those subjects who received all required doses of investigational product. This population is identified as the study completers population.
Calculated MD &lt;0 or &gt;6 were omitted.</population>

        <title>Change in Quality of Life Using SF36 Questionnaire (Physical Component Score) for Study Completers Population</title>
        <description>The Summary of SF36 change from Baseline of Physical Component Score (PCS) to the scores during treatment on Days 60, 120, 180, 240, 300 and 360 using the SF36 questionnaire.
The SF-36 (The Short Form 36 Health Survey) consists of eight scaled scores, which are the weighted sums of the questions in each section. Each scale is directly transformed into a 0-100 scale on the assumption that each question carries equal weight.
The higher scores represent better health-related quality-of-life.</description>
