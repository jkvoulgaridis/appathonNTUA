  <brief_summary>

      This study aimed to measure the effects of SIH and DH on the mortality outcomes of the adult
      patients with moderate to severe thoracoabdominal injury

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Because the pathophysiologic response of the patients with a thoracoabdominal injury is
      different from those who had a traumatic brain injury, this study aimed to measure the
      effects of hyperglycemia induced by stress or by diabetes on the outcomes of patients with
      thoracoabdominal injuries in comparison with those who had non-diabetic normoglycemia (NDN).
      The primary study hypothesis stated that, following thoracoabdominal injuries, the patients
      with SIH had a worse outcome than patients with DH. The primary outcome was mortality rate of
      these patients.

        This retrospective study reviewed data from trauma patients registered between January 1,
        2009 and December 31, 2018. The inclusion criteria were age ≥20 years Adult patients with
        moderate to severe thoracoabdominal injuries (n = 802) were grouped into four exclusive
        subgroups: (1) SIH, which was defined as a serum glucose ≥ 200 mg/dL in the patients
        without DM (n = 52); (2) DH, which indicated a serum glucose ≥ 200 mg/dL in patients with
        DM (n = 79); (3), DN, which was defined when there was a serum glucose &lt; 200 mg/dL in the
        patients with DM (n = 50); and (4) NDN, indicating a serum glucose &lt; 200 mg/dL in patients
        who were absent of DM (n = 621)
