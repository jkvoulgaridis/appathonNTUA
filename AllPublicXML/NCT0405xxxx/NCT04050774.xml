  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Falls are the leading cause of nonfatal injuries in children and elderly. To understand the
      causes of falling in these populations, fundamental knowledge of how ageing affects balance
      control is of utmost importance.

      In general, two biomechanical mechanisms allow people to control balance; 1.moving the center
      of pressure within the base of support using ankle muscle activation; 2.counter-rotating
      segments around the center of mass. To understand how balance is controlled differently
      across the lifespan, 4 age groups (each N=20) will be compared to each other; i.e.
      prepubertal children (6-9y), postpubertal children (15-17y), young adults (18-24y), healthy
      non-falling older adults (65-80y). .

      A force plate platform combined with 3D movement registration will be used to determine the
      biomechanical balance control strategy across the lifespan during unperturbed and perturbed
      standing. The innovative but focused scope of this study could provide a breakthrough in our
      biomechanical understanding of balance control and, in particular, the changes in limitations
      of balance control in childhood and an ageing (fall-prone) population. The gained fundamental
      knowledge could lead to unprecedented insights in the causes of falling across the lifespan
      and in possible targets for intervention.

    <description>The unstable surface will be created with a balance board consisting of a wooden board mounted on a section of a cylinder, creating an unstable support in the sagittal plane or in the frontal plane. The participants will stand on three balance boards, varying the height of the surface of the board above the point of contact (15, 17 and 19 cm respectively). The radius of the cylinder will kept constant at 24 cm. The standing surface will be 48cm x 48 cm</description>
