  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2 study with an open-label dose escalation phase followed by a blinded
      withdrawal phase and an open label extension. The study is designed to monitor the PTG-300
      safety profile and to obtain preliminary evidence of efficacy of PTG-300 for the treatment of
      phlebotomy-requiring polycythemia vera.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Phase 2 study in approximately thirty subjects previously diagnosed with Polycythemia Vera
      who require phlebotomy on a routine basis. There is a 16 week dose finding phase followed by
      a dose stabilization phase. Subjects who successfully complete dose stabilization will be
      entered into 12 week randomized withdrawal phase to confirm the response. Subsequently
      patients will enter into 1 year open label extension to investigate long term safety.

    <intervention_model_description>Part 1:
28 week open-label dose escalation phase in which each subject's dose of PTG-300 is increased at 4-week intervals until the subject reaches the maximum planned dose or has a pre-specified decrease in hematocrit from baseline. After a potentially clinically active dose is found, subjects will be maintained at that dose until Week 29.
Part 2:
12-week blinded randomized withdrawal phase. Subjects are randomized 1:1 to continue PTG-300 or to receive placebo.
Part 3:
1 year open label extension.</intervention_model_description>
