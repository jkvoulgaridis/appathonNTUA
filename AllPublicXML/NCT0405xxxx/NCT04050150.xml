  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the feasibility of providing task-oriented arm training in standing
      or during walking in individuals with movement deficits due to stroke. Participants will
      received 24 sessions of arm training in standing over an 8-week period that focus on arm and
      hand function.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Residual motor deficits are common after stroke and often have a negative impact on the
      performance of functional activities and overall quality of life. A frequently reported
      contribution to these functional limitations is an inability to incorporate the weaker arm
      and hand into daily activities. While rehabilitation interventions can improve arm functional
      capacity, these improvements often do not translate into increased real-world arm use which
      is often reduced after stroke.

      The performance of skilled arm and hand movements in standing requires precise coordination
      between upper extremity movement and balance control. Many everyday functional tasks that
      require the arm are performed in standing (e.g. opening a door or meal preparation at the
      kitchen counter), however, training of arm function in rehabilitation is often done in
      sitting. An important rehabilitation approach may be to create a training environment that
      resembles the way the arm is used in everyday life (i.e. standing). This study will examine
      the feasibility of providing task-oriented, functional arm training in standing and during
      walking in individuals with motor deficits due to stroke.
