  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the study is to gain a better understanding of the gene expression changes
      in the endometrial biopsy especially whether the endometrium has reached a receptive status,
      i.e. the implantation window, or not.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The endometrium goes through huge gene expression changes during a cycle, the cells are
      transformed, the mucous membrane thickens, then loosens, and finally sheds. In this process,
      the expression of the genes also goes through significant changes, which can be determined
      from a small tissue sample.

      Endometrium biopsy samples can be used for endometrium phasing. A question of the study is
      the feasibility of using for endometrium phasing beside endometrium tissue biopsy also
      samples generated by endometrium lavage. The advantage of this latter method is that it is
      minimally invasive, it does not cause haemorrhage and has minimal side effects. In some
      selected cases endometrial lavage will be performed on the same day with endometrial tissue
      sampling together with the drawing of a peripheral blood sample.

      A list of potential biomarkers was proposed from the meta-analysis of published gene
      expression datasets. From the endometrium derived samples, RNA will be isolated and gene
      expression biomarkers will be measured. Expression profiles will be compared to published
      reference samples.
