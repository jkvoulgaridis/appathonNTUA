  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The use of prophylactic antibiotics in cirrhotics with gastrointestinal bleeding has been a
      routine clinical practice . It is still unknown whether use of short term vasoconstrictors
      and antibiotics could have superior acute hemostatic rate.

      Thus, the investigators conducted a trial to compare the effectiveness between participants
      receiving terlipressin and ceftriaxone 5 days and terlipressin and ceftriaxone 2 days after
      endoscopic therapy in cirrhotic patients presenting with acute gastro-esophageal variceal
      hemorrhage..

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acute gastro-esophageal variceal hemorrhage is a dreadful complication of portal
      hypertension. Meta-analysis showed that the combination of vasoconstrictor and endoscopic
      therapy is superior to endoscopic therapy or vasoconstrictor alone in the control of acute
      esophageal variceal hemorrhage. Bacterial infections are frequently encountered in cirrhotic
      patients presenting with acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding. The association of bacterial
      infections to variceal bleeding may increase the occurrence of variceal rebleeding and
      mortality. A study has shown that antibiotic prophylaxis in patients with acute esophageal
      variceal hemorrhage may reduce infection as well as prevent rebleeding. Currently, most
      guidelines recommend that vasoactive drugs should be continued for 3 to 5 days after
      endoscopic therapy and antibiotics should be instituted for up to 7 days to manage patients
      with acute esophageal variceal hemorrhage . On the other hand, some studies in recent years
      implied that short term vasoconstrictors or antibiotics could achieve similar low variceal
      rebleeding rates. The use of prophylactic antibiotics in cirrhotics with gastrointestinal
      bleeding for only one single dose or 3 days appeared to be feasible. It is still unknown
      whether use of short term both vasoconstrictors and antibiotics could have similar acute
      hemostatic rate.

      Thus, the investigators conducted a trial to compare the effectiveness between participants
      receiving terlipressin and ceftriaxone 5 days and terlipressin and ceftriaxone 2 days after
      endoscopic therapy in cirrhotic patients presenting with acute gastroesophageal variceal
      hemorrhage..
