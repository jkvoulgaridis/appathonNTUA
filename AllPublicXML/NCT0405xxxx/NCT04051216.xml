  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the feasibility of using two information technology tools in patients
      undergoing Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-cell (CART) therapy. The first is an Apple iPad®
      application called the BMT Roadmap, which shows information about the participant's health.
      The second is a wearable activity monitoring device. Health information technology tools such
      as Roadmap system and the activity monitoring device may enable caregivers and patients to
      become more active participants in their healthcare.

      30 patients will be asked to participate in the wearable device portion of the study. 30
      caregivers will be asked to participate in the Roadmap (iPad) portion of the study.

      Each caregiver will be provided with an iPad to use the BMT Roadmap system. Patients and/or
      caregivers are free to use this tool as much as they would like on their own time while in
      the hospital. The hospital care team will collect the iPad when the patient is discharged and
      ready to go home. Patients and caregivers will also be asked to take three surveys that will
      ask about their feelings and thoughts about the Roadmap application. The surveys will be
      completed when patients are admitted for their CART therapy, when they get discharged from
      the hospital and around 100 days after they receive their CART therapy.

      In addition to the use of the BMT Roadmap, this study will include around 7-10 interviews
      about participants' opinions on the two tools and their experience in the CART therapy
      process.

    <description>Feasibility of collecting longitudinal samples of blood, urine and stool from study population. Samples will be used to perform an exploratory analysis of the relationship between these biomarkers and clinical status, Roadmap and wearable device information.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Caregiver activation/participation compared to reference population to measure the impact of Roadmap information system and wearable monitoring device using survey instrument scores of Parent-Patient Activation Measure (P-PAM) as a composite measure.</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to day 100 post-CART</time_frame>
    <description>Descriptive statistics will be calculated for each Patient Activation Measure (PAM) score and stratified into the appropriate level of activation. Results will be compared with a published sample. Univariate analyses will be performed to assess associations between PAM and demographic, social, and environmental characteristics of the parent (type of insurance, marital status, number of children in household), disease-related characteristics of the patients (age, disease, disease status at CART), satisfaction (Press Ganey, Usefulness), caregiver burden (CQOLC), mood (POMS), anxiety (STAI), stress (Impact of Event Scale-Revised), miscarried helping (HHI), and experiential avoidance (PAAQ). Pearson's correlation (and other suitable measures of association for categorical variables) will be used to determine the nature and significance of association between each variable and Parent-PAM scores. This analysis will not be powered to detect any statistically meaningful differences.</description>

    <description>Caregivers receive the Roadmap information system loaded on an Apple iPad® for use during the inpatient hospitalization of CART therapy. The Roadmap information system consists of 5 modules personalized to the CART patient: laboratory studies, medications, clinical trial enrollment, healthcare providers, and criteria for discharge. Patients wear an activity monitoring device on days 0-100. Patients wear the device as long as they can each day to monitor physical activity level, sleep/wake patterns, skin temperature, heart rate and respiratory rate.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        INCLUSION:

          -  Caregiver (age 18 years or older) of any patient eligible to undergo CART therapy and
             any patient (age 5 years or older) eligible to undergo CART therapy will be recruited
             during the &quot;Pre-CART Workup&quot; stage in the outpatient setting.

          -  CAREGIVER PARTICIPANTS: Caregiver (age 18 years or older) of a patient who will be
             hospitalized to receive CART therapy in the University of Michigan Mott Children's
             Hospital Adult or Pediatric BMT Units. The age range of patients typically
             transplanted in the Pediatric BMT unit is 0-25 years, while the Adult BMT unit
             transplants those older than 25. Caregivers with children (patients) who are younger
             than 5 years of age may be eligible to participate even though their children are too
             young to assent or participate themselves.

          -  PATIENT PARTICIPANTS: Patient (age 10 years or older) who will be hospitalized to
             receive or after receiving CART therapy will be given the opportunity to
             assent/consent and participate in the study. With his/her permission, the patient will
             also be provided with their own iPad® Roadmap information system to use. Qualitative
             interviews will be conducted in patients (age 10 years or older) with their
             assent/consent. Patients (age 10-17.9 years) will be asked to complete surveys that
             have been validated in this age group and that offer insight into the usefulness of
             the Roadmap. Patients (18 years or older) will be asked to complete surveys. The
             patient will also be provided with their own non-invasive, wearable activity
             monitoring device(s) that will track activity and rest levels. Patients 5-9 years old
             will be enrolled with parental consent but will not be approached for assent. These
             patients will not be eligible to participate in the survey or interview portions of
             the study, however, they will be eligible for sample collection and wearable devices.

          -  Ability to speak and read proficiently in English (the study's instruments have not
             been translated and validated in languages other than English)

          -  Willing and able to provide informed consent

          -  Willing to comply with study procedures and reporting requirements

        EXCLUSION:

          -  Not willing and able to provide informed consent.

          -  Not willing to comply with study procedures and reporting requirements.
