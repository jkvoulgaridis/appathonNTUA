    <textblock>
      A quasi-experimental design where internal medicine residents in a high complexity hospital
      were assessed after a 24-hour shift for cognitive impairment by a trained neurologist.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators conducted a cross sectional study during the 2014-2016 period in a high
      complexity school hospital in Buenos Aires. Second and third year Internal Medicine residents
      who consented to participate were included.

      A neurologist conducted a cognitive evaluation to the residents who had done 24 hours shifts
      (with sleep deprivation) within 6 hours of its end.

      Auditory memory deficit was evaluated (PASAT - Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test), verbal
      fluency (FAS), direct and indirect Digit-Span, Rey auditory verbal learning test (RAVLT) and
      Continuous Performance Test 2 (CPT2).

      Results were presented as means of standardized scores (z score) with their interquartile
      range (IQR).
