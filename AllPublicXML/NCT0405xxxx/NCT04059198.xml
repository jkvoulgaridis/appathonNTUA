    <criteria>
      <textblock>

          1. HBV-infected male and female subjects aged 18 to 70 years, inclusive

          2. Ultrasound, computed tomography (CT) scan, or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) within
             6 months of enrollment date with no evidence of cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma

          3. Must be willing and able to comply with all study requirements

          4. Chronic HBV as defined by documented HBsAg or HBV DNA positive for 6 months or more

          5. Not on any antiviral medications for at least 6 months. If a subject is hepatitis B e
             antigen (HBeAg)-negative, they will be eligible if they have not received antiviral
             medications for at least 3 months. Antiviral medications include lamivudine,
             telbivudine, adefovir, tenofovir, entecavir, IFN therapies of any type, and all other
             medications with potential antiviral activity.

          6. HBV DNA &gt;2000 IU/mL for HBeAg-negative subjects and &gt;20,000 IU/mL for HBeAg-positive
             subjects at Screening

          7. ALT &lt;5× ULN and ≤200 U/L

          8. Negative urine or serum pregnancy test (for women of childbearing potential)
             documented within the 24-hour period prior to the first dose of IP. If the urine
             pregnancy test is positive, a follow-up serum test is required for confirmation

          9. Women of childbearing potential must agree to use a highly effective method of
             contraception throughout the study and for 3 months after discontinuing study
             treatment. Men with female partners who are of childbearing potential must agree that
             they or their partners will use a highly effective method of contraception throughout
             the study and for 3 months after discontinuing study treatment. Male subjects must not
             donate sperm throughout the study and for 3 months after discontinuing study
             treatment.

               -  Women of childbearing potential are sexually mature women who have not undergone
                  bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy, or hysterectomy; or who have
                  not been postmenopausal (ie, who have not menstruated at all) for at least 1
                  year.

               -  Highly effective methods of contraception are hormonal contraceptives (oral,
                  injectable, patch, intrauterine devices), male partner sterilization, or total
                  abstinence from heterosexual intercourse, when this is the preferred and usual
                  lifestyle of the subject. Note: The double-barrier method (eg, synthetic condoms,
                  diaphragm, or cervical cap with spermicidal foam, cream, or gel), periodic
                  abstinence (such as calendar, symptothermal, post-ovulation), withdrawal (coitus
                  interruptus), lactational amenorrhea method, and spermicide only are not
                  acceptable as highly effective methods of contraception.

         10. Must have the ability to understand and sign a written informed consent form (ICF);
             consent must be obtained prior to initiation of study procedures

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Any prior liver biopsy evidence of metavir F3 or F4 disease

          2. Any history of decompensation of liver disease including history of ascites,
             encephalopathy, or varices

          3. Evidence of advanced fibrosis as defined by Fibroscan at the Screening Visit of ≥8
             kPa. If Fibroscan is not available, subjects with both a Fibrotest ≥0.65 and aspartate
             transaminase (AST):platelet ratio index (APRI) ≥1.0 are excluded (subjects will not be
             excluded if only 1 of the Fibrotest or APRI results is higher than allowed)

          4. Laboratory parameters not within defined thresholds:

               1. White blood cells &lt;4000 cells/μL (&lt;4.0×109/L)

               2. Hemoglobin &lt;11 g/dL (&lt;110 g/L) for females, &lt;13 g/dL (&lt;130 g/L) for males

               3. Platelets &lt;130,000 per μL (&lt;150×109/L)

               4. Albumin &lt;3.5 g/dL (&lt;35 g/L)

               5. International normalized ratio (INR) &gt;1.5

                  Gilbert's disease can be included if direct bilirubin is within normal limits.
                  Subjects with an AFP &gt;50 ng/mL but &lt;500 ng/mL can be included if CT scan or MRI
                  performed within 3 months shows no evidence of HCC

               7. Creatinine &gt;1.2 mg/dL (&gt;106.08 μmol/L) and creatinine clearance &lt;50 mL/min (&lt;0.83

         11. Subjects currently taking medication(s) that are transported through organic anion
             transporting polypeptide 1 (OATP1) including, but not limited to, atazanavir,
             rifampin, cyclosporine, eltrombopag, gemfibrozil, lopinavir/ritonavir, and saquinavir

         12. Use of another investigational agent within 3 months of Screening

         13. Current alcohol or substance abuse judged by the Investigator to potentially interfere
             with compliance

         14. Females who are pregnant or may wish to become pregnant during the study
