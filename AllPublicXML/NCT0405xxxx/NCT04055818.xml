  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A randomized control trial in 20 subjects with sickle cell disease comparing oral
      THU-decitabine to nicotinamide and in combination (THU, decitabine and nicotinamide).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A randomized control trial comparing oral THU-decitabine to nicotinamide (1:1 randomization),
      and then comparing the effects of the combination of nicotinamide with THU-decitabine vs
      either treatment alone. Treatment with each agent alone is for 12 weeks followed by the
      combination for a further 12 weeks. Patients have the option to enter an extension phase of
      combination treatment for an additional 24 weeks (total of 48 weeks)

          -  Confirmed sickle cell disease (SCD) as determined by hemoglobin electrophoresis or
             liquid chromatography.

          -  Subject is in his/her steady state and not having any acute complication due to SCD
             (i.e., hospitalization, acute pain, or acute chest syndrome in the past 14 days).

             narcotics, or 1 or more acute chest syndrome episodes, or Hemoglobin &lt;9 g/dL and
