  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ulcerative colitis(UC) seriously affect the quality of life in patients. Clinically, it is
      effective to apply therapeutic method of clearing heat and promoting diuresis to the common
      syndrome of dampness-heat. Dysbiosis of intestinal microbiota is closely related to the
      immune imbalance and intestinal mucosal barrier injury. C1orf106/CYTH-1/ARF6 signal pathway,
      which derive from intestinal micro environment changes,is the mainly cause of intestinal
      mucosal barrier injury, and this is may be the common pathogenesis of dampness-heat syndrome
      in UC . Based on the clinic, the project is to study the effect and mechanism of Chinese
      compound formula of clearing heat and promoting dieresis in modulating intestinal microbiota
      dysbiosis, repairing intestinal mucosal barrier and reconstructing intestinal
      microenvironment. With the combination of metagenomics and metabonomics, the study compare
      the differences of co-metabolites of intestinal microbiota and host within the healthy
      people, UC patients with dampness-heat syndrome, to explore the relevance between intestinal
      flora and host co-metabolites. Furthermore, the experimental study is to clarify the drug
      targets via C1orf106/ CYTH-1/ARF6 signal pathway.Through the study of association between
      dampness-heat syndrome in UC and intestinal microbiota, it is of important academic
      significance to reveal the Chinese theory intension of &quot;homotherapy for heteropathy &quot;.
