    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to characterize the single-dose plasma and urine PK of TAK-788
      and its active metabolites (AP32960 and AP32914) in participants with severe RI compared to
      matched-healthy participants with normal renal function.

      29-Apr-2020 Enrollment of new patients into this study has been paused due to the COVID-19
      situation. The duration of this pause is dependent on the leveling and control of the
      COVID-19 pandemic.

      The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-788. This study is to assess the PK of
      TAK-788 and its active metabolites (including but not limited to AP32960 and AP32914) in
      participants with severe RI compared to matched-healthy participants with normal renal
      function.

      The study will enroll approximately 16 participants. Participants will be assigned to 1 of
      the following 2 treatment groups:

        -  Severe RI: TAK-788 80 mg

        -  Normal Renal Function: TAK-788 80 mg

      Healthy participants with normal renal function will be recruited to match severe RI by age
      (mean plus or minus [+-] 10 years), gender (+-2 participants per gender), and body mass index
      (BMI), (mean +- 10 percent [%]). All participants will be asked to take single dose of
      TAK-788 on Day 1.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in the United States. The overall time to
      participate in this study is 51 days. Participants will be contacted by telephone 30 days
      after the last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.
