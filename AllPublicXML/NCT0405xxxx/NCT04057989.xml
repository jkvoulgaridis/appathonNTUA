  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Using a retrospective review of records, we will conduct a multivariate analysis to examine
      the relationship between exposure to ketamine, as an analgesic agent in combat related trauma
      care, the use of additional opioid pain medications, and patient reported pain levels.

      This is a retrospective study to determine if there is a relationship between intravenous
      infusion of ketamine given for analgesia and the use of additional opioid pain medications
      and patient reported pain levels before and during ketamine usage. The investigator
      anticipates that records of up to 700 subjects will be reviewed for eligibility. The time
      period 24 hours before the initial ketamine therapy is initiated along with 24 &amp; 48 hours
      after the start of ketamine therapy will be the time periods examined. The
      average/minimum/maximum pain scores during these time periods will be used. Medication usage
      will be calculated over the 24 hour time periods.

      This protocol is presented as an initial step in exploring the possible relationship between
      the administration of ketamine as an analgesic agent, the potential reduction in pain
      medications, and the potential reduction of pain levels. With this the goals/objectives are
      as follows:

      Objectives

        1. To compare morphine consumption in battlefield injured patients with acute pain 24 hours
           before the initiation of a ketamine infusion to the subsequent 48 hours following the
           start of infusion.

        2. To compare average/minimum/maximum pain scores in battlefield injured patients with
           acute pain 24 hours before the initiation of a ketamine infusion to the subsequent 48
           hours following the start of infusion.

        3. To describe the pain trajectory in battlefield injured patients with acute pain after
           the initiation of ketamine infusions.

        4. To measure the absolute and proportional incidence of ketamine associated side effects
           in battlefield injured patients with acute pain following the initiation of ketamine
           infusions.
