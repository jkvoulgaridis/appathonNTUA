      This is a Phase 2, multicenter, open-label extension (OLE) of study CXA-10-301, to evaluate
      the long term safety and efficacy of daily dosing of CXA-10.

      The study will be performed in approximately 50 study centers across the United States and
      the United Kingdom, which participated in CXA-10-301. Approximately 96 subjects who completed
      treatment in CXA-10-301 will be eligible to participate in this OLE study, after completing
      all Visit 9 (Day 1 and Day 2) assessments in CXA-10-301.

      Study participation for each subject will last up to approximately 6.5 months. The study will
      consist of a 6 month open-label treatment period and require 5 clinic visits and 1 telephone
      visit, including the Baseline Visit completed simultaneously with Visit 9 CXA-10-301, plus a
      follow-up visit approximately 2 weeks following the last dose of CXA-10.

             endocrine, metabolic, central nervous system or psychiatric disease that, in the
             opinion of the investigator, may adversely affect the safety of the subject and/or
             efficacy of the investigational product or severely limit the lifespan of the subject
             other than the condition being studied.

             28. Clinically significant hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism not adequately treated.

             29. Any other condition and/or situation that causes the Investigator to deem a
             subject unsuitable for the study (e.g., due to expected study medication non-
             compliance, inability to medically tolerate the study procedures, or a subject's
             unwillingness to comply with study-related procedures).

             30. Known hypersensitivity to CXA-10, the metabolites, or formulation excipients.

             days or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to Baseline (this includes
             investigational formulations of marketed products, inhaled and topical drugs), or
             plans to participate in an investigational drug or device study at any time during
