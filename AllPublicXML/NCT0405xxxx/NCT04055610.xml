  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the feasibility and effects of H-MEX powered exoskeleton in individuals
      with paraplegia as a result of spinal cord injury.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants with paraplegia will attend gait training using H-MEX powered exoskeleton 3
      times a week for 10 weeks.

      The aim of this study is to assess the impact of gait training using H-MEX powered
      exoskeleton on walking ability, gait analysis, medical examination, body composition,
      functional evaluation, laboratory findings, quality of life, and subjective experience in
      individuals with paraplegia.

      Participants will be evaluated before, during, and after training.
