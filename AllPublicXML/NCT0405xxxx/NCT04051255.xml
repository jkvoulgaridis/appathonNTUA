  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Treatment of smoker patients with AgP is considered a challenge to periodontists. To date,
      only one controlled clinical study (De Genaro Modanese et al., 2016) evaluated the effect of
      full mouth ultrasonic debridment (FMUD) on smokers with aggressive periodontitis. Its results
      showed significant improvements in clinical parameters (plaque index PI, bleeding on probing-
      BoP and probing depth-PD), and immunologic (reductions in interleukin 6- IL-6, tumor necrosis
      factor- α TNF-α levels), although the results were more favorable for non-smoking patients.
      Antimicrobials associated to mechanical therapy has been extensively studied (Hafajee et al.,
      2003, Heitz-Mayfield, 2006). The association of Amoxicillin and Metronidazole have had good
      clinical and microbiological results in randomized clinical trials in the treatment of AgP
      (Casarin et al., 2012, Sgolastra et al., 2012, Keestra et al., 2015).

      Thus, this study investigates clinical, microbiological and immunological influence of
      smoking in the periodontal debridement associated to Amoxiciclin and Metronidazole of young
      individuals with pronounced periodontal destruction, compared with non-smokers individuals.

    <description>The patients were treated by a single-session of periodontal debridement under local anaesthesia during 45 minutes, using an ultrasonic instrument#, using subgingival tips* and irrigation with sterile saline solution, by the same operator (MGC, Paulista University, São Paulo, Brazil). After the debridement, all patients has prescribed with Amoxicillin 500 mg and Metronidazole 400 mg, every 8 hours, for 10 days (Casarin et al., 2012). Subjects were extensively informed about the intake of the prescribed medication. Subjects were clinically and microbiologically monitored at baseline (before therapy) and at 3 and 6 months post-therapy. During the monitored sessions, oral hygiene was evaluated and home care instructions were re-emphasized. Additionally, all subjects were recalled monthly for oral hygiene instructions.</description>
