  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study was to determine the effect of proprioceptive and neuromuscular
      training on landing errors and balance of the football players. This was randomized
      controlled trial in which 40 football players were randomly allocated into experimental and
      control group. The control group followed conventional exercise plan while experimental group
      players were being trained under Myklebust's training program. Data were collected at
      baseline and after follow-up of five weeks Landing Error Score System (LESS) and Biodex
      Single Leg Stability (SLS) score. Data were analyzed using statistical package for social
      sciences (SPSS)-21.

      Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries are a severe public health issue from both an
      economic and general wellness view. This burden will be reduced by promoting compliance and
      the use of injury prevention programs. To reduce injury rates, trainers, athletes, parents,
      and the team of sports medicine need to know the advantages of injury prevention programs.
      Parents and employees in sports medicine want a program that can decrease the risk of injury.
      Coaches and athletes are looking for a program that will also increase athletic efficiency
      without taking time off exercise, time that would otherwise be spent honing sport-specific
      abilities. Injury prevention programs in youth athletics will promote neuromuscular
      enhancements and create appropriate long-term techniques while instantly preparing the
      athlete for competition.

      Various studies have been done to assess the role of proprioceptive and neuromuscular
      exercises on reducing incidence of ACL injury. No conclusive result has been established as
      yet that these type of exercises really reduce the incidence of ACL injury or not. However,
      it is found that by performing certain exercises there is improvement in biomechanics of jump
      landing as predicted by LESS score which is a reliable tool to establish risk of ACL and
      other lower limb injury in an athlete. Therefore the investigators have used a lower limb
      injury prevention program to assess its effectiveness in reducing LESS score.
