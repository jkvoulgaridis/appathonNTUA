    <textblock>
      Trauma is one of the leading causes of death among people under 40 years of age, the causes
      are numerous but the majorities are involved in road traffic accidents (RTA). The oral and
      maxillofacial injuries are the common presentation of hospitals either as an isolated injury
      ( 50%) and rest 20-30% are associated with multiple injuries to the head, neck, chest,
      abdomen and extremities. These injuries may cause serious functional, psychological,
      physical, and cosmetic disabilities.

      Maxillofacial fractures are a large public health problem with a significant negative impact
      on an individual's overall health and even survival. The cause, severity, and temporal
      distribution of maxillofacial trauma can assist in establishing clinical and research
      priorities for effective treatment and prevention of these injuries. Also understanding
      maxillofacial trauma helps to evaluate the behaviour patterns of people in different
      countries and to establish effective prevention and treatment strategies.

      To this end, numerous studies have been carried out to explore the epidemiological features
      of maxillofacial fractures in different population groups. However, to best our knowledge,
      there is a lack of research about maxillofacial injuries for this region. Hence the main
      purpose of this study is to investigate the epidemiological characteristics of prevalence,
      aetiology, sex and age distributions, fracture site, treatment pattern, associated injuries,
      and complications of maxillofacial fractures treated at the National Medical College and
      others Hospitals of Birgunj Metropolitan city over a 10-year period from June 2011 to June
      2021. A specific form (oral and maxillofacial injury proforma) will be used to collect the
      data from medical records of patients who had sustained oral and maxillofacial injuries and
      admitted as well managed at the hospitals (National Medical College and Teaching Hospital,
      Birganj health care, Gandak hospital, LS Neuro hospital. Birgunj). Subjects would be the
      patients' data's/ medical records present in hospitals, Birganj. From the patient files or
      medical records, following information will be gathered include demographics (e.g. age, sex),
      the aetiology of injury, anatomic site of the fracture, time of hospital admission and
      operation, presence and location of associated injuries, treatment pattern, length of
      in-hospital stay, and complications.

      Introduction:

      Trauma-related injuries claimed approximately 5 million lives in the world in 2016; is one of
      the leading causes of death among people in different age groups depending upon the causes of
      injuries (WHO, 2018a). More than quarters (29%) of these deaths were due to a road traffic
      accident. Low-income countries had the highest mortality rate due to a road traffic accident
      with 29.4 deaths per 100 000 population (WHO, 2018b). Many factors affect mortality rate and
      outcome after trauma (Kieser J et al 2002; Johnson J etal. 2012). Nature and severity of the
      injuries on the body part are the main factors for mortality of injured person. Among the
      mortality; fatality rate is 50 % within a few minutes of trauma due to damage to the brain or
      spinal cord or heart or major vessel or organ. Another factor affecting mortality is the
      standard of surgical care in the hospital; 30% die in the hospital a few hour injuries due to
      hypoxia and haemorrhage (hypovolemic shock). Late mortality is seen within a day to a week in
      hospital (20%) due to sepsis and multiorgan failure (Kovacs G, Sowers N., 2018; Prathigudupu
      RS et al.,2018; ).

      Oral and Maxillofacial trauma is a common presentation in Emergency departments (ED) of the
      hospitals (Kieser J et al 2002; Wong NH etal 2012; Calderoni DR etal 2011; Katarzyna B etal
      2010). Age of the patient, concomitant head injuries, airway obstruction, a pattern of facial
      bone fracture and increased bleeding are some of the variables of increasing death rates
      after maxillofacial trauma (Katarzyna B etal 2010; Kovacs G, Sowers N., 2018). Multiple body
      part injuries are often associated with oral and maxillofacial injuries in severely injured
      trauma patients(Kieser J et al, 2002; Wong NH etal, 2012; Calderoni DR etal, 2011; Katarzyna
      B etal. 2010; Prathigudupu RS et al, 2018; Davies MJ et al 2012). The diagnosis, as well as
      management of complicated facial fractures, is challenging even to the most experienced oral
      and maxillofacial surgeons, while the presence of coexistent injuries and the complexity of
      these injuries make it more difficult to consolidate experience and develop realistic
      treatment protocols. Furthermore, the lack of sufficient specialist facial trauma units
      results in unacceptable delays from referral to operation, complicating the management and
      compromising the outcome. Coordination of trauma teams, emergency room physicians, and
      surgical teams such as neurosurgeons, orthopaedic is vital for the early stabilization and
      treatment of patients with facial bone fracture (Wong NH et al, 2012; Davies MJ et al, 2012;
      Follmar KE et al,2007; Van Hout WM et al ,2013, Kostakis G et al, 2012). These injuries may
      cause serious functional, psychological, physical, and cosmetic disabilities (Kim JW et al
      2015; Zachariades N et al 1993) .

      The epidemiology of oral and maxillofacial trauma varies from one geographical region to
      another and even within the same region depending on the many risk factors such as
      demographic, socioeconomic, cultural, personal behaviour, mental status and environmental
      factors ( Mathog RH et al, 2000; Fasola AO et al, 2003;Branas CC et al, 2004; Li Z and Li ZB,
      2008 ). The common causes worldwide are road traffic accidents (20-83%) (Lee JH et al, 2010;
      Karagozoglu KH et al, 2012; Walker TW et al 2013; Forouzanfar T et al. 2013; Mijiti A et al,
      2014;Jung CP et al, 2016 ); assault( 18- 79%) (Ugboko VI et al 1998; Laskin DM and Best AM,
      2000; Olasoji HO et al, 2002; Adebayo ET et al ,2003; Al Ahmed HE et al, 2004; Brasileiro BF
      et al, 2006; Lee K, 2009a; Lee KH, 2009b; Mijiti A et al, 2014), falls( 10-17% ) (Shankar AN
      et al, 2012; Van den Bergh B et al 2012; Salentijn EG et al, 2013; Mijiti A et al, 2014),
      sport injuries (3-7% ) (Bamjee Y et al, 1996; Qudah MA et al, 2002; Al-Khateeb T et al 2007;
      Bakardjiev A et al, 2007; de Matos FP et al 2010) , hit by moving object ( 5- 15%) (Sakr K,
      Farag IA et al 2006; Subhashraj K et al, 2007; Thor√©n H et al, 2010; Chrcanovic BR et al,
      2012), bicycle accident ( 2-28% ) (Gomes PP et al, 2006; Kotecha S et al, 2008; Lee JH et al,
      2010; Forouzanfar T et al, 2013) , work-related accident (1.7-7% ) (Gassner R et al 2003;
      Qing-Bin Z et al, 2013) and miscellaneous ( 1.3 %) include pathological fractures, blast
      injuries, animal attack accident, tooth extraction, and unknown etiology.

      Facial bone fractures are a large public health problem with a significant negative impact on
      an individual's overall health and even survival (Kim JW et al , 2015; Kovacs G, Sowers N,
      2018; Prathigudupu RS et al, 2018) . Addressing socio-cultural issues, reviewing and
      improving road safety legislation, enforcing infrastructure and vehicle standards, and
      improving post-crash care remain critical to preventing avoidable deaths and disabilities
      caused by road crashes - which continue to be a major public health challenge ( Mathog RH et
      al, 2010; Kim JW et al, 2015). Despite the legislative changes and preventative measures
      involving seatbelt and airbag use, as well as the reduction of drinking and driving, road
      traffic accidents are still the major cause of facial fractures in many developing countries.

      This part of the country ( Provinces 2), is the second most populous province of the country
      Nepal, located in the central south of the country spans over 9,661 km2 (3,730 sq mi), with a
      5,404,145 population of (according to the CBS 2015 year census). Majority of people are poor
      (48%), illiterates 32% overall and major source of income is agriculture and foreign worker
      (Wikipedia, 2019). It borders with Bihar states of India. Among the many factors social and
      cultural similarity, the people of Bihar is presented in this regional hospital for
      treatment. The road, a major means of transportation here but the condition of the road is
      very bad.

      The main purpose of this study is to investigate the epidemiological characteristics of
      prevalence, aetiology, sex and age distributions, fracture site, treatment pattern,
      associated injuries, and complications of maxillofacial fractures treated at the National
      Medical College and others Hospitals of Birgunj Metropolitan city over a 10-year period from
      June 2011 to June

      Statement of the Problem and Rationale / Justification:

      A clearer understanding of the demographic patterns of maxillofacial injuries will assist
      health care providers as they plan and manage the treatment of traumatic maxillofacial
      injuries (Al Ahmed et al., 2004; Lee K, 2009; Mijiti A et al., 2014). Such epidemiological
      information can also be used to guide the future funding of public health programs geared
      towards prevention.

      Understanding maxillofacial trauma helps to evaluate the behaviour patterns of people in
      different countries and to establish effective prevention and treatment strategies (Maliska
      et al., 2009; Katarzyna B, Piotr A 2010).

      Understanding the cause, severity, and temporal distribution of maxillofacial trauma can
      assist in establishing clinical and research priorities for effective treatment and
      prevention of these injuries (Gassner et al., 2003; Qing-Bin Z et al., 2013).

      To this end, numerous studies have been carried out to explore the epidemiological features
      of maxillofacial fractures in different population groups (Ugboko VI et al., 1998; Kieser J
      et al., 2002; Olasoji HO et al., 2002; Qudah MA et al., 2002; Fasola AO et al., 2003; Al
      Ahmed HE et al., 2004; Ansari MH., 2004; Gomes PP et al., 2006; Sakr K et al., 2006;
      Al-Khateeb T et al., 2017; Bakardjiev A et al., 2007; Lee JH et al., 2010; Walker TW et al.,
      2012; Forouzanfar T et al., 2013; Qing-Bin Z et al., 2013; Van Hout WM et al., 2013; Mijiti A
      et al., 2014; Jung CP et al., 2016; Nogami S et al., 2019). However, to best our knowledge,
      there is a lack of reports detailing the causes, incidence, and treatment pattern of
      maxillofacial injuries, and no study has been published about oral and maxillofacial injuries
      analysis for this region.

    <description>Multidisciplinary approaches are required to manage oral and maxillofacial injuries because mainly associated with other injuries. The primary survey is very important to preserve the life of the patients ie ABCDE. Definite management is performed only after proper diagnosis on the basis of clinical or radiological examination, or both. A facial fracture is documented as a standard classification of the zygoma, the accompanying ipsilateral orbital fracture. In the case of a Le Fort II or III fracture, the accompanying nasal and orbital fractures are documented separately.
Information about the method of treatment will be gathered from the operating notes and will be categorised as open reduction and internal fixation, intermaxillary fixation, reposition without fixation, or orbital floor repair. Other injuries are categorised as neurotrauma, spinal trauma, orthopaedic trauma, general surgical trauma, and other trauma.</description>
