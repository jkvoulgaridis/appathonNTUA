  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Childhood cancer survivors are vulnerable to treatment-related late effects, including
      physical and psychosocial morbidities, subsequent malignancies, and premature death. Symptom
      assessment provides a unique insight into survivorship care since symptoms not only indicate
      the manifestation for the occurrence of chronic health conditions, but also impact quality of
      life and survival. The National Cancer Institute (NCI) has developed a Patient-Reported
      Outcomes version of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (PRO-CTCAE) to assess
      symptomatic adverse events (AEs) for adult-onset cancer patients who are receiving cancer
      therapies. However, content-appropriate and clinically validated symptom assessment tools for
      adult survivors of childhood cancer are not available.

      Primary Object 1: Establish content validity for the PRO-CTCAE-SCC

      Primary Objective 1A: Conduct a symptom selection process through qualitative research to
      identify symptomatic AEs for adult survivors of childhood cancer

      Primary Objective 1B: Create symptomatic AE items for adult survivors of childhood cancer
      based on the prevalence and clinical importance ratings on the items

      Primary Objective 2: Validate the PRO-CTCAE-SCC using psychometric methods and objective
      clinical parameters

      Primary Objective 2A: Test dimensionality for the PRO-CTCAE-SCC

      Primary Objective 2B: Test clinical validity for the PRO-CTCAE-SCC

      Primary Objective 2C: Test responsiveness to change for the PRO-CTCAE-SCC

      Secondary Objective 1: Increase clinical usefulness of the PRO-CTCAE-SCC

      Secondary Objective 2: Establish meaningful cut-points and minimally important differences
      (MIDs) on symptom burden scores for clinical decision-making

      We propose to adapt an existing symptomatic adverse event tool, the Patient-Reported Outcomes
      Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (PRO-CTCAE), to be content appropriate and
      clinically meaningful for adult survivors of childhood cancer using two well-established
      childhood cancer survivor cohorts. Psychometric methodologies will be used to validate this
      tool by incorporating objective clinical anchors collected from medical evaluations. Our
      symptomatic AE tool has the potential to augment the Children Oncology Group Survivorship
      Care Guidelines by implementing risk-based symptom screening to track and anticipate adverse
      health events.
