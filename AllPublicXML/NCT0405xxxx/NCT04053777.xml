    <textblock>
      Non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) is undoubtedly one of the most important
      advances in mechanical ventilation technology in the past 30 years. Currently, NPPV has
      become an essential respiratory support technology in hospitals, and it is used in different
      fields, including respiratory and critical care, emergency care, anesthesia, and
      rehabilitation. Applications of NPPV are also gradually expanding from intensive care units
      (ICUs) and respiratory wards to use in other medical departments and at home.

      This is an observational study of recording the respiratory parameters of patients when
      receiving non-invasive ventilation and analyze the relationship between those parameters and
      clinical outcomes.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes of visual analogue scale score before and after using non-invasive ventilation</measure>
    <time_frame>1 hour</time_frame>
    <description>Visual analogue scale score is used to represent the subjective dyspnea of patient. Scores range between 0 and 10 and higher scores are attributed to less dyspnea.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes of respiratory rate before and after using non-invasive ventilation</measure>
    <time_frame>1 hour</time_frame>
    <description>The respiratory rate is the rate at which breathing occurs. This is usually measured in breaths per minute.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes of SpO2 before and after using non-invasive ventilation</measure>
    <time_frame>1 hour</time_frame>
    <description>Oxygen saturation is the fraction of [oxygen]-saturated hemoglobin relative to total hemoglobin in the blood.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes of tidal volume before and after using non-invasive ventilation</measure>
    <time_frame>1 hour</time_frame>
    <description>Tidal volume is the lung volume representing the normal volume of air displaced between normal inhalation and exhalation when extra effort is not applied.This is usually measured in mini Liter.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes of heart rate before and after using non-invasive ventilation</measure>
    <time_frame>1 hour</time_frame>
    <description>Heart rate is the speed of the heartbeat measured by the number of contractions (beats) of the heart per minute (bpm).</description>
