  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to use a stepped-care approach in treating symptoms of
      posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The information learned by doing this study may help us
      to develop some target treatments for PTSD symptoms in survivors of stem cell transplant.

      Participants in this study will be randomized to a mobile app or usual care. An assessment
      will be made after 4 weeks and a determination made of adding more intensive treatment.
      Participants will be asked to complete a questionnaire 4 times over a period of 6 months, at
      the time your participation is complete.
