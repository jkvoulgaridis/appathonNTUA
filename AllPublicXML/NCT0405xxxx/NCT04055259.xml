  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study was to assess the effectiveness of a 6-month text-based mobile
      health and wellness (mHWC) intervention, as compared to usual care (UC), for weight loss in
      adults. Participants were randomly assigned to one of the two groups (mHWC or UC). At the
      beginning of the study, both groups were given a Fitbit wearable device, and a weight scale.
      All participants also received a counseling session from a dietician focused on diet,
      physical activity, and sleep, and were set up on the Nudge app, a commercially-available mHWC
      platform. Participants in the mHWC group received text-based coaching messages via Nudge and
      did not return to the clinic for the duration of the 6-month intervention. Those in the UC
      group met once a month with a pharmacist or dietician for 6 months. In both groups, the focus
      was on facilitating health behavior change related to diet, physical activity, and sleep to
      promote weight loss.

      We hypothesized that weight loss at 6 months would be greater in the mHWC group vs. the UC
      group.

    <description>Assessed via Exercise Vital Sign (EVS) at baseline and follow-up. The EVS is used to assess via self-report the amount of physical activity or exercise an individual engages in during an average week. It asks: 1. On average, how many days a week do you perform physical activity or exercise, such as walking or jogging? and 2. On average, how many minutes of physical activity or exercise do you perform on those days?</description>

    <measure>Change in Self-Reported Sleep Quantity</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months (mean 193 ± 21 days)</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed via Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) at baseline and follow-up. The PSQI is used to assess via self-report an individual's nightly average sleep quality and quantity over the previous 30 day period. As for quality, the higher the score, the lower the quality of sleep.</description>

    <description>Assessed via the Automated Self-Assessment 24-hour (ASA24) Dietary Assessment at baseline and follow-up. The ASA24 is a detailed 24-hour food recall that can be used to estimate via self-report diet quality and quantity.</description>

    <description>Participants in the mobile health and wellness coaching (mHWC) group received text-based mHWC messages and did not return to the clinic until the end of the 6 month intervention. Messages were sent at least weekly and focused on facilitating the adoption and maintenance of health behaviors related to diet, physical activity and sleep to promote weight loss. Participants could respond via text at any time. The Nudge platform was used for all messaging.</description>

    <description>Participants in the usual care (UC) group met in-person once a month with either a pharmacist or dietician for the duration of the 6-month intervention. The focus of these sessions was on facilitating the adoption and maintenance of health behaviors related to diet, physical activity and sleep to promote weight loss. These participants were set up on the Nudge app, but they did not use the mHWC (texting) feature.</description>
