  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients referred to neurosurgery routinely and safely undergo deep brain stimulation (DBS)
      for treatment of neurological conditions, most commonly Parkinson's disease.

      The investigators have observed that respiratory problems (breathlessness) sometimes occur
      subsequent to DBS of the subthalamic nucleus (STN). This study aims to determine whether this
      is indeed a consequence of STN stimulation. Secondary objectives include identification of
      the respiratory physiological mediators of any interoceptive neuromodulation observed,
      changes in daily physical activity and MRI structural connectivity analysis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A continuous cohort of Parkinson disease patients planned to undergo STN-DBS will be
      approached to participate in this study (i.e. every patient will be offered participation in
      the study). Over the same time period other DBS patients (GPi and VIM) will be approached
      before their implantation procedure to participate as controls/comparators. Participants will
      all be offered the full study, but will also be free to participate in a smaller number of
      activities if so chosen.

      Patients will be assessed both pre-operatively and post-operatively where they will complete
      a compound respiratory questionnaire and tests of respiratory interoception and function.
      Post-operatively, these tests will be carried out with stimulation ON and OFF, the order of
      which will be randomised between patients.

      Data on daily activity will be collected during pre- and post-operative windows, using a
      wearable pedometer/heart-rate monitor.

      Positive findings of respiratory neuromodulation will be correlated between patients with
      structural connectivity (e.g. STN-insula.) from pre-operative MRI scans.
