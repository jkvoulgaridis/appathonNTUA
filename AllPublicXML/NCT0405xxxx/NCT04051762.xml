  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that there is a growing trend of the feasibility of HFNC as an
      alternative to other forms of non-invasive ventilation mechanism to provide continuous
      distending pressure to preterm infants. However, there remains uncertainty about the efficacy
      and safety of HFNC in this population.

    <textblock>
      Our primary outcome is to determine whether postextubation respiratory support via heated
      humidified high-flow nasal cannula results in a greater proportion of infants younger than 34
      weeks gestation being successfully extubated after a period of endotracheal positive pressure
      ventilation compared with conventional (NCPAP).

      The following study will be conducted in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) of
      Gynecology and Obstetric department of Kasr El Aini hospital and neonatal intensive care unit
      of Military Hospital throughout a time interval of at least 6 months for a minimum of 100
      preterm infants.

      Infants will be eligible for the study if they born at less than 34 weeks' gestation,
      required endotracheal intubation and positive pressure ventilation, and considered ready for
      extubation by the clinical team.

      The investigators will assign extubation of preterm ventilated infants (50 preterm infant) in
      NICU of Military Hospital into HHFNC and extubation of preterm ventilated infants (50 preterm
      infant) in (NICU) of Gynecology and Obstetric department of Kasr El Aini hospital into NCPAP
      (50 preterm infant).
