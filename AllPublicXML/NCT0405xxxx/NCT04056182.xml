      This is an open-label pilot trial to evaluate the safety and tolerability of lofexidine in
      the management of opioid withdrawal symptoms while initiating outpatient treatment with
      naltrexone. The initiation procedure will be a flexible detoxification lasting 2 to 10 days
      concluding with the injection of XR-Naltrexone (Vivitrol). Vivitrol is a long-acting
      injection that contains enough medicine to last for one month blocking the effects of
      opioids.

      This is an open-label pilot trial to evaluate the safety and tolerability of lofexidine in
      the management of opioid withdrawal symptoms while initiating outpatient treatment with
      naltrexone. Lofexidine is a nonopioid prescription medicine used in adults to help with the
      symptoms of opioid withdrawal that may happen when a person stops taking an opioid suddenly.
      The initiation procedure will be a flexible detoxification lasting 2 to 10 days concluding
      with the injection of XR-Naltrexone (Vivitrol). Vivitrol is a long-acting injection that
      contains enough medicine to last for one month blocking the effects of opioids. Lofexidine
      will be fixed-flexible dosing started on day 1 with maximum dose being three 0.18mg tablets
      taken orally 4 times daily at 4-to 6-hour intervals. Lofexidine treatment will continue
      throughout the detoxification, up to 10 days, and will be discontinued with a gradual dose
      reduction over 2 to 4 days. Precipitated withdrawal symptoms are treated with lofexidine,
      clonazepam, and other comfort medications. After the induction patients will be seen at the
      clinic for 8 weeks. Twice weekly for the first month and weekly for weeks 5-8. A second
      Vivitrol injection will be provided at week 4.
