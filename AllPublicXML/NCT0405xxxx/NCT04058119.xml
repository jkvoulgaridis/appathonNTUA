  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mental disorders are among the most common causes of disability globally. Given the high
      prevalence of mental disorders (57.0%) in Azores islands (Portugal), local primary health
      care (PHC) services should encourage the implementation of complementary interventions for
      prevention of this type of disorders. New approaches, such as mind-body therapies, have been
      studied and recommended for prevention and treatment of numerous chronic diseases,
      particularly mental disorders.

      This study aims to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of a 6-months mind-body
      therapies (yoga, qigong and pilates), in users of Ponta Delgada Health Center (PDHC) with
      perceived distress, compared to a waiting list control.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      VIVE mind will be a pragmatic, single-center, randomized controlled trial.

      Users of PDHC with perceived distress (PSS-10), aged 18 years or over, will be recruited and
      randomly assigned into experimental and waiting list control group, in a 1:1 ratio. The
      recruitment of participants will be held in PDHC by health professional (e.g., family
      medicine doctors, nurses, nutritionists, psychologists, etc). After signed informed consent
      and baseline measures, experimental group will participate in body-mind sessions (yoga,
      qigong or pilates), oriented by certified instructors, during 6-months. Each participant
      should attend only one of the therapies, in order to guarantee a differentiated evaluation.
      In every session, it will be evaluated the participants' adherence and theirs perceived
      enjoyment and exertion. The other outcomes (primary and secondary) will be analyzed through a
      face-to-face contact, in three different moments: baseline (T0), post-intervention (at month
      6, T1) and 6-month follow-up (at month 12, T2). The control group will not participate in any
      specific intervention, but will receive the body-mind intervention after the experimental
      period. An intention-to-treat and per protocol analysis will be performed to analyze
      intervention effectiveness and efficacy.

    <description>Depression, anxiety stress scale-21 (DASS-21) consists of three 7-item subscales: depression, anxiety, and stress. Participants indicate how much each of 21 items applies to them over the past week on a scale from 0 (did not apply to me at all) to 3 (applied to me very much, or most of the time). This scale has good psychometric properties in both clinical and non-clinical samples. Also, this scale reliably distinguishes between symptoms of anxiety (panic/worry), stress (tension/agitation) and depression (low mood/anhedonia), which are highly comorbid.</description>
