  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a first-time-in-man (FTIM) multicenter, dose escalation study designed to investigate
      the safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of AZD5153 in patients with malignant
      solid tumors, including lymphomas.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The trial will be conducted in two parts, dose escalation and dose expansion. AZD5153 will be
      investigated as a monotherapy and in combination with olaparib.

      AZD5153 monotherapy (dose escalation):

      This part of the study will enroll patients with advanced solid malignancies, including
      lymphoma, and test safety and tolerability of AZD5153 administered as a monotherapy. The dose
      escalation will proceed by two-fold increments or through lower doses suggested by the CRM
      until an MTD as defined by dose-limiting toxicity is reached.

      Single daily (QD) and twice daily (BID) dosing schedules will be explored in the monotherapy
      cohort. Additional dose levels or dosing schedules may be evaluated and recommended by study
      Safety Review Committee (SRC) based on the emerging PK and safety data.

      When the AZD5153 monotherapy MTD is established, an expansion cohort consisting of up to 12
      additional evaluable patients may be enrolled to confirm the safety and tolerability of the
      MTD. The dose expansion will be initiated and will enroll patients with histologically or
      cytologically confirmed platinum resistant or platinum-refractory high grade serous ovarian
      (HGSO) cancer.

      Mandatory tumor biopsies at screening for ovarian cancer patients will be required for
      patient enrollment in the MTD dose expansion cohort. Optional on-treatment biopsies will be
      requested from consenting patients in the ovarian expansion cohort.

      AZD5153 + olaparib combination:

      Dose escalation of AZD5153 in combination with olaparib will also be investigated while the
      AZD5153 monotherapy dose escalation is ongoing and prior to determination of a monotherapy
      MTD.

      The starting dose of AZD5153 in combination with olaparib will be a dose that has been shown
      to be safe and tolerated in monotherapy and has been chosen because clinical exposure
      achieved at this dose is equivalent to preclinical exposure causing tumour growth inhibition
      in animal models. If the starting dose in combination with olaparib is safe and tolerated,
      the dose of AZD5153 will be escalated, using the same method as for the monotherapy part of
      the study, keeping the olaparib dose fixed at 300 mg BID. Intermittent schedules as well as
      continuous BID or QD dosing of AZD5153 in combination with 300 mg BID olaparib might be
      tested until a safe and tolerated combination dose and schedule is determined. However, the
      total dose per cycle of AZD5153 used in combination with olaparib won't exceed the total dose
      per cycle that has been shown to be safe and tolerated as a monotherapy, and won't be higher
      than the dose declared to be the monotherapy MTD. If intermittent dosing is explored then the
      CRM will consider cumulative dosing rather than daily dosing.

      AZD5153 and olaparib will be administered in continuous cycles of 21 days. The combination
      dose escalation part will run in parallel with the AZD5153 monotherapy part (dose escalation
      and expansion) and will continue until a safe and tolerated combination dose of the two
      agents is declared. Mandatory paired tumor biopsies at screening and on-treatment will be
      required for patients enrolled into the combination dose escalation.

      Once a dose and schedule of AZD5153 in combination with olaparib is established, up to 12
      additional evaluable patients might be enrolled to confirm the safety and tolerability of the
      dose and schedule of AZD5153 and olaparib in one or more of the indications where clinical
      activity is observed. Patients with platinum-resistant or platinum-refractory HGSO cancer,
      triple negative breast cancer, metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer, or pancreatic
      ductal adenocarcinoma will be eligible for the expansion cohort.

          5. Patient is unable to swallow oral medications or has a gastrointestinal disorder
             (e.g., malabsorption) that would jeopardize intestinal absorption of AZD5153 and
             olaparib.

          6. Treatment with any of the following:

               -  Patient has had prescription or non-prescription drugs or other products known to
                  be strong or moderate inhibitors/inducers of CYP3A4/5, or CYP3A4/5 sensitive
                  substrates or substrates with a narrow therapeutic range, which cannot be
                  discontinued 2 weeks prior to the first day of dosing and withheld throughout the
                  study until 2 weeks after the last dose of AZD5153 and/or olaparib.

               -  Drugs that are sensitive substrates of the transporters P-gp, UGT1A1, BCRP,
                  OATP1B1, OAT3, OCT1, OCT2, MATE1 and MATE2K.

               -  Herbal preparations/medications are not allowed throughout the study. These
                  herbal medications include, but are not limited to: St. John's wort, kava,
                  ephedra (ma huang), ginkgo biloba, dehydroepiandrosterone, yohimbe, saw palmetto,
                  and ginseng. Patients should stop using these herbal medications 14 days prior to
                  the first dose of AZD5153 and/or olaparib.

               -  Drugs known to prolong QT interval or induce Torsades de Pointes.

          7. Refractory nausea and vomiting, previous significant bowel resection that would
             preclude adequate absorption of study drug and chronic gastrointestinal disease
             including active or prior documented inflammatory bowel disease.

          8. Patient has a history of tuberculosis.

          9. Patients receiving a live attenuated vaccine ≤28 days before the first dose of study
             drug.

         10. Spinal cord compression or brain metastases unless asymptomatic, treated and stable
             and not requiring steroids for at least 4 weeks prior to start of study treatment.

         11. A diagnosis of MDS or secondary AML (for olaparib combination dose escalation only)

         12. As judged by the Investigator, any evidence of severe or uncontrolled systemic
             diseases, including uncontrolled hypertension, active bleeding diatheses, or active
             infection including hepatitis B, hepatitis C, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or
             other comorbidity that renders the patient unsuitable for participation in the study.
             Screening for chronic conditions is not required.

         13. Any of the following cardiac criteria:

               -  Mean resting corrected QT interval (QTcF) &gt;450 msec obtained from 3
                  electrocardiograms (ECGs).

               -  Any clinically important abnormalities in rhythm, conduction or morphology of
                  resting ECG e.g., complete left bundle branch block, third degree heart block.

               -  Any factors that increase the risk of QTc prolongation or risk of arrhythmic
                  events such as heart failure, hypokalemia, congenital long QT syndrome, family
                  history of long QT syndrome or unexplained sudden death under 40 years of age.

         14. History of hypersensitivity to active or inactive excipients of AZD5153 and/or
             olaparib or drugs with a similar chemical structure or class to AZD5153 and/or
             olaparib.

         15. Patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) at high risk for developing tumor lysis
             syndrome are not eligible for the monotherapy dose escalation part of this study.

         16. Judgment by the Investigator that the patient should not participate in the study if
             the patient is unlikely to comply with study procedures, restrictions and
             requirements.

         17. Psychological, familial, sociological, or geographical conditions that do not permit
             compliance with the protocol.
