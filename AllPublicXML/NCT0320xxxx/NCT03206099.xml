  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      Genetic testing called sequencing helps researchers look at DNA. Genes are made of DNA and
      are the instructions for our bodies to function. We all have thousands of genes. DNA variants
      are differences in genes between two people. We all have lots of variants. Most are harmless
      and some cause differences like blue or brown eyes. A few variants can cause health problems.

      Objective:

      To understand the genetics of immune disorders.

      Eligibility:

        -  People ages 0-99 who are have a disease under investigation by another NIAID study that
           they are enrolled in

        -  Relatives of those people

      Design:

      Participants will give a sample by one of several means.

        -  Blood drawn by needle, or

        -  Saliva spit into a tube, or

        -  A couple of hairs plucked from the head, or

        -  A fingernail clipping.

      Researchers will study the genes from the samples. They will tell participants if they find
      results that relate to:

        -  The participant s (or family s) immune disorder

        -  Serious treatable diseases (like inherited cancer or heart disease)

        -  Some uncertain clinical results

      Researchers will not routinely tell participants about results that relate to normal variants
      or disorders that can t be treated.

      The samples and data will be saved for future research.

      Personal data will be kept as private as possible.

      If future studies need new information, participants may be contacted.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Investigators at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) use
      next-generation sequencing technologies to help determine genetic contributions to immune
      diseases. These efforts have increased rates of molecular diagnosis for a subset of NIAID
      participants as well as uncovered fundamental insights into the cellular and signaling
      pathways in host defense and immune regulation.

      Despite these successes, analysis and interpretation of genomic data remain a substantial
      challenge. Simply, researchers do not understand the functional and clinical consequences of
      most human genetic variation. This is true at NIAID and across the intramural research
      program. Making progress in this area requires a coordinated, systematic, and transparent
      approach to clinical genomics research.

      This protocol is specific to genetic testing and explicitly aims to both strengthen clinical
      care and enhance research throughout participating programs at the NIH. Probands will provide
      biological specimens for genetic testing and will be required to be enrolled on a primary
      protocol, which will execute the primary clinical and research evaluations. This protocol
      serves as a vehicle for a programmatic effort that includes standardized phenotyping, test
      ordering through the Clinical Research Information System (CRIS), sample collection and
      isolation, nucleic acid analysis, bioinformatics, clinical interpretation, reporting in CRIS,
      genetic counseling, and supporting effective use of genomics as a research tool throughout
      the intramural program. Overall, increased process standardization will support data
      integrity and efficiency while still accommodating the need for investigator flexibility.

        -  PARTICIPANT INCLUSION CRITERIA:

               1. Must fulfill one of the following criteria:

                    1. Proband participants must have a disease under investigation by another NIH
                       protocol on which they are enrolled.

                    2. Alternatively, participants may be the biological relative of a study
                       proband.

               2. Aged 0-99 years.

               3. Participants must be willing to undergo genetic testing.

               4. Participants who are pregnant are eligible to enroll.

               5. Participants must be willing to allow samples to be stored for future research.

               6. Participants must be willing to have their de-identified genomic data shared, for
                  example in a controlled access databases like the Database of Genotypes and
                  Phenotypes (dbGaP).

        PARTICIPANT EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Any condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, contraindicates participation in
        this study is a reason for exclusion.

        Co-enrollment guidelines:

        Probands must be enrolled on another NIAID protocol as their primary protocol for carrying
        out clinical and research evaluations. Relatives of probands may be enrolled in this
        protocol whether or not the relatives are enrolled on another NIAID protocol. However, we
        may prioritize enrolling relatives who are on other NIAID protocols and have undergone
        careful phenotyping on those protocols. Careful phenotyping is important, even for
        participants who are apparently healthy. Because the primary research team is best suited
        to characterize their participants phenotypes, phenotyping of co-enrolled relatives will be
        performed on the primary protocols.

        SUBSTUDY INCLUSION CRITERIA:

          1. Aged 14-99 years.

          2. English language proficiency.

        SUBSTUDY EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          1. Have received positive genetic results from this protocol in the past.

          2. Any condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, contraindicates participation
             in this substudy.
