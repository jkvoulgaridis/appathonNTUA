    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies radiofrequency technology in locating non-palpable breast
      lesions in patients undergoing surgery. Placing a miniature radiofrequency tag or microchip
      in the breast lesion before surgery and using a handheld device to guide doctors during
      surgery may improve surgical outcomes in patients with non-palpable breast lesions.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the feasibility of utilizing a new Federal Drug Administration (FDA)-cleared
      radiofrequency tag for localization of non-palpable breast lesions and provide preliminary
      data for a larger study.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo mammogram or ultrasound for image-guided placement of the radiofrequency tag
      within 30 days of surgery and then undergo radiofrequency-guided localization during surgery.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up within 2 weeks.

    <description>The patient experience with image-guided placement of the radio frequency Identification (RFID) tag.This assessments was captured using Likert-type questionnaires. Individual question responses for the patient and physician questionnaires ranged from 1 to 5 with the score of 5 representing the maximum positive or favorable response to each question. The following choices were included in each questionnaire:
Strongly disagree
Disagree
Neutral
Agree
Strongly Agree
Responses of the individual scales were added to create a total score, which would include a possible total range of 5 to a maximum of 25 points. 25 is the maximum positive or favorable response.</description>

      <time_frame>Adverse event reports were completed routinely for the first 20 patients enrolled in the study within 24 hours of device placement. Final monitoring for adverse events was performed at the time of the post-operative visit, which occurred within 14 days of surgery. The final monitoring occurred for the last patient on 01/23/2018</time_frame>
