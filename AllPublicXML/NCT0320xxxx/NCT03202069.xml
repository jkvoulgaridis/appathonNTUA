      The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of daily protein intake patterns on
      body composition and eating behaviors during weight loss.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The reinforcing value of food varies greatly among individuals, but is strongest for those
      who are overweight or obese. Reducing energy intake, which is necessary for overweight and
      obese individuals to achieve a healthier body weight, increases the reinforcing value of food
      - especially for energy-dense snack foods. Food is a powerful reinforcer and is associated
      with energy intake; making it a primary contributing factor to an individual's weight loss
      struggle. Developing a way to decrease or limit the increase in food reinforcement during
      energy deficits would have important clinical impact. High-protein diets are known to be
      efficacious for weight loss and recently have been shown to decrease stimulation of the
      reward areas of the brain that stimulate reward-driven eating behavior. Nonetheless,
      sustaining a high-protein diet can be difficult, especially for women. Consuming a modest
      amount of protein at each meal may be better tolerated. However, we do not know whether this
      pattern of protein intake can assist women in staying &quot;on track&quot; with weight loss goals. This
      study will help begin to elucidate the connections between the daily pattern of protein
      intake on diet adherence, alterations in food reinforcement, and favorable body composition
      changes during weight loss.
