  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of deferasirox film coated
      tablet (FCT) versus phlebotomy for the management of iron overload in adults with HH at risk
      of iron-related morbidity. This evaluation will provide information on the two treatment
      options in terms of the rate of response of proportion of patients reaching the study target
      SF ≤ 100 μg/L and their associated safety profiles.

      In addition to exploring the safety and efficacy of deferasirox FCT in hereditary
      hemochromatosis (HH), this study is being conducted to fulfill an FDA post-marketing
      requirement [PMC 750-10 (Exjade) /PMR 2888-8 (Jadenu)] to provide additional randomized data
      to confirm the ocular safety profile of deferasirox through detailed ocular assessments in
      patients treated with deferasirox FCT for 2 years.
