    <description>The Treatment Phase consists of the 4 milligrams (mg) Treatment Phase (the Titration Period [6 weeks] and the Maintenance Period [26 weeks]) and the 8 mg Treatment Phase (the Titration Period [4 weeks] and the Maintenance Period [26 weeks]) if participants require a higher dose. In the 4 mg Titration Period (6 weeks), participants will initiate 2 mg perampanel once daily (QD) for 2 weeks and then will be up-titrated to 4 mg QD and will continue this dose for 4 weeks. If participants have no safety issues at the end of the Titration Period, they will start the 4 mg Maintenance Period for 26 weeks. Participants will only need the higher dose if they are having seizures. In the 8 mg Titration Period (4 weeks), participants will be administered 6 mg perampanel QD for 2 weeks and then will be up-titrated to 8 mg QD and will continue this dose for 2 weeks. If participants have no safety issues at the end of the Titration Period, they will start the 8 mg Maintenance Period for 26 weeks.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Participants took part in the study at 38 investigative sites in Japan and Korea. Results are reported based on the primary completion date of 28 Feb 2019. A total of 98 participants were screened, of which 07 were screen failures and 91 entered Treatment Phase. Of these, 89 participants received the study treatment.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Study consisted of 2 main phases: Treatment Phase (consisted of 4 milligram [mg] Treatment Phase [the Titration Period {6 weeks} and the Maintenance Period {26 weeks}] and, for those participants who need a higher dose, the 8 mg Treatment Phase [the Titration Period {4 weeks} and the Maintenance Period {26 weeks}]) and Extension Phase.</pre_assignment_details>
      <group_list>
        <group group_id="P1">
          <title>Perampanel</title>
          <description>Participants received perampanel 2 mg tablets orally once daily (QD) for up to 2 weeks, then dose was up-titrated to 4 mg orally QD for 4 weeks in 4 mg Titration Period (6 Weeks) followed by perampanel 4 mg tablets orally QD in Maintenance Period (26 weeks). If participants experienced seizures during 4 mg Maintenance Period, investigator ended Maintenance Period and transitioned participants to 8 mg Titration Period based on participant’s safety and tolerability. In 8 mg Titration Period (4 weeks) participants received 6 mg perampanel tablets orally QD for 2 weeks and were up-titrated to 8 mg tablets orally QD for 2 weeks followed by perampanel 8 mg tablets orally QD in Maintenance Period (26 weeks). Participants who completed Treatment Phase and agreed to continue perampanel monotherapy entered Extension Phase and received perampanel until insufficient seizure control or lack of tolerability, or initiation of additional antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) (up to additional 124 weeks).</description>

        <description>Time to onset of first seizure was defined as the period from the first dose of study drug in the 4 mg Maintenance Period to the onset of first seizure. A seizure was a brief episode of signs or symptoms due to abnormal excessive or synchronous neuronal activity in the brain. Data for this outcome measure will be reported after study completion (which is planned for 2020).</description>
