    <textblock>
      While knowledge on the neurobiological signatures of fear and anxiety disorders and, in
      particular, their association with treatment outcome is accumulating, clinical translation
      still awaits empirical proof of evidence. Exposure-based cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)
      is a first-line treatment, but clinically significant change is only seen in approx. 50-65%
      of patients. Patient stratification is a powerful option to increase treatment response;
      however, developing prognostic markers suitable for single-patient predictions still is in
      its infancy and crucially requires external cross-validation embedded within an a priori
      prediction approach - a procedure yet largely missing in the field of biomarker research.
      Employing a bicentric strategy the aim of this study is to test the hypothesis that a priori
      prediction of treatment outcome based on neurobiological measures is possible in a second,
      independent sample. Building upon findings from previous mechanistic studies, These will be
      incorporated into the development of a predictive pattern comprising fear-relevant genotypes
      and molecules targeting neuropeptides, related epigenetic signatures as well as
      neurofunctional activation patterns associated with fear circuitry functions, and clinical
      data. Pre-treatment neurobiological signatures will be tested for their potential as a
      predictive response marker towards behavioral exposure (virtual reality exposure treatment
      (VRET) and an in vivo behavioral avoidance test) in a model disorder of fear circuitry
      dysfunctions (spider phobia). Multivariate pattern analyses employing a machine learning
      framework will be used to generate predictions on the individual patient level and to
      cross-validate markers in a second, independent sample. While at site A predictions will be
      generated following completion of the treatment, response will be predicted at site B a
      priori, but in a double-blind manner. Comparison of observed vs. predicted response rates
      will serve as a test of hypothesis. In addition, neuroplastic (on a subsample) and epigenetic
      changes induced by VRET treatment will be assessed following treatment and, in case of
      epigenetics, also after 6-months follow-up.
