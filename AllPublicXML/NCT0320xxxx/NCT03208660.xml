    <measure>Number of participants with any treatment-emergent (TE) serious adverse event (SAE) resulting in discontinuation of Fycompa</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: results in death; is life threatening (ie, the participant was at immediate risk of death from the adverse events [AE] as it occurred; this does not include an event that, had it occurred in a more severe form or was allowed to continue, might have caused death); requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; is a congenital anomaly/birth defect (in the child of a participant who was exposed to the study drug). A TEAE is defined as an AE that emerges during treatment, having been absent at pretreatment (baseline) or (1) reemerges during treatment, having been present at pretreatment (baseline) but stopped before treatment, or (2) worsens in severity during treatment relative to the pretreatment state, when the AE is continuous.</description>

    <measure>Number of participants with any treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) resulting in discontinuation of Fycompa</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical investigation participant administered an investigational product. An AE does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the medicinal product. A TEAE is defined as an AE that emerges during treatment, having been absent at pretreatment (baseline) or (1) reemerges during treatment, having been present at pretreatment (baseline) but stopped before treatment, or (2) worsens in severity during treatment relative to the pretreatment state, when the AE is continuous.</description>
