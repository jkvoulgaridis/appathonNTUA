  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the benefit and safety of relugolix 40 milligrams
      (mg) once daily, co-administered with low-dose estradiol (E2) and norethindrone acetate
      (NETA) compared with placebo for 24 weeks, on dysmenorrhea and on nonmenstrual pelvic pain.

    <textblock>
      This study is an international phase 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled efficacy
      and safety study to evaluate 24 weeks of oral, once-daily relugolix (40 mg) co-administered
      with either 12 or 24 weeks of low-dose E2 (1.0 mg) and NETA (0.5 mg), compared with placebo.

      Approximately 600 women with endometriosis-associated pain were enrolled and randomized 1:1:1
      to Group A - relugolix plus low-dose hormonal add-back therapy, Group B - relugolix
      monotherapy for 12 weeks followed by co-administration with low-dose hormonal add-back
      therapy, or Group C - placebo (N = 200 per group).

      Eligible participants were randomized on Baseline Day 1 to Treatment Group A, B, or C, in the
      double-blind period.

      Eligible participants, including those randomized to placebo, were offered the opportunity to
      enroll in an 80-week open label extension study where participants received relugolix
      co-administered with low-dose E2 and NETA. Participants who did not enroll into the extension
      study had a Follow-Up visit approximately 30 days after the participant's last dose of study
      drug.
