      This is a prospective, multi-center, observational study, the primary objective is to
      evaluate the prevalence of gBRCA/sBRCAm in newly diagnosed ovarian cancer patients and
      explore ovarian cancer treatment outcomes of different BRCAm status

    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multi-center, observational study that will enroll consecutive
      patients with a confirmed diagnosis of epithelial ovarian cancer, fallopian tube, or
      peritoneal cancer and who consent to a blood draw, a tissue sample analysis, and follow up
      for collection of data. 900 newly diagnosed ovarian cancer patients will be enrolled and
      evaluated for Breast Cancer Susceptibility genes BRCA1 and BRCA2 germline and somatic
      mutations (BRCAm). Approximately 170 BRCAm positive patients and 170 negative patients will
      be followed in the Follow-up Period. This study aims to answer very important questions
      regarding the prevalence of gBRCAm and sBRCAm in a population of newly diagnosed ovarian
      cancer patients, and the relationship of these mutations to patient treatment and clinical
      outcomes. These answers may be extremely helpful in the counseling and treatment of genetic
      risk in these populations and may aid in making treatment decisions in the future.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Be able and willing to sign the informed consent form (ICF)

          -  Female aged 18 years or over

          -  Have histologically confirmed new diagnosis of Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics
             (FIGO) stage III or IV ovarian epithelial, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube
             cancer made by one or more of the following:

               -  standard staging laparotomy including bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy,
                  omentectomy, and lymph node sampling and debulkingand/or

               -  surgical resection and radiographic evidence consistent with Stage III or IV
                  ovarian cancer

               -  biopsy with radiographic evidence consistent with Stage III or IV ovarian cancer

          -  Have availability of paraffin-embedded archivedtumor tissue block (preferred) or,if a
             block is not possible, a minimum of twenty 5-Î¼m unstained sections. (Tumor tissue
             should be archived at diagnosis. 10 slides is utilized for sBRCA testing after the
             enrolment. Another 10 slides is utilized for exploratory evaluation of HRR gene
             mutations in a retrospective way.)

          -  Have a diagnosis that is within 60 days of informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Have a diagnosis of additional concurrent malignancies or previous diagnosis of
             another malignancy with current evidence of residual disease

          -  Have a diagnosis of other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric conditions
             that may increase the risk associated with study participation or may interfere with
             the interpretation of the study results and, in the judgement of the Investigator,
             would make the patient inappropriate for enrollment in this study

          -  Be currently participating in any other clinical trial for first-line treatment of
             ovarian cancer

          -  Be a patient who, in the judgement of the Investigator, would be inappropriate for
             enrollment in this study
