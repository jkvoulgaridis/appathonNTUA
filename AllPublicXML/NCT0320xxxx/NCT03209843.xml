    <textblock>
      The objective of PERFECTO is to assess the reendothelialization at 3 months after
      successfully CTO percutaneous intervention (PCI) with new generation drug eluting stent (DES)
      by OFDI analysis. Designed as a multicentric, observational and prospective study which will
      be conducted at University Hospital of Poitiers (France), a systematic OFDI analysis will be
      realized immediately after CTO-PCI and at 3 months. Known as major predictive factors of
      stent thrombosis, percentages of malapposition, uncovered struts and neointimal hyperplasia
      proliferation will be measured over the entire length of each stent implanted combining in a
      composite primary endpoint.

    <description>Each participating center will perform one year after CTO PCI a clinical evaluation of all patients included. This could be established directly with the subject during medical follow-up or indirectly via family doctor. Standardized questionnaire will be provided at the end of the e-case report form (CRF). Occurrence of major adverse cardiac events (myocardial infarction, death, stroke), sudden death, hospitalization for cardiac disease and severe hemorrhage will be recorded. Any new coronary arteriography will be noticed, as well as any PCI or coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) during this one-year follow-up.
Death all-cause
Myocardial infarction
Stroke
Sudden death
Hospitalization for cardiac cause
