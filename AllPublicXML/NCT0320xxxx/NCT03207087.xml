    <textblock>
      This trial is a prospective, multicenter, single-arm confirmatory clinical trial. The study
      is to confirm the safety and effectiveness of the WEB Aneurysm Embolization System
      demonstrated in the US WEB-IT Study for the treatment of intracranial wide-neck bifurcation
      aneurysms. The study's primary endpoints include a primary effectiveness endpoint and a
      primary safety endpoint. The study device must meet both endpoints. The primary effectiveness
      endpoint is adjudicated by an independent third party core lab.

    <description>The WEB is an intra-aneurysmal device intended for use in endovascular embolization of intracranial aneurysms. The intended therapeutic effect of the WEB device is to line the neck of the aneurysm with a metallic structure that disrupts the inflow of blood, causing hemostasis within the aneurysm sac, and leading to thrombus formation within the implant. Subjects will be screened for study eligibility after giving informed consent.</description>
