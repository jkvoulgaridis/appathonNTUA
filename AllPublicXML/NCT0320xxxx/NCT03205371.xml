  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Phase III, open-label, randomized, parallel-group, active-controlled, multicenter study
      was conducted to assess the immunogenicity and safety of a single dose of Meningococcal
      Polysaccharide (Serogroups A, C, Y and W) Tetanus Toxoid (MenACYW) Conjugate vaccine when
      administered alone and in combination with other pediatric vaccines in healthy toddlers in
      South Korea, Thailand, the Russian Federation, and Mexico.

      Primary Objective:

        -  To describe the immunogenicity profile of MenACYW Conjugate vaccine administered alone
           or concomitantly with licensed pediatric vaccine(s) (measles-mumps-rubella vaccine [MMR]
           + Varicella, diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis, hepatitis B, poliomyelitis, and
           Haemophilus influenzae type-b Conjugate vaccine [DTaP-IPV-HB-Hib], or pneumococcal
           Conjugate vaccine [PCV13]).

      Secondary Objective:

        -  To describe the immunogenicity profile of licensed pediatric vaccine(s) (MMR +
           Varicella, DTaP-IPV-HB-Hib, or PCV13) when administered alone or concomitantly with
           MenACYW Conjugate vaccine.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Healthy, meningococcal-vaccine naïve toddlers aged 12 to 23 months were randomized either to
      a single dose of MenACYW Conjugate vaccine alone or in combination with other pediatric
      vaccines in healthy toddlers in South Korea and Thailand (MMR + varicella vaccine), the
      Russian Federation (PCV13), and Mexico (DTaP-IPV-HB-Hib). Immunogenicity (pre- and 30 days
      post-vaccination) and safety was assessed.

             administered in the study.

          -  For South Korea, participants must not had received the MMR or Varicella vaccination
             corresponding to his or her age at inclusion.

          -  For Mexico, participants must not had received the DTaP-IPV-HB-Hib vaccination
             corresponding to his or her age at inclusion.

          -  For Thailand, participants must not have received the any dose of MMR or V
             vaccination.

          -  Informed consent form was signed and dated by the parent(s) or guardian if allowed by
             local regulations (and by independent witnesses if required by local regulations)†.

          -  Participant and parent/guardian were able to attend all scheduled visits and to comply
             with all trial procedures.

          -  *Participants must had received the total number of doses expected for each vaccine
             recommended for his/her age in the respective NIPs, but inclusion of participants with
             variations in the vaccine administration timeframes is considered acceptable if the
             total number of doses for the corresponding vaccines had been completed (e.g., in
             Mexico, 3 infant doses of the pentavalent vaccine must had been administered but the
             4th dose due in the 2nd year of life should not had been administered for participants
             to be included in the trial). For the Russian Federation only, participants that had
             not received a seasonal flu vaccination from 6 months of age according to the Russian
             NIP were still eligible to participate in this study. For Thailand only, participants
             who had received a vaccine ahead of the schedule can still be included in the study
             provided the first doses of MMR and Varicella vaccines have not been administered
             prior to inclusion.

          -  †In the Russian Federation, as per local regulations, only the participant's parent(s)
             are entitled to sign an informed consent form. A child under the responsibility of a
             guardian were not included in the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participation in the 4 weeks preceding the first trial vaccination or planned

          -  Receipt of any vaccine in the 4 weeks (28 days) preceding the first trial vaccination

             containing vaccine; previous vaccination with DTaP-IPV-HB-Hib or DTaP-containing
             vaccine at 12 to 23 months of age.

        <description>Solicited Reaction (SR) was defined as an adverse event (AE) that was prelisted (i.e., solicited) in the electronic case report form (eCRF) and considered to be related to vaccination (adverse drug reaction). Solicited injection site reactions: tenderness, erythema, and swelling. Tenderness: Grade 3: cries when injected limb moved or the movement of the injected limb reduced, Erythema and swelling: Grade 3: &gt;= 50 millimeter (mm). Participants with any of the Grade and Grade 3 solicited injection-site reactions were reported.</description>

        <population>Analysis was performed on Safety analysis set (SafAS) which included participants who received at least 1 dose of study vaccine(s) &amp; had any safety data available.

        <title>Number of Participants Reporting at Least One Solicited Injection Site Reactions (Tenderness, Erythema, and Swelling): Groups 4, 5, and 6</title>
        <description>SR was defined as an AE that was prelisted (i.e., solicited) in the eCRF and considered to be related to vaccination (adverse drug reaction). Solicited injection site reactions: tenderness, erythema, and swelling. Tenderness: Grade 3: cries when injected limb moved or the movement of the injected limb reduced, Erythema and swelling: Grade 3: &gt;= 50 mm. Participants with any of the Grade and Grade 3 solicited injection-site reactions were reported.</description>
        <time_frame>Within 7 days post vaccination</time_frame>
        <population>Analysis was performed on SafAS. Here, ‘Number analyzed’ = participants with available data for each specified category and '0' in the number analyzed field signifies that the vaccines mentioned in the respective categories were not administered to the specified group.</population>

        <description>SR was defined as an AE that was prelisted (i.e., solicited) in the eCRF and considered to be related to vaccination (adverse drug reaction). Solicited injection site reactions: tenderness, erythema, and swelling. Tenderness: Grade 3: cries when injected limb moved, or the movement of the injected limb reduced, Erythema and swelling: Grade 3: &gt;= 50 mm. Participants with any of the Grade and Grade 3 solicited injection-site reactions were reported.</description>

      <time_frame>AE data were collected from Day 0 up to Day 30 post-vaccination. SR data were collected within 7 days after vaccination. Serious adverse event (SAE) data were collected throughout the study period (up to Day 30 post-vaccination).</time_frame>
      <desc>SR: an AE that was prelisted (i.e., solicited) in the eCRF and considered to be related to vaccination (adverse drug reaction). An unsolicited AE was an observed AE that did not fulfill the conditions prelisted in the eCRF (i.e., solicited) in terms of symptom and/or onset post-vaccination. Analysis was done on SafAS. In the AE section, solicited reactions Fever, Abnormal crying, Drowsiness, and Appetite lost are reported under Pyrexia, Crying, Somnolence, and Decreased Appetite, respectively.</desc>
