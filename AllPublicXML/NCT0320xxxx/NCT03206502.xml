  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is intended to characterize sleep, stress, and seizures in daily life with the
      Empatica Embrace watch and smartphone-based diary-alert system. The primary study objective
      is to collect and validate biometric signals from epilepsy patients using the Empatica
      Embrace watch and compare them to ictal events captured from human (patient and caregiver)
      reports.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients use the Embrace sensor with a smartphone app, &quot;Alert&quot;. The sensor attempts to
      capture convulsive seizure events such as generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCS's), and to
      initiate an alert when such an event is captured. Patients can also enter seizures (captured
      or not, GTCS or not) into the &quot;Mate&quot; diary, and they can cancel or mark false alarms if
      Embrace triggered a false alarm.

    <time_frame>The primary outcome is assessed continuously over the trial period (each new seizure is counted and summed for each person; the average time period is 6 months)</time_frame>
    <description>The number of GTCS automatically detected by Embrace will be compared to the total recorded by the wearer+caregiver in a seizure diary. This fraction is the sensitivity.</description>

    <description>The number of alerts elicited by Embrace+Alert app that do NOT correspond to convulsive seizures marked in the seizure diary are &quot;false alarms&quot;. False alarms can also be explicitly marked by patients.</description>

    <description>Participants are allowed to enter the trial (to use Embrace+Alert app) whether or not they have epilepsy. People without epilepsy may use Alert in this trial even though they are not expected to have seizures, as long as they are willing to mark false positives. Since many people with epilepsy live active lives and appear perfectly healthy outwardly, it is important that their active lifestyle data not trigger false alarms. Allowing healthy participants without epilepsy to contribute active lifestyle data helps us make the detection algorithm even stronger and better.</description>

    <intervention_type>Device</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>Embrace + Alert App</intervention_name>
    <description>Participants will wear an Embrace smartwatch to collect data, and will provide survey/diary information on the occurrence of seizures. The device sends data to the Alert app, which issues either true detections or false alarms when it detects a possible convulsive seizure. Participants are asked to either cancel (in real time) or mark (at a later time) all false alarms using the Alert app.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants must be between the ages of 1-99

          -  Anyone (healthy or not) can participate

          -  Adult participant must either be able to give consent or must have an acceptable
             surrogate capable of giving consent on their behalf.

          -  Participants under age 18 must have an adult guardian give informed consent, and if
             capable, the patient must give informed assent.

          -  Participants with GTCS must have a functioning smartphone (iOS or Android) that can be
             paired with the Embrace over a Bluetooth Low Energy connection and agree that it can
             be kept on or near their person.

          -  Participants with GTCS (or their surrogate) must be able to identify one or more
             &quot;designated frequent caregivers,&quot; who has a functioning phone, agrees to keep it
             regularly charged, agrees to receive alerts, and agrees to respond to alerts promptly
             to the best of their ability.

          -  Participants must be fluent in the language of the consent forms (Currently limited to
             English but Spanish and other languages are planned).

          -  Participants must reside in the United States.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants must not have broken or injured skin at the wrist or leg location where
             Embrace is worn, and they must be able to tolerate wearing Embrace snugly for long
             periods of time. Thus, they should not have allergies to the material composition of
             the Embrace watch, or discomfort wearing a wristwatch or leg-band device.

          -  Participants should not be homeless.

          -  Participants should not have active dependence on substances that are not currently
             prescribed by their doctor (e.g. alcohol, pain medications, illegal drugs) or be
             taking substances that they are not willing to disclose as a study participant.

          -  Participants must not be pregnant or planning to become pregnant within six months at
             the time of screening.
