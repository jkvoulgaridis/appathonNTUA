      This phase II trial studies how well atezolizumab, cobimetinib, and eribulin work in treating
      patients with inflammatory breast cancer that has spread to other places in the body.
      Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as atezolizumab, may help the body's immune
      system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and
      spread. Cobimetinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed
      for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as eribulin, work in different ways to stop
      the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by
      stopping them from spreading. Giving atezolizumab, cobimetinib, and eribulin may work better
      in treating patients with inflammatory breast cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine ORR (overall response rate) of metastatic inflammatory breast cancer (mIBC)
      patients treated with this proposed combinatorial atezolizumab, cobimetinib, and eribulin
      (ACE) therapy via phase II.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To further characterize the safety and tolerability of, triple combination: ACE therapy.

      II. To determine CBR (clinical benefit rate): (stable disease [SD] + complete response [CR] +
      partial response [PR]) &gt;= 24 weeks of mIBC patients treated with this proposed combinatorial
      therapy via phase II.

      III. To determine the duration of response (DOR). IV. To determine progression free survival
      (PFS). V. To determine 2 years overall survival (OS).

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the progressive disease (PD) biomarker changes induced by combinatorial
      therapy using liquid and tissue based assays to investigate microenvironment via multiplex
      imaging, proportional study of T cells: CD3, CD8 composition and change, macrophage (M1 and
      M2), PD-L1 expression on circulating tumor cell (CTC).

      II. To determine the immune pathway related biomarker changes induced by combinatorial
      therapy via multiplex serum cytokine assays.

      III. This translational biomarker assays will be done based on collaboration with plasma
      based ribonucleic acid (RNA) sequencing (RNA-seq) in collaboration with Lambowitz laboratory
      (lab), Oncomine next-generation sequencing (NGS) study on tumor/circulating tumor
      deoxyribonucleic acid (ctDNA) with Wistuba lab, and bioinformatics with Futreal lab.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive atezolizumab intravenously (IV) over about 30 minutes-1 hour every 2 weeks,
      cobimetinib orally (PO) daily for 3 weeks on, 1 week off for 4 weeks of the safety lead-in
      course. Patients then receive atezolizumab IV over about 30 minutes-1 hour every 2 weeks,
      cobimetinib PO daily for 3 weeks on, 1 week off, and eribulin IV over about 5 minutes on days
      1 and 8 of courses 1-4. Courses 1-4 repeat every 21 days and subsequent courses with
      atezolizumab and cobimetinib repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of the study treatment, patients are followed for 3 months and then every 6
      months for at least 2 years.
