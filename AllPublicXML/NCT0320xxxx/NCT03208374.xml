  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will recruit approximately 5,000 patients with histologically confirmed cancer who
      have successfully completed MSK-IMPACT panel testing and collect information about tumor
      genetic results and patient exercise behavior history.

      The purpose of the study is to create a registry to collect exercise behavior history in
      patients who had IMPACT genetic panel testing on protocol IRB #12-245 &quot;Genomic Profiling in
      Cancer Patients&quot;, IRB #06-107 &quot;Storage and Research Use of Human Biospecimens,&quot; or IRB
      #09-141 &quot;Collection of Human Biological Specimens from Patients for Research Studies.&quot; The
      investigators want to find a way to create an exercise database. This database will collect
      information about tumor genetic results and patient exercise behavior history.
