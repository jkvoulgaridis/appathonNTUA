  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      Chronic lymphocytic leukemia and small lymphocytic lymphoma (hereby referred as CLL) are
      tumors of B cells. A subset of patients categorized as high-risk CLL has a poor clinical
      outcome when treated with conventional chemotherapy. This single-arm, phase II study
      investigates the combination of ibrutinib, fludarabine and pembrolizumab for treatment of
      CLL. Ibrutinib is an orally administered therapy for CLL. Fludarabine is a well-tolerated
      drug that has been widely used to treat CLL. Also, fludarabine can modulate CLL cells as well
      as immune cells that support the growth of CLL cells. Pembrolizumab recruits immune cells to
      attack CLL cells. With this approach we hope to achieve a greater reduction in CLL cells than
      with single agent ibrutinib andto restore healthier immune system that could contribute to
      durable responses.

      Objective:

      To investigate the rate of complete response to ibrutinib, short course fludarabine and
      pembrolizumab.

      Eligibility:

      Patients with active CLL meeting treatment indications defined by 2008 International Workshop
      on CLL (IWCLL) consensus guideline.

      High-risk CLL defined by one of the following:

        -  Relapsed/refractory disease status (except patients with deletion 13q AND mutated IgHV),
           or

        -  Presence of high-risk mutations regardless of prior treatment status: deletion 17p, TP53
           mutation, NOTCH1 mutation, or complex cytogenetics.

      Design:

      This is a single-arm, open-label phase II study.

      Timeline: Treatment on this study is given in cycles from cycle -3 to 17, then in months
      beyond cycle 17. Cycles -3 to -1 are 28-day cycles. Cycles 1 to 17 are 21-day cycles. After
      completion of 1 year of pembrolizumab, the time on study is by chronological months on study
      from starting pembrolizumab.

      Treatment plan:

        -  Ibrutinib is given starting from cycle -3 and continuously until disease progression or
           intolerable side effects occur.

        -  Fludarabine is given on cycle -2 only.

        -  Pembrolizumab is given every 3 weeks starting from cycle 1 for 1 year.

        -  Minimal residual disease will be measured at 2 years from cycle 1 to determine the need
           for long- term treatment with ibrutinib.

             -  Previously-untreated patients who achieve minimal residual disease negativity will
                stop ibrutinib.

             -  Patients who do not achieve minimal residual disease negativity or who has
                Relapsed/refractory CLL will continue ibrutinib.

      Background:

      This study investigates the combination of ibrutinib, fludarabine and pembrolizumab for
      treatment of CLL. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia and small lymphocytic lymphoma (hereby
      referred as CLL) are tumors of B cells. A subset of patients categorized as high-risk CLL has
      a poor clinical outcome when treated with conventional chemotherapy. High-risk CLL is defined
      by relapsed/refractory disease status, or the presence of high-risk mutations, such as
      deletion 17p, TP53, and NOTCH1. While the cause of CLL is still unclear, studies have
      indicated critical factors required for the tumor cells. First, CLL cells grow and survive
      because they receive signals through the B-cell receptor (BCR); and second, CLL cells benefit
      from interactions with other cells, especially T cells.

      The stimulation through the BCR can be blocked by ibrutinib, which is an oral drug that
      selectively inhibits Bruton s tyrosine kinase (BTK). In clinical trials, ibrutinib
      demonstrated safety and high response rates in patients with high-risk disease. Ibrutinib has
      gained FDA approval as a treatment for CLL regardless of prior treatment or cytogenetic
      status. However, single-agent ibrutinib has limitations; the drug does not eliminate all
      tumor cells and, with time, the tumor cells may become resistant. Therefore, combination of
      ibrutinib with other drugs could be beneficial.

      Objectives:

      -To investigate the rate of complete response to ibrutinib, short course fludarabine and

      pembrolizumab.

      Key eligibility criteria:

      Patients with active CLL meeting treatment indications defined by 2008 International Workshop
      on CLL (IWCLL) consensus guideline.
