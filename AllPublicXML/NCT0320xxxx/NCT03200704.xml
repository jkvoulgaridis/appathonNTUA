      This is a prospective, open label, multicenter, non-inferiority within-patient study to
      determine the effectiveness of IC2000 (Indocyanine Green (ICG) for Injection) and the SPY
      Portable Handheld Imaging System (SPY-PHI) as an intraoperative fluorescence visualization
      tool, in the visual identification of lymphatic vessels and lymph nodes (LNs) during
      lymphatic mapping and sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) procedures as confirmed by
      Technitium99m (Tc99m) and Gamma Probe.

    <description>Per standard of care, each subject will receive an injection of Tc-99m radioactive colloid. Then the periareolar area of the breast(s) identified with breast cancer will be injected (intradermal) twice with 0.05 ml of a 2.5 mg/ml solution of IC2000. Following the injection lymph node mapping will occur based on intraoperative fluorescence visualization using IC2000 and SPY-PHI. Lymph nodes will be excised following identification with IC2000 and SPY-PHI. The Gamma Probe will then be used with Tc-99m for confirmation of the excised lymph nodes as well as in the area of LN excision to ensure all LNs have been identified and excised.</description>
