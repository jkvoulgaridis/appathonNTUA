      To establish performance of individual tests and combinations of tests (serological,
      molecular and cellular tests) in early Lyme infection diagnosis
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The present study aims to investigate the performance characteristics of both established and
      new assays for Borrelia burgdorferi infection and to assess the relative performance of
      appropriate combinations of these tests. The study will also investigate the effect of the
      time course of the infection and its treatment on the outcomes for the various tests.
      Polymerase Chain Reaction(PCR), serology and T cell based tests will be performed. In
      addition, tests for Babesia, Anaplasma, Ehrlichia and Rickettsia will also be performed as
      these pathogens can be carried by the same tick that carries Borrelia and may result in
      coinfection.

    <description>Whole blood specimens will be tested for the presence of Borrelia DNA by PCR in a two-step test (Imugen). In Cohort 1a and 1b. The first step tests for the presence of any Borrelia DNA. The second step is employed on positive samples and tests for the presence of either B. burgdorferi DNA or B. miyamotoi DNA. Positivity by PCR has a short but early window in the infection cycle for Borrelia burgdorferi and results may enable this window period and diagnosis rates to be better defined.
In addition co-infection PCR analysis will be performed for the presence of Babesia, Anaplasma or Ehrlichia DNA (Imugen).</description>

The Immunetics C6 Lyme ELISA assay.
A 2-tier Lyme test performed and interpreted according to Centers for Disease Control (CDC) Guidelines
A Rickettsia antibody test will be used to identify Spotted Fever and Typhus fever groups infections.
Lyme test methodologies generally indicate a need to run a combination of tests in order to overcome limitations in either sensitivity or specificity of the various individual tests. Performance of all these tests on the same set of samples should enable both individual and combinatorial performance values to be calculated and compared.</description>

    <description>A research based ELISpot assay will be performed on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) extracted from whole blood samples to test for presence of T cells activated against Borrelia antigens. Unlike serology based methods, this signal may not persist over extended periods of time in the absence of Borrelia antigens. The diagnostic window may be different for a test measuring adaptive immune response (i.e. T cells) and thus such test may identify patients with undetectable antibody response and may aid sensitivity of diagnosis.</description>
