  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      GSK3772847, an anti-interleukin (IL)33 receptor monoclonal antibody, is a novel treatment for
      asthma. This is a phase 2a study which aims to evaluate efficacy, safety, tolerability,
      pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) profiles of GSK3772847 in subjects with
      moderately severe asthma. The study will be conducted in 4 phases including screening, run-in
      phase, treatment phase and follow-up. In treatment phase, eligible subjects will be
      randomized to receive either GSK3772847 or placebo administered via intravenous (IV) route
      every 4 weeks in addition to open-label background therapy of fluticasone propionate/
      salmeterol (FP/Sal) 500/50 micrograms (mcg) twice daily. During the treatment phase, the
      background therapy will be switched to FP 500 mcg for 2 weeks and the dose of FP will be
      reduced by approximately 50 percent at every 2 weeks until complete FP discontinuation. The
      total duration of study will be approximately 33 weeks and approximately 165 subjects with
      moderately severe asthma who are maintained on high-dose of inhaled corticosteroids/
      Long-Acting Beta-2-Agonists (ICS/LABA) will be randomized.

          <description>Participants were administered placebo via intravenous (IV) route every 4 weeks (Weeks 0, 4, 8 and 12) in addition to open-label background therapy of fluticasone propionate/ salmeterol (FP/Sal) 500/50 micrograms (mcg) twice daily. After 2 weeks, the background therapy was switched to FP 500 mcg for 2 weeks and the dose of FP was reduced by approximately 50 percent at every 2 weeks until complete FP discontinuation. Three Follow-up visits were performed after the End of Treatment Period (ETP) Visit (Weeks 20, 24, and 28) for safety assessments. Participants received salbutamol/albuterol to use as needed for asthma symptom relief.</description>

The analysis shown is for primary estimand which includes all data collected, except for data collected after the date of loss of asthma control or early withdrawal from study treatment. Baseline is defined as Day1. Percentage of participants experiencing loss of asthma control up to Week 16 has been presented. Modified Intent-to-Treat (Loss of Control) (mITT_LoC) population consisted of all randomized participants who took at least 1 dose of study treatment and if participants experienced loss of asthma control, they were analyzed according to actual treatment at time of loss of control.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With &gt;=0.5 Point Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ-5) Score Increase From Baseline</title>
        <description>The ACQ-5 is a five-item, self-completed questionnaire, which measures asthma control of a participant. The five questions (concerning nocturnal awakening, waking in the morning, activity limitation, shortness of breath and wheeze) enquire about the frequency and/or severity of symptoms over the previous week. The response options for all these questions range from zero (no impairment/limitation) to six (total impairment/ limitation) scale. ACQ-5 score ranges from 0 (totally controlled) to 6 (severely uncontrolled). Higher score indicate lower asthma control. Baseline is the latest available assessment prior to first dose (Day 1). Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting Baseline value from the specified time point value. A change of &gt;=0.5 in score suggests a clinically important change in score. Data is presented for primary estimand which includes all data collected, except for data collected after the date of loss of asthma control or early withdrawal from study treatment</description>

After 2 weeks, the background therapy was switched to FP 500 mcg for 2 weeks and the dose of FP was reduced by approximately 50 percent at every 2 weeks until complete FP discontinuation. Three Follow-up visits were performed after the End of Treatment Period (ETP) Visit (Weeks 20, 24, and 28) for safety assessments.

        <title>Time to Loss of Asthma Control</title>
        <description>Time to loss of asthma control was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier analysis. In this analysis, participants were either be counted as an event or they were censored. An event is defined as participants who experience loss of asthma control during the study. Censoring is defined as participants who discontinued investigational product for reasons other than loss of asthma control. The analysis shown is for primary estimand which includes all data collected, except for data collected after the date of loss of asthma control or early withdrawal from study treatment. Participants who didn't experience loss of asthma control were also censored at day 113.</description>

After 2 weeks, the background therapy was switched to FP 500 mcg for 2 weeks and the dose of FP was reduced by approximately 50 percent at every 2 weeks until complete FP discontinuation. Three Follow-up visits were performed after the End of Treatment Period (ETP) Visit (Weeks 20, 24, and 28) for safety assessments. Participants received salbutamol/albuterol to use as needed for asthma symptom relief.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ-5) Total Score</title>
        <description>ACQ-5 is a five-item, self-completed questionnaire, which measures asthma control of a participant. The five questions (concerning nocturnal awakening, waking in the morning, activity limitation, shortness of breath &amp; wheeze) enquire about the frequency &amp;/or severity of symptoms over the previous week. The response options range from zero (no impairment/limitation) to six (total impairment/limitation) scale. ACQ-5 score ranges from 0 (totally controlled) to 6 (severely uncontrolled). Higher score indicate lower asthma control. Baseline is the latest available assessment prior to first dose (Day 1). Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting Baseline value from the specified time point value. Data is presented for primary estimand which includes all data collected, except for data collected after the date of loss of asthma control or early withdrawal from study treatment.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline and Weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 and Week 16</time_frame>
        <population>Modified Intent-to-Treat Population. Only those participants with data available at indicated time points were analyzed. Participants with data available at specified time points were represented by n=x in the category titles.</population>

            <title>Placebo</title>
            <description>Participants were administered placebo via intravenous (IV) route every 4 weeks (Weeks 0, 4, 8 and 12) in addition to open-label background therapy of fluticasone propionate/ salmeterol (FP/Sal) 500/50 micrograms (mcg) twice daily. After 2 weeks, the background therapy was switched to FP 500 mcg for 2 weeks and the dose of FP was reduced by approximately 50 percent at every 2 weeks until complete FP discontinuation. Three Follow-up visits were performed after the End of Treatment Period (ETP) Visit (Weeks 20, 24, and 28) for safety assessments. Participants received salbutamol/albuterol to use as needed for asthma symptom relief.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With &lt;=-0.5 Point ACQ-5 Score Decrease From Baseline (Responder)</title>
        <description>ACQ-5 is a five-item, self-completed questionnaire, which measures asthma control of a participant. The five questions (concerning nocturnal awakening, waking in the morning, activity limitation, shortness of breath &amp; wheeze) enquire about the frequency &amp;/or severity of symptoms over the previous week. The response options range from zero (no impairment/limitation) to six (total impairment/limitation) scale. ACQ-5 score ranges from 0 (totally controlled) to 6 (severely uncontrolled). Higher score indicate lower asthma control. Baseline is the latest available assessment prior to first dose (Day 1). Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting Baseline value from the specified time point value. A responder is defined as participants with change from Baseline of &lt;= -0.5 point at given time point. Data is presented for primary estimand which includes all data collected, except for data collected after the date of loss of asthma control or early withdrawal from study treatment.</description>

            <description>Participants were administered placebo via intravenous (IV) route every 4 weeks (Weeks 0, 4, 8 and 12) in addition to open-label background therapy of fluticasone propionate/ salmeterol (FP/Sal) 500/50 micrograms (mcg) twice daily. After 2 weeks, the background therapy was switched to FP 500 mcg for 2 weeks and the dose of FP was reduced by approximately 50 percent at every 2 weeks until complete FP discontinuation. Three Follow-up visits were performed after the End of Treatment Period (ETP) Visit (Weeks 20, 24, and 28) for safety assessments. Participants received salbutamol/albuterol to use as needed for asthma symptom relief.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) Total Score</title>
        <description>SGRQ is a disease-specific questionnaire designed to measure impact of respiratory disease and its treatment on Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of participants with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). It contains 14 questions with a total of 40 items grouped into domains (Symptoms, Activity and Impacts). SGRQ total score was calculated as 100 multiplied by summed weights from all positive items divided by sum of weights for all items in questionnaire. It ranges from 0 to 100, higher score indicates poor HRQoL. Baseline is defined as the latest available assessment prior to first dose (Day 1). Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting Baseline value from the specified time point value. Data is presented for primary estimand which includes all data collected, except for data collected after the date of loss of asthma control or early withdrawal from study treatment.</description>

            <description>Participants were administered placebo via intravenous (IV) route every 4 weeks (Weeks 0, 4, 8 and 12) in addition to open-label background therapy of fluticasone propionate/ salmeterol (FP/Sal) 500/50 micrograms (mcg) twice daily. After 2 weeks, the background therapy was switched to FP 500 mcg for 2 weeks and the dose of FP was reduced by approximately 50 percent at every 2 weeks until complete FP discontinuation. Three Follow-up visits were performed after the End of Treatment Period (ETP) Visit (Weeks 20, 24, and 28) for safety assessments. Participants received salbutamol/albuterol to use as needed for asthma symptom relief.</description>

            <description>Participants were administered placebo via intravenous (IV) route every 4 weeks (Weeks 0, 4, 8 and 12) in addition to open-label background therapy of fluticasone propionate/ salmeterol (FP/Sal) 500/50 micrograms (mcg) twice daily. After 2 weeks, the background therapy was switched to FP 500 mcg for 2 weeks and the dose of FP was reduced by approximately 50 percent at every 2 weeks until complete FP discontinuation. Three Follow-up visits were performed after the End of Treatment Period (ETP) Visit (Weeks 20, 24, and 28) for safety assessments. Participants received salbutamol/albuterol to use as needed for asthma symptom relief.</description>

          <title>Percentage of Participants With at Least a 4 Units Improvement From Baseline of St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ)</title>
          <description>SGRQ is a disease-specific questionnaire designed to measure impact of respiratory disease and its treatment on HRQoL of participants with COPD. It contains 14 questions with a total of 40 items grouped into domains (Symptoms, Activity and Impacts). SGRQ total score was calculated as 100 multiplied by summed weights from all positive items divided by sum of weights for all items in questionnaire. It ranges from 0 to 100, higher score indicates poor HRQoL. Baseline is defined as the latest available assessment prior to first dose (Day 1). A responder is defined as a change from Baseline of &lt;= -4 at the given time point. Data is presented for primary estimand which includes all data collected, except for data collected after the date of loss of asthma control or early withdrawal from study treatment.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Mean Morning Peak Expiratory Flow (PEF) and Mean Evening PEF</title>
        <description>PEF is maximum speed of expiration measured, using spirometer. The device was distributed to participants at Visit 1, to measure PEF twice-daily (morning upon waking &amp; in the evening just before going to bed). Participants were encouraged to perform morning &amp; evening PEF measurements before the use of any long-acting beta-agonists (LABAs) or rescue medication. Highest of 3 values were recorded in eDairy.Baseline was calculated over the last 7 days of run-in period prior to Visit 2 (Week 0). Participants with at least 4 full days of data in the last 7 days of run-in were included. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting Baseline value from the specified time point value. Mean PEF was calculated for each participant during the four weekly periods (Weeks 1-4; Weeks 5-8, Weeks 9-12 and Weeks 13-16).Data is presented for primary estimand which includes all data collected, except for data collected after the date of loss of asthma control or early withdrawal from study treatment</description>

        <description>Asthma symptoms experienced by participants during the day was recorded in e-Diary every evening before going to bed in form of scores on a 5-point rating scale. Scores ranged from 0=no daytime asthma symptoms to 4=very severe daytime asthma symptoms. Baseline was calculated over the last 7 days of run-in period prior to Visit 2 (Week 0). Participants with at least 4 full days of data in the last 7 days of run-in were included. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting Baseline value from the specified time point value. The mean asthma symptom score was calculated for each participant during the four weekly periods (Weeks 1-4; Weeks 5-8, Weeks 9-12 and Weeks 13-16).

        <title>Change From Baseline in Mean Daily Rescue Medication Use (Albuterol/Salbutamol)</title>
        <description>The mean number of inhalation of rescue medication (albuterol/salbutamol) used to relieve symptoms immediately during the day and night was recorded in eDiary from Baseline until Week 16. Baseline was calculated over the last 7 days of run-in period prior to Visit 2 (Week 0). Participants with at least 4 full days of data in the last 7 days of run-in were included. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting Baseline value from the specified time point value. The mean rescue medication use was calculated for each participant during the four weekly periods (Weeks 1-4; Weeks 5-8, Weeks 9-12 and Weeks 13-16). Data is presented for primary estimand which includes all data collected, except for data collected after the date of loss of asthma control or early withdrawal from study treatment.</description>

        <title>Percent Change From Baseline in Fractional Exhaled Nitric Oxide (FeNO)</title>
        <description>FeNO was assessed as a measure of airway inflammation using a handheld electronic device. The measurements recorded were according to standardized procedures by the American Thoracic Society and the European Respiratory Society Recommendations for Standardized Procedures for the Online and Offline Measurement of Exhaled Lower Respiratory Nitric Oxide and Nasal Nitric Oxide. FeNO measurements were obtained prior to FEV1 assessments. Participants did not use their rescue medication for at least 6 hours before each FeNO assessment, unless essential for clinical need. Baseline is defined as the latest available assessment prior to first dose (Day 1). Percent change from Baseline is calculated as ratio to Baseline minus one and multiplied by 100. Data is presented for primary estimand which includes all data collected, except for data collected after the date of loss of asthma control or early withdrawal from study treatment.</description>

            <description>Participants were administered placebo via intravenous (IV) route every 4 weeks (Weeks 0, 4, 8 and 12) in addition to open-label background therapy of fluticasone propionate/ salmeterol (FP/Sal) 500/50 micrograms (mcg) twice daily. After 2 weeks, the background therapy was switched to FP 500 mcg for 2 weeks and the dose of FP was reduced by approximately 50 percent at every 2 weeks until complete FP discontinuation. Three Follow-up visits were performed after the End of Treatment Period (ETP) Visit (Weeks 20, 24, and 28) for safety assessments. Participants received salbutamol/albuterol to use as needed for asthma symptom relief.</description>

            <description>Participants were administered placebo via intravenous (IV) route every 4 weeks (Weeks 0, 4, 8 and 12) in addition to open-label background therapy of fluticasone propionate/ salmeterol (FP/Sal) 500/50 micrograms (mcg) twice daily. After 2 weeks, the background therapy was switched to FP 500 mcg for 2 weeks and the dose of FP was reduced by approximately 50 percent at every 2 weeks until complete FP discontinuation. Three Follow-up visits were performed after the End of Treatment Period (ETP) Visit (Weeks 20, 24, and 28) for safety assessments. Participants received salbutamol/albuterol to use as needed for asthma symptom relief.</description>

            <description>Participants were administered placebo via intravenous (IV) route every 4 weeks (Weeks 0, 4, 8 and 12) in addition to open-label background therapy of fluticasone propionate/ salmeterol (FP/Sal) 500/50 micrograms (mcg) twice daily. After 2 weeks, the background therapy was switched to FP 500 mcg for 2 weeks and the dose of FP was reduced by approximately 50 percent at every 2 weeks until complete FP discontinuation. Three Follow-up visits were performed after the End of Treatment Period (ETP) Visit (Weeks 20, 24, and 28) for safety assessments. Participants received salbutamol/albuterol to use as needed for asthma symptom relief.</description>

After 2 weeks, the background therapy was switched to FP 500 mcg for 2 weeks and the dose of FP was reduced by approximately 50 percent at every 2 weeks until complete FP discontinuation. Three Follow-up visits were performed after the End of Treatment Period (ETP) Visit (Weeks 20, 24, and 28) for safety assessments. Participants received salbutamol/albuterol to use as needed for asthma symptom relief.</description>

        <description>Triplicate 12-lead ECGs were recorded pre-dose and post-dose with participant in semi-supine position after 5 minutes rest. At each time point ECG was taken using an ECG machine that automatically measures PR interval, QRS duration, uncorrected QT interval, QTcF interval and RR interval. Baseline is defined as the most recent recorded value before dosing on Day 1. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting Baseline value from the specified time point value.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in ECG Heart Rate</title>
        <description>Triplicate 12-lead ECGs were recorded pre-dose and post-dose with participant in semi-supine position after 5 minutes rest. At each time point ECG was taken using an ECG machine that automatically measures heart rate. Baseline is defined as the most recent recorded value before dosing on Day 1. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting Baseline value from the specified time point value.</description>

            <description>Participants were administered placebo via intravenous (IV) route every 4 weeks (Weeks 0, 4, 8 and 12) in addition to open-label background therapy of fluticasone propionate/ salmeterol (FP/Sal) 500/50 micrograms (mcg) twice daily. After 2 weeks, the background therapy was switched to FP 500 mcg for 2 weeks and the dose of FP was reduced by approximately 50 percent at every 2 weeks until complete FP discontinuation. Three Follow-up visits were performed after the End of Treatment Period (ETP) Visit (Weeks 20, 24, and 28) for safety assessments. Participants received salbutamol/albuterol to use as needed for asthma symptom relief.</description>

            <description>Participants were administered placebo via intravenous (IV) route every 4 weeks (Weeks 0, 4, 8 and 12) in addition to open-label background therapy of fluticasone propionate/ salmeterol (FP/Sal) 500/50 micrograms (mcg) twice daily. After 2 weeks, the background therapy was switched to FP 500 mcg for 2 weeks and the dose of FP was reduced by approximately 50 percent at every 2 weeks until complete FP discontinuation. Three Follow-up visits were performed after the End of Treatment Period (ETP) Visit (Weeks 20, 24, and 28) for safety assessments. Participants received salbutamol/albuterol to use as needed for asthma symptom relief.</description>

          <description>Triplicate 12-lead ECGs were recorded pre-dose and post-dose with participant in semi-supine position after 5 minutes rest. At each time point ECG was taken using an ECG machine that automatically measures PR interval, QRS duration, uncorrected QT interval, QTcF interval and RR interval. Baseline is defined as the most recent recorded value before dosing on Day 1. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting Baseline value from the specified time point value.</description>

        <description>Using a Holter monitor, maximum, minimum and average changes in heart rate was recorded at Baseline, Weeks 0, 4 and 12 through 24 hours. Participants with analyzable time of at least 16 hours were evaluated. Baseline is the value from the screening visit assessment. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting Baseline value from the specified time point value.</description>

            <description>Participants were administered placebo via intravenous (IV) route every 4 weeks (Weeks 0, 4, 8 and 12) in addition to open-label background therapy of fluticasone propionate/ salmeterol (FP/Sal) 500/50 micrograms (mcg) twice daily. After 2 weeks, the background therapy was switched to FP 500 mcg for 2 weeks and the dose of FP was reduced by approximately 50 percent at every 2 weeks until complete FP discontinuation. Three Follow-up visits were performed after the End of Treatment Period (ETP) Visit (Weeks 20, 24, and 28) for safety assessments. Participants received salbutamol/albuterol to use as needed for asthma symptom relief.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Supraventricular Couplets, Supraventricular Ectopics, Supraventricular Runs, Supraventricular Singles, Ventricular Couplets, Ventricular Ectopics, Ventricular Runs, Ventricular Singles</title>
        <description>Using a Holter monitor, supraventricular couplets, supraventricular ectopics, supraventricular runs, supraventricular singles, ventricular couplets, ventricular ectopics, ventricular runs, ventricular singles were recorded at Baseline, Weeks 0, 4 and 12 through 24 hours. Participants with analyzable time of at least 16 hours were evaluated. Baseline is the value from the screening visit assessment. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting Baseline value from the specified time point value.</description>

            <description>Participants were administered placebo via intravenous (IV) route every 4 weeks (Weeks 0, 4, 8 and 12) in addition to open-label background therapy of fluticasone propionate/ salmeterol (FP/Sal) 500/50 micrograms (mcg) twice daily. After 2 weeks, the background therapy was switched to FP 500 mcg for 2 weeks and the dose of FP was reduced by approximately 50 percent at every 2 weeks until complete FP discontinuation. Three Follow-up visits were performed after the End of Treatment Period (ETP) Visit (Weeks 20, 24, and 28) for safety assessments. Participants received salbutamol/albuterol to use as needed for asthma symptom relief.</description>

After 2 weeks, the background therapy was switched to FP 500 mcg for 2 weeks and the dose of FP was reduced by approximately 50 percent at every 2 weeks until complete FP discontinuation. Three Follow-up visits were performed after the End of Treatment Period (ETP) Visit (Weeks 20, 24, and 28) for safety assessments. Participants received salbutamol/albuterol to use as needed for asthma symptom relief.</description>

            <description>Participants were administered placebo via intravenous (IV) route every 4 weeks (Weeks 0, 4, 8 and 12) in addition to open-label background therapy of fluticasone propionate/ salmeterol (FP/Sal) 500/50 micrograms (mcg) twice daily. After 2 weeks, the background therapy was switched to FP 500 mcg for 2 weeks and the dose of FP was reduced by approximately 50 percent at every 2 weeks until complete FP discontinuation. Three Follow-up visits were performed after the End of Treatment Period (ETP) Visit (Weeks 20, 24, and 28) for safety assessments. Participants received salbutamol/albuterol to use as needed for asthma symptom relief.</description>

        <description>Blood samples were collected for the analysis of clinical chemistry parameters including total bilirubin, creatinine and direct bilirubin at indicated time points. Baseline is defined as the most recent recorded value before dosing on Day 1. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting Baseline value from the specified time point value.</description>

            <description>Participants were administered placebo via intravenous (IV) route every 4 weeks (Weeks 0, 4, 8 and 12) in addition to open-label background therapy of fluticasone propionate/ salmeterol (FP/Sal) 500/50 micrograms (mcg) twice daily. After 2 weeks, the background therapy was switched to FP 500 mcg for 2 weeks and the dose of FP was reduced by approximately 50 percent at every 2 weeks until complete FP discontinuation. Three Follow-up visits were performed after the End of Treatment Period (ETP) Visit (Weeks 20, 24, and 28) for safety assessments. Participants received salbutamol/albuterol to use as needed for asthma symptom relief.</description>

        <description>Blood samples were collected at given time points to assess clinical chemistry parameters including total protein and albumin levels. Baseline is defined as the most recent recorded value before dosing on Day 1. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting Baseline value from the specified time point value.</description>

            <description>Participants were administered placebo via intravenous (IV) route every 4 weeks (Weeks 0, 4, 8 and 12) in addition to open-label background therapy of fluticasone propionate/ salmeterol (FP/Sal) 500/50 micrograms (mcg) twice daily. After 2 weeks, the background therapy was switched to FP 500 mcg for 2 weeks and the dose of FP was reduced by approximately 50 percent at every 2 weeks until complete FP discontinuation. Three Follow-up visits were performed after the End of Treatment Period (ETP) Visit (Weeks 20, 24, and 28) for safety assessments. Participants received salbutamol/albuterol to use as needed for asthma symptom relief.</description>

        <description>Blood samples were collected at given time points to assess hematology parameters including basophil, eosinophils, leukocytes, lymphocytes, leutrophils, monocytes, and platelets . Baseline is defined as the most recent recorded value before dosing on Day 1. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting Baseline value from the specified time point value.</description>

            <description>Participants were administered placebo via intravenous (IV) route every 4 weeks (Weeks 0, 4, 8 and 12) in addition to open-label background therapy of fluticasone propionate/ salmeterol (FP/Sal) 500/50 micrograms (mcg) twice daily. After 2 weeks, the background therapy was switched to FP 500 mcg for 2 weeks and the dose of FP was reduced by approximately 50 percent at every 2 weeks until complete FP discontinuation. Three Follow-up visits were performed after the End of Treatment Period (ETP) Visit (Weeks 20, 24, and 28) for safety assessments. Participants received salbutamol/albuterol to use as needed for asthma symptom relief.</description>

            <description>Participants were administered placebo via intravenous (IV) route every 4 weeks (Weeks 0, 4, 8 and 12) in addition to open-label background therapy of fluticasone propionate/ salmeterol (FP/Sal) 500/50 micrograms (mcg) twice daily. After 2 weeks, the background therapy was switched to FP 500 mcg for 2 weeks and the dose of FP was reduced by approximately 50 percent at every 2 weeks until complete FP discontinuation. Three Follow-up visits were performed after the End of Treatment Period (ETP) Visit (Weeks 20, 24, and 28) for safety assessments. Participants received salbutamol/albuterol to use as needed for asthma symptom relief.</description>

            <description>Participants were administered placebo via intravenous (IV) route every 4 weeks (Weeks 0, 4, 8 and 12) in addition to open-label background therapy of fluticasone propionate/ salmeterol (FP/Sal) 500/50 micrograms (mcg) twice daily. After 2 weeks, the background therapy was switched to FP 500 mcg for 2 weeks and the dose of FP was reduced by approximately 50 percent at every 2 weeks until complete FP discontinuation. Three Follow-up visits were performed after the End of Treatment Period (ETP) Visit (Weeks 20, 24, and 28) for safety assessments. Participants received salbutamol/albuterol to use as needed for asthma symptom relief.</description>

After 2 weeks, the background therapy was switched to FP 500 mcg for 2 weeks and the dose of FP was reduced by approximately 50 percent at every 2 weeks until complete FP discontinuation. Three Follow-up visits were performed after the End of Treatment Period (ETP) Visit (Weeks 20, 24, and 28) for safety assessments. Participants received salbutamol/albuterol to use as needed for asthma symptom relief.</description>

            <description>Participants were administered placebo via intravenous (IV) route every 4 weeks (Weeks 0, 4, 8 and 12) in addition to open-label background therapy of fluticasone propionate/ salmeterol (FP/Sal) 500/50 micrograms (mcg) twice daily. After 2 weeks, the background therapy was switched to FP 500 mcg for 2 weeks and the dose of FP was reduced by approximately 50 percent at every 2 weeks until complete FP discontinuation. Three Follow-up visits were performed after the End of Treatment Period (ETP) Visit (Weeks 20, 24, and 28) for safety assessments. Participants received salbutamol/albuterol to use as needed for asthma symptom relief.</description>

            <description>Participants were administered placebo via intravenous (IV) route every 4 weeks (Weeks 0, 4, 8 and 12) in addition to open-label background therapy of fluticasone propionate/ salmeterol (FP/Sal) 500/50 micrograms (mcg) twice daily. After 2 weeks, the background therapy was switched to FP 500 mcg for 2 weeks and the dose of FP was reduced by approximately 50 percent at every 2 weeks until complete FP discontinuation. Three Follow-up visits were performed after the End of Treatment Period (ETP) Visit (Weeks 20, 24, and 28) for safety assessments. Participants received salbutamol/albuterol to use as needed for asthma symptom relief.</description>

After 2 weeks, the background therapy was switched to FP 500 mcg for 2 weeks and the dose of FP was reduced by approximately 50 percent at every 2 weeks until complete FP discontinuation. Three Follow-up visits were performed after the End of Treatment Period (ETP) Visit (Weeks 20, 24, and 28) for safety assessments. Participants received salbutamol/albuterol to use as needed for asthma symptom relief.</description>

            <description>Participants were administered placebo via intravenous (IV) route every 4 weeks (Weeks 0, 4, 8 and 12) in addition to open-label background therapy of fluticasone propionate/ salmeterol (FP/Sal) 500/50 micrograms (mcg) twice daily. After 2 weeks, the background therapy was switched to FP 500 mcg for 2 weeks and the dose of FP was reduced by approximately 50 percent at every 2 weeks until complete FP discontinuation. Three Follow-up visits were performed after the End of Treatment Period (ETP) Visit (Weeks 20, 24, and 28) for safety assessments. Participants received salbutamol/albuterol to use as needed for asthma symptom relief.</description>

        <population>PK Population consists of all randomized participants who received at least one dose of study medication, and for whom at least one pharmacokinetic sample was obtained, analyzed and was measurable.

            <description>Participants were administered 10 milligram/kilogram (mg/kg) GSK3772847 via IV route every 4 weeks (Weeks 0, 4, 8 and 12) in addition to open-label background therapy of FP/Sal 500/50 mcg twice daily. After 2 weeks, the background therapy was switched to FP 500 mcg for 2 weeks and the dose of FP was reduced by approximately 50 percent at every 2 weeks until complete FP discontinuation. Three Follow-up visits were performed after the ETP Visit (Weeks 20, 24, and 28) for safety assessments. Participants received salbutamol/albuterol to use as needed for asthma symptom relief.</description>

        <description>Blood samples were collected at given time points to measure free soluble ST2 concentration. Baseline is defined as the latest available assessment prior to first dose (Day 1). Analysis was performed using mixed model repeated measures. Percent change from Baseline is calculated as ratio to Baseline minus 1 and multiplied by 100.</description>

            <description>Participants were administered placebo via intravenous (IV) route every 4 weeks (Weeks 0, 4, 8 and 12) in addition to open-label background therapy of fluticasone propionate/ salmeterol (FP/Sal) 500/50 micrograms (mcg) twice daily. After 2 weeks, the background therapy was switched to FP 500 mcg for 2 weeks and the dose of FP was reduced by approximately 50 percent at every 2 weeks until complete FP discontinuation. Three Follow-up visits were performed after the End of Treatment Period (ETP) Visit (Weeks 20, 24, and 28) for safety assessments. Participants received salbutamol/albuterol to use as needed for asthma symptom relief.</description>

          <description>Participants were administered placebo via intravenous (IV) route every 4 weeks (Weeks 0, 4, 8 and 12) in addition to open-label background therapy of fluticasone propionate/ salmeterol (FP/Sal) 500/50 micrograms (mcg) twice daily. After 2 weeks, the background therapy was switched to FP 500 mcg for 2 weeks and the dose of FP was reduced by approximately 50 percent at every 2 weeks until complete FP discontinuation. Three Follow-up visits were performed after the End of Treatment Period (ETP) Visit (Weeks 20, 24, and 28) for safety assessments. Participants received salbutamol/albuterol to use as needed for asthma symptom relief.</description>
