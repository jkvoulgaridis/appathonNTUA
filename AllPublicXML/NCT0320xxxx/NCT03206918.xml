        4. Documented failure to achieve at least partial response (PR) or documented disease
        progression after response to the most recent treatment regimen. Refractory disease is
        defined as treatment failure (stable disease, non-response, progressive disease [PD]) or
        disease progression within 6 months after the most recent prior therapy (Hallek et al,
        2008).

        entry 6. Platelets ≥ 50 x 109/L, independent of growth factor support or transfusion within
        7 days of study entry 7. Creatinine clearance of ≥ 30 ml/min (as estimated by the
        Cockcroft-Gault equation or estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] from the

        are at least 6 months after transplant.

        12. Life expectancy of &gt;4 months 13. Echocardiogram (ECHO) must demonstrate left
        ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≥50%; (AHA, 2016)

          3. Prior corticosteroids given in excess of prednisone 10 mg/day or its equivalent with
             antineoplastic intent within 7 days.

             (1) adequately treated in-situ carcinoma of cervix; (2) localized basal cell or
             squamous cell carcinoma of skin; (3) previous malignancy confined and treated locally
             (surgery or other modality) with curative intent

          7. Currently active clinically significant cardiovascular disease

             degree AV block

          9. Unable to swallow capsules or disease significantly affecting gastrointestinal
             function such as malabsorption syndrome, resection of the stomach or small bowel,
             symptomatic inflammatory bowel disease, or partial or complete bowel obstruction

         10. Active infection including infections requiring oral or intravenous anti-microbials

         11. Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), or active hepatitis B or hepatitis C
             infection (detected positive by polymerase chain reaction [PCR]).

         12. Has received allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation prior to enrollmen

         13. Any life-threatening illness, medical condition or organ system dysfunction which, in
             the investigator's opinion, could compromise the participants's safety, or put the
             study at risk

         14. Requires ongoing treatment with any medication which is a strong cytochrome P450,
             family 3, subfamily A (CYP3A) inhibitor or strong CYP3A inducer

         15. Known or clinically suspected Richter's transformation at the time of study entry

         16. History of stroke or intracranial hemorrhage within 6 months prior to enrollment
