             requirement.

          -  Previous treatment for hemophilia A, defined as at least 150 documented prior exposure
             days to any recombinant and/or plasma-derived FVIII and/or cryoprecipitate products at

             previously documented or identified from screening assessments, must have the
             following results prior to Day 1 Advate dose: cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4)

             Investigator, made the participant unsuitable for enrollment.

          -  Serious active bacterial or viral infection (other than chronic hepatitis or HIV)
             present within 30 days of screening.

          -  Other known coagulation disorder(s) in addition to hemophilia A.

          -  History of hypersensitivity or anaphylaxis associated with any FVIII product.

          -  Known or suspected allergy to mice, hamsters, or any ingredient in Advate.

             administrations. Family history of inhibitors not excluded the participant.

        Medications and Procedures:

        investigational study.

        Other:

          -  Inability to comply with study requirements as assessed by the Investigator.

          -  Other unspecified reasons that, in the opinion of the Investigator or Sponsor, made

        <description>AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug and did not necessarily had a causal relationship with the treatment. TEAE is defined as any AE that begins on or after the single dose of Advate but before the single dose of BIVV001. Serious AE (SAE) was defined as any AE resulting in death, immediate risk of death, inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or a congenital/anomaly/birth defect, or any other medically important event.</description>

          <title>Number of Participants With Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAE) and Treatment Emergent Serious Adverse Event (TESAE) During Advate Treatment Period</title>
          <description>AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug and did not necessarily had a causal relationship with the treatment. TEAE is defined as any AE that begins on or after the single dose of Advate but before the single dose of BIVV001. Serious AE (SAE) was defined as any AE resulting in death, immediate risk of death, inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or a congenital/anomaly/birth defect, or any other medically important event.</description>
