  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of E7389 liposomal formulation (E7389-LF) will be determined
      in the dose escalation part. Safety, pharmacokinetics (PK) and efficacy will be assessed
      using treatment regimen evaluated in dose escalation part in participants with breast cancer
      in the expansion part 1 and in participants with adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC), gastric
      cancer (GC), esophageal cancer (EGC), and small cell lung cancer (SCLC) in the expansion part
      2, 3, 4, and 5.

    <description>ORR is defined as the percentage of participants who have a best overall response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1. For target lesions, CR is defined as the disappearance of all target lesions. For non-target lesions, CR is defined as the disappearance of all non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker level. All lymph nodes must be non-pathological in size (&lt;10 millimeter [mm] short axis). Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have a reduction in the short axis to &lt;10 mm. For target lesions, PR is defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.</description>

    <time_frame>up to approximately 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>PFS is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of the first documentation of disease progression or date of death, whichever occurs first. For target lesions, progressive disease (PD) is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. For non-target lesions, progressive disease is defined as the unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions. The appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression.</description>
