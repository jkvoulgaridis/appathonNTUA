      The objective of this study was to evaluate the safety and therapeutic equivalence of generic
      ingenol mebutate gel, 0.015% to Picato gel, 0.015% by establishing the therapeutic
      comparability of the two active products and the superiority of the two active products over
      the vehicle gel in the treatment of AK on the face and scalp.

    <textblock>
      Picato® (ingenol mebutate) gel is the first and only ingenol mebutate product approved by the
      Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2012 for the topical treatment of AKs on the face and
      scalp (0.015% formulation) and on the trunk and extremities (0.05% formulation). The FDA
      approved regimen for ingenol mebutate gel, 0.015% for the treatment of AKs on the face and
      scalp is once-daily application of one unit dose tube for three consecutive days applied to
      one contiguous skin area of approximately 25 cm2 (e.g., 5 cm x 5 cm).

          -  Subject provided written informed consent.

          -  Subject had a clinical diagnosis of AK at Visit 1/Baseline with at least four, but no
             more than eight visible and discrete non-hyperkeratotic, non-hypertrophic AK lesions,
             each at least 4 mm in diameter, within a contiguous 25 cm2 treatment area (&quot;the
             Treatment Area&quot;) located on the face or scalp.

          -  Subject was willing and able to apply the test article as directed, comply with study
             instructions, and commit to all follow-up visits for the duration of the study.

          -  Subject was in good general health and free of any disease state or physical condition
             that might have impaired evaluation of AK lesions or which, in the investigator's
             opinion, exposed the subject to an unacceptable risk by study participation.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  1. Subject was pregnant, lactating, or was planning to become pregnant during the
             study.

          -  Subject had a location of the selected contiguous 25 cm2 Treatment Area that (a) was
             within 5 cm of an incompletely healed wound or (b) was in an area containing a lesion
             that was previously treated with ingenol mebutate.

          -  Subject had hyperkeratotic, hypertrophic, or large mat-like AKs (e.g., AK &gt;1 cm2 in
             size) within the contiguous 25 cm2 Treatment Area.

          -  Subject had more than eight AKs, independent of size, within the selected contiguous
             25 cm2 Treatment Area

          -  Subject had atopic dermatitis, basal cell carcinoma, eczema, psoriasis, rosacea,
             squamous cell carcinoma, xeroderma pigmentosum, or any other possibly confounding skin
             conditions within the region of the head that contained the selected Treatment Area
             (i.e., face or scalp).

          -  Subject had any skin pathology or condition that, in the investigator's opinion, could
             have interfered with the evaluation of the test article or required the use of
             interfering topical, systemic, or surgical therapy.

          -  Subject was immunosuppressed (e.g., human immunodeficiency virus, systemic malignancy,
             graft host disease, etc.).

          -  Subject experienced an unsuccessful outcome from previous ingenol mebutate therapy (an
             unsuccessful outcome was defined as after a reasonable therapeutic trial with no
             compliance issues and the topical drug did not work).

             Treatment Area within one day prior to entry into the study.

               -  Interferon/interferon inducers, cytotoxic drugs, immuno-modulators, or
                  immunosuppressive therapies within one month;

          -  Subject was previously enrolled in the same study.
