      The AELIX-002 study aims to evaluate the safety and the immunogenicity of an heterologous
      prime-boost regimen with DNA.HTI, MVA.HTI and ChAdOx1.HTI in early diagnosed and treated
      HIV-1 positive individuals, males and females,18-60 years of age.

    <textblock>
      AELIX Therapeutics in collaboration with IrsiCaixa has developed a novel immunogen, termed
      HTI which was designed as an immunogen for T cells to be used as a a therapeutic HIV vaccine
      that could help HIV infected individuals to control viral replication in the absence of
      antiretroviral treatment. HTI is a chemically synthesized chimeric protein consisting of 16
      continuous segments of HIV-1 each between 11 and 78 amino acids in length and encoding
      critical targets of viral proteins Gag (45%), Pol (44%), Vif (8%) and Nef (3%). The function
      of the immunogen HTI is the induction of an immune response by HIV-1-specific T cells
      directed against the regions included in the insert HTI, which can control HIV-1 effectively.
      The HTI immunogen is administered through an heterologous prime-boost vaccination that
      includes three components, a DNA vaccine prime (DNA.HTI), a viral vaccine boost (MVA.HTI and
      ChAdOx1.HTI).

      The AELIX-002 Phase I study will evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of an heterologous
      regime with DNA.HTI, MVA.HTI and ChAdOx1.HTI in HIV-1 positive patients on suppressive
      antiretroviral treatment who started Combination Antiretroviral Therapy (cART) within first 6
      months of confirmed HIV-1 acquisition. In Phase A, patients will be randomized to receive
      active vaccine or placebo in a double blinded fashion. There will be a sentinel group of
      three patients; two will receive active vaccine and one will receive placebo (0.9% normal
      saline). During the sentinel phase of the study only one patient will be enrolled per day.
      Two weeks later and in the absence of any related SAE or ≥ Grade 3 adverse event lasting &gt;72h
      after vaccination in any of the 3 sentinel individuals, six of the remaining cohort will be
      enrolled (in blocks of 3 patients per day) and the final six patients one week later, also in
      blocks of 3 patients per day. On each vaccination day, 2 patients will receive active IMP and
      1 will receive placebo (2:1).

      After the first 15 participants (3 sentinel and 12 non-sentinel) have reached week 22 visit
      and a favourable report from the Safety Monitoring Committee has been released, transition to
      Phase B will be performed to further include 30 participants (Group 3). Participants will be
      recruited sequentially and without following blocks of pre-defined number of vaccinees and
      placebos per immunization day.

      At week 32, all participants will be invited to participate in an extension sub-study
      (Roll-over Phase) to assess long-term safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of DNA.HTI and
      MVA.HTI administrations until start of Phase C. No interventions are envisioned during this
      extension Roll-over Phase.

      After a favourable SMC report, transition to Phase C will be allowed. During Roll-over Phase
      participants in Phase A/B will be offered to participate in Phase C. Participants who
      received active treatment (DDDMM) in Phase A/B will continue to receive active treatment
      (CCM) in Phase C, while participants who received placebo in Phase A/B will continue to
      receive placebo (PPP). Treatment allocation will remain blind. Eight weeks after the third
      MVA.HTI/placebo administration, all participants will undergo an Analytical Treatment
      Interruption (ATI) of up to 24 weeks of duration. At visit Phase C week 56 (end-of-ATI
      visit), or before according to pre-specified criteria, cART will be resumed, and participants
      will be followed during a safety period of 12 weeks.
