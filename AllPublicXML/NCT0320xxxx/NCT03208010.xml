      The purpose of this study is to test a culturally tailored lifestyle intervention designed to
      prevent, or delay onset of, T2DM in Mexican Americans with prediabetes. Half the participants
      take part in a lifestyle program that emphasizes preparing and eating healthy
      Mexican-American foods and increasing physical activity and the other half take part in an
      &quot;enhanced&quot; usual care control group.

      The main purpose of this study is to test a culturally tailored lifestyle intervention that
      incorporates motivational interviewing and is designed to prevent, or delay onset of, T2DM in
      Mexican Americans with prediabetes. Groups of participants are randomly assigned to: a) an
      experimental group that receives a lifestyle program (12 2-hour weekly educational group
      sessions) that emphasizes preparing and eating healthy Mexican-American foods and increasing
      physical activity, followed by 14 bi-weekly support group sessions to problem solve remaining
      barriers to adopting recommended behaviors and 3 booster sessions to enhance maintenance of
      behavioral changes; OR b) an &quot;enhanced&quot; usual care control group that receives lab results
      with individualized guidance and referrals. A secondary goal of the study is to examine the
      influence of genetic variation at selected candidate genes for glucose regulation on response
      to the lifestyle intervention.

      The specific aims of the study are to:

        1. Test a culturally tailored lifestyle intervention that incorporates motivational
           interviewing and is designed to prevent, or delay onset of, T2DM in Mexican Americans
           with prediabetes. Groups of participants are randomly assigned to: a) an experimental
           group that receives a lifestyle program (12 2-hour weekly educational group sessions)
           that emphasizes preparing and eating healthy Mexican-American foods and increasing
           physical activity, followed by 14 bi-weekly support group sessions to problem solve
           remaining barriers to adopting recommended behaviors and 3 booster sessions to enhance
           maintenance of behavioral changes; OR b) an &quot;enhanced&quot; usual care control group that
           receives lab results with individualized guidance and referrals.

           H1: The experimental group, compared to the control group, will have better health
           outcomes at 3, 6, 12, 24, and 36 months post baseline: 2-hour OGTT, A1C, FBG, lipids,
           blood pressure, health behaviors (physical activity, dietary intake), health beliefs:
           barriers, and anthropometrics (BMI [primary outcome], waist circumference). Other
           baseline measures — demographics and acculturation — characterize the population and
           correct for any baseline imbalances between groups.

        2. Prior to testing the intervention, we conduct focus groups in Starr County with
           participants of our previous DSME studies, physicians from both sides of the border,
           local health officials, and key authority figures (Catholic priests, county officials)
           to fine-tune intervention aspects in the context of diabetes prevention.

        3. Exploratory Aim: Examine the influence of genetic variation at selected candidate genes
           for glucose regulation on response to the lifestyle intervention.

      The study addresses THE major public health problem of U.S.-Mexico border communities.

    <intervention_model_description>The study involves an examination of the effectiveness of a culturally tailored diabetes prevention intervention using a randomized, repeated measures, pretest/post-test control group design. Groups are randomly assigned to: 1) the diabetes prevention intervention; or 2) an &quot;enhanced&quot; usual care control group. Outcome measurements are made at 3, 6, 12, 24, and 36 months post entry into the study to examine changes over time in key diabetes and health indicators.</intervention_model_description>

    <measure>Changes from baseline to 12 months in number/amount of times foods were eaten during the previous month using the questionnaire entitled, Food Frequency Questionnaire for Starr County Health Studies (see McPherson et al., Ann Epidemiol, 1995).</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Food Frequency Questionnaire for Starr County Studies lists 106 specific food items. The participants indicate the frequency a specific food item, including cultural foods, was eaten during the past month, as well as the portion size. For example, for the item &quot;Cheetos,&quot; the respondent answers &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; regarding whether the item was eaten during the past month. If &quot;yes,&quot; then the individual is asked how many times and then asked to estimate portion size using food models available during the administration of the questionnaire. Special software enables converting frequency data to raw intake as well as nutrient densities for analysis. Macro- and micro-nutrients that will be quantified are: total caloric intake, protein, fat, saturated fat, mono-unsaturated fat, poly-unsaturated fat, cholesterol, carbohydrate intake, vitamins A, and E, carotene, calcium, and iron.</description>

    <description>The Saturated Fat/Cholesterol Avoidance Scale is a brief 7-item scale that collects information on intake and use of saturated fat in the diet during the previous month. A major emphasis in the diet instruction is how to reduce lard when preparing Mexican-American recipes. Questions on the Scale are specific to Mexican-American foods, e.g., &quot;When you eat refried beans, what type of fat are they made with?&quot; The Scale is a brief 7-item scale and item responses range from 1 to 4, representing never to always. Higher scores reflect higher intake of high-fat foods.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline in depression measured with the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) at 3 months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) is a brief, 9-item instrument to screen for depression. It employs a 0 to 3 scale: not at all, several days, more than half the days, and nearly every day. A composite score of 5-9 indicates mild depression; 10-14 moderate depression; 15-19 moderately severe depression; and 20-17 severe depression.</description>
