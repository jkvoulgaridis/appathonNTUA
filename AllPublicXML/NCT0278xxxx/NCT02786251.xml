  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The recent discovery of functional brown adipose tissue (BAT) in humans has led to a paradigm
      shift in adipose tissue biology; it is now believed that adipocytes may play a significant
      role in regulating substrate metabolism. Given that the resurgence in the interest in human
      BAT is still in its infancy, a number of fundamental questions pertaining to the role of BAT
      in human physiology remain unanswered. One area of particular importance, but poorly
      understood, is the potential effect of BAT on triglyceride (TG) metabolism. Data from a
      series of studies have found that BAT is inversely associated with adiposity, high blood
      lipids, and fatty liver in people. However, the role of BAT in the regulation of TG
      metabolism in people is not known. The overall goal of this study is to determine the
      physiological importance of the human BAT in TG metabolism. To this end, we are planning to
      study overweight/obese women with high amounts of BAT (BAT+, n=14) and with no/minimal BAT
      (BAT−, n=14) both under thermoneutrality and mild cold exposure (~2 weeks apart). The
      investigators hypothesize that BAT+ participants will demonstrate greater plasma very
      low-density lipoprotein triglycerides (VLDL-TG) clearance rate compared to BAT− participants,
      and higher expression of genes involved in lipid metabolism only in BAT (but not muscle and
      white adipose tissue). Infusion of stable isotope tracers and metabolic modeling techniques
      will be used to assess VLDL-TG kinetics. Positron emission tomography computed tomography
      will be used for the identification and quantification of BAT. Supraclavicular BAT, abdominal
      white adipose tissue, and skeletal muscle tissue biopsies during cold exposure and
      thermoneutral conditions in conjunction with molecular biology techniques will used to
      measure expression of genes involved in lipid metabolism.
