      The objective of this Phase II study is to assess the efficacy and safety of nintedanib alone
      or in combination with capecitabine for patients with refractory metastatic colorectal cancer
      (mCRC) after failure of at least 2 lines of standard treatment

             safety of the trial drug, such as neurologic, psychiatric, infectious disease or
             active ulcers (gastro-intestinal tract, skin) or laboratory abnormality that may
             increase the risk associated with trial participation or trial drug administration,

             into the trial

          -  Major injuries and/or surgery or bone fracture within 4 weeks of trial inclusion
             (signing Informed Consent), or planned surgical procedures during the trial period

             central venous catheter thrombosis and peripheral deep vein thrombosis). Known
             inherited predisposition to bleeding or to thrombosis

          -  Bleeding or thrombotic disorders requiring anticoagulant therapy such as warfarin, or
             similar agents requiring therapeuticInternational normalized ratio (INR) monitoring

             study drug
