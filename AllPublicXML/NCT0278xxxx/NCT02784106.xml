             be excluded and are not required to be tested

          -  Participants with current household contacts with active TB will also be excluded

          -  Indeterminate QuantiFERON-TB or T-SPOT tests may be repeated once, and will be

             the skin (no more than 3 lesions requiring treatment in lifetime) or carcinoma in

             process or any other clinically significant abnormality on Screening chest X-ray (CXR)
             taken within 4 weeks of the first dose, per Investigator opinion. If a CXR has been
             taken within the previous 3 months and results are available and normal, the CXR does
             not need to be carried out

        <description>Disease Activity Score (DAS) based on a 28 joint count hsCRP consisted of composite numerical score of following variables: tender joint count (TJC28), swollen joint count (SJC28), hsCRP (mg/mL), and participant's global assessment of disease activity. DAS28-hsCRP was calculated using following formula: DAS28-hsCRP equals to (=) 0.56*square root (sqrt) (TJC28) plus (+) 0.28*sqrt (SJC28)+ 0.014* participant's global assessment of disease activity + 0.36*natural log(hsCRP+1) +0.96. Scores ranged 1.0-9.4, where lower scores indicated less disease activity.</description>

        <description>DAS28 consisted of composite score of following variables: TJC28, SJC28, hsCRP (mg/mL), and participant's global assessment of disease activity. DAS28-hsCRP was calculated using following formula: DAS28-hsCRP =0.56* sqrt (TJC28) + 0.28*sqrt (SJC28)+ 0.014* participant's global assessment of disease activity + 0.36*natural log(hsCRP+1) +0.96. Scores ranged 1.0-9.4, where lower scores indicated less disease activity. Proportion of participants with DAS28-hsCRP value &lt;2.6 were reported.</description>

A serious adverse event (SAE) was an AE that resulted in any of the following outcomes: death; life threatening; persistent/significant disability/incapacity; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; congenital anomaly/birth defect or was otherwise considered medically important. Treatment-emergent are events between first dose of study drug that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pre-treatment state.
