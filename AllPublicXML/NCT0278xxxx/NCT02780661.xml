  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This method development study will be a two treatment arm, randomized, cross over study in a
      population with edentulous upper arch restored with a maxillary complete denture. The lower
      may be a partial or full edentulous mandibular arch that may be restored with a stable
      complete, partial or implant supported denture.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, 2 treatment periods, examiner-blind, randomized, 7 day crossover
      study in adult participants with a complete maxillary denture. This is a method development
      study to investigate the changes in the level of denture plaque, microbial counts, microbial
      composition and stain on the maxillary dentures after daily denture cleanser use versus
      dentures that are cleaned weekly.

    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 0 pre-treatment), Day 7 (post-treatment)</time_frame>
    <description>Microbial count samples were collected using a paper disc (disc sampling). A pre-sterilised 10-millimeter (mm) filter paper disc was lightly pressed against the selected quadrant of maxillary denture, leaving enough space to place two discs without overlap. The selected areas were lateral to the midline and corresponding to the palatal rugae. Microbiological sampling was carried out from one standardised site on the fitting surface of the denture for standard culture. The discs were left for 20 secs prior to aseptic removal using sterile tweezers, and were serially diluted and plated into appropriate agar plates and incubated aerobically. Pre-treatment samples were taken from the left rough and left smooth denture surface. Post-treatment samples were taken from the right rough and right smooth denture surface at Day 7.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Aerobic Bacteria Microbial Count on Day 7</title>
        <description>Microbial count samples were collected using a paper disc (disc sampling). A pre-sterilised 10-millimeter (mm) filter paper disc was lightly pressed against the selected quadrant of maxillary denture, leaving enough space to place two discs without overlap. The selected areas were lateral to the midline and corresponding to the palatal rugae. Microbiological sampling was carried out from one standardised site on the fitting surface of the denture for standard culture. The discs were left for 20 secs prior to aseptic removal using sterile tweezers, and were serially diluted and plated into appropriate agar plates and incubated aerobically. Pre-treatment samples were taken from the left rough and left smooth denture surface. Post-treatment samples were taken from the right rough and right smooth denture surface at Day 7.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline (Day 0 pre-treatment), Day 7 (post-treatment)</time_frame>
        <population>Analysis for this outcome was performed on intent-to-treat (ITT) population which included all participants who were randomized, received at least one dose of the study treatment and provided at least one post-baseline assessment of microbial count from disc sampling.</population>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Aerobic Bacteria Microbial Count on Day 3</title>
        <description>Microbial count samples were collected using a paper disc (disc sampling). A pre-sterilised 10 mm filter paper disc was lightly pressed against the selected quadrant of maxillary denture, leaving enough space to place two discs without overlap. The selected areas were lateral to the midline and corresponding to the palatal rugae. Microbiological sampling was carried out from one standardised site on the fitting surface of the denture for standard culture. The discs were left for 20 secs prior to aseptic removal using sterile tweezers, and were serially diluted and plated into appropriate agar plates and incubated aerobically. Pre-treatment samples were taken from the left rough and left smooth denture surface. Post-treatment samples were taken from the right rough and right smooth denture surface at Day 3.</description>
