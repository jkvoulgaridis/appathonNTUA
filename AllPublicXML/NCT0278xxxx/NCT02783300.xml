  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study drug, GSK3326595, is an inhibitor of protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5)
      that potently inhibits tumor growth in vitro and in vivo in animal models. This first time in
      human (FTIH), open-label, dose escalation study will assess the safety, pharmacokinetics
      (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), and preliminary clinical activity of GSK3326595 in participants
      with advanced or recurrent solid tumors, as well as clinical activity in participants with a
      subset of solid tumors and NHL. This is an open-label, repeat-dose, multicenter, three-part
      study to establish the maximally tolerated dose (MTD)/ recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) based
      on safety and tolerability and preliminary clinical efficacy of orally-administered
      GSK3326595. Part 1 is a dose-escalation phase to identify the MTD/RP2D based on the safety,
      PK, and PD profiles observed after oral administration of GSK3326595 and to preliminarily
      identify whether or not there is an effect of fed versus fasted state and of tablet versus
      capsule formulation on the PK of GSK3326595. This Part will be conducted in adult
      participants with relapsed and/or refractory solid tumors. It is estimated that up to 66
      participants will be enrolled into the dose escalation cohort of the study, including up to
      42 participants to identify the MTD and approximately 12 participants in the
      PK/PD/metabolite/biomarker expansion cohort(s) and approximately 12 participants in the food
      effect and relative bioavailability sub-study. Disease-specific expansion cohorts (Part 2)
      are planned to further explore clinical activity of GSK3326595 in participants with selected
      solid tumors and NHL. It is estimated that up to 316 participants will be enrolled in Part 2.
      Part 3 will be a dose determination study to evaluate the safety, PK/PD profile, and clinical
      activity of orally-administered GSK3326595 in combination with intravenous pembrolizumab.
      Overall, approximately 30 participants will be enrolled in Part 3. The duration of study will
      depend on recruitment rates and the timing of participant's duration on study (withdrawal
      rates due to toxicity or progression), with an approximate duration of 6 years.

             one of the methods of contraception for the duration specified in protocol.

          -  A female participant is eligible to participate if she is not pregnant (as confirmed
             by a negative serum human chorionic gonadotrophin [hCG] test), not nursing, and at
             least one of the following conditions apply: Reproductive potential: participants must

          -  ii) Postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea with an appropriate
             clinical profile or females over 60 years of age. Females on hormone replacement
             therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of
             the highly effective contraception methods if they wish to continue their HRT during
             the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of
             post-menopausal status prior to study enrollment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Malignancy attributed to prior solid organ transplant.

          -  Leptomeningeal disease, spinal cord compression, or brain metastases that require
             immediate central nervous system (CNS)-specific treatment in the opinion of the

          -  Recent prior therapy, defined as

          -  1. Any non-monoclonal anti-cancer therapy within 14 days or 5 half-lives, whichever is
             longer, prior to the first dose of GSK3326595. Any nitrosoureas or mitomycin C within
             42 days prior to the first dose of GSK3326595. Prior therapy with biologic agents
             (including monoclonal antibodies) is permitted so long as 28 days have elapsed since
             therapy and all therapy-related AEs have resolved to =&lt;Grade 1, note that participants
             with immunotherapy-related endocrinopathies, currently managed with replacement
             therapy, will be allowed on study.

          -  2. Any radiotherapy within 14 days or major surgery within 28 days prior to the first
             dose of GSK3326595. For participants in the GBM cohort, participants must have
             completed radiation therapy at least 28 days prior to the first dose of GSK3326595.

          -  3. Anti-androgen therapies for prostate cancer, such as bicalutamide, must be stopped
             4 weeks prior to enrollment. Second-line hormone therapies such as enzalutamide or
             abiraterone should be stopped 2 weeks prior to enrolment. Participants with prostate
             cancer should remain on luteinizing hormone releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists or
             antagonists. Participants with prostate cancer may also remain on low-dose prednisone
             or prednisolone (up to 10 mg/day) and still be eligible for this study.

          -  Part 3 only: History of any of the following: Recent history (within the past 2 years)
             of autoimmune disease or syndrome that required systemic treatment; a diagnosis of
             immunodeficiency or administration of systemic steroids (&gt;=10 mg oral prednisone or
             equivalent) or other immunosuppressive agents within 7 days prior to randomization;
             Receipt of any live vaccine within 30 days prior randomization; Prior
             allogeneic/autologous bone marrow or solid organ transplantation; Current pneumonitis
             or history of non-infectious pneumonitis that required steroids or other
             immunosuppressive agents; Recent history of allergen desensitization therapy within 4
             weeks of randomization; History of severe hypersensitivity to monoclonal antibodies.

          -  History of a second malignancy, excluding non-melanoma skin cell cancer within the
             last three years. Participants with second malignancies that were indolent, in situ or
             definitively treated may be enrolled even if less than three years have elapsed since
             treatment. Consult the GSK Medical Monitor if second malignancies meet the
             requirements specified above.

          -  Current use of a prohibited medication or planned use of any forbidden medications
             during treatment with GSK3326595.

          -  Evidence of severe or uncontrolled systemic diseases (e.g., unstable or uncompensated
             respiratory, hepatic, renal, cardiac disease, or clinically significant bleeding
             episodes). Any serious and/or unstable pre-existing medical (aside from malignancy),
             psychiatric disorder, or other conditions that could interfere with participant's
             safety, obtaining informed consent or compliance to the study procedures, in the
             opinion of the Investigator.

          -  Any clinically significant gastrointestinal (GI) abnormalities that may alter
             absorption such as malabsorption syndrome or major resection of the stomach and/or
             bowels.

          -  History of known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection or positive HIV test
             result at screening.

          -  Presence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) or positive hepatitis C antibody test
             result at screening or within 3 months prior to first dose of study treatment.
             Participants with positive Hepatitis C antibody due to prior resolved disease can be
             enrolled only if a confirmatory negative Hepatitis C Ribonucleic acid (RNA) polymerase
             chain reaction (PCR) is obtained.

          -  Any of the following cardiac abnormalities: 1. Recent history (within 6 months of
             first dose of study drug) of acute coronary syndromes (including myocardial infarction

             pacemaker, 3. Baseline QTcF &gt;=450 millisecond, 4. Uncontrolled arrhythmias.
             Participants with rate-controlled atrial fibrillation for &gt;1 month prior to first dose
             of study drugs may be eligible. 5. Class II, III or IV heart failure as defined by the
             New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional classification system.

          -  History of sensitivity to any of the study medications, or components thereof or a
             history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator or Medical
