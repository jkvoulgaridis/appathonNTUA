  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of a medication called suvorexant
      in reducing anxiety, improving sleep, and reducing cocaine cravings or cocaine use.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Preclinical research has established important functions for the orexin system in mediating
      arousal/sleep, stress, and cue-induced reinstatement of drug taking (e.g., relapse). The role
      of stress/anxiety and drug cue reactivity in human drug relapse is well established, but to
      date, the role of the orexin system in modulating these phenomena has not been examined in
      humans with substance use disorders (e.g., cocaine). The goal of the present first-in-human
      study will be to examine the effects of an orexin antagonist (suvorexant) on interactions
      among stress/anxiety, sleep, and drug-cue reactivity. The study will utilize a battery of
      highly sensitive, drug-specific, laboratory measures of drug cue reactivity (a relapse risk
      model), and well-established metrics of stress/anxiety and sleep. The hypothesis is that
      antagonism of the orexin system will attenuate the link between (1) stress/anxiety and drug
      cue reactivity, and (2) sleep and drug cue reactivity. These results will elucidate a unique
      biochemical mechanism for understanding relapse, and provide a potential medication target
      for relapse prevention.

    <measure>Stress/Anxiety as Assessed by Blood Pressure During the Cold Pressor Test (CPT) - Systolic Blood Pressure</measure>
    <time_frame>day 0, day 7, and day 14</time_frame>
    <description>Cold Pressor Test (CPT) reliably increases activity of the sympathetic nervous system and the HPA axis, and produces reliable increases in heart rate and cortisol. Subjects are requested to submerge the dominant arm up to the wrist or elbow in ice-cold water (0° to 4° C) for as long as possible with a maximum of 90 seconds. The procedure activates afferent nerves and elicits a CNS stress response. This procedure produces no lasting biological or psychological distress beyond the acute challenge period, and physiological effects return to baseline within 90 min. In fact, the CPT is used to study pain in children, and is considered a noninvasive, exempt educational experimental activity by the IRB of the University of Texas-Austin. It has been used extensively in cardiology, endocrinology, psychiatry, and psychology since 1940 as a challenge to the peripheral and central stress axis</description>

        <description>The attention bias (AB) task is a saccade-based eye-tracking measurement, developed by the PI to assess attentional bias to drug cues. AB measures utilizing eye movements have produced moderate to robust effects for a broad class abused substances, including cocaine. The score ranges from 0 to 1. Higher scores indicate a worse outcome.</description>

        <title>Stress/Anxiety as Assessed by Blood Pressure During the Cold Pressor Test (CPT) - Systolic Blood Pressure</title>
        <description>Cold Pressor Test (CPT) reliably increases activity of the sympathetic nervous system and the HPA axis, and produces reliable increases in heart rate and cortisol. Subjects are requested to submerge the dominant arm up to the wrist or elbow in ice-cold water (0° to 4° C) for as long as possible with a maximum of 90 seconds. The procedure activates afferent nerves and elicits a CNS stress response. This procedure produces no lasting biological or psychological distress beyond the acute challenge period, and physiological effects return to baseline within 90 min. In fact, the CPT is used to study pain in children, and is considered a noninvasive, exempt educational experimental activity by the IRB of the University of Texas-Austin. It has been used extensively in cardiology, endocrinology, psychiatry, and psychology since 1940 as a challenge to the peripheral and central stress axis</description>

          <title>Stress/Anxiety as Assessed by Blood Pressure During the Cold Pressor Test (CPT) - Systolic Blood Pressure</title>
          <description>Cold Pressor Test (CPT) reliably increases activity of the sympathetic nervous system and the HPA axis, and produces reliable increases in heart rate and cortisol. Subjects are requested to submerge the dominant arm up to the wrist or elbow in ice-cold water (0° to 4° C) for as long as possible with a maximum of 90 seconds. The procedure activates afferent nerves and elicits a CNS stress response. This procedure produces no lasting biological or psychological distress beyond the acute challenge period, and physiological effects return to baseline within 90 min. In fact, the CPT is used to study pain in children, and is considered a noninvasive, exempt educational experimental activity by the IRB of the University of Texas-Austin. It has been used extensively in cardiology, endocrinology, psychiatry, and psychology since 1940 as a challenge to the peripheral and central stress axis</description>
