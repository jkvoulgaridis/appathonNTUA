      1. Examine the use of low level therapeutic laser (LLLT) combined with physical therapy for
           improvements in pain, range of motion, and function in individuals with chronic pain
           from musculoskeletal conditions.

        2. Compare changes in pain, mobility, and ability to return to home/work/recreational
           activities between treatments with standard physical therapy plus LLLT or the standard
           physical therapy program alone.

    <textblock>
      Potential subjects will be identified by their physician referral to the pain program and
      after initial evaluation by the medical personnel and physical therapy for appropriate
      inclusion in the pain program. For individuals who meet entry parameters for the pain
      program, this project will be discussed by their physical therapist for consideration of
      voluntary participation. If participants are willing to participate, appropriate consent and
      HIPPA permissions will be obtained.

      After consent, the patient will be randomized to one of the two treatment cohorts which
      consists of utilizing either laser or sham laser before and during pain program
      participation. The principle investigator will be blinded to the treatment allocation group.
      The treating clinician will be aware of their treatment allocation assignment for laser
      application. Each treatment cohort will be completed as assigned. Physical therapy treatment
      in addition to the study intervention will be selected by the treating clinician based on
      participant's specific needs as standard of care would dictate. Outcome measures will be
      collected as described below.

      Testing Schedule:

      The assigned study intervention (LLLT or Sham) will be administered on each of the clinical
      visits for phase 1 and 2 of the study. Outcome measures will be completed on the following
      schedule.

      Phase 1: Conducted during the period between acceptance to pain program and start the of the
      pain program (4 weeks). Baseline testing will be completed at the time of initial evaluation
      and enrollment to the study.

      Phase 1 final testing (4 weeks) will be on the first clinic visit of the formal pain program.
      Phase 2: This phase is the 4-week formal pain program (2 visits/week x 4 weeks, total 8
      visits). Final testing (8 weeks) will be on the final visit of the formal pain program.

      Measurements:

      A. Numerical pain rating scale (NPRS): perceived pain on scale of 0-10 (0=no pain, 10=
      extremely severe pain). Pain during the previous 24-hour period (best, worst, current) will
      be measured at baseline, 4 weeks, and 8 weeks. The average of 3 scores will be used.

      B. Region specific functional outcome measure: A valid and reliable outcome tool of broad
      based physical function based on the body region of interest will be completed. Measured at
      baseline, 4 weeks, and 8 weeks.

      C. Questionnaires of fear avoidance (FABQ, or TKS) and sleep quality (Pittsburg sleep index)
      will be taken as measures of quality of life and impact. Measures will be taken at baseline,
      4 weeks, and 8 weeks.

      All procedures, measurements, and interventions (exercises) are considered to be standard of
      care for rehabilitation and the subject's needs. The experimental aspect of the study is
      derived from the randomized selection of which laser intervention will be utilized before and
      during program participation.

    <description>The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) is a self-rated questionnaire which assesses sleep quality and disturbances over a 1-month time interval. Nineteen individual items generate seven &quot;component&quot; scores: subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleeping medication, and daytime dysfunction.
The sum of scores for these seven components yields one global score. each scored 0 (no difficulty) to 3 (severe difficulty). The component scores are summed to produce a global score (range 0 to 21). Higher scores indicate worse sleep quality.</description>

    <description>Treatment will be administered 2x/w x 4 weeks as a standalone, then 2 times/week x 4 weeks in conjunction with standard physical therapy and counseling. The clinician will apply 10 minutes of low level laser therapy at a dosage of 0 watts for a total of 0 joules based on body surface area treated. Application will be with light to moderate contact pressure based on patient tolerance (should be no additional discomfort from laser). Area for administration will include 6 minutes of application along spine (C2-S1), and 4 minutes of application either to bilateral upper extremity or bilateral lower extremity based on areas of primary pain complaint. The contact head applicator will be used if soft tissue contact is tolerable. Otherwise, the non-contact head will be utilized.</description>

            <description>Treatment will be administered 2x/w x 4 weeks as a standalone, then 2 times/week x 4 weeks in conjunction with standard physical therapy and counseling. The clinician will apply 10 minutes of low level laser therapy at a dosage of 0 watts for a total of 0 joules based on body surface area treated. Application will be with light to moderate contact pressure based on patient tolerance (should be no additional discomfort from laser).

The contact head applicator will be used if soft tissue contact is tolerable. Otherwise, the non-contact head will be utilized.

        <title>Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index</title>
        <description>The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) is a self-rated questionnaire which assesses sleep quality and disturbances over a 1-month time interval. Nineteen individual items generate seven &quot;component&quot; scores: subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleeping medication, and daytime dysfunction.
The sum of scores for these seven components yields one global score. each scored 0 (no difficulty) to 3 (severe difficulty). The component scores are summed to produce a global score (range 0 to 21). Higher scores indicate worse sleep quality.</description>

          <title>Sham Low Level Laser</title>
          <description>Treatment will be administered 2x/w x 4 weeks as a standalone, then 2 times/week x 4 weeks in conjunction with standard physical therapy and counseling. The clinician will apply 10 minutes of low level laser therapy at a dosage of 0 watts for a total of 0 joules based on body surface area treated. Application will be with light to moderate contact pressure based on patient tolerance (should be no additional discomfort from laser). Area for administration will include 6 minutes of application along spine (C2-S1), and 4 minutes of application either to bilateral upper extremity or bilateral lower extremity based on areas of primary pain complaint. The contact head applicator will be used if soft tissue contact is tolerable. Otherwise, the non-contact head will be utilized.
Sham low level laser: Sham laser will be administered using the same time and contact exposure as delivered for the active group, but without any energy delivered.</description>

          <title>Active Low Level Laser</title>
          <description>Treatment will be administered 2x/w x 4 weeks as a standalone, then 2 times/week x 4 weeks in conjunction with standard physical therapy and counseling. The clinician will apply 10 minutes of low level laser therapy at a dosage of 15-25 watts for a total of 9,000-15,000 joules based on body surface area treated. This equates to standard acceptable dosing of 6-10 j/cm2 over the larger area of treatment. Areas for application and contact will otherwise be consistent with the sham group.</description>
