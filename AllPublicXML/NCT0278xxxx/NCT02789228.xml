      Patients with high-risk solid tumors, those that are refractory to standard up front therapy
      or relapse after completion of therapy, have a very poor prognosis despite attempts to induce
      remission with salvage regimen. Novel therapies are critical for this patient population with
      high-risk cancer.

      The ability of tumors to be recognized and lysed by the immune system offers a unique
      opportunity to aid in tumor eradication by expanding and activating these anti-tumor cells.
      Through this ability to harness sophisticated and specific immunotherapy, residual or
      relapsed disease that is resistant to chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy could be eradicated.
      Prior studies have suggested both safety of expanded specific T cells and efficacy in the
      setting of melanoma, lymphoma or viral eradication. While this therapy has previously been
      limited by the versatility of the tumor to down-regulate antigens and evade a single
      immune-target, the use of multi-antigen specific T cells may permit better and more durable
      anti-tumor immunity. Thus, the investigators propose to infuse these specific multi-antigen
      anti-tumor T lymphocytes into patients with high risk solid tumors. This trial will be
      conducted to demonstrate safety of these cells and generate efficacy and biology data that
      may be important for future studies that may enhance tumor immunotherapy.

      This protocol is designed as a phase I dose-escalation study. In each treatment group (A and
      B), patients will be enrolled to one of the following TAA-CTL dose levels:

      Dose Level One: 1 x 107 cells/m2 Dose Level Two: 2 x 107 cells/m2 Dose Level Three: 4 x 107
      cells/m2 Two to four patients will be enrolled at each dose level until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined at which point to ensure safety a total 8 patients will be treated
      at the MTD. Expansion cohorts of Group B patients with Wilms tumor, neuroblastoma,
      rhabdomyosarcoma, adenocarcinoma and esophageal cancer will be permitted to enroll up to 6
      additional patients in each disease group, to be treated at the MTD. Each patient will
      receive at least one TAA-CTL infusion and may receive a maximum of 8 doses total. Dose
      escalation will occur once at least 2 patients have completed the 45 day follow up period
      following their first TAA-CTL infusion. The first and second doses will be administered 45
      days apart then additional doses will be spaced every 28 days. The expected volume of each
      infusion is 1 to 10 cc.

      Patients will receive cells due to the presence of refractory disease and/or high risk for
      disease relapse and/or residual detectable disease following HSCT or conventional therapy at
      the time of the infusion. Group A and Group B patients will use the dose escalation strategy
      described above. Ideally, patients should not receive other systemic antineoplastic agents
      for at least 45 days after the infusion of TAA- CTL (for purposes of evaluation), although
      such treatment may be added if deemed critical for patient care by the attending physician.

      If patients with measurable or evaluable disease have a response of stable disease or better
      by RECIST criteria (see section 3.2.1) at the day 28 evaluation after dose 2 or subsequent
      evaluations they are eligible to receive up to 6 additional doses of CTLs at 28 day
      intervals. Each subsequent doseis expected to be at the enrollment dose level (i.e. no
      subsequent dose escalation). Following dose 1, if a patient's T cell supply is insufficient
      for subsequent doses at the enrollment dose level, further treatments may be administered at
      a lower dose level at the treating physician's discretion.

Dose Level One: 1 x 107 cells/m2 Dose Level Two: 2 x 107 cells/m2 Dose Level Three: 4 x 107 cells/m2
Patients will receive cells due to the presence of refractory disease and/or high risk for disease relapse and/or residual detectable disease following conventional therapy at the time of the infusion. Ideally, patients should not receive other systemic antineoplastic agents for at least 6 weeks after infusion of TAA CTL (for purposes of evaluation), although such treatment may be added if deemed critical for patient care by the attending physician.</description>

    <description>Pediatric and adult patients who have high-risk solid tumors with known positivity for one or more Tumor Antigen Associated (TAA) (WT1, PRAME and/or survivin) will be eligible to receive Tumor Antigen Associated Cytotoxic T Lymphocytes (TAA CTL). The goal of this cell infusion will be to initiate an immune response against solid tumors that includes multiple antigens and may prevent tumor evasion (through decreased expression of a single antigen).</description>
