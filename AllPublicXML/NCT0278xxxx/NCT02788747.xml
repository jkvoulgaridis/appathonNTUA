      This was a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, multiple-dose study in subjects
      with stable heart failure (HF) with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). After completing the
      Screening period, a total of 71 subjects were randomized, in a 1:1:1 ratio, to receive either
      placebo, 4 mg elamipretide, or 40 mg elamipretide once daily for 28 consecutive days.

      Each treatment group went through 3 distinct periods: Screening, Treatment, and Follow up.

             months duration from the time of the initial diagnosis.

          -  Receiving heart failure (HF) treatment, including, but not limited to, angiotensin
             converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) and/or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB), and an
             evidence-based beta blocker for the treatment of HF. Subjects who cannot tolerate ACEI
             or ARB due to reduced renal function or hypotension are eligible. Subjects may be
             receiving aldosterone antagonists, but this is not a requirement for the study.

          -  HF is considered to be stable in the judgment of the Investigator AND doses of HF
             treatment have been stable for at least 1 month prior to the Screening Visit.

          -  In normal sinus rhythm (electrocardiogram documented) at Screening and Day 1 and no
             history of atrial fibrillation in the past 12 months

          -  No hospitalization related to HF within 1 month prior to the Screening Visit.

          -  Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) ≤ 40% by 2-D echocardiography at Screening.

          -  At least 3 viable segments (hyperenhancement ≤ 25%) by a qualifying delayed
             gadolinium-enhanced cardiac MRI examination at Screening (confirmed by independent
             core lab).

          -  Women of childbearing potential must agree to use 1 of the following methods of birth

                  been surgically sterilized by vasectomy, or barrier method AND either hormonal
                  contraception or an intrauterine device or system.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of any concurrent medical condition which, in the opinion of the Investigator,
             significantly increased the potential risks associated with administration of study
             medication or any other aspect of study participation.

          -  Any contraindication to MRI scanning.

             aortic stenosis.

          -  The presence or anticipated placement of any pacemaker, implantable cardioverter
             defibrillator (ICD), or cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) devices during the
