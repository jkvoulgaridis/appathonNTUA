  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted to characterize the effects of twice daily administration of
      rhPTH(1-84) on the way the body handles rhPTH(1-84) as well as its actions and safety and
      tolerability over the course of 24 hours as compared with the current once daily dosing
      regimen of marketed rhPTH(1-84) (marketed in the United States as Natpara® and in the EU as
      Natpar).

          4. Any disease that might affect calcium metabolism or calcium-phosphate homeostasis
             other than hypoparathyroidism, including but not limited to, active hyperthyroidism;
             poorly controlled insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus or type 2 diabetes mellitus;
             severe and chronic cardiac, liver or renal disease; Cushing's syndrome; neuromuscular
             disease such as rheumatoid arthritis; myeloma; pancreatitis; malnutrition; rickets;
             recent prolonged immobility; active malignancy, bone metastases or a history of
             skeletal malignancies; primary or secondary hyperparathyroidism; a history of
             parathyroid carcinoma; hypopituitarism, acromegaly; or multiple endocrine neoplasia
             types 1 and 2, as determined by the investigator.

        5 . In male and female rats, parathyroid hormone caused an increase in the incidence of
        osteosarcoma (a malignant bone tumor). The occurrence of osteosarcoma was dependent on
        parathyroid hormone dose and treatment duration. This effect was observed at parathyroid
        hormone exposure levels ranging from 3 to 71 times the exposure levels in humans receiving
        a 100 mcg dose of rhPTH(1-84). Therefore, participant who are at increased baseline risk
        for osteosarcoma such as participant with Paget's disease of bone or unexplained elevations
        of alkaline phosphatase, pediatric and young adult participants with open epiphyses,
        participants with hereditary disorders predisposing to osteosarcoma or participant with a
        prior history of external beam or implant radiation therapy involving the skeleton are
        excluded.

        6. Participants who have a known history of hypercalcemia during initiation of treatment
        with PTH, PTH analogues or fragments of PTH.

        7. Participants who have a known history of hypocalcemia following abrupt withdrawal of
        treatment with PTH, PTH analogues or fragments of PTH.

        8. Participant dependent on regular parenteral calcium infusions (example, calcium
        gluconate) to maintain calcium homeostasis within 3 months prior to enrollment, as
        determined by the investigator.

        9. Use of the following medications prior to administration of investigational product
        within: 14 days- thiazide diuretics; 30 days - loop diuretics, lithium, systemic
        corticosteroids (medical judgment is required by the investigator. Primarily high doses of
        systemic corticosteroids [example, prednisone] should be excluded. Stable doses of
        hydrocortisone [example, as treatment for Addison's disease] may be acceptable); 3 months -
        calcitonin, cinacalcet hydrochloride, treatment with rhPTH(1-84) or N-terminal PTH or
        PTH-related peptide fragments or analogs; For females: changes in hormone replacement
        therapy within 3 months are excluded. Stable (&gt;=3 months) hormone replacement therapy is
        acceptable; 6 months - fluoride tablets, oral bisphosphonates, methotrexate, growth
        hormone, digoxin, raloxifene or similar selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs); 12
        months - intravenous bisphosphonates, drug or alcohol abuse, as determined by the
        investigator.

        10. Presence of any clinically significant results from laboratory tests, vital signs
        assessments, or electrocardiograms (ECGs), as judged by the investigator.

        11. Twelve-lead ECG values (average of triplicate readings) demonstrating QTc&gt;450
        millisecond (msec) (males) or &gt;470 msec (females) at the Clinical Screening Visit and/or
        any time points up to and including predose of Day 1 (Period 1).

        12. Any medical condition or prior therapy that, in the opinion of the investigator, would
        make the participant unsuitable for this study.

        13. Positive test result for any of the following viral infections at the Clinical
        Screening Visit: Hepatitis B surface antigen; hepatitis C; human immunodeficiency virus
        (HIV) 14. Known significant bleeding diathesis that could preclude multiple venipunctures
        as determined by the investigator.

        15. Participants who have donated a total of 100 mL to 499 mL of whole blood within 30 days
        prior to dosing, or participants who have donated a total of more than 499 mL of whole
        blood within 56 days prior to dosing.

        16. A positive screen for drugs of abuse at the Clinical Screening Visit, and/or a positive
        screen for drugs of abuse and alcohol at check-in to the CRC at Treatment Period 1.

        for drugs of abuse may be enrolled per the investigator's medical judgment.

        determined by the investigator).

        18. History of any clinically significant surgery or procedure within the past 8 weeks, as
        determined by the investigator.

        significant allergies, as determined by the investigator.

        <description>Baseline-adjusted rhPTH(1-84) concentrations (participant- and period-specific) were calculated by subtracting baseline endogenous PTH from the raw PTH concentrations. The baseline was defined as premorning-dose endogenous rhPTH(1-84) level on Day 1 for each treatment period. Tmax of baseline adjusted rhPTH(1-84) was reported. Here the number of participants analyzed signifies participants who were evaluable for this outcome measure.</description>
