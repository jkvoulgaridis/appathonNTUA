  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During pregnancy, the foetus is therefore chronically exposed to a large number of
      substances. A number of studies have started to emphasize the effects of this antenatal
      exposure on the newborn infant's morphological parameters (weight, crown-rump length, etc.).
      However, in addition to these morphological effects, pesticides may also induce various
      effects on physiological functions, as some pesticides act as inhibitors of neurotransmitters
      involved in many nervous system regulation pathways in man. This is particularly the case for
      organophosphates, which act as acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. A previous study conducted by
      the coordinator of the project presented here demonstrated the presence of high levels of
      this type of pesticide in meconium (1st stool) in neonates born in Picardy. This inhibition
      of the enzyme metabolizing ACh could have an impact on neurophysiological functions mediated
      by this neurotransmitter. Sleep or respiratory control, vital functions of the neonate
      particularly in preterm neonates, could therefore be affected.

      The PhysioMéco project is therefore designed to study the possible links between antenatal
      exposure to pesticides and modifications of respiratory control allowed by peripheral
      chemoreceptor in preterm neonates. Antenatal exposure will be determined by pesticide assays
      in the meconium of neonates in combination with an exposure questionnaire to determine the
      sources of these pesticides. Sleep and respiratory control will be studied in these neonates
      nursed in incubators. Hypoxic test will be used in order to assess respiratory control
      involving the peripheral chemoreceptors.
