      Currently, routine preoperative biliary drainage (PBD) was not recommended. However, PBD is
      still necessary in case of patients with cholangitis or very high level of bilirubin or
      patients who are expected to receive delayed surgery.

      The aim of this clinical trial is to demonstrate non-inferiority of uncovered self-expandable
      metal stent to plastic stent for PBD by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography in
      patients with periampullary cancer undergoing curative intent pancreaticoduodenectomy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Jaundice is one of the most common symptoms in patients with periampullary cancers including
      pancreatic cancer, common bile duct (CBD) cancer, ampulla of Vater (AoV) cancer, and duodenal
      cancer. Traditionally, preoperative biliary drainage (PBD) was routinely performed in these
      cancers because it might favorably influence sepsis, endotoxemia, and intravascular
      coagulation. However, a recent randomized control study reported that routine PBD in patients
      undergoing surgery for cancer of the pancreatic head increases the rate of complications.
      Therefore, routine PBD was not recommended. However, PBD is still necessary in case of
      patients with cholangitis or very high level of bilirubin or patients who are expected to
      receive delayed surgery.

      In these patients with necessity of PBD, a plastic stent (PS) has been used because it is
      good for temporary use with cheap prices. However, it is sometimes occluded before surgery or
      not enough for rapid decompressing jaundice mainly because of its short diameter. In this
      aspect, a self-expandable metal stent (SEMS) has strength compared to PS because it has a
      longer diameter which enables rapid decompression with a fewer events of occlusion. However,
      SEMS is much more expensive than PS and the exact length of stent is more critical.

      Although there are still lack of evidence which compares the results between PS and SEMS,
      National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines recently recommended the use of a
      short SEMS for pancreatic adenocarcinoma patients with cholangitis or fever. However, we
      needed more concrete evidence about this principle.
