  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Temozolomide (TMZ) is the chemotherapy drug approved by the FDA to increase survival in
      glioblastoma (GBM) patients beyond surgical resection and radiation therapy alone. Give its
      activity in astrocytomas, TMZ is commonly used in grade III anaplastic astrocytoma (AA) as
      well. Both grade III AA and grade IV GBM are high grade gliomas (HGG). The short half-life of
      this drug and known oscillations in DNA damage repair make it an ideal candidate for
      chronotherapy.

      Chronotherapy is the improvement of treatment outcomes by minimizing treatment toxicity and
      maximizing efficacy through delivery of a medication according to the timing of biological
      rhythms within a patient. Chronotherapy has improved outcomes through the reduction of side
      effects and increase in anti-tumor activity for a variety of cancers, but has never been
      applied to the treatment of gliomas.

      Based on the preliminary preclinical data for chronotherapeutic TMZ treatment of intracranial
      glioma xenografts and the success of chronotherapy in the treatment of other cancers, the
      invesitgators hypothesize that the timing of TMZ treatment will alter its efficacy and
      toxicity.

    <description>Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the updated response assessment criteria for high-grade gliomas: Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) working group guideline [JCO 28(11): 1963-1972, 2010].
The duration of overall response is measured from the time measurement criteria are met for complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) (whichever is first recorded) until the first date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started).</description>

Neutropenia grade 3 is &lt;1000-500/mm3 and grade 4 is &lt;500/mm3
Thrombocytopenia grade 3 is &lt;50,000-25,000/mm3 and grade 4 is &lt;25,000/mm3

    <description>The data will be collected through the ActTrust Condor Instrument Watch and the Sleep Questionniare.

    <description>23-item questionnaire that can be completed in 5 to 10 minutes with little or no assistance in patients who are not neurologically incapacitated. This brain subscale is usually used along with the core (general) questionnaire [2] that includes 27 items.
Patients rate all 5 items using a five-point Likert scale ranging from 0 &quot;not at all&quot; to 4 &quot;very much.&quot; Overall, higher ratings suggest higher QOL. Items are totaled to produce the following subscales, along with an overall QOL score: physical well-being (7 items); social/family well-being (7 items); emotional well-being (6 items); functional well-being (7 items); and concerns relevant to patients with brain tumors (23 items)
The sleep portion of this questionnaire consists of 17 questions about sleeping patterns and the ability to rate severity of insomnia.</description>
