    <textblock>
      This is an unblinded study to be conducted at a single research center, San Diego Sexual
      Medicine. Subjects meeting inclusion and exclusion criteria will receive 60 mg ospemifene
      daily for twenty weeks. After the informed consent is signed, a baseline physical
      examination, and vulvoscopy with detailed photography of the vulva, vestibule and vagina,
      will be performed. Physical examination and vulvoscopy with detailed photography of the
      vulva, vestibule and vagina, will be repeated prospectively every 4 weeks for a total of 20
      weeks. Therefore, physical examination and vulvoscopy with detailed photography of the vulva,
      vestibule and vagina will be performed prospectively at baseline (vulvoscopy session 1), 4
      weeks (vulvoscopy session 2), 8 weeks (vulvoscopy session 3), 12, weeks (vulvoscopy session
      4), 16 weeks (vulvoscopy session 5) and 20 weeks (vulvoscopy session 6) following daily
      administration of 60 mg ospemifene.

    <textblock>
      Ospemifene is indicated for post-menopausal women diagnosed with vulvar vaginal atrophy (VVA)
      and dyspareunia. While ospemifene clinically significantly reduces pain associated with
      dyspareunia, there has been little prospective documentation using vulvoscopy with detailed
      photography of the visible changes to the vulva, vestibule and vaginal region with daily
      administration of 60 mg ospemifene in post-menopausal women with VVA and dyspareunia. This
      study will include a total of 6 prospective photographic sessions of the vulva, vestibule and
      vagina over the 20 weeks administration of 60 mg ospemifene in the study. Comparisons will be
      made of baseline photography (vulvoscopy session 0) with photography at 4 weeks (vulvoscopy
      session 1), 8 weeks (vulvoscopy session 2), 12 weeks (vulvoscopy session 3), 16 weeks
      (vulvoscopy session 4) and 20 weeks (vulvoscopy session 5).

      Currently there have been limited prospective studies using vulvoscopy with detailed
      photography demonstrating visible changes to the vulva, vestibule and vagina following oral
      administration of 60 mg ospemifene in post-menopausal women with VVA and dyspareunia.
      Information regarding visible changes to the vulva, vestibule and vagina may be very
      important to the patient and to the health care provider to best understand the beneficial
      effects of ospemifene and to ensure patient compliance with treatment.

    <measure>Visible Changes to the Vulva, Vestibule and Vaginal Region on Photography</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 20 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Change in score on the Vulvoscopic Genital Tissue Appearance (VGTA) scale from baseline to 20 weeks was measured using ten parameters: 1) loss of labia majora, 2) loss of labia minora, 3) decreased glans clitoris, 4) prominence of the urethral meatus, 5) stenosis of the introitus, 6) vestibular pallor, 7) vestibular erythema, 8) loss of vestibular moisture, 9) loss of vaginal rugae, and 10) loss of prominence of the anterior vaginal wall to determine health of the vulva, vestibule and vaginal region using vulvoscopic photographs. VGTA scoring ranges from 0 (normal) to 3 (most severe) for each parameter, for a total score ranging from 0 (normal) to 30 (most severe). Each region assessed is reflected as worse for a higher score and better for a lower score in the 0-3 range, and the same for the total score, with 0 being the best possible score and 30 the worse.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in Pain Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 20 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in pain as noted on the pain scale (0-3) by q-tip testing of the vestibule by the clinician, with 0 representing no pain at the location and 3 being severe in each location, 1 o'clock, 3 o'clock, 5 o'clock, 6 o'clock, 7 o'clock, 9 o'clock and 11 o'clock circling the vestibule. The maximum total pain score range is 0 (no pain) to the worst score possible of 21 indicating severe pain at all locations.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Sexual Encounters in Which Pain Was Experienced</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 20 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>For each sexual encounter, patients were required to record a ''yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; response to the following question: Did you experience pain during intercourse? The percentage of sexual encounters in which the woman answered &quot;yes&quot; to this question at baseline (first month of the study) and at week 20 (last month of the study) was compared. The worst score possible was experiencing pain during 100% of sexual encounters and the best possible score was experiencing pain during 0% of sexual encounters at any given assessment period.</description>

        <title>Visible Changes to the Vulva, Vestibule and Vaginal Region on Photography</title>
        <description>Change in score on the Vulvoscopic Genital Tissue Appearance (VGTA) scale from baseline to 20 weeks was measured using ten parameters: 1) loss of labia majora, 2) loss of labia minora, 3) decreased glans clitoris, 4) prominence of the urethral meatus, 5) stenosis of the introitus, 6) vestibular pallor, 7) vestibular erythema, 8) loss of vestibular moisture, 9) loss of vaginal rugae, and 10) loss of prominence of the anterior vaginal wall to determine health of the vulva, vestibule and vaginal region using vulvoscopic photographs. VGTA scoring ranges from 0 (normal) to 3 (most severe) for each parameter, for a total score ranging from 0 (normal) to 30 (most severe). Each region assessed is reflected as worse for a higher score and better for a lower score in the 0-3 range, and the same for the total score, with 0 being the best possible score and 30 the worse.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Sexual Encounters in Which Pain Was Experienced</title>
        <description>For each sexual encounter, patients were required to record a ''yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; response to the following question: Did you experience pain during intercourse? The percentage of sexual encounters in which the woman answered &quot;yes&quot; to this question at baseline (first month of the study) and at week 20 (last month of the study) was compared. The worst score possible was experiencing pain during 100% of sexual encounters and the best possible score was experiencing pain during 0% of sexual encounters at any given assessment period.</description>
