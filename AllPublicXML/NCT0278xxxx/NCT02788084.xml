      1. Develop a Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) workflow for mutation profiling of
           formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue and cell-free DNA (cfDNA) specimens.

        2. Calculate the proportion of cases in a test series of B-cell non-Hodgkin Lymphomas
           (BNHL) with somatic mutations or immunoglobulin heavy chain (IGH) gene rearrangements
           common to both FPPE and cfDNA specimens.

        3. Determine if certain types of BNHL are more likely to have mutation profiles common to
           both FFPE &amp; corresponding cfDNA (&quot;FFPE-cfDNA dyads&quot;)

        4. Determine if specific mutations or mutation profiles in FFPE or cfDNA specimens (or
           both) are of prognostic value after a clinical follow-up of 2 years from the time of
           diagnosis.

      Patients with newly diagnosed B cell NHL will be identified. Samples will be cored from their
      diagnostic FFPE blocks and assayed to find lymphoma specific variants and immunoglobulin
      heavy chain gene rearrangements. Blood samples collected at baseline will be compared to see
      if variants and rearrangements can be detected in tumor specific DNA based on previous
      studies. Participant data will be collected, and clinical outcomes will be assessed to
      determine effect of mutation profiles on outcomes over 2 year follow up.

      Blood samples will be prospectively collected at scheduled follow up and if primary
      objectives of this study are met, will be assessed for presence of cfDNA and impact of
      variation on clinical outcomes.
