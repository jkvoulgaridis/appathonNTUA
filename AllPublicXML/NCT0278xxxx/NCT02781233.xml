  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the clinical impact of a progressive resistance training program in
      adults patients with haemophilia
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The training program aims improving muscular strength and endurance in the relevant muscles
      and joints (knee, elbow, ankle, shoulder and hip) in order to improve the quality of life in
      the patients.

    <measure>Change in Muscle strength</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>For measuring the isometric knee flexion and extension, ankle plantarflexion and dorsiflexion strength and isometric elbow flexion and extension strength, a portable hand-held dynamometer will be used (Nicholas Manual Muscle Tester, Lafayette Instruments, Indiana, USA).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Timed Up and Go</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Timed Up and Go test (TUG) is a simple test used to assess a person's mobility and requires both static and dynamic balance.
It uses the time that a person takes to rise from a chair, walk three meters, turn around, walk back to the chair, and sit down.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Haemophilia Quality of life questionnaire (A36 Haemophilia-QoL® )</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Haemophilia-QoL questionnaire is a self-report modular instrument that assesses nine relevant HRQoL domains for patients with haemophilia (e.g. physical health, daily activities, joint damage, pain, treatment satisfaction, treatment difficulties, emotional functioning, mental health, relationships and social activity).</description>

    <measure>Change in sit-to-stand test</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The time taken for the participant to stand up and sit down from a standard 45 cm chair with arms three times, as quickly as possible, was measured.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Haemophilia Activities List questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Haemophilia Activities List questionnaire measures the impact of hemophilia on self-perceived functional abilities in adults.
It contains 42 multiple choice questions in seven domains:
Lying/sitting/kneeling/standing (8 items) Functions of the legs (9 items) Functions of the arms (4 items) Use of transportation (3 items) Self-care (5 items) Household tasks (6 items) Leisure activities and sports (7 items) The most important outcomes are the overall sum score and three component scores relating to upper extremity activities, basic lower extremity activities, and complex lower extremity activities. A domain score for each of the seven domains can also be calculated.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in The Haemophilia Joint Health Score (HJHS)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The HJHS measures joint health, in the domain of body structure and function (i.e. impairment), of the joints most commonly affected by bleeding in hemophilia: the knees, ankles, and elbows.The HJHS 2.1 provides a total score (higher score is worse; max=124), joint specific scores, and a global gait score.</description>
