  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is primarily designed to collect resting phase signals from eligible subjects
      using the Phase Signal Recorder (PSR) prior to coronary angiography to machine learn and test
      an algorithm for detecting the presence of significant coronary artery disease in symptomatic
      adult patient.

      This clinical protocol is primarily designed to collect resting phase signals from eligible
      subjects using the Phase Signal Recorder (PSR) prior to coronary angiography to machine learn
      and test an algorithm for detecting the presence of significant coronary artery disease in
      symptomatic adult patient. In addition to this primary objective, machine-learned algorithms
      will be developed and tested to report the left ventricular ejection fraction and to identify
      the location of significant coronary artery disease. The performance of the machine-learned
      algorithm will be evaluated using a comparative paired trial design. In this study, the
      physician will not be provided the results of analysis performed and, accordingly, the
      results of the analyses will not be used to guide treatment decisions for the patient.

    <description>Develop and test a machine-learned algorithm which maximizes the area under the receiver-operating characteristic (AUC-ROC) curve to 0.70 (expected) and clinically significant sensitivity and specificity to detect CAD when compared to clinical diagnosis of significant coronary artery disease (i.e., presence of ≥70% stenosis by angiography or reduced fraction flow of &lt;=0.80) in at least one of the major coronary arteries (LMA, LAD, RCA, or LCX) or their distributions.</description>

    <description>The cPSTA System is a medical device system that uses passive tomography to analyze a patient's phase space data to identify the presence of significant coronary artery disease. The cPSTA System consists of several components that work together to obtain, transmit, analyze the data, and display the results, including the Phase Signal Acquisition System (PSAQ System), which is the Phase Signal Recorder (PSR) and the Phase Signal Data Repository (PSDR); analytical software; and secure web portal. For this study only the PSAQ System is used by the clinical site for the purposes of acquiring and transmitting the signal.</description>
