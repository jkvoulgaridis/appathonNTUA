  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      The Ebola virus causes a severe disease. It can be fatal. The usual incubation period after
      being exposed is 2 to 21 days. There is no approved treatment for Ebola infection. There is
      also no vaccine to prevent infection either before or after exposure. Researchers want to
      test an Ebola vaccine. They want to give it to people before they are exposed to the virus in
      order to prevent the disease.

      Objectives:

      To see how long-lasting and effective the vaccine rVSV[delta]G ZEBOV-GP (V920) is at
      preventing Ebola.

      Eligibility:

      Healthy adults at risk of exposure to the Ebola virus at work through lab or clinical
      contact.

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with medical history, physical exam, and blood tests.

      Participants will get the study vaccine. It will be injected into their upper arm.

      Participants will be monitored closely for at least 30 minutes. They will get a diary card to
      record any symptoms they have from the vaccine for up to 14 days.

      Participants will have study visits at 1, 3, and 6 months after they get the vaccine, then
      every 6 months (that is, at months 12, 18, 19, 24, 30, and 36 of study) for a total of 36
      months.

      Eighteen months after they join the study, participants will be randomly assigned to one of
      two groups. One group will get a second (or booster ) dose of the vaccine. The other group
      will not get a second dose.

      This study lasts 36 months.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Between 1994 and the present, there have been multiple Ebolavirus outbreaks affecting mostly
      central Africa. However, the 2014/2015 West African outbreak significantly exceeds all
      previous outbreaks in geographic range, number of individuals affected, and in disruption of
      typical activities of civil society.

      This protocol is a multi-center study to evaluate the durability of the immune response
      following the open label administration of the investigational rVSVdeltaG-ZEBOV-GP vaccine
      (V920) as pre-exposure prophylaxis for adults who have an occupational risk for potential
      exposure to Ebola virus. The vaccine uses a live replicating vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)
      replacing the gene encoding the G envelope glycoprotein with the gene encoding the envelope
      glycoprotein from the Zaire strain of Ebola (rVSVdeltaG-ZEBOV-GP also known as V920).

      All subjects will receive a single dose of rVSVdeltaG-ZEBOV-GP (2 x 10^7 pfu) on Day 0. We
      will collect adverse events after vaccination and at Month 1 and Month 19, serious adverse
      events (SAE) for the duration of the study, and assess the immune response at Months 1, 3, 6,
      12, 18, 19, 24, 30, and 36.

      A single booster immunization with the same dose of study vaccine as the primary dose (2 x
      10^7 pfu/mL) will be given to those randomized at month 18 to the booster arm of the trial.
      However, if at any time during the observation period antibody levels fall below a predefined
      seroprotective threshold (yet to be defined in parallel or newly planned studies), a booster
      will be offered to those who have not previously received a booster injection.

                  clinically significant abnormal laboratory results, or past medical history with

                  clinically significant condition or process includes but is not limited to:

                    1. A process that would adversely affect the systemic immune response

                    2. A process that would require medication that might adversely affect the
                       systemic immune response

                    3. Any contraindication to repeated injections or blood draws

                    4. A condition that requires active medical intervention or monitoring to avert

               -  Presence of any pre-existing illness or clinical history that, in the opinion of
                  the investigator, would place the participant at an unreasonably increased risk
                  through participation in this study. This includes but is not limited to:

                    1. Active malignancy

               -  Any concomitant medication for which reported side effects or adverse events, in
                  the judgment of the investigator, may interfere with assessment of safety.

                  comply with the requirements of this protocol.

          2. Pregnant or breast feeding (must have negative serum or urine pregnancy test on the
             day of vaccination, prior to vaccination)

          3. Known allergy to the components of the rVSV G-ZEBOV-GP vaccine (V920) vaccine product
             (VSV, albumin, tris).

          4. History of severe local or systemic reactions to any vaccination.

          5. Received an investigational drug within 5 half-lives or 30 days, whichever is longer,
             prior to vaccination (Day 0)/booster (Month 18).

          6. Received killed vaccines 14 days before vaccination (Day0)/booster (Month 18).

          7. Received live virus vaccines within 30 days before, or intention to receive live virus
