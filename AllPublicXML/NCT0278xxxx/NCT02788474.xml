  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Identifying biomarkers to predict the clinical course and benefits of therapy early in the
      course of the disease remains one of the most urgent and relevant challenges to improve
      overall patient management, to prevent treatment delay or overtreatment. This study is
      conducted to examine the effect of nintedanib treatment on change in biomarkers indicative of
      extracellular matrix turnover which have been shown recently to correlate with disease
      progression. This study further aims to confirm the association of biomarker course during
      the first three months of treatment and disease progression.

    <description>The rate of change (slope) in blood C-reactive protein degraded by matrix metalloproteinase-1/8 (CRPM) from baseline to week 12 is presented. The mean presented is the adjusted rate based on a random coefficient regression (CRPM log 10 transformed) with fixed effects for gender, age, height and random effect of patient specific intercept and time.</description>

    <description>For this endpoint, disease progression was defined by absolute FVC (percentage of predicted) decline ≥10% or death up to Week 52 based on in-clinic supervised spirometry.
This is a key secondary endpoint of the trial. This outcome measure is &quot;percentage of patients with disease progression&quot; and CRPM is included in the various models as a factor/covariate, and that this outcome measure, the percentage of progressors are displayed under &quot;Measured values&quot;</description>
