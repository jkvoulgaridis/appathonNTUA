      This study investigates a novel magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) system designed by GEHC for
      imaging viable neonate and infant populations. This MR system has a smaller size and design
      features that may make it more feasible to locate the system in close proximity to care areas
      for neonates (birth - 1 month) and infants (&gt;1 month to two years), such as clinical neonatal
      intensive care units (NICUs) and other infant and neonatal care departments.

      This study investigates a novel magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) system designed by GEHC for
      imaging viable neonate and infant populations. This MR system has a smaller size and design
      features that may make it more feasible to locate the system in close proximity to care areas
      for neonates (birth - 1 month) and infants (&gt;1 month to two years), such as clinical neonatal
      intensive care units (NICUs) and other infant and neonatal care departments.

      This is a two-phase prospective clinical study evaluating the performance and safety of the
      investigational MRI device for neonates and infants, including:

        -  Phase 1 - Initial feasibility assessment and optimization study (Phase 1) which may
           include hardware and software modifications. These studies are guided by a series of MR
           scanning procedures defined in sequential Sponsor-provided MR Procedure Documents

        -  Phase 2 - Controlled image and data collection study based on Phase 1 results, in which
           optimized scan procedure(s) according to MR Procedure Document(s) will be provided at
           the start of Phase 2 scanning and a fixed hardware and integrated software configuration
           will be applied for all subjects.

      Investigator feedback on scanning conducted under each MR Procedure Document will be
      documented. Because the device is intended for use in viable neonate and infant populations,
      clinical data are required that cannot be conducted in any other populations or simulated on
      non-human models. Clinical images and associated data as well as assessments of image
      quality, workflow, and usability will be collected.

      Images, associated image data, and subject data collected in both phases of this study may be
      used for future engineering development and activities that support MR product development,
      including Sponsor-authorized scientific and marketing activities. Summary evaluation of
      safety and performance from Phase 1 and Phase 2 may be used in support of regulatory
      submission, including filings for European CE mark.

Question 1. I think that I would like to use this system frequently Question 2. I found the system unnecessarily complex Question 3. I thought the system was easy to use Question 4. I think that I would need support from a technician to be able to use this system Question 5. I found the various functions in this system were well integrated Question 6. I thought there was too much inconsistency in this system Question 7. I think that most people would learn to use this system very quickly Question 8. I found the system very cumbersome to use Question 9. I felt very confident using the system Question 10. I needed to learn a lot of things before I could get going with this system Question 11. I feel confident this system will meet my patient's needs Question 12. How likely is it that you would recommend this system to other professionals in your field?</description>

Question 1. I think that I would like to use this system frequently Question 2. I found the system unnecessarily complex Question 3. I thought the system was easy to use Question 4. I think that I would need support from a technician to be able to use this system Question 5. I found the various functions in this system were well integrated Question 6. I thought there was too much inconsistency in this system Question 7. I think that most people would learn to use this system very quickly Question 8. I found the system very cumbersome to use Question 9. I felt very confident using the system Question 10. I needed to learn a lot of things before I could get going with this system Question 11. I feel confident this system will meet my patient's needs Question 12. How likely is it that you would recommend this system to other professionals in your field?</description>
