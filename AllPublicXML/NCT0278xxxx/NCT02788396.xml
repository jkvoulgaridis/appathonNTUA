  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to assess the impact of NC balloon post-dilatation on coronary
      microcirculation in patients with ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI)
      undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Suboptimal stent deployment can lead to future stent failure. Thus, optimising stent
      deployment with non-compliant balloons (NC balloon) post dilatation (PD) at high pressures is
      an established strategy. In the context of ST segment elevation myocardial infarction
      (STEMI), PD has been correlated anecdotally with the no reflow phenomenon.

      This study aims to determine the impact of stent post-dilation (PD) with NC balloons at high
      pressures on coronary microcirculation during PPCI by measuring the index of microcirculatory
      resistance (IMR) pre and post stent post-dilatation. Pre and post PD, an optical coherence
      tomography (OCT) study will be performed to assess stent deployment and identify parameters
      that predict the changes in IMR.
