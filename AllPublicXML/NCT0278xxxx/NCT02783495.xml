  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies how well an iPad-based cognitive rehabilitation program
      works in improving quality of life in patients with grade II-III glioma. An iPad-based
      cognitive rehabilitation program may help to increase patients cognitive function and quality
      of life, and may provide doctors with valuable information for optimizing care of patients
      with brain tumors.

    <description>Patients with brain tumors receive an iPad with the ReMind app. The patients will use the app to train neurocognitive and compensatory skills for 3 hours per week over the course of 12 weeks (36 hours in total)</description>

    <intervention_name>Device: iPad</intervention_name>
    <description>All patients will receive baseline neurocognitive and quality of life testing, followed by 3 months of the iPad-based intervention. At the end of the baseline visit, subjects will be lent an iPad to take home (or will be assisted in the installation of the ReMind app on their personal iPad) and instructed in the use of the ReMind app (and more basic iPad skills, if necessary). Subjects will review the intervention schedule (approximately 3 hours per week). Testing will be repeated 3 months after the baseline visit (i.e., immediately after the intervention) and 9 months after the baseline visit (i.e., 6 months after completion of the intervention), both time-points including a new MRI.</description>

             or carcinoma in-situ of the cervix), unless in complete remission and off of all
             therapy for that disease for a minimum of 3 years.

          -  Patients must be receiving MRI scans at UCSF

          -  Patients must be clinically stable and off treatment (e.g. radiation or chemotherapy)
             for ≥ 6 months

          -  Patients must be ≥ 6 months from craniotomy

          -  Patients must have subjective complaints of cognitive deficits.

          -  Patients must have adequate seizure control and be on a stable, or decreasing, dose of
             anti-epileptics

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who are not able to comply with study and/or follow-up procedures.

          -  Patients who do not have home access to the Internet.

          -  Patients who, based on the physician's opinion, are unable to participate in
             neurocognitive testing and/or neurocognitive rehab secondary to significant neurologic
             deficit
