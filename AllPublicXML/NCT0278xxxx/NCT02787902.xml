    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to develop, implement, and evaluate a behavioral weight
      management intervention with a communication training component for Mexican-American women.
      The study has three specific aims.

      Aim 1: Develop a behavioral weight loss intervention that modifies evidence-based behavioral
      weight loss treatment using results from formative data collected from Mexican-American
      mother-daughter dyads. The adapted intervention will focus on improving dyadic communication
      and collaboration for providing reciprocal support for healthy eating and physical activity
      behaviors.

      Aim 2: Implement and evaluate a pilot weight management program adapted for mother-daughter
      dyads. Dyads will be randomly assigned to partner-based treatment with or without
      communication skills training.

      Aim 3: Evaluate associations between changes in weight, weight-related behaviors, and
      psychosocial variables with changes in measures assessing interpersonal communication.
