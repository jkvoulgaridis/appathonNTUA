      The research project is a pilot study to assess the effects of a multi-component intervention
      in increasing physical activity among breast cancer survivors with depression. Individuals
      meeting inclusion/exclusion criteria will be enrolled in the 12-week intervention with a 6
      month follow up. Intervention components will include print-based education, self-monitoring,
      Active Living counseling, and facility access. Blood samples will be collected at baseline.
      Assessments (anxiety, stress, sleep) and sample collection will also occur at 3 time points
      during the intervention (Weeks 7, 13, and 25). Changes in physical activity will be assessed
      using Fitbits to measure weekly minutes of moderate/vigorous activity.

Print-based education: Subjects received the book, Exercise for Health: An Exercise Guide for Breast Cancer Survivors. Topics covered include: benefits of exercise; recommendations on type, duration, frequency and intensity of exercise; goal-setting; and advice on overcoming barriers.
Fitbit: Subjects were provided a Fitbit and instructed to wear the device daily.
Active Living counseling: The Active Living counseling program consisted of 12 weekly group educational sessions, facilitated by project interventionists. Discussions will involve topics related to increasing physical activity, such as identifying and overcoming barriers, setting goals, and time management.
Facility Access: Subjects will have access to the exercise lab in the UT Southwestern Depression Center consisting of equipment for aerobic exercise (treadmills, stationary bikes, etc.).</description>
