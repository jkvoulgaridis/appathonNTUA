  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the usefulness of using a long term subcutaneously inserted
      continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) sensor in patients with insulin treated Type 1 or Type 2
      Diabetes Mellitus. The study will be conducted in France. Patients will be enrolled into two
      cohorts and randomized into two groups within each cohorts.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      324 patients will be included in this study: 159 in cohort 1 and 165 in cohort 2. The cohort
      1 will be focused on participants with Type 1 or Type 2 Diabetes with an HbA1c &gt; 8% whereas
      cohort 2 will be focused on participants with Type 1 Diabetes spending more than 1.5 hour
      with sensor glucose &lt; 70 mg/dL per day including excursions below 54 mg/dL as a mean for at
      least 28 days.

             8% (cohort 1)

          -  Clinically confirmed diagnosis of Type 1 diabetes mellitus for ≥1 year and using
             insulin by multiple-daily subcutaneous injections or insulin pump and spending more
             than more than 1.5 hour with sensor glucose &lt;70 mg/dl per day including excursions
             below 54 mg/dl as a mean for at least 28 days (cohort 2)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Female participants of childbearing capacity (defined as not surgically sterile or not
             menopausal for ≥ 1 year) who are lactating or pregnant, intending to become pregnant,

          -  A condition preventing or complicating the placement, operation or removal of the
             Sensor or wearing of transmitter, including upper extremity deformities or skin
             condition

          -  History of hepatitis B, hepatitis C, or HIV

          -  Currently receiving (or likely to need during the study period): immunosuppressant
             therapy; chemotherapy; anticoagulant/antithrombotic therapy (excluding aspirin &lt; 2000
             mg per day); antibiotics for chronic infection (e.g. osteomyelitis, endocarditis)

          -  A condition requiring or likely to require magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)

          -  Known topical or local anesthetic allergy

          -  Known allergy to glucocorticoids or using systemic glucocorticoids (excluding topical,
             optical or nasal but including inhaled)

          -  Any condition that in the investigator's opinion would make the participant unable to
             complete the study or would make it not in the participant's best interest to
             participate in the study. Conditions include, but are not limited to, psychiatric
             conditions, known current or recent alcohol abuse or drug abuse by participant
             history, a condition that may increase the risk of induced hypoglycemia or risk
             related to repeated blood testing. Investigator will supply rationale for exclusion

          -  Participation in another clinical investigation (drug or device) within 2 weeks prior
             to screening or intent to participate during the study period

          -  Legal incompetence or limited legal competence

          -  Dependency on sponsor or Investigator (e.g. co-worker or family member)
