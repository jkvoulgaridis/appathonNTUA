  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-centre, randomized controlled trial comparing operative and non operative
      treatment for displaced patella fractures in elderly, low-demand patients.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with a displaced patellar fracture who meet the inclusion criteria and provide
      consent will be randomized to one of the two treatment arms. One group (Group A) will receive
      standardized non-operative treatment with immediate weight-bearing as tolerated in a knee
      immobilizer and early ROM exercises begun at 2 weeks post injury. The other group (Group B)
      will receive ORIF of their displaced patellar fracture with a standardized post-operative
      protocol.

      Post-operative rehabilitation will be standardized across both groups. Patients will be
      weight bearing as tolerated immediately in a removable knee immobilizer, with progressive
      range-of-motion exercises begun at two weeks following surgery or randomization. The knee
      immobilizer will be used full-time (with the exception of removal for physiotherapy and
      bathing) for 6 weeks after surgery or randomization. At six weeks post-treatment, patients
      will be allowed to perform active extension and will initiate progressive strengthening
      exercises of the extensor mechanism.

    <description>A self-administered questionnaire that assesses five outcomes: pain, symptoms, activities of daily living, sport and recreation function, and knee-related quality of life.

    <description>Open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) of the patellar fracture will be performed using screws, wires, pins, or plate fixation at the discretion of the treating surgeon. The trial is designed in a pragmatic fashion to allow participating surgeons from the multiple participating sites to perform fixation as per the standard of care at their institution. Post-operative care will include standard-of-care antibiotics and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis, both prescribed at the discretion of the attending surgeon.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female patients 65 years of age or older and ambulatory prior to injury (with
             or without walking aids).

          -  Closed fracture of the patella displaced by 5 mm or greater (Displacement will be
             determined by measuring the widest displacement on any x-ray view with the knee in
             full extension).

          -  The patient scores between 3 and 6 on the Clinical Frailty Scale. This score
             corresponds to a low-demand patient who is ambulatory and functionally independent

          -  Within 14 days of injury, the patient is able to perform a straight leg raise with
             less than 30 degrees of extensor lag.

          -  Able to read and understand the study consent form document.

          -  Willing and able to sign consent, follow the study protocol and attend follow-up
             visits.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Associated extremity injuries or polytrauma injuries that would otherwise require
             surgery or interfere substantially with rehabilitation or outcome in the opinion of
             the investigator.

          -  Neurovascular injuries at the level of the knee requiring surgery.

          -  Pathologic fractures.

          -  Periprosthetic fractures, or other knee surgery which would contra-indicate inclusion
             in the study (e.g. previous patella ORIF or previous surgery involving patella such as
             patella tendon or quads repair).

          -  Medical contra-indication to surgery.

          -  Likely problems, in the judgment of the investigators, with maintaining follow-up
             (e.g. patients with no fixed address, intellectually challenged patients without
             adequate support, etc.).
