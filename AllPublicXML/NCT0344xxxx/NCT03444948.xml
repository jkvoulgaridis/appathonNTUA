      To assess if endoscopic ultrasound-guided radiofrequency ablation application in patients
      with inoperable pancreatic cancer confers survival benefit when compared to patients
      receiving standard medical care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The five-year survival for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is less than 5% in spite
      of the advances in management of cancers in the last few decades. Endobiliary application of
      radiofrequency (RF) has been developed and used in patients with inoperable bile duct and
      pancreatic head adenocarcinomas presenting with biliary obstruction. (1, 2) Endoscopic
      ultrasound (EUS) radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of pancreatic neoplasms has been proven to be
      well tolerated and safe, inducing a significant reduction in tumour size (3). Various
      techniques of EUS-guided tumour ablation have been described, including RF ablation,
      photodynamic therapy, laser ablation, and ethanol injection (4). Kahaleh et al. have
      demonstrated that Endoscopic ultrasound guided RF ablation (EUS-RFA) of the pancreatic head
      using Habib EUS-RFA catheter (EMcision Ltd, UK) through a 19-gauge needle was well tolerated
      in 5 Yucatan pigs and with minimum amount of pancreatitis (5). In a pilot clinical study, Pai
      et al showed either a complete response or at least a 50% reduction in tumours following
      application of radiofrequency ablation with the Habib™ EUS-RFA device in a group of eight
      patients with pancreatic cancers (3).
