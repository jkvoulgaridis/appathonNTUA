  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a two-part study that aims to determine the reliability and safety of the use of the
      Hövding inflatable helmet in seizures, as evidenced by the deployment of the helmet during
      seizures, and qualitative patient reporting.

      Part 1: 4 healthy volunteers will fall from a standing position onto a padded surface to
      evaluate for consistent helmet deployment from a standing position. Part 2: up to 20 patients
      with drug resistant epilepsy who do not use existing head-protective devices will be enrolled
      and assigned to first enter &quot;helmet&quot; or &quot;no helmet&quot; groups. When assigned to the &quot;helmet&quot;
      group, patients will wear the helmet until deployment during a seizure or up to 3 months.
      Subjects will complete questionnaires about their seizures including any injuries sustained,
      post concussive symptom questionnaire, and the circumstances of inflation. Patients will
      return to site after helmet deployment. While assigned to the &quot;no helmet&quot; group, patients
      will complete the same questionnaires, except those relating to helmet inflation. We will
      compare circumstances, injuries, and post concussive scales in seizures resulting in falls
      occurring while the helmet was worn versus seizures resulting in falls occurring while the
      helmet was not being worn.

    <intervention_model_description>This is an open-label, randomized, 2-way crossover pilot safety study of the Hövding helmet device in patients with drug resistant epilepsy. Reference therapy is no head-protective device. Part 1 will test helmets on 4 normal controls falling from standing. If the helmet deploys in at least 3 out of 4 falls, we will proceed to Part 2. Part 2 will enroll up to 20 patients with Drug Resistant Epilepsy. Patients will be block randomized to first wear the helmet in their daily lives until helmet deployment or for up to 3 months, or to first not wear a helmet for up to 3 months. Patients in each group will complete self-administered questionnaires. We will compare circumstances, injuries, and post concussive scales in seizures resulting in falls occurring while the helmet was worn versus seizures resulting in falls occurring while the helmet was not being worn using daily seizure calendar, medical records review, the Rivermead Post Concussive Scale and other qualitative questionnaires.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>After a screening period, 10 patients with drug resistant epilepsy will first be assigned to wear one Hövding inflatable helmet in their daily lives. Subjects will fill out questionnaires about their seizures, injuries, and the circumstances of inflation when it occurs. After experiencing a seizure resulting in a fall or any helmet deployment, patients will crossover to the &quot;no helmet&quot; group. If no seizure resulting in fall occurs in 3 months, participation will end.</description>

    <description>The Hövding inflatable helmet is designed for cyclists as a collar with a deployable airbag that inflates when a sensor detects rapid changes in acceleration. The inflated helmet wraps the back and sides of the user's head in inflated nylon fabric which then slowly deflates after deploying.</description>
