  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators have recently demonstrated that argininosuccinate synthase 1 (ASS1)
      expression is silenced in 88% of all sarcomas (n=708), and that this loss is associated with
      a decreased overall survival. Using the extracellular arginine depleting enzyme PEGylated
      arginine deiminase (ADI-PEG20), an extracellular arginine depleting enzyme, the investigators
      demonstrated ADI-PEG20 induces a prosurvival metabolic reprogramming in ASS1-deficient
      sarcomas that redirects glucose into the serine/folate pathway directing the carbons from
      glucose into pyrimidine biosynthesis, thus sensitizing cells to death by the pyrimidine
      antimetabolite gemcitabine by using metabolomics. The synthetic lethality was increased by
      the addition of docetaxel. Therefore a phase II clinical trial of ADI with gemcitabine and
      docetaxel, a standard second line therapy for soft tissue sarcoma will be conducted to
      determine if the clinical benefit rate of gemcitabine and docetaxel is improved by the
      metabolic changes induced by ADI-PEG20.

      Recently published data shows that priming ASS1-deficient tumors with ADI-PEG 20 and
      docetaxel improves the effect of gemcitabine. Therefore, a cohort of patients consisting of
      ten patients diagnosed with either osteosarcoma or Ewing's sarcoma (ideally five of each),
      and five patients diagnosed with small cell lung cancer will be included as an exploratory
      cohort. Enrollment to Cohort 2 will occur concurrently with Cohort 1.

             only or carcinoma in situ of the cervix, or other tumors discussed with the study PI

          -  Currently receiving any other investigational agents.

          -  Prior treatment with ADI-PEG 20, gemcitabine, or docetaxel. Patients treated &gt; one

          -  Known brain metastases. Patients with known brain metastases must be excluded from
             this clinical trial (except for patients with SCLC, see below) because of their poor
             prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction that would
             confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events. Patients with SCLC are
             allowed to enroll with brain metastases provided they are stable and they are at least
             3 months post-treatment for brain metastases.

          -  A history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or
             biologic composition to ADI-PEG 20, gemcitabine, pegylated compounds, or other agents
             used in the study.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.

          -  History of seizure disorder not related to underlying cancer.

          -  Pregnant and/or breastfeeding. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative
             pregnancy test within 14 days of study entry.

          -  Known HIV-positivity on combination antiretroviral therapy because of the potential
             for pharmacokinetic interactions with the study treatment. In addition, these patients
             are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with marrow-suppressive
             therapy. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients receiving combination
             antiretroviral therapy when indicated.
