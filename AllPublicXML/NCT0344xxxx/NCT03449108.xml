      This phase II trial studies how well autologous tumor infiltrating lymphocytes LN-145
      (LN-145) works in treating patients with ovarian cancer, osteosarcoma, or other bone and soft
      tissue sarcomas that do not respond to treatment (refractory) or that has come back
      (relapsed). LN-145 is made by collecting and growing specialized white blood cells (called
      T-cells) that are collected from the patient's tumor. The T cells may specifically recognize,
      target, and kill the tumor cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate efficacy using objective response rate (ORR) using Response Evaluation
      Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version (v)1.1 in each cohort.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the disease control rate (DCR) within and across cohorts. II. Determine the
      duration of response (DOR). III. Determine progression-free survival (PFS) and overall
      survival (OS). IV. Further characterize the safety profile of adoptive cell therapy with
      tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) across multiple tumor types.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Establish duration of tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) persistence. II. Compare the
      molecular and immunological features of tumors before and after TIL therapy.

      III. Prospectively evaluate the existing immunotherapy response criteria (immune-related
      [ir]RECIST) as the best response assessment tool for TIL therapy among a diverse group of
      solid tumors.

      IV. To investigate TIL attributes (CD8 percentage [%], CD27 and CD28 expression) and
      correlation with response to therapy.

      V. Assess tumor marker (CA-125) response in patients who produce this tumor marker.

      VI. To assess Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQOL).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive cyclophosphamide intravenously (IV) over 2 hours on days -7 and -6,
      fludarabine phosphate IV over 30 minutes daily on days -5 to -1, autologous tumor
      infiltrating lymphocytes LN-145 IV over 45 minutes on day 0 and aldesleukin IV over 30
      minutes on days 1-4 for up to 6 doses.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 18 weeks, 6, 9, 12, 18 and
      24 months, then every 3 months for 3 years.
