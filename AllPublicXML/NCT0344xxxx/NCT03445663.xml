  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A multi-center Phase 1, First-in-Human study conducted in 2 Parts, testing AMG 424 in
      subjects with relapsed/ refractory multiple myeloma.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Part 1 of the study is dose evaluating and aimed at assessing the safety and tolerability of
      AMG 424 while determining the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or biologically active dose in
      subjects with relapsed/ refractory multiple myeloma.

      Part 2 of the study will further evaluate safety and tolerability of the AMG 424 MTD dose
      determined in Part 1, in groups of subjects with relapsed/ refractory multiple myeloma that
      include those with high or low cytogenetic risk.

In general, Amgen does not grant external requests for individual patient data for the purpose of re-evaluating safety and efficacy issues already addressed in the product labelling. Requests are reviewed by a committee of internal advisors, and if not approved, may be further arbitrated by a Data Sharing Independent Review Panel. Upon approval, information necessary to address the research question will be provided under the terms of a data sharing agreement.
