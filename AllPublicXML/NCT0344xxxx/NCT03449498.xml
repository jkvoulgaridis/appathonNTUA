  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Research on the effects of physiotherapeutic interventions in children with CP has grown
      expansively, and shows a wide diversity of techniques and concepts that are used in variable
      intensity. Until now there is no consensus on the optimal intensity of these interventions to
      have a positive impact on the activity and participation level of these children. A recent
      systematic review and meta-analysis already showed evidence for the effect of intensive
      training of hand function in children with CP, including short bursts of highly intensive
      therapy. In contrast, studies on the effect of intensive therapy of gross motor function were
      limited, and training was performed at a lower intensity during a longer period, resulting in
      effects that are more inconclusive. Moreover, none of the reviewed studies included
      improvement of trunk control as one of their treatment goals, although it is known that most
      children with CP experience some problems with trunk control, to a variable extent.

      This research project has two aims, i.e. 1) investigating the effect of intensive therapy
      camps on qualitative and quantitative parameters of lower limbs and trunk; and 2) comparing
      the effect of two therapeutic approaches, namely a functional approach versus a more
      qualitative-functional approach on these parameters.

    <time_frame>1h30</time_frame>
    <description>The Gross Motor Function Measure (GMFM)25 is used for the evaluation of gross motor function. The GMFM-88 exists of 88 items categorized into five dimensions: Lying &amp; Rolling (Dim A), Sitting (Dim B), Crawling &amp; Kneeling (Dim C), Standing (Dim D), and Walking, Running &amp; Jumping (Dim E). The Quality Function Measure (QFM)26 evaluates the quality of execution of the items of Dim D and E of the GMFM. Five attributes are scored separately by use of video scoring: alignment, coordination, weight shift, stability and dissociated movements.
GMFM: scale ranges fo each item: 0-3 (0 is the minimum score, 3 is the maximum score). There is a total score for all dimensions and a subscore for each dimension, expressed in a percentage. QFM: scale ranges for each qualitative attribute: 0-3 (0 is the minimum score, 3 the maximum score). There is a total score for each qualitative attribute.</description>

    <measure>3D-motion analysis system movements of lower limbs and trunk during gait</measure>
    <time_frame>1h</time_frame>
    <description>3D-movement analysis is used to evaluate lower limb and trunk movements during gait. The children walk barefoot over a 10m walkway at self-selected speed, while marker trajectories on trunk and lower limbs are captured by 12 infrared cameras (VICON system). Spatiotemporal and kinematic parameters will be evaluated.</description>

    <time_frame>30 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Trunk control in sitting is evaluated with the Trunk Control Measurement Scale (TCMS). The TCMS evaluates two prime aspects of trunk control during functional activities: (1) being a stable base for upper and lower limb movements, and (2) being an actively moving body segment. It consists of three subscales: 'static sitting balance', 'selective movement control' and 'dynamic reaching'.
Scale range: 0-3 (0 is the minimum score, 3 is the maximum score).</description>

    <description>Camps fot children with spastic CP are organised. Each camp consists of 10 days of 6 hours therapy per day. Six functional activities focusing on lower limbs and trunk are performed: walking, stair climbing, balance, transfers, trunk control, and Wii (combination of functional activities in sitting and/or standing). A group of clinical experts composes a set of exercises for each of these activities, however individual adaptations according to the needs and abilities of the child can be still be done. Quality of movement (alignment, weightshift, dissociation, coordination and stability) is hereby very important. The theme 'circus' is used to enhance the motivation of the children.</description>
