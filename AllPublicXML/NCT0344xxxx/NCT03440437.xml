  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be conducted in adult patients diagnosed with advanced tumors to characterize
      the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and activity of FS118. This is a Phase 1,
      multi-center, open label, multiple-dose, first in human study, designed to systematically
      assess safety and tolerability, and to identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or
      recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) for FS118 in patients with advanced tumors. Pharmacokinetics,
      pharmacodynamics, immunogenicity, and response will also be assessed.
