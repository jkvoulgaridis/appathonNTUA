      The aim of this research is to assess drug effects (Xanax and Norco) on driving performance.
      Researchers will use the Alertness Memory Profiler (AMP) application to compare results to
      previous related studies.

      This study continues a line of research designed to characterize the effects of common
      recreationally used prescription and illicit drugs with well known stimulant and sedating
      effects and their relationship to results from the Alertness Memory Profiler (AMP) that
      included a set of vigilance and memory tasks.

      This study uses EEG, EKG, computerized assessment, blood sampling, and driving simulation.

      Individuals recruited will be normal, healthy individuals not currently taking the study
      drugs. The study will involve five visits, a screening visit as well as four dosing visits.
      The dosing visits will have a clean (double placebo) and three drugged visits (Xanax and
      Norco placebo, Xanax placebo and Norco, Xanax and Norco). The screening visit will last about
      two hours and will include drug and pregnancy testing as well as screening for
      physical/psychological health. Each of the dosing visits will last approximately five to six
      hours and will include sleep and food intake surveys, being dosed with study drugs or
      placebos, AMP assessments, a simulator drive, and wellness surveys. There will also be 4 mL
      blood sampling before dosing, before driving, and after driving.

Subjects who did not complete the study may have completed one arm and their data is not included in the analysis. There was a screening visit and four study visits where the subject arrived at the National Advanced Driving Simulator. At each study visit, subjects received one of the following four dosing regimens: double placebo or &quot;Sober&quot;; active Xanax with active Norco, active Xanax and placebo Norco, and placebo Xanax and active Norco.</description>
