  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An observational prospective will be conducted to determine the detection rate of serrated
      adenoma during screening colonoscopy at our institution. Additionally, the variability of
      serrated adenoma detection among endoscopists will be evaluated and the characteristics of
      serrated adenomas will be described.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Colonoscopy screening is a preventative measure for colorectal carcinoma (CRC), a highly
      malignant and dangerous cancer. Extensive research on the adenoma detection rate has provided
      national standards and quality metrics to help assess competence of endoscopists. Currently,
      there are no standards established for serrated adenomas. The proposed study would be
      conducted at Good Samaritan Hospital (GSH) and TriHealth Surgery Center West. This is an
      observational study and does not involve any patient interventions. However, because patient
      healthcare data will be collected for research, informed consent will be obtained shortly
      before the procedure. The main study objective is to determine the detection rate of serrated
      adenoma during screening colonoscopy at our institution. Additionally, the variability of
      serrated adenoma detection among endoscopists will be evaluated and the characteristics of
      serrated adenomas will be described.
