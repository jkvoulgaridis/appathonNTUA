  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Renal excretion is a minor elimination route of telotristat etiprate. So this trial is
      intended to assess the drug behaviour in subjects with decreased renal function.

      This is a staged study with Part B contingent upon the results of Part A. Part A will enrol a
      total of 16 subjects, eight with severely impaired renal function and eight healthy subjects.
      Part B with enrol a total of 16 subjects, eight subjects in each additional renal function
      group, i.e. mildly impaired renal function group and moderately impaired group.

      <recruitment_details>A total of 16 subjects were recruited in this open label, single dose study between February and May 2018. Recruited subjects were split evenly between 2 groups (control group and test group).</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>The control group comprised 8 healthy subjects with normal renal function and who were demographically matched to test group by age (±10 years), sex and body mass index (BMI) (±20%). 8 subjects with severely impaired renal function but not requiring dialysis were recruited into the test group.</pre_assignment_details>
