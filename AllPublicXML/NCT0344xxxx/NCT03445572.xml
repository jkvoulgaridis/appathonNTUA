    <textblock>
      This trial studies how well meditative slow breathing or Isha Kriya meditation works in
      improving cancer-related symptoms in hospitalized participants with cancer. Meditative slow
      breathing or Isha Kriya meditation may help to decrease perceived stress and enhance
      well-being in hospitalized cancer participants.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Test the feasibility of the meditation practice.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Explore the acceptability of meditation in cancer patients through modified Global Symptom
      Evaluation (GSE) and on day 7 +/- 1 day and day 28 +/- 3 days.

      II. Explore the effect of meditative practices in cancer patients through Edmonton Symptom
      Assessment Scale (ESAS) on the day of enrolment and a weekly basis until the end of study at
      four weeks.

      OUTLINE: Participants are randomized to 1 of 3 groups.

      GROUP I (MSB): Participants are instructed on the meditative slow breathing (MSB) technique
      and then perform MSB over 15 minutes twice daily (BID) for 28 days.

      GROUP II (IK MEDITATION): Participants are instructed on the 3 steps of Isha Kriya (IK)
      meditation and then perform IK meditation over 15 minutes BID for 28 days.

      GROUP III (WAITLIST): Participants are placed on a waitlist and receive standard supportive
      care for 28 days. After 28 days, participants may crossover to Group II.
