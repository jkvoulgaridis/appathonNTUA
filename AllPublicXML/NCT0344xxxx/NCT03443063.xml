             consent.

          -  Body Mass Index between 18 and 40 kilograms per meters squared (kg/m^2), inclusive, at
             Screening.

          -  Voluntary agreement to provide written informed consent, and the willingness and
             ability to comply with all aspects of the protocol.

          -  Nonsmokers or smokers who smoke 20 cigarettes or less per day.

          -  Participants with normal liver function.

        Additional Inclusion Criteria for Healthy Participants:

          -  Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is ≥ 90 mL/min/1.73 m^2, as determined by
             the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) formula.

        Additional Inclusion Criteria for Participants with Renal Impairment:

        - Diagnosis of severe renal impairment (eGFR is 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73 m^2, as determined by
        the MDRD formula) that has been stable (without any change in disease status) for 60 days
        prior to study Screening and is confirmed on Day -1, as determined by the investigator by
        MDRD formula. If the renal function classification for the participant changed from
        screening to Day -1, eGFR should be repeated once within 24 to 48 hours. If eGFR
        variability across these scheduled and repeat time points indicates the participant does
        not consistently meet the criteria for one renal category group, participant enrollment
        into a renal category group will be at the discretion of the medical monitor and
        investigator, in consultation with the Sponsor.

        Exclusion Criteria:

             to Screening.

          -  A positive urine drug test or a positive breathalyzer alcohol test at Screening or Day
             -1.

          -  Participation in another interventional clinical trial within 4 weeks, or 5 times the
             half-life of the investigational drug (whichever is longer), of lemborexant
             administration.

             half-lives (whichever is longer) before Screening, or plans to use any such treatment

             as determined by the investigator. Participants with a history of Type I or Type II
             diabetes may be eligible, providing that, in the investigator's opinion, the disease
             has been stable. Participants receiving insulin therapy may be eligible provided they
