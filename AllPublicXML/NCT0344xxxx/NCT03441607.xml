          -  Subject has rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, or have been diagnosed with any
             other auto-immune disorders that could be the cause of their knee pain.

          -  BMI greater than 40 kg/m2.

          -  Subject has received an intra-articular hyaluronic acid (HA) injection for the
             treatment of OA of the target knee within 3 months prior to screening.

          -  Subject has received an intra-articular amniotic fluid, amniotic membrane or amniotic
             fluid/membrane combination injection for the treatment of OA of the target knee within
             3 months prior to screening.

          -  Subject has received a steroid, bone marrow aspirate concentrate (BMAC) or platelet
             rich plasma (PRP) injection for the treatment of OA of the target knee within 3 months
             prior to screening.

          -  Subject has had major surgery, arthroplasty or arthroscopy in the target knee within
