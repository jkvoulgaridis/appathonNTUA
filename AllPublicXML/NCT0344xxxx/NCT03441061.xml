    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well inotuzumab ozogamicin works in treating patients with
      B-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia with positive minimal residual disease. Inotuzumab
      ozogamicin is a monoclonal antibody called inotuzumab linked to a toxic agent called
      ozogamicin. Inotuzumab ozogamicin attaches to B cell-specific CD22 cancer cells in a targeted
      way and kills them.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the clinical efficacy of inotuzumab ozogamicin in patients B-cell acute
      lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in complete morphologic remission with positive minimal residual
      disease (MRD) in terms of relapse-free survival (RFS).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate other efficacy endpoints such as overall survival and MRD negativity rate by
      flow cytometry and/or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) overall and after the first cycle, as
      well as safety of inotuzumab ozogamicin in this setting.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive inotuzumab ozogamicin intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15 of
      cycle 1 and days 1 and 8 of subsequent cycles. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 6
      cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 day and then periodically
      every 6 months.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with B-lineage ALL in hematologic complete remission (CR) with molecular
             failure (i.e., had never achieved an MRD-negativity status before inotuzumab
             ozogamicin) or had a molecular relapse (i.e., became MRD positive after having been
             MRD negative) starting at any time point after 3 months of frontline therapy.
             Molecular disease or minimal residual disease is defined by a value of at least of
             10^-4 (0.01%) by multicolor flow cytometry, PCR and/or next-generation sequencing
             (NGS).

          -  Patients with B-lineage ALL in at least marrow CR in salvage 1 and beyond with MRD
             failure at any time point after 1 month of salvage therapy are allowed, including
             patients who received prior allogeneic stem cell transplantation.

          -  Patients with Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)+ ALL can be enrolled in CR1 or CR2 and
             beyond. A tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) will be added at the discretion of the
             treating physician. MRD for these patients will be defined by either 1.) a ratio of

             with p210 transcript or a ratio of BCR-ABL1 to ABL1 by PCR of 0.01% for patients with
             non-p210 transcripts, or 2.) detectable MRD at a level of at least 1x10^-4 (0.01%) by
             multicolor flow cytometry and/or by NGS.

          -  Monoclonal antibodies therapy within 2 weeks before study entry

          -  Radiotherapy or cancer chemotherapy (except for intrathecal prophylaxis and/or
