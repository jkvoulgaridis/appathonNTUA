      The purpose of this study is to compare the maximum single dose of Aleve® (two tablets,
      equivalent to 440 mg of naproxen sodium) to the maximum single dose of Tylenol Extra Strength
      (two caplets, equivalent to 1000 mg of acetaminophen) in the treatment of menstrual pain
      associated with primary dysmenorrhea.

    <measure>Sum of Total Pain Relief (TOTPAR) Over 0-12 Hours</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 hours post-dose</time_frame>
    <description>Pain relief was measured using Categorical Pain Relief Rating Scale (0 = No relief, 1 = a little relief, 2 = some relief, 3 = a lot of relief, 4 = complete relief). Total pain relief scores (TOTPARs) were calculated by multiplying the pain relief score at each postdose time point by the duration (in hours) since the preceding time point and then summing these values. The minimum value is 0, and the maximum value is 46. Higher scores was indicative of more pain relief.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Summed Pain Intensity Difference (SPID) Over 0-12 Hours</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 hours post-dose</time_frame>
    <description>Pain intensity was measured using Numerical Rating Scale (from 0 to 10: 0 = no pain, 10 = worst possible pain). For each postdose time point, pain intensity differences (PIDs) were derived by subtracting the pain intensity at the postdose time point from the baseline intensity score (baseline score - post-baseline score). A positive difference was indicative of improvement. Time-weighted summed pain intensity differences (SPIDs) were calculated by multiplying the PID score at each postdose time point by the duration (in hours) since the preceding time point and then summing these values. The minimum value could be -115, and the maximum value could be 115.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>SPID Over 0-6 Hours</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 hours post-dose</time_frame>
    <description>Pain intensity was measured using Numerical Rating Scale (from 0 to 10: 0 = no pain, 10 = worst possible pain). For each postdose time point, pain intensity differences (PIDs) were derived by subtracting the pain intensity at the postdose time point from the baseline intensity score (baseline score - post-baseline score). A positive difference was indicative of improvement. Time-weighted summed pain intensity differences (SPIDs) were calculated by multiplying the PID score at each postdose time point by the duration (in hours) since the preceding time point and then summing these values. The minimum value could be -55, and the maximum value could be 55.</description>

    <measure>Time to First Intake of Rescue Medication</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 hours post-dose</time_frame>
    <description>Time to first intake of rescue medication was defined as the number of hours elapsed between time of dose and time of rescue medication in each treatment period. Participants would be censored at time of last pain assessment.</description>

    <time_frame>Up to 12 hours post-dose</time_frame>
    <description>Global evaluation was performed either at 12 hours post-dose or immediately prior to the first intake of rescue medication. Global Evaluation Score was based on the question 'Overall, I would rate the effectiveness of the study medication in relieving my menstrual pain as: 0=Poor, 1=Fair, 2=Good, 3=Very Good, 4=Excellent.'</description>

        <title>Sum of Total Pain Relief (TOTPAR) Over 0-12 Hours</title>
        <description>Pain relief was measured using Categorical Pain Relief Rating Scale (0 = No relief, 1 = a little relief, 2 = some relief, 3 = a lot of relief, 4 = complete relief). Total pain relief scores (TOTPARs) were calculated by multiplying the pain relief score at each postdose time point by the duration (in hours) since the preceding time point and then summing these values. The minimum value is 0, and the maximum value is 46. Higher scores was indicative of more pain relief.</description>

        <title>Summed Pain Intensity Difference (SPID) Over 0-12 Hours</title>
        <description>Pain intensity was measured using Numerical Rating Scale (from 0 to 10: 0 = no pain, 10 = worst possible pain). For each postdose time point, pain intensity differences (PIDs) were derived by subtracting the pain intensity at the postdose time point from the baseline intensity score (baseline score - post-baseline score). A positive difference was indicative of improvement. Time-weighted summed pain intensity differences (SPIDs) were calculated by multiplying the PID score at each postdose time point by the duration (in hours) since the preceding time point and then summing these values. The minimum value could be -115, and the maximum value could be 115.</description>

          <title>TOTPAR 6-12 Hours</title>
          <description>Pain relief was measured using Categorical Pain Relief Rating Scale (0 = No relief, 1 = a little relief, 2 = some relief, 3 = a lot of relief, 4 = complete relief). Total pain relief scores (TOTPARs) were calculated by multiplying the pain relief score at each postdose time point by the duration (in hours) since the preceding time point and then summing these values. The minimum value is 0, and the maximum value is 24. Higher scores was indicative of more pain relief.</description>

        <title>Pain Intensity Difference (PID) Scores at Each Evaluation</title>
        <description>Pain intensity was measured using Numerical Rating Scale (from 0 to 10: 0 = no pain, 10 = worst possible pain). For each postdose time point, pain intensity differences (PIDs) were derived by subtracting the pain intensity at the postdose time point from the baseline intensity score (baseline score - post-baseline score). A positive difference was indicative of improvement.</description>
