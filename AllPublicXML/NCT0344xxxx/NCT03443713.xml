  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to assess the impact of physician-driven insulin setting changes in
      type 1 patients using multiple daily injection insulin therapy with exercise. This is a short
      outpatient study with multiple outpatient and home exercise sessions with an assigned type of
      exercise.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will be on study for 28 days. Sensor glucose, exercise, insulin and meal data will
      be collected during this time. Subjects will wear the Dexcom G6 CGM system and a physical
      activity monitor. The Subjects will complete 2 exercise visits in-clinic and 4 exercise
      visits as an outpatient. Subjects will be randomized to aerobic, anaerobic or high intensity
      interval exercise sessions for 30 minutes each. Physicians will review CGM and insulin data
      every 7 days and make insulin dose recommendations that the subject will adjust in the dose
      calculator.
