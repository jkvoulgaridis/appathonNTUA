  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 2-part, single-dose, open label, randomized 3-way cross-over study to compare BA of
      pediatric study drugs TRIUMEQ and (DTG/3TC) in healthy volunteers under fasted conditions.
      Study will be conducted in 2-parts. Each part 1 and part 2 will comprise of 3-treatment
      periods (TP) where Part 1, will assess BA, of pediatric TRIUMEQ dispersible tablets with an
      adult TRIUMEQ conventional tablet formulation and Part 2, will assess BA, of pediatric
      DTG/3TC dispersible tablets with adult DTG and 3TC conventional tablets formulation. Total
      duration of study is 9-weeks and will be conducted in approximately 36 subjects. The 2-parts,
      may be run in parallel as they are independent of each other. TRIUMEQ is a registered
      trademark of GlaxoSmithKline group of companies.

    <intervention_model_description>2-part study with 3-TPs each. Part 1, compares relative BA of TRIUMEQ dispersible tablets for pediatric populations (DTG, 5 milligram [mg]/abacavir [ABC] 60 mg/3TC 30 mg), when administered as direct-to-mouth and when dispersed into purified water, with adult TRIUMEQ conventional tablet (DTG 50 mg/ABC 600 mg/3TC 300 mg), administered as direct-to-mouth (reference). Additionally, part 2 will compare relative BA of DTG/3TC (DTG 5 mg/3TC 30 mg), dispersible tablets for pediatric populations, when administered as direct-to mouth and when dispersed into purified water, with adult DTG (50 mg) and 3TC (300 mg) conventional tablets, when administered as direct-to-mouth (reference). Each TP, in Part 1 and 2 will have, wash-out period of 7-days (with minus 4 hours) between each single dose, for flexible dosing. During TPs, subjects will be admitted, to clinic on Day-1, following completion of last study procedure on Day 4, post which follow-up visit conducted, 7 to 10 days after last dose.</intervention_model_description>

             components thereof or a history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the
             investigator or medical monitor, contraindicates their participation. The subject has
             participated in a clinical trial and has received an investigational product (IP)
             within the following time period prior to the first dosing day in the current study:
             30 days, 5 half-lives or twice the duration of the biological effect of the IP
             (whichever is longer).

          -  The subject has participated in a clinical trial and has received an IP within the
             following time period prior to the first dosing day in the current study: 30 days, 5
             half-lives or twice the duration of the biological effect of the IP (whichever is
             longer).

          -  Creatinine clearance (CrCL) &lt; 90 mL per minute.

          -  Presence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), positive hepatitis C antibody test
             result at screening or within 3 months prior to first dose of study treatment.

          -  A positive test for HIV antibody.

          -  Where participation in the study would result in donation of blood or blood product in
             excess of 500 mL within 60 days.

        <description>Blood samples were collected from participants at indicated time points after the administration of study treatment to investigate pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of DTG in Part 1. Pharmacokinetic analysis was conducted using standard non-compartmental methods. PK population comprised of participants in the all participants population (participants who took at least 1 dose of study medication) for whom PK sample was obtained and who had evaluable PK assay results. Statistics has been presented on geometric least square (LS) means.</description>

          <description>Blood samples were collected for the analysis of clinical chemistry parameters including bilirubin, creatinine and direct bilirubin. Day -1 was defined as Baseline for clinical chemistry parameters. Change from Baseline value is calculated as the value at the post-dose visit minus the Baseline value.</description>

        <description>Urine samples were collected for analysis of urine pH. pH is calculated on a scale of 0 to 14, values on the scale refer to the degree of alkalinity or acidity. A pH of 7 is neutral. A pH of less than 7 is acidic and a pH of greater than 7 is basic. Normal urine has a slightly acidic pH (5.0-6.0).</description>
