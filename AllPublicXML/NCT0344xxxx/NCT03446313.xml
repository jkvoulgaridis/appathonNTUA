  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether using a mobile app increases adherence to a
      heart healthy prescription after discharge from a cardiac rehab program.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ongoing maintenance of physical activity after cardiac rehab is an important part of
      preventing secondary cardiac events in patients with ischemic heart disease. Our central
      hypothesis is that monitoring and promotion of health-related behaviors by increasing
      patient-provider communication through a mobile device after discharge from cardiac rehab
      increased adherence to a heart healthy prescription over time. Participants will be randomly
      assigned to use a mobile app or serve as the control group. All participants will have an
      activity tracker to track their activity for two months.
