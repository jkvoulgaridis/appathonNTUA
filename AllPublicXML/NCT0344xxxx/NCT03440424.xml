          <title>Cohort A: Mild Hepatic Impairment (Child Pugh Class A)</title>
          <description>Participants with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A, score 5 to 6) received lemborexant 10 milligrams (mg) administered as a tablet, orally in the morning on Day 1 of the 14-day Treatment Period. The Child-Pugh Score is a scoring system used to determine the prognosis with cirrhosis and need for liver transplantation. Scoring is based upon albumin, ascites, total bilirubin, prothrombin time, and encephalopathy. Each category is based on a scoring system of 1-3 with 3 being the worst and a total score range of 5-15. It is broken into categories A (score of 5-6), B (score of 7-9), and C (score of 10-15) with worsening from A to C for prognosis.</description>

The Child-Pugh Score is a scoring system used to determine the prognosis with cirrhosis and need for liver transplantation. Scoring is based upon albumin, ascites, total bilirubin, prothrombin time, and encephalopathy. Each category is based on a scoring system of 1-3 with 3 being the worst and a total score range of 5-15. It is broken into categories A (score of 5-6), B (score of 7-9), and C (score of 10-15) with worsening from A to C for prognosis.</description>

            <title>Cohort B: Moderate Hepatic Impairment (Child Pugh Class B)</title>
            <description>Participants with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B, score 7 to 9) received lemborexant 10 mg administered as a tablet, orally in the morning on Day 1 of the 14-day Treatment Period. The Child-Pugh Score is a scoring system used to determine the prognosis with cirrhosis and need for liver transplantation. Scoring is based upon albumin, ascites, total bilirubin, prothrombin time, and encephalopathy. Each category is based on a scoring system of 1-3 with 3 being the worst and a total score range of 5-15. It is broken into categories A (score of 5-6), B (score of 7-9), and C (score of 10-15) with worsening from A to C for prognosis.</description>

        <title>AUC(0-72 Hours): Area Under Plasma Concentration Versus Time Curve From Time Zero to 72 Hours Postdose of Lemborexant's Metabolites M4, M9, and M10</title>
        <description>Blood samples were analyzed for the amount of lemborexant's metabolites (M4, M9, M10) in the plasma. Plasma concentration-time data were measured by validated LC-MS/MS method. AUC(0-72 hours) was calculated by the linear-up log-down trapezoidal method. Plasma PK data were analyzed using a non-compartmental method of analysis.</description>

The Child-Pugh Score is a scoring system used to determine the prognosis with cirrhosis and need for liver transplantation. Scoring is based upon albumin, ascites, total bilirubin, prothrombin time, and encephalopathy. Each category is based on a scoring system of 1-3 with 3 being the worst and a total score range of 5-15. It is broken into categories A (score of 5-6), B (score of 7-9), and C (score of 10-15) with worsening from A to C for prognosis.</description>

The Child-Pugh Score is a scoring system used to determine the prognosis with cirrhosis and need for liver transplantation. Scoring is based upon albumin, ascites, total bilirubin, prothrombin time, and encephalopathy.

Blood samples were analyzed for the amount of lemborexant and its metabolites (M4, M9, M10) in the plasma. Plasma concentration-time data were measured by validated LC-MS/MS method.

        <description>The apparent volume of distribution gives information about amount of lemborexant distributed in body tissue rather than the blood/plasma. Vz/F for parent lemborexant only was calculated as Dose/(AUC0-inf multiplied by elimination rate constant[λz]). Area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to infinity, calculated(AUC0-inf) as AUC0-t + AUCextra. AUCextra represents an extrapolated value obtained by Clast/λz, where Clast: plasma concentration at last sampling time point at which measured plasma concentration is at or above LLQ. λz is the elimination rate constant. Elimination rate constant obtained from linear regression of terminal phase of log transformed concentration-time data. A minimum of three points is required to calculate λz. Blood samples were analyzed for amount of lemborexant in plasma. Plasma concentration-time data were measured by validated LC-MS/MS method. Plasma PK data were analyzed using a non-compartmental method of analysis.</description>

        <title>CLu/F: Apparent Clearance Relative to the Unbound Plasma Concentration Based on AUCu of Lemborexant</title>
        <description>Unbound fraction of drug in plasma was calculated as 100% - mean percent of lemborexant bound to plasma protein for each participant. Blood samples were analyzed for the amount of lemborexant in the plasma. Plasma concentration-time data were measured by validated LC-MS/MS method. Plasma PK data were analyzed using a non-compartmental method of analysis.</description>

        <population>The PK Analysis Set was the group of participants who were dosed with the test drug and had sufficient PK data to derive at least 1 PK parameter. Here “Overall number of participants analyzed” signifies participants who were evaluable for this outcome measure.</population>

            <description>Participants with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A, score 5 to 6) received lemborexant 10 mg administered as a tablet, orally in the morning on Day 1 of the 14-day Treatment Period. The Child-Pugh Score is a scoring system used to determine the prognosis with cirrhosis and need for liver transplantation. Scoring is based upon albumin, ascites, total bilirubin, prothrombin time, and encephalopathy. Each category is based on a scoring system of 1-3 with 3 being the worst and a total score range of 5-15. It is broken into categories A (score of 5-6), B (score of 7-9), and C (score of 10-15) with worsening from A to C for prognosis.</description>
