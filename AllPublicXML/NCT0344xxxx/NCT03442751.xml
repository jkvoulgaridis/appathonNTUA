  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the safety and efficacy of epithelium-on corneal collagen cross-linking (CXL) in
      impeding the progression of, and/or reducing corneal curvature (Kmax) in eyes with
      progressive keratoconus. Epithelium-on CXL uses a formulation that allows the riboflavin to
      penetrate the cornea without the need to remove the epithelium, the outer most layer of the
      cornea.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Up to 275 study eyes with progressive keratoconus will be enrolled. Study eyes will be
      randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive CXL treatment or sham/control treatment.The primary
      efficacy endpoint is a difference of ≥ 1 diopter between treatment groups in the mean change
      in Kmax from baseline to Month 6.

             consent

          3. Ability to read English or Spanish to complete the NEI-VFQ 25 questionnaire;

          4. Willingness and ability to follow all instructions and comply with schedule for

          5. For females capable of becoming pregnant, agree to have urine pregnancy testing
             performed prior to randomization of each study eye and prior to treatment of a
             cross-over eye; must not be lactating, and must agree to use a medically acceptable
             form of birth control for at least one week prior to the randomization visit, one week
             prior to treatment of a cross-over eye, and continue to use the method for one month
             following the last treatment. Acceptable forms for birth control are spermicide with
             barrier, oral contraceptive, injectable or implantable method of contraception,
             transdermal contraceptive, intrauterine device, or surgical sterilization of partner.
             For non-sexually active females, abstinence will be considered an acceptable form of

             have experienced menarche and have not experienced menopause (as defined by amenorrhea
             for greater than 12 consecutive months) or have not undergone successful surgical
             sterilization (e.g. hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation, or bilateral
             oophorectomy);

          6. Having topographic and clinical evidence of keratoconus defined as thefollowing:

               -  Axial topography consistent with keratoconus

               -  Presence of central or inferior steepening on the Pentacam topography map

               -  Presence of one or more findings associated with keratoconus, such as

                    2. Vogt striae

                    3. Corneal thinning

                    4. Corneal scarring

                    5. Scissoring of the retinoscopic reflex

          7. Having a diagnosis of progressive keratoconus, defined as one or more of the following
             changes over a period of 18 months or less:

               1. An increase of ≥ 1.00 D in Kmax or simK

               2. An increase of ≥ 1.00 D in regular astigmatism on subjective manifest refraction

               3. A myopic shift (towards greater negative sphere) of 0.50 D or more on subjective
                  manifest refraction or as evaluated by comparing eyeglass or contact lens
                  prescriptions to current subjective manifest refraction [NOTE: subjects with a
                  clear history of progression but without prior documentation may be screened and
                  followed for a period of time to confirm and document progression]

          8. BSCVA of ≥ 1 letter and ≤ 85 letters on ETDRS chart

          9. Contact Lens Wearers Only: Removal of contact lenses is required for a 1 week period
             prior to the screening visit(s) and subject must agree to remain out of their contact
             lenses from the time of treatment until the 1-month visit is completed. A contact lens
             wearer is defined as someone who has worn contact lenses in the eye to be treated in
             the last 30 days.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Contraindications, sensitivity or known allergy to the use of the test article(s) or
             their components;

          2. If female, be pregnant, nursing or planning a pregnancy or have a positive urine
             pregnancy test prior to the randomization or treatment of either eye or during the
             course of the study;

          3. Eyes classified as either normal, atypical normal, or keratoconus suspect on the
             severity grading scheme;

          4. A history of previous corneal surgery, limbal relaxing incision procedure, or
             insertion of Intacs in the eye(s) to be treated;

          5. Corneal pachymetry that is &lt; 325 microns at the thinnest point measured by Pentacam in
             the eye to be treated;

          6. Eyes which are aphakic, or eyes which are pseudophakic and do not have a UV blocking
             lens implanted;

          7. Previous ocular condition (other than refractive error) in the eye to be treated that
             may predispose the eye for future complications. For example:

               -  History of corneal disease (e.g., herpes simplex, herpes zoster keratitis,
                  corneal melt, corneal dystrophy, etc.);

               -  Clinically significant corneal scarring in the cross-linking treatment zone that
                  is not related to keratoconus or, in the Investigator's opinion, will interfere
                  with the cross-linking procedure;

          8. A history of delayed epithelial healing in the eye to be treated or a current
             condition that may interfere with or prolong epithelial healing;

          9. Subjects with nystagmus or any other condition that would prevent a steady gaze during
             the treatment or other diagnostic tests;

         10. A history of previous corneal cross-linking treatment in the eye to be treated;

         11. Have used an investigational drug or device within 30 days of screening or be
             concurrently enrolled in another investigational drug or device trial within 30 days
             of the study.
