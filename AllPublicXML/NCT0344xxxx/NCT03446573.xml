  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to establish if human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infected
      adult subjects with current virologic suppression on a ≥3-drug tenofovir alafenamide (TAF)
      based regimen (TBR) remain suppressed upon switching to a two-drug regimen of dolutegravir
      (DTG) 50 milligram (mg) + lamivudine (3TC) 300 mg. This study will also provide important
      information regarding the safety and subject satisfaction with this two-drug regimen. The
      primary objective of this trial is to demonstrate the non-inferior antiviral activity of
      switching to DTG + 3TC once daily compared to continuation of TBR over 48 weeks in HIV-1
      infected, ART-experienced, virologically suppressed subjects. This study also will
      characterize the long-term antiviral activity, tolerability and safety of DTG + 3TC compared
      to TBR through Week 144 and characterize the long-term antiviral activity, tolerability and
      safety of DTG + 3TC through Week 200.

      This will be a 200-week, Phase III, randomized, open-label, active-controlled, multicenter,
      parallel-group study. The study will include a screening phase (up to 28 days), a randomized
      early switch phase (Day 1 up to Week 148), a randomized late switch phase (Week 148 up to
      Week 200), and a continuation phase (post Week 200). Approximately 550 HIV-1 infected adults
      on stable TBR will be randomized 1:1 to switch to DTG + 3TC once daily for up to 200 weeks,
      or to continue their TBR for 148 weeks, at which time and if HIV-1 ribonucleic acid (RNA) &lt;50
      copies per milliliter (c/mL) at Week 144, these subjects will switch to DTG + 3TC up to Week
      200.

    <intervention_model_description>This is a randomized study with parallel group assignment where subjects will be randomized into one of the two treatment groups. Subjects randomized to DTG + 3TC will receive DTG + 3TC up to Week 200. Subjects randomized to TBR will continue to take their current regimen up to Week 148, at which time and if HIV-1 RNA &lt;50 c/mL at Week 144, these subjects will switch to DTG + 3TC up to Week 200. Randomization will be stratified by Baseline third agent class (protease inhibitor [PI], integrase inhibitor [INI], or non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor [NNRTI]).</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>This will be an open-label study and therefore no blinding is required. The Sponsor team aims to remain blinded to subject assignment, and will instruct sites to refrain from mentioning assignment when sending in queries (as the sites/subjects will not be blinded). No summaries of the study data according to actual randomized treatment groups will be available to sponsor staff prior to the planned Week 24 preliminary analysis.</masking_description>

    <description>Number of participants, who meet CVW criteria (one plasma HIV-1 RNA &gt;=200 c/mL after Day 1 with immediate prior HIV RNA &gt;=50 c/mL), with emergent phenotypic resistance to INSTI and/or NRTI were summarized. Assessment of antiviral activity of anti-retroviral therapy (ART) using phenotypic test results was interpreted through a proprietary algorithm (from Monogram Biosciences), which provided the overall susceptibility of the drug. Partially sensitive and resistant calls were considered resistant in this analysis. The phenotypic resistance was calculated using binary scoring system, where 0 was considered as sensitive and 1 as resistance. Phenotypic Resistance data for the following INSTI, NNRTI, NRTI and PI drugs in participants Meeting CVW Criteria has been presented.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>This non-inferiority study evaluated antiviral activity of switching to dolutegravir (DTG) + lamivudine (3TC) fixed dose combination (FDC) once daily compared to continuation of a Tenofovir alafenamide (TAF)-based regimen (TBR) over 48 weeks in virologically suppressed participants with human immunodeficiency type 1 infection.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>743 participants were enrolled, of which two participants did not receive treatment and hence 741 participants received at least one treatment into the study. The results presented are based on Week 48 primary analysis.</pre_assignment_details>

          <description>Participants who were on a stable TBR and who had an HIV-1 ribonucleic acid (RNA) &lt;50 copies per millilter (c/mL) at the time of screening, received fixed dose combination of DTG 50 milligrams (mg) + 3TC 300 mg once daily up to 48 weeks.</description>

          <description>Participants who were on a stable TBR and who had an HIV-1 RNA&lt;50 c/mL at the time of screening, were continued to receive TBR up to 48 weeks. One participant randomized to the this arm received TDF rather than TAF-and was presented within the “TAF-based regimen” arm for efficacy because the efficacy of TAF and TDF are comparable. However the participant was presented separately under “TDF-based regimen” for Safety because the safety profiles of TDF and TAF differ.</description>

        <description>Percentage of participants with virologic failure (plasma HIV-1 RNA &gt;=50 c/mL) was evaluated using FDA snapshot algorithm at Week 48. The Snapshot algorithm treated all participants without HIV-1 RNA data at the visit of interest (due to missing data or discontinuation of investigational product prior to the visit window) as non-responders, as well as participants who switch their concomitant antiretroviral therapy (ART) prior to the visit of interest. Intent-to-treat exposed (ITT-E) Population comprises of all randomized participants who receive at least one dose of study treatment either DTG + 3TC or TBR. Participants were assessed according to the treatment to which the participant was randomized. Any participant receiving a treatment randomization number was considered to be randomized.</description>

One participant randomized to the this arm received TDF rather than TAF-and was presented within the “TAF-based regimen” arm for efficacy because the efficacy of TAF and TDF are comparable. However the participant was presented separately under “TDF-based regimen” for Safety because the safety profiles of TDF and TAF differ.</description>

        <description>HIV-associated conditions were recorded during the study and was assessed according to the 2014 CDC Classification System for HIV Infection in Adults. CDC classification for HIV were: Stage 1: No AIDS defining condition and CD4+ T-lymphocyte count: &gt;=500 cells/mcL; Stage 2: No AIDS infection and CD4+ lymphocyte count: 200-499 cell/mcL and Stage 3: with HIV infection and CD4+ T-lymphocye count &lt;200 cells/mcL. Disease progression summarize participants who had HIV infection stage 3 associated conditions or death. Indicators of clinical disease progression were defined as: CDC Category Stage 1 at enrolment to Stage 3 event; CDC Category Stage 2 at enrolment to Stage 3 event; CDC Category Stage 3 at enrolment to New Stage 3 Event; CDC Category Stage 1, 2 or 3 at enrolment to Death.</description>

          <description>HIV-associated conditions were recorded during the study and was assessed according to the 2014 CDC Classification System for HIV Infection in Adults. CDC classification for HIV were: Stage 1: No AIDS defining condition and CD4+ T-lymphocyte count: &gt;=500 cells/mcL; Stage 2: No AIDS infection and CD4+ lymphocyte count: 200-499 cell/mcL and Stage 3: with HIV infection and CD4+ T-lymphocye count &lt;200 cells/mcL. Disease progression summarize participants who had HIV infection stage 3 associated conditions or death. Indicators of clinical disease progression were defined as: CDC Category Stage 1 at enrolment to Stage 3 event; CDC Category Stage 2 at enrolment to Stage 3 event; CDC Category Stage 3 at enrolment to New Stage 3 Event; CDC Category Stage 1, 2 or 3 at enrolment to Death.</description>

        <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. Adverse events were evaluated by the investigator and graded according to the DAIDS toxicity scales from Grade 1 to 5 (1=Mild, 2=Moderate, 3=Severe, 4=Potentially life threatening, 5=Death). The higher the grade, the more severe the symptoms. Number of TDF-based regimen participants with adverse events by maximum grade have been presented.</description>

Any abnormality in clinical chemistry parameters were evaluated according to the DAIDS toxicity scale From Grade 1 to 4: Grade 1 (mild), Grade 2 (moderate), Grade 3 (severe) and Grade 4 (Potentially life-threatening).

        <description>samples were collected up to the Week 36 visit for the analysis of clinical chemistry parameters: alanine aminotransferase (ALT), albumin, alkaline phosphate (ALP), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), bilirubin, carbon dioxide (CO2), cholesterol, creatinine kinase (CK), creatinine, direct bilirubin, glomerular filtration rate (GFR) from creatinine adjusted for body surface area (BSA), GFR from cystatin C adjusted using chronic kidney disease-epidemiology collaboration (CKD-EPI), hypercalcemia, hyperglycemia, hyperkalemia, hypernatremia, hypocalcemia, hypoglycemia, hypokalemia, hyponatremia, low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, phosphate and triglycerides. Any abnormality in clinical chemistry parameters were evaluated according to the DAIDS toxicity scale From Grade 1 to 4: Grade 1 (mild), Grade 2 (moderate), Grade 3 (severe) and Grade 4 (Potentially life-threatening). The higher the grade, the more severe the symptoms.</description>

        <description>Urine samples were collected at Baseline, Week 24 and Week 48. Baseline is defined as Day 1. Change from Baseline in UA/C was calculated as UA/C ratio at post-Baseline visit minus UA/C ratio calculated at Baseline. Estimated geometric mean adjusted ratio (each visit over Baseline) and 95% CI have been presented. Change from Baseline in UP/C and UA/C was calculated as UP/C and UA/C ratio at post-Baseline visit minus UP/C and UA/C ratio calculated at Baseline, respectively. Estimated geometric mean adjusted ratio (each visit over Baseline) and 95% CI have been presented. One participant randomized to TBR but received TDF-based regimen and because the safety profiles of TDF and TAF differ, this participant was removed from the overall safety population and is presented in separate arm &quot;Randomized to TBR but received TDF-based regimen.&quot;</description>

One participant randomized to the this arm received TDF rather than TAF-and was presented within the “TAF-based regimen” arm for efficacy because the efficacy of TAF and TDF are comparable. However the participant was presented separately under “TDF-based regimen” for Safety because the safety profiles of TDF and TAF differ.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Renal Biomarkers- UA/C Ratio and UP/C Ratio at Weeks 24 and 48 in Participants Randomized to TBR Receiving TDF-based Regimen</title>
        <description>Urine samples were collected at Baseline, Week 24 and Week 48 to assess renal biomarkers - urine albumin/creatinine ratio and urine protein/creatinine ratio. Baseline was defined as the latest pre-dose assessment value (Day 1) with a non-missing value. Change from Baseline in UA/C was calculated as UA/C ratio at post-Baseline visit minus UA/C ratio calculated at Baseline. Change from Baseline in UP/C was calculated as UP/C ratio at post-Baseline visit minus UP/C ratio calculated at Baseline. One participant randomized to TBR but received TDF-based regimen and because the safety profiles of TDF and TAF differ, this participant was removed from the overall safety population and is presented in separate arm &quot;Randomized to TBR but received TDF-based regimen.&quot;</description>

          <description>Urine biomarker samples were collected to assess urine beta-2 microglobulin/urine creatinine. Baseline (Day 1) value was the value from the latest pre-dose assessment with a non-missing value, including those from unscheduled visits. Change from Baseline in urine beta-2-microglobulin/urine creatinine was calculated as urine beta-2-microglobulin/urine creatinine ratio at post-Baseline visit minus urine beta-2-microglobulin/urine creatinine ratio calculated at Baseline. One participant randomized to TBR but received TDF-based regimen and because the safety profiles of TDF and TAF differ, this participant was removed from the overall safety population and is presented in separate arm &quot;Randomized to TBR but received TDF-based regimen.&quot;</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Renal Biomarkers- Urine Retinol Binding Protein 4/Urine Creatinine in Participants Randomized to TBR Arm Receiving TDF-based Regimen</title>
        <description>Urine biomarker samples were collected to assess urine retinol binding protein 4/urine creatinine. Baseline (Day 1) value was the value from the latest pre-dose assessment with a non-missing value, including those from unscheduled visits. Change from Baseline in urine retinol binding protein 4/urine creatinine was calculated as urine retinol binding protein 4/urine creatinine ratio at post-Baseline visit minus urine retinol binding protein 4/urine creatinine ratio calculated at Baseline. One participant randomized to TBR but received TDF-based regimen and because the safety profiles of TDF and TAF differ, this participant was removed from the overall safety population and is presented in separate arm &quot;Randomized to TBR but received TDF-based regimen.&quot;</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Fasting Lipids at Weeks 24 and 48 in Participants Randomized to TBR Arm Receiving TDF-based Regimen</title>
        <description>Blood samples were collected up to the Week 48 visit (participant withdrew from the study at Week 36) to assess fasting lipids which included plasma cholesterol, plasma LDL cholesterol, plasma HDL cholesterol and plasma triglycerides. Baseline value was the value from the latest pre-dose assessment (Day 1) with a non-missing value. Change from Baseline is defined as post-dose visit value minus Baseline value. Change from Baseline values for fasting lipids in TDF-based regimen participants has been presented. One participant randomized to TBR but received TDF-based regimen and because the safety profiles of TDF and TAF differ, this participant was removed from the overall safety population and is presented in separate arm &quot;Randomized to TBR but received TDF-based regimen.&quot;</description>

        <description>Serum samples were collected for analysis of bone biomarkers. Baseline was latest pre-dose assessment (Day 1) with a non-missing value. Change from Baseline is post-dose visit value minus Baseline value. Adjusted mean and its corresponding standard error has been presented. Adjusted mean was the estimated mean change from Baseline at each visit in each arm calculated from a repeated measures model adjusting for treatment, visit, Baseline third agent class, CD4+ cell count (continuous), age (continuous), sex, race, body mass index (BMI) (continuous), smoking status, vitamin D use, Baseline biomarker (continuous), treatment by visit interaction, and Baseline value by visit interaction, with visit as repeated factor.One participant randomized to TBR but received TDF-based regimen and because the safety profiles of TDF and TAF differ, this participant was removed from the overall safety population and is presented in separate arm &quot;Randomized to TBR but received TDF-based regimen.&quot;</description>

One participant randomized to the this arm received TDF rather than TAF-and was presented within the “TAF-based regimen” arm for efficacy because the efficacy of TAF and TDF are comparable. However the participant was presented separately under “TDF-based regimen” for Safety because the safety profiles of TDF and TAF differ.</description>

        <description>Serum samples were collected for analysis of bone biomarkers. Baseline was latest pre-dose assessment (Day 1) with a non-missing value. Change from Baseline is post-dose visit value minus Baseline value. Change from Baseline in bone biomarkers-serum bone-specific ALP (Bone-ALP), osteocalcin, serum P1NP and serum CTX-1 in TDF-based regimen participants has been presented. One participant randomized to TBR but received TDF-based regimen and because the safety profiles of TDF and TAF differ, this participant was removed from the overall safety population and is presented in separate arm &quot;Randomized to TBR but received TDF-based regimen.&quot;</description>

Change from Baseline is defined as post-dose visit value minus Baseline value. Adjusted mean and its corresponding standard error has been presented. Adjusted mean was estimated mean change from Baseline at each visit in each arm calculated from a repeated measures model adjusting for treatment, visit, Baseline third agent class, CD4+ cell count (continuous), age (continuous), sex, race, BMI (continuous), smoking status, vitamin D use, Baseline biomarker (continuous), treatment by visit interaction, and Baseline value by visit interaction, with visit as repeated factor.One participant randomized to TBR but received TDF-based regimen and because the safety profiles of TDF and TAF differ, this participant was removed from the overall safety population and is presented in separate arm &quot;Randomized to TBR but received TDF-based regimen.&quot;</description>

One participant randomized to the this arm received TDF rather than TAF-and was presented within the “TAF-based regimen” arm for efficacy because the efficacy of TAF and TDF are comparable. However the participant was presented separately under “TDF-based regimen” for Safety because the safety profiles of TDF and TAF differ.</description>

        <description>Serum samples were collected at Baseline, Week 24 and Week 48 to assess renal inflammation biomarker - cystatin C. Baseline was defined as the latest pre-dose assessment value (Day 1) with a non-missing value. Change from Baseline is defined as post-dose visit value minus Baseline value. Change from Baseline values for serum cystatin -C biomarker in TDF based regimen participants has been presented. One participant randomized to TBR but received TDF-based regimen and because the safety profiles of TDF and TAF differ, this participant was removed from the overall safety population and is presented in separate arm &quot;Randomized to TBR but received TDF-based regimen.&quot;</description>

        <description>Serum samples were collected at Baseline, Week 24 and Week 48 to assess renal inflammation biomarkers - serum GFR from cystatin C adjusted using CKD-EPI and serum GFR from creatinine adjusted using CKD-EPI. Baseline was defined as the latest pre-dose assessment value (Day 1) with a non-missing value. Change from Baseline is defined as post-dose visit value minus Baseline value. Change from Baseline in serum GFR from cystatin C adjusted using CKD-EPI and serum GFR from creatinine adjusted using CKD-EPI in TDF-based regimen participants has been presented. One participant randomized to TBR but received TDF-based regimen and because the safety profiles of TDF and TAF differ, this participant was removed from the overall safety population and is presented in separate arm &quot;Randomized to TBR but received TDF-based regimen.&quot;</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Renal Biomarker- Serum GFR From Cystatin C Adjusted Using CKD-EPI and Serum GFR From Creatinine Adjusted Using CKD-EPI at Weeks 24 and 48 in Participants Randomized to TBR Arm Receiving TDF-based Regimen</title>
          <description>Serum samples were collected at Baseline, Week 24 and Week 48 to assess renal inflammation biomarkers - serum GFR from cystatin C adjusted using CKD-EPI and serum GFR from creatinine adjusted using CKD-EPI. Baseline was defined as the latest pre-dose assessment value (Day 1) with a non-missing value. Change from Baseline is defined as post-dose visit value minus Baseline value. Change from Baseline in serum GFR from cystatin C adjusted using CKD-EPI and serum GFR from creatinine adjusted using CKD-EPI in TDF-based regimen participants has been presented. One participant randomized to TBR but received TDF-based regimen and because the safety profiles of TDF and TAF differ, this participant was removed from the overall safety population and is presented in separate arm &quot;Randomized to TBR but received TDF-based regimen.&quot;</description>

        <description>Serum samples were collected to assess renal inflammation biomarker - serum creatinine. Baseline was Day 1 with a non-missing value. Change from Baseline is post-dose visit value minus Baseline value. Adjusted mean and its corresponding standard error has been presented. Adjusted mean was the estimated mean change from Baseline at each visit in each arm calculated from a repeated measures model adjusting for treatment, visit, Baseline third agent class, CD4+ cell count (continuous), age (continuous), sex, race, BMI (continuous), presence of diabetes mellitus, presence of hypertension, Baseline biomarker (continuous), treatment by visit interaction, and Baseline value by visit interaction, with visit as repeated factor.

        <description>EQ-5D-5L questionnaire provides a profile of participant function and a global health state rating. The five-item measure has one question assessing each of five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression and 5 levels for each dimension including 1=no problems, 2=slight problems, 3=moderate problems, 4=severe problems and 5=extreme problems. The health state is defined by combining the levels of answers from each of the 5 questions. Each health state is referred to in terms of a 5 digit code. Health state 5 digit code is translated into utility score, which is valued up to 1 (perfect health) with lower values meaning worse state. EQ-5D-5L utility score ranges from -0.281 to 1. Higher scores indicate better health.</description>

The health state is defined by combining the levels of answers from each of the 5 questions. Each health state is referred to in terms of a 5 digit code. Health state 5 digit code is translated into utility score, which is valued up to 1 (perfect health) with lower values meaning worse state. EQ-5D-5L utility score ranges from -0.281 to 1. Higher scores indicate better health.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in EQ-5D-5L Thermometer Scores at Week 24 and 48</title>
        <description>EEQ-5D-5L questionnaire provides a profile of participant function and a global health state rating. The five-item measure has one question assessing each of five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression and 5 levels for each dimension including 1=no problems, 2=slight problems, 3=moderate problems, 4=severe problems and 5=extreme problems. EQ-5D-5L included EQ visual Analogue scale (EQ VAS) 'Thermometer' which provided Self-rated current health status. Score ranges from 0 (worst imaginable health state) to 100 (best imaginable health state). MMRM was run on the LOCF dataset. Baseline was the latest pre-dose assessment value (Day 1) and change from Baseline=post-dose value minus Baseline value.</description>
