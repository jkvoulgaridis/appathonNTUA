    <intervention_model_description>This is a Phase 1 study of E7130 in participants with advanced solid tumors. This study will be conducted in 2 parts (Part 1 and Part 2). Part 1 will be the dose escalation portion of this study, conducted to assess dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) and to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) in participants with solid tumors. The dosage and the duration of the treatment cycle in Part 2 will be determined based on the data from Part 1. Part 2 will be comprised of cohort expansions to further characterize the safety and tolerability of E7130.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Part 1 (Cycle 1; 28 days): The first cohort of 3 participants will receive 25 micrograms per meters squared (μg/m^2) of E7130, on Day 1 and Day 15 as an intravenous infusion. If a drug-related Grade 2 or higher toxicity excluding clinically insignificant events is not observed in the initial cohort, dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) will be evaluated in successive dose levels with single participants until such a toxicity is observed. Once the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) will be determined, additional participants will be enrolled to explore participant's optimal biologic dose (OBD). Part 2: Participants with Her2-negative breast cancer and other solid tumors will be evaluated at the dose level determined in Part 1 in a 2-week or in a 3-week regimen based on the evaluations in Part 1.</description>

    <description>Part 1 (Cycle 1; 21 days): On Day 1, participants will receive E7130 at (-1) a lower dose than the dose at which the first DLT was observed in the 2-week regimen. Once the MTD will be determined, additional participants will be enrolled to explore participant's OBD. Part 2: Participants with Her2-negative breast cancer and other solid tumors will be evaluated at the dose level determined in Part 1 in a 3-week or in a 2-week regimen based on the evaluations in Part 1.</description>
