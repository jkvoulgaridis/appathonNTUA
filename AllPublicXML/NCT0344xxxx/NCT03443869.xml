  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of letermovir (LET) versus
      valganciclovir (VGCV) in preventing CMV disease in adult kidney transplant recipients. The
      primary hypotheses are that LET is non-inferior to VGCV; and if non-inferiority is
      demonstrated, that LET is superior to VGCV, in preventing CMV disease through 52 weeks
      post-transplant.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Have a documented negative serostatus for CMV within 180 days prior to randomization.

          -  Anticipate receiving a primary or secondary allograft kidney from a CMV IgG
             seropositive (D+) donor at the time of screening AND have received a primary or
             secondary allograft kidney from a documented D+ donor at the time of randomization.

          -  Be within 0 (i.e. day of transplantation) to 7 days (inclusive) post-kidney transplant
             at the time of randomization.

          -  Males agree to use contraception during the treatment period, and for at least 90 days
             after the last dose of study treatment, and refrain from donating sperm during this
             period.

          -  Female is not pregnant, not breastfeeding, and is not a woman of childbearing
             potential (WOCBP), OR if a WOCBP, agrees to follow the contraception guidance during
             the treatment period and for at least 90 days after the last dose of study treatment.
