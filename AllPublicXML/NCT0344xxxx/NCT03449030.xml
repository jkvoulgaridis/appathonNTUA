  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of TAK-164 and to determine the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) and schedule.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is a novel antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) called TAK-164.
      TAK-164 is being evaluated in participants with advanced GCC-positive GI cancer (Part A) or
      colorectal carcinoma (CRC) and gastric carcinoma (Part B and Part C) to determine safety,
      tolerability, and pharmacokinetics (PK) and MTD/RP2D of TAK-164, as well as the preliminary
      efficacy. The study will include approximately 100 evaluable participants.

      In Part A (Escalation), approximately 25 participants with GI carcinoma will be enrolled.
      Those include participants with various GI malignancies such as carcinomas of esophagus,
      stomach, colon, and pancreas. The starting dose for Arm 1 will be 0.004 mg/kg of TAK-164
      administered intravenously on Day 1 Q3W and the maximal dose will not exceed 0.19 mg/kg Q3W.

      In Part B (Expansion), approximately 50 participants will be enrolled to receive TAK-164
      infusion at determined RP2D in Part A. Participants will follow the Q3W schedule and will be
      followed until PD, unacceptable toxicity, or until they choose to withdraw consent.

      In Part C (Imaging substudy to be conducted in the Netherlands only), approximately 25
      participants with GCC-expressing metastatic colorectal carcinoma (mCRC) will be enrolled to
      receive 89Zr-TAK-164 and unlabeled TAK-164 at determined RP2D in Part A.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in the United States and the Netherlands. The
      overall time to participate in this study is up to 55 months. Participants will attend an end
      of study (EOS) visit 30 days after the last dose of TAK-164 or just prior to the start of
      subsequent antineoplastic therapy, whichever occurs first.

          5. For participants enrolled in studies in which tumor biopsies are obtained:

               -  Known bleeding diathesis or history of abnormal bleeding, or any other known
                  coagulation abnormalities that would contraindicate the tumor biopsy procedure.

               -  Ongoing therapy with any anticoagulant or antiplatelet agents (example, aspirin,
                  clopidogrel, heparin, or warfarin).
