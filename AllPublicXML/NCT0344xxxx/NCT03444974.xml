  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to investigate the sociodemographic background as well as psychiatric
      comorbidities of adolescent substance users with substance use disorders. The study
      simultaneously evaluates biomarkers of stress and addiction, including long-term cortisol
      levels from hair samples and gene methylation in blood samples associated with substance use.

      Our study also adapts, rolls out, and evaluates an evaluated multimodal treatment manual wich
      was originally intended for stimulant drug users (MATRIX). We adopt this manual to the needs
      and specifics of adolescents (MATRIX-A, A=adolescents) with substance use disorders of any
      substance, including cannabis, methamphetamine, and alcohol. Adolescents will receive group
      therapy sessions, individual therapy sessions, and medication if needed, while parents or
      professional caretaker will receive group sessions. Therapy outcomes will be examined in
      addition to parental distress and parenting skills.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As numbers of adolescent drug abuse have grown rapidly within the last couple of years,
      research on youth drug abuse and dependency has taken a new and vital role within the public
      healthcare system. For this reason, it is crucial to find new ways to effectively integrate
      adolescent patients into the health care system, as well as assign them to treatment options
      tailor made for the specific challenges and needs of this population. This study aims to
      investigate (a) sociodemographic background and psychiatric comorbidities in connection with
      adolescent substance abuse and dependence to enhance understanding of epidemiologic risk
      factors for developing drug dependency in adolescence, as well as benefit future treatment
      options.

      It further aims to investigate (b) molecular and epigenetic mechanisms of addiction disorders
      in adolescents by analyzing methylation pattern, as well as proteome analysis of peripheral
      immune markers. The investigator's aim is a better understanding of the multimodal biological
      underpinnings of risk/resilience for addiction in youth on the molecular, cellular and
      circuit levels with a special focus on the changes within the stress and immune system in
      patients with addiction disorders and their family members.

      Another research interest of this study concerns (c) adapting and evaluating new treatment
      options, tailor made for the adolescent population. For this reason the investigators aim to
      adapt, implement and evaluate a therapeutic program according to the MATRIX manual for the
      treatment of substance abuse, which consists of two group therapies for patients, as well as
      their parents (Evaluation time points: T0, T1, and T2).

      Last, this study aims to (d) evaluate parental stress levels, parental communication skills
      and knowledge in connection with adolescent substance abuse.
