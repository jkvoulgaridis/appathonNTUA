    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, immunogenicity, and PK/PD
      of SCB-313 (recombinant human TRAIL-Trimer fusion protein) administered twice weekly for 2
      weeks via IP bolus injection for the treatment of patients with peritoneal malignancies,
      including but not limited to peritoneal carcinomatosis, malignant ascites, pseudomyxoma
      peritonei, and peritoneal mesothelioma.

          4. Age ≥18 years

          5. Body mass index ≥17.0 kg/m2

          6. Adequate hematological function, defined as:

               1. Platelet count ≥ 75,000/μL

               2. Prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time ≤1.5 times the upper
                  limit of normal (ULN)

               3. Absolute neutrophil count ≥1,500/μL

               4. Hemoglobin ≥8 g/dL (transfusion and erythropoietic agents are allowed. In case
                  there is existence of active bleeding or other persistent condition of either
                  increased destruction or impaired production of erythrocytes which may require
                  repeated transfusion or erythropoietic treatment, the eligibility must be
                  discussed with the Sponsor on a case-by-case basis prior to randomization)

          7. Adequate renal function, defined as serum creatinine ≤2.0 times ULN and creatinine
             clearance &gt;45 mL/minute

          8. Adequate liver function, defined as:

               1. Aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase ≤3 times ULN for patients
                  without liver metastases, or ≤5 times ULN in the presence of liver metastases

               2. Bilirubin ≤1.5 times ULN, unless patient has known Gilbert's syndrome

          9. Female patients of childbearing potential (excluding women who have undergone surgical
             sterilization or menopause. Menopause is defined as the status where no menstrual
             periods continue for 1 year or more without any other medical reasons), are eligible
             if they have negative serum pregnancy testing within 7 days prior to first dosing and
             are willing to use an effective method of birth control/contraception to prevent
             pregnancy until 6 months after discontinuation of the SCB-313.

        Both men and women of reproductive potential must agree to use effective contraception
        during the study and for 6 months after discontinuation of the SCB-313.

        Note: Contraceptive methods that are considered highly effective are, for example, total
        abstinence, an intrauterine device, a double barrier method (such as condom plus diaphragm
        with spermicide), a contraceptive implant, hormonal contraceptives (contraceptive pills,
        implants, transdermal patches, hormonal vaginal devices, or injections with prolonged
        release), or have a vasectomized partner with confirmed azoospermia.

             (IV) antibiotics within 2 weeks prior to enrollment.

          2. Symptoms or signs (including laboratory tests) of clinically significant concomitant
             hematologic, cardiovascular, pulmonary, hepatic, renal, pancreatic, or endocrine
             diseases.

          3. Residual adverse events (AEs) &gt; Grade 2 from previous treatment.

          4. Evidence or suspicion of relevant psychiatric impairment including alcohol or
             recreational drug abuse.

          5. Myocardial infarction within 6 months prior to treatment, and/or prior diagnoses of
             congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association Class III or IV), unstable
             angina, unstable cardiac arrhythmia requiring medication, and/or long QT syndrome or
             QT/QTc interval &gt;450 msec at baseline.

          6. Uncontrolled hypertension defined as systolic blood pressure ≥160 mmHg and/or
             diastolic blood pressure ≥100 mmHg confirmed upon repeated measures.

          7. Left ventricular ejection fraction &lt;40% as determined by echocardiography performed at
             screening or within 90 days prior to enrollment.

          8. Prior anti-tumor therapy (chemotherapy) within 2 weeks, hormone therapy or palliative
             extra-abdominal radiotherapy within at least 1 week, or small-molecule targeted
             therapy within 5 half-lives prior to enrollment. Prior therapy with monoclonal
             antibody should be stopped after Investigator's judgement making sure delayed side
             effects will not interfere with the dose limiting toxicity (DLT) evaluation period
             after SCB-313 therapy.

          9. Major surgery within 4 weeks prior to enrollment.

         10. Patient with ileus within 30 days prior to screening.

         11. Positive serology test for human immunodeficiency virus Type 1 and 2 or known history
             of other immunodeficiency disease.

         12. Live vaccine within 2 weeks prior to enrollment.

         13. Scheduled participation in another clinical study involving an investigational product
             or device during the course of this study.

         14. Previous treatment with a TRAIL-based therapy or death receptor (DR) 4/5 agonist
             therapy.

         15. Known or suspected hypersensitivity to any component of the SCB-313.

         16. Any further condition which, according to the Investigator, may result in undue risk
             of the patient by participating in the present study.

         17. Untreated central nervous system metastatic disease, leptomeningeal disease, or cord
             compression.
