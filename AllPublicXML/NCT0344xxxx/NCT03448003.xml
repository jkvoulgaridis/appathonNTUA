      This trial studies how well comprehensive lifestyle change works in preventing patients from
      breast cancer. A program including dietary recommendations, physical activity, stress
      management and mindfulness training, learning sleep hygiene techniques, and behavioral
      counseling in addition to social support may help patients who may be at risk for breast
      cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess the feasibility of a randomized controlled trial involving a mobile, standardized,
      comprehensive integrative oncology (IO) prevention program.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Compare group differences over time in biological pathways including: immune function, gut
      microbiome, endocrine function, insulin and glucose metabolism, inflammation, other
      cancer-related pathways (from peripheral blood), antioxidant capacity, and nutrient levels.

      II. Determine whether the IO group has improved patient reported outcomes over time
      including: quality of life, sleep disturbances, aspects of mental health, and psychosocial
      measures including: mindfulness, social support, and measures of positive growth.

      III. Compare group differences over time in dietary patterns, fitness levels, percent body
      fat, and anthropometrics.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized into 1 of 2 groups.

      GROUP I: Patients attend IO prevention program consisting of 1-2 physical activity, nutrition
      and diet, and mind-body practice sessions over 60 minutes weekly for 12 weeks. Patients also
      attend a behavioral counseling session once weekly for up to 26 weeks. Patients complete
      exercises over 30-60 minutes 3-5 times weekly for 12 weeks.

      GROUP II: Patients receive no intervention. After 26 weeks, patients may crossover to Group
      I.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 26 weeks and 1 year.

    <description>Will be defined as attending at least 50% of sessions during the intervention delivery weeks (first 26 weeks) in the integrative oncology (IO) group.

    <measure>Group differences over time in biological pathways</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Will first conduct extensive descriptive analyses on the data collected at baseline and at each follow-up. Descriptive statistics including 90% CIs will be computed for the relevant measures. Will examine distribution characteristics of the variables using box plots, histograms, scatter plots, and the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test of normality where appropriate. Distribution assumptions will be evaluated, and if indicated, normalizing transformations or robust procedures will be used. Will evaluate bivariate associations between the outcome measures and selected demographic and medical variables, including age, ethnicity, body mass index, and cancer history using Pearson product-moment correlation coefficients, chi-squared tests, or other methods where appropriate. Will use generalized linear mixed model regression (GLMM). Separate sets of analyses will be conducted for each criterion variable.</description>
