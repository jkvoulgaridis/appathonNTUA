    <textblock>
      Physically healthy adult smokers may be eligible for this study. Volunteers may participate
      in this study if they are 18 - 65 years old.

      Subjects will participate in two separate 7-hour PET/CT Scan Sessions (each with 2 hours of
      actual PET/CT scanning): one following an overnight abstinence and one following two
      overnights of abstinence. To achieve and confirm two overnights of abstinence, participants
      will present to the inpatient CHPS the day prior to the scheduled scan and stay overnight.

      The 2-[18F]-FA PET/CT brain scans will consist of an injection followed by an 7-hour infusion
      of 2-[18F]-FA. The scan session will begin at approximately 4 hours after the bolus
      injection. The PET/CT scan will occur in two segments. Starting at approximately 4 hours post
      bolus and infusion start, we will scan for approximately 90 minutes with a bolus injection of
      IV nicotine that will occur approximately 15 minutes into the scanning procedure. There will
      be a break in scanning of approximately 60 minutes, during which subjects will be allowed to
      get off the scanner and use the restroom, if necessary. The second scan segment will start at
      approximately 6.5 hours post bolus injection, t. This segment will last approximately 30
      minutes. The pre and post nicotine images will be analyzed to evaluate for differences in
      receptor uptake after the nicotine &quot;challenge&quot;.

      Subjects will have a structural Brain MRI performed within 1 year prior to study enrollment
      or subjects who have not had a Brain MRI that is deemed acceptable for use for this study
      will undergo a research Brain MRI after consent.
