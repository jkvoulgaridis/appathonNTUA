    <textblock>
      A randomized double-blind study of the effect of carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) on stool
      microbiota composition, microbiota localization, and metabolic parameters in healthy
      subjects. It includes a 11-day in-patient stay, randomization to an emulsifier-free group or
      a CMC group with the same diet except baked goods/sorbet with added CMC at 15g/person/day.

      This is a randomized double-blind, controlled feeding experiment examining the effect of CMC
      on the stool microbiota composition, gene expression, and microbiota localization with
      respect to the epithelium. In addition, the investigators will assess the impact of CMC
      exposure in the diet on markers of metabolic syndrome including response to oral glucose
      tolerance testing and other plasma metabolite measurements.

      Sixteen healthy volunteers will be recruited for a 11-day in-patient study. All participants
      will receive 3 full days of freshly prepared emulsifier-free food to begin the study. This
      will be called the &quot;washout period&quot;. Participants will then be randomized into an
      &quot;emulsifier-free&quot; arm and a &quot;CMC&quot; arm in a 1:1 ratio.

      Both arms will continue the same diet except that the &quot;CMC&quot; arm's brownie and sorbet will
      have CMC added to achieve a level of 15 gm per person per day consumption. Serial collection
      of fecal, plasma, urine and mucosal biopsy samples will be performed to investigate the
      extent to which CMC consumption by humans impacts the gut microbiota and its interaction with
      the host parameters related to inflammation and metabolism. Participants will have daily
      urine and stool collections. Sigmoidoscopies and glucose tolerance testing will be completed
      on day 1and 11. Blood samples are collected on days 1-4, 8, 10, and 11.

    <description>CMC is one of many synthetic dietary emulsifiers that are incorporated into a variety of processed foods. We have recently shown that, in mice, consumption of P80 and CMC, alters microbiota composition, have pro-inflammatory potential and promote microbiota encroachment into the colonic mucosa, low-grade inflammation, and metabolic syndrome. However, it is not known whether these compounds have similar effects in humans. We would like to study these effects in the human gut microbiota.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Participant is capable of giving informed consent

          2. Participant is age 18 to 60 years

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Diagnosis with IBD, celiac disease, or other chronic intestinal disorders. Since we
             are interested in assessing the impact of diet on the microbiome in the absence of
             pathologic inflammation, we will exclude participants with chronic intestinal
             abnormalities.

          2. Baseline bowel frequency less than every 2 days or greater than 3 times daily. Normal
             bowel frequency is every 3rd day to 3 times per day.20-23 Although unknown, stool
             frequency could be related to the microbiome composition.24-26 Furthermore, change in
             diet could alter baseline stool frequency, potentially causing diarrhea, particularly
             in those with high baseline stool frequency, or severe constipation in those with low
             stool frequency. To avoid the need for use of antidiarrheal medications or laxatives,
             which themselves could alter the microbiome composition, these patients will be
             excluded.

          3. Current smoker. What effect smoking has on the microbiome of the gut is unknown.
             Furthermore, because our hospital is a smoke-free environment, volunteers will not be
             able to smoke. Thus, inclusion of smokers would increase the risk of early withdrawal
             from the study.

          4. Body Mass Index (BMI) &lt;18.5 or &gt;40 at screening. Volunteers with BMI below normal27
             will be excluded to prevent inclusion of participants with a subclinical systemic
             disease that may influence the gut microbiome. Volunteers with severe obesity will be
             excluded as obesity may be associated with altered gut microbiome composition.

          5. More than two of the criteria for metabolic syndrome:

               -  A waist circumference greater than 35 inches (89 centimeters) for women and 40
                  inches (102 centimeters) for men at screening.

               -  A diagnosis of diabetes mellitus or baseline HbA1c &gt; 6.4% or a fasting glucose
                  level of greater than 100mg/dL

               -  Systolic blood pressure &gt;130 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure &gt;85 mmHg or treated
                  with medications for hypertension at screening.

               -  Fasting triglycerides &gt;149 mg/dl or treated with medications for
                  hypertriglyceridemia

               -  Fasting HDL cholesterol &lt;40 mg/dl in men or &lt;50 mg/dl in women or treated with
                  medications for hypercholesterolemia

          6. Known substance abuse disorder or consumption of illicit drugs or alcohol in the 24
             hours prior to admission to the Center for Human Phenomic Science (CHPS).

          7. Prior bowel resection surgery other than appendectomy. It is unknown how prior bowel
             resection surgery may influence the microbiome composition, hence we will exclude
             these participants.

          8. Contraindication to flexible sigmoidoscopy and biopsies. Patients with suppressed
             white blood count may be at increased risk of systemic infection following
             sigmoidoscopy with biopsies. As such, participants with a WBC less than 3,500 or an
             absolute neutrophil count of less than 1,000 will be excluded. Patients with
             thrombocytopenia or with a coagulopathy may be at increased risk of bleeding
             complications after colonoscopic biopsies. As such, patients with a platelet count of
             less than 100,000 or an INR greater than 1.2 will be excluded from the study.

          9. Estimated GFR&lt;60ml/min/1.73m2 based on measured serum creatinine concentration

         10. Pregnant and lactating women. To avoid any risk to an unborn fetus or new born baby
             from changing the mother's diet, pregnant and lactating women will be excluded.

         11. Use of antibiotics in the 6 months prior to Visit 2. A small proportion of bacteria
             may require 6 months to recover after treatment with antibiotics.28

         12. Use of antacids, NSAIDs, or dietary supplements in the week prior to Visit 2. NSAIDs
             have been associated with C. difficile colitis, although whether this is causative and
             whether this is mediated through changing the fecal microbiota composition is
             unknown.29 Antacids could potentially alter the gut microbiota by changing the acid
             milieu or by altering fecal transit time. For our study purposes, multivitamins will
             not be considered dietary supplements.

         13. Use of laxatives or anti-diarrhea medications in the two weeks prior to Visit 2.

         14. Use of anticholinergics in the week prior Visit 2.

         15. Use of narcotics in the week prior to Visit 2.

         16. HIV infection, AIDS, or other known conditions resulting in immunosuppression - we
             will determine this by direct participant query; no formal testing will be done.

         17. Allergies or intolerance to the components of the study diets.

         18. Participant has experienced diarrhea within the two weeks prior to Visit 2. Diarrhea
             is defined as a change in bowel habits with an increased frequency or loose stools
             such that the stool could not be lifted with a fork.

         19. Refusal to use a medically accepted method of birth control while participating in
             this study, such as a barrier method, hormonal contraceptives, implanted birth control
             devices, permanent methods (such as a vasectomy), and/or abstinence.

         20. Vegans and Vegetarians.

         21. Student or employee of any one of the investigators.

         22. Anyone who cannot receive study payment (ie: visa)

         23. Any condition that the investigator feels may limit the volunteer's ability to
             complete the study protocol.
