    <textblock>
      Initial performance of Ga-68-P16-093 in prostate cancer patients including dosimetry and
      preliminary efficacy evaluation in BCR patients, and correlation of Ga-68-P16-093 uptake with
      tissue histopathology in intermediate to high risk primary prostate cancer patients.

    <measure>Sensitivity of Ga-68-P16-093 in BCR</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>We will compare the number and location of metastatic lesions apparently detected by 68Ga-P16-093 with the number and location of lesions detected by standard-of-care imaging. Sensitivity of the 68Ga-P16-093 PET procedure will be estimated based on the number of subjects in whom a site of disease is identified by the imaging procedure. Scans will also be reconstructed summing passes 1-5, passes 2-5, passes 3-5, and passes 1-2 to assess how image quality varies with chosen framing.</description>

    <measure>The proportion of patients for whom Ga-18-P16-093 PET/CT changes treatment through detection of lesions</measure>

    <description>Change in management will be based on physician questionnaires including confirmation of actual treatment.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Sensitivity and Specificity of Ga-68-P16-093 in primary PCa</measure>
    <time_frame>2-60 days following PET/CT scan</time_frame>
    <description>We will estimate the sensitivity and specificity of the 68Ga-P16-093 PET imaging by comparing the PET SUV values and whole-mount pathology findings on a sextant basis (6 sextants per subject x 10 subjects). Images will be evaluated from ~ 5 min to 60 minutes of scanning in 5-10 minutes up to 45 min frames.</description>

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria (Cohort 1):

          -  Male ≥ 18 years of age

          -  Prostate cancer patients presenting with rising PSA after radical prostatectomy for
             treatment if primary disease.

          -  PSA ≥ 0.2 ng/mL

          -  Patients must give informed consent for the research study, and agree to allow
             investigator access to clinical results following treatment plan implementation such
             as description of the treatment plan and PSA values following implementation of
             treatment plan as part of standard care, typically determined 3-4 months after
             treatment.

        Inclusion Criteria (Cohort 2):

          -  Male ≥ 18 years of age

          -  Histologically confirmed prostate cancer with following Gleason scoring at biopsy:

               -  Gleason ≥ 4+3 OR

               -  Gleason 3+4 with &gt;30% pattern 4 or ≥3 cores positive

          -  Scheduled for radical prostatectomy (expected to occur within 60-days of scanning)

          -  Patients must give informed consent for the research study, and agree to allow
             investigator access to the clinical results such as SOC imaging (mpMRI, e.g.) for
             surgical planning if done, or biopsy data following prostatectomy including lymph node
             dissection biopsy data, if available.

        Exclusion Criteria (Cohorts 1&amp; 2):

          -  Inability to give informed consent.

          -  Patient is unable to tolerate remaining still on the bed of the PET camera, due to
             physical limitations or claustrophobia.

          -  Significant acute or chronic medical, neurologic, or illness in the subject that, in
             the judgment of the Clinical Investigators, could compromise subject safety, limit the
             ability to complete the study, and/or compromise the objectives of the study
