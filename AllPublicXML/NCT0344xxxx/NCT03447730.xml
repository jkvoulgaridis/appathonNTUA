    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1b/2a, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the
      safety, tolerability and pharmacodynamics of SYNB1020 in hepatic insufficiency and cirrhosis
      patients.

      This study consists of two parts:

      Part 1 (Completed):

      A sentinel open-label cohort of subjects with cirrhosis and Model for End-Stage Liver Disease
      (MELD) score &lt;12 will be admitted to an inpatient facility for a run in diet, baseline
      assessments, IP administration, safety monitoring, and collection of blood, urine, and fecal
      samples for evaluation of safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics and PD evaluations. Once
      the safety and tolerability have been established in Part 1, enrollment will be opened to
      subjects in Part 2.

      Part 2:

      Part 2 of the trial will comprise a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study in
      subjects with cirrhosis and hyperammonemia. Subjects may be pre screened for eligibility
      based on medical history and a single fasting spot venous ammonia measurement. Eligible
      subjects with elevated fasting spot venous ammonia will then undergo full screening within 7
      days of pre screening. Eligible subjects will be admitted to an inpatient facility for a
      run-in diet and 24-hour ammonia profile, and those with an elevated 24-hour ammonia AUC will
      proceed with randomization, IP administration, safety monitoring, and collection of blood,
      urine, and fecal samples for pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic (PD) evaluations.
