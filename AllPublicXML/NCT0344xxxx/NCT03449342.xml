    <textblock>
      This study will test the well-known medicine turoctocog alfa for any side effects. The
      purpose is to test turoctocog alfa for any side effects in the Indian population. The
      participants will get turoctocog alfa. Turoctocog alfa is already a well-known medicine in
      India, and can be prescribed by the study doctor. The participants will get an injection
      every second day or 3 times per week. This is decided by the study doctor. The study doctor
      will decide the amount and how often the participants must take the medicine. The study will
      last for about 16 weeks. The participants will have 5 visits with the study doctor. If the
      participants agree to participate in this study, the participants will receive the first
      injection at the second visit, thereafter the participants will be trained to do the
      injection by themself.

    <measure>Incidence of Adverse Drug Reactions (ARs) and Serious Adverse Reactions (SARs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 0-12</time_frame>
    <description>Incidence of adverse drug reactions (ARs) and serious adverse reactions (SARs) were calculated as the number of adverse reactions per patient years. All presented ARs and SARs are treatment emergent and related to trial product, which were defined as the events reported after trial product administration until the follow-up, 12 weeks after first treatment.</description>

    <measure>Number of Bleeding Episodes With Successful Haemostatic Effect of Turoctocog Alfa</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 0-8</time_frame>
    <description>The haemostatic effect (HE) of turoctocog alfa when used for treatment of bleeding episodes was evaluated during 8 weeks of treatment. Successful haemostatic effect means the haemostatic response when used for treatment of a bleeding episode was either excellent or good. Excellent haemostatic respose: Abrupt pain relief and/or clear improvement in objective signs of bleeding episode within approximately 8 hours after a single injection. Good haemostatic response: Definite pain relief and/or improvement in signs of bleeding episode within approximately 8 hours after an injection, but possibly requiring more than 1 injection for complete resolution.</description>

        <title>Number of Bleeding Episodes With Successful Haemostatic Effect of Turoctocog Alfa</title>
        <description>The haemostatic effect (HE) of turoctocog alfa when used for treatment of bleeding episodes was evaluated during 8 weeks of treatment. Successful haemostatic effect means the haemostatic response when used for treatment of a bleeding episode was either excellent or good. Excellent haemostatic respose: Abrupt pain relief and/or clear improvement in objective signs of bleeding episode within approximately 8 hours after a single injection. Good haemostatic response: Definite pain relief and/or improvement in signs of bleeding episode within approximately 8 hours after an injection, but possibly requiring more than 1 injection for complete resolution.</description>

        <title>Incidence of Allergic or Infusion Reactions Related to the Trial Product</title>
        <description>Incidence of allergic or infusion reactions related to trial products were calculated as the number of reactions per patient years. Allergic reactions are a class of adverse events related to allergy.</description>

            <description>Participants were to receive prophylactic (preventive) treatment of turoctocog alfa as intravenous (i.v.) injections at a frequency of ‘every second day’ or ‘3 times a week’ at a dose in the range of 20-50 IU/kg at the investigator’s discretion. Dosing for prophylaxis was according to the approved prescribing information. The total treatment duration for each participant was 8 weeks. Bleeds were treated with one or more turoctocog alfa intravenous (i.v.) bolus injections. The individual dose levels were decided by the investigator based on recommendations from the World Federation of Hemophilia (WFH). Participants who underwent surgery were treated with turoctocog alfa according to WFH recommendations.</description>
