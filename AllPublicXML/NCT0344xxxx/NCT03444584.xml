      A Phase 2 study Comparing the effects on glucose control of MEDI0382 in combination with
      Dapagliflozin and Metformin compared to placebo in combination with Dapagliflozin and
      Metformin in overweight/obese participants with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM).

    <textblock>
      This is an exploratory randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the
      efficacy and safety of MEDI0382 versus placebo in overweight/obese participants with T2DM
      treated with metformin and dapagliflozin dual therapy. The study will enroll participants
      with T2DM treated either with metformin monotherapy or with metformin and dapagliflozin dual
      therapy. After the screening period, participants treated with metformin monotherapy only
      will enter a 4-week run-in period where participants will be administered oral dapagliflozin
      10 mg a day, which will be provided by the sponsor. Enrolled participants that are already
      treated with metformin and dapagliflozin dual therapy will continue this dual therapy
      throughout the study and can be randomized after the screening period without entering the
      run-in period. All participants (ie, on monotherapy and dual therapy) entering the
      double-blind treatment period will receive dapagliflozin 10 mg a day, which will be provided
      by the sponsor.

      Participants in this study will participate for up to 20 weeks including a screening period
      of up to 60 days, a 4-week run-in period (for participants on metformin monotherapy only), a
      4-week treatment period, and a 4-week follow-up post-treatment period.

    <description>An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. A serious adverse event (SAE) is an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life threatening experience(immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. The TEAEs are defined as events present at baseline that worsened in intensity after administration of study drug or events absent at baseline that emerged after administration of study drug.</description>

             (maximum dose of 300 mg/day), or metformin (MTD &gt; 1 g) with empaglifozin (maximum dose
             of 25mg/day) for at least 3 months prior to screening may be eligible to enter the
             study after switching to dapagliflozin.

          8. Female participants of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test at
             screening and randomization and must not be lactating.

             is strongly recommended for the male partner of a female participant to also use male
             condom plus spermicide throughout this period. Cessation of contraception after this
             point should be discussed with a responsible physician. Periodic abstinence, the
             rhythm method, and the withdrawal method are not acceptable methods of contraception.

        <description>An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship.

The TEAEs are defined as events present at baseline that worsened in intensity after administration of study drug or events absent at baseline that emerged after administration of study drug.</description>
