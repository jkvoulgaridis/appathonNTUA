  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      The development of new technologies now allow scientists to investigate the molecular basis
      and clinical manifestations of monoclonal B cell lymphocytosis (MBL), chronic lymphocytic
      leukemia(CLL)/small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL), lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (LPL)/Waldenstrom
      macroglobulinemia (WM), and splenic marginal zone lymphoma (SMZL). Applying these methods in
      a natural history study can clarify processes involved in disease progression and possibly
      lead to the discovery or validation of treatment targets.

        -  Objectives:

             -  Study the history of MBL/CLL/SLL/LPL/WM/SMZL in patients prior to and after
                treatment.

             -  Characterize clinical, biologic and molecular events of disease stability and
                progression of patients enrolled on this protocol.

        -  Eligibility:

             -  Diagnosis of MBL/CLL/SLL/LPL/WM/SMZL

             -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years.

             -  Patients with CLL/SLL in remission after chemotherapy are excluded.

             -  ECOG performance status of 0-2.

        -  Design:

             -  Patients are typically followed every 6 to 24 months in the clinic and have blood
                drawn. When required patients may undergo additional testing that may include bone
                marrow biopsy and aspiration, blood drawing, lymph node biopsy, x-ray studies,
                positron emission tomography and CT and MRI scans. Some of these tests may be
                required to monitor CLL/SLL, LPL/WM, and SMZL patients. Other tests, such as bone
                marrow biopsy and aspiration, lymph node biopsy, may not be clinically indicated,
                but patients may be asked to undergo these procedures for research purposes.

             -  No treatment will be administered on this study. If a patients requires treatment
                for their cancer, available NIH clinical trials and alternative treatment options
                will be discussed with the patient.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this protocol is to collect blood, tissue (bone marrow and lymph node
      biopsies) and/or imaging studies (PET and CT scans) from patients with monoclonal B cell
      lymphocytosis (MBL) chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphoma (CLL/SLL), lymphoplasmacytic
      lymphoma (LPL)/Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia (WM), and splenic marginal zone lymphoma (SMZL).

      Assessments will be used for clinical and translational research investigating the molecular
      basis of MBL, CLL/SLL, LPL/WM, SMZL and their clinical manifestations. New technologies now
      permit the simultaneous characterization of pathogenic events ranging from the control of
      gene expression to the characterization of the molecular events of cell-cell interactions.
      Applying these methods to MBL/CLL/SLL/LPL/WM/SMZL in the context of a natural history
      protocol can help unravel cellular pathways involved in pathogenesis and disease progression
      and lead to the discovery or the validation of therapeutic targets. MBL/CLL/SLL/LPL/WM/SMZL
      is an incurable disease for which there are no reliable cell lines and only a few mouse
      models. There is an urgent need to obtain a flow of primary samples to advance research into
      pathogenesis and novel treatment approaches.

        -  Eligibility:

             -  Diagnosis of MBL/CLL/SLL/LPL/WM/SMZL

             -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years.

             -  ECOG performance status of 0-2.

        -  Design:

      Patients will be typically followed every 6-12 months for the first 2 years and every 12-24
      months thereafter. Interim visits may occur at the discretion of the research team. Patients
      may donate cellular products or tissues as appropriate for research purposes. Clinical
      information will be obtained and stored in a central databank.

        -  Objectives:

             -  Describe the history of MBL/CLL/SLL/WM/SMZL in patients prior to and after
                treatment.

             -  Apply the expertise and available technologies of the investigators to advance our
                understanding of disease pathogenesis by studying MBL/CLL/SLL and closely related
                B-cell malignancies, LPL/WM and SMZL

             -  Develop novel treatment approaches for CLL/SLL/LPL/WM/SMZL.

             -  Provide evaluation, diagnostic studies and monitoring for patients on study.

             -  Provide blood and tissue linked to clinical and biologic information for
                translational studies.

        -  Endpoints:

             -  Treatment free survival, measured as the time from dianosis or last therapy to the
                development of active disease that requires treatment at which time patients will
                be able to change to a treatment protocol or seek treatment outside of NIH.

             -  Describe the underlying biologic heterogeneity of tumor cells in relation to
                treatment free survival.
