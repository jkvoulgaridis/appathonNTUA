  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is two-fold. (1) We will determine if in mid- to late pubertal
      girls without hyperandrogenism (HA), progesterone (P4) acutely reduces waking luteinizing
      hormone (LH) frequency to a greater extent than sleep-associated LH frequency. (2) We will
      determine if in mid- to late pubertal girls with HA, P4 will acutely suppress waking LH
      frequency to a lesser degree than it does in girls without HA.

    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded crossover study to test the
      following hypotheses: (1) In normal mid- to late pubertal girls without hyperandrogenism
      (HA), progesterone acutely suppresses waking LH pulse frequency more than sleep-associated LH
      pulse frequency; and (2) compared to normal mid- to late pubertal girls without HA, acute
      progesterone suppression of waking LH pulse frequency is impaired in mid- to late pubertal
      girls with HA. Studies will be performed in mid- to late pubertal girls (at least Tanner
      breast stage 3 but no more than 2 years postmenarcheal). Subjects will complete two 18-hour
      Clinical Research Unit (CRU) admissions in separate menstrual cycles. Immediately before and
      during the first CRU admission, either oral micronized progesterone (0.8 mg/kg/dose) or
      placebo (randomized) will be given at 0700, 1500, 2300, and 0700 h. During the CRU admission,
      blood will be obtained every 10 minutes through an indwelling iv catheter from 1800 to 1200
      h. This will allow full characterization of pulsatile LH secretion in addition to other
      hormone measurements. A second CRU admission (performed at least 2 months later given blood
      withdrawal limits) will be identical to the first except that placebo will exchanged for
      progesterone or vice versa (treatment crossover). The primary endpoint is LH pulse frequency
      while awake. (LH pulse frequency while asleep is an important secondary endpoint.) Results in
      pubertal girls without HA were recently published (Kim et al, J Clin Endocrinol Metab
      2018;103:1112-1121). Data from girls with HA will be compared to recently-published results
      in girls without HA. Mean LH pulse frequency while awake will be analyzed via a hierarchical
      linear mixed model (HLMM). HA status (HA vs. non-HA), sleep status (wake vs. sleep), and
      treatment (progesterone vs. placebo) will represent fixed-effects, along with all associated
      interactions. Random effects will be used to account for hierarchical variance-covariance
      structure of the crossover study design. With regard to hypothesis testing, the association
      between HA status and wake LH pulse frequency will be evaluated via linear contrasts of HLMM
      least squares pulse frequency means. The differential impact of exogenous progesterone on
      wake LH pulse frequency in pubertal girls with and without HA (primary analysis) will be
      evaluated via the same testing method. Using published and preliminary data, we determined
      that, if 16 pubertal girls with HA complete both admissions, we should have at least an 80%
      chance of detecting a 0.2 pulse/hour differential effect of P4 on wake LH pulse frequency
      between the HA and the non-HA groups with a two-sided false positive rejection rate of no
      more than 0.05.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Mid- to late pubertal adolescent girl (at least Tanner breast stage 3, but no more
             than 2 years postmenarcheal)

          -  For girls without hyperandrogenism: serum (calculated) free testosterone concentration
             within the Tanner stage-specific reference range and the absence of hirsutism

          -  For girls with hyperandrogenism: serum (calculated) free testosterone concentration
             greater than the Tanner stage-specific reference range and/or unequivocal evidence for
             hirsutism

          -  General good health (excepting overweight, obesity, hyperandrogenism, and
             adequately-treated hypothyroidism)

          -  Capable of and willing to provide informed assent (adolescents under age 16 years)
             and/or consent (adolescents over age 16 years; custodial parents or guardians of all
             adolescent volunteers)

          -  Willing to strictly avoid pregnancy with use of reliable non-hormonal methods during
             the study period

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Inability/incapacity to provide informed consent

          -  Males will be excluded (hyperandrogenism is unique to females)

          -  Obesity resulting from a well-defined endocrinopathy or genetic syndrome

          -  Positive pregnancy test or current lactation

          -  Evidence for non-physiologic or non-PCOS causes of hyperandrogenism and/or anovulation

          -  Evidence of virilization (e.g., rapidly progressive hirsutism, deepening of the voice,
             clitoromegaly)

          -  Total testosterone &gt; 150 ng/dl, which suggests the possibility of virilizing ovarian
             or adrenal tumor

          -  DHEA-S elevation &gt; 1.5 times the upper reference range limit. Mild elevations may be
             seen in adolescent HA and in PCOS, and will be accepted in these groups.

          -  Early morning 17-hydroxyprogesterone &gt; 200 ng/dl measured in the follicular phase,
             which suggests the possibility of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (if elevated during
             the luteal phase, the 17-hydroxyprogesterone will be repeated during the follicular
             phase). NOTE: If a 17-hydroxyprogesterone &gt; 200 ng/dl is confirmed on repeat testing,
             an ACTH stimulated 17-hydroxyprogesterone &lt; 1000 ng/dl will be required for study
             participation.

          -  Abnormal thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH): Note that subjects with stable and
             adequately treated primary hypothyroidism, reflected by normal TSH values, will not be
             excluded.

          -  Hyperprolactinemia: Mild prolactin elevations may be seen in HA/PCOS, and elevations
             within 20% higher than the upper limit of normal will be accepted in this group.

          -  History and/or physical exam findings suggestive of Cushing's syndrome, adrenal
             insufficiency, or acromegaly

          -  History and/or physical exam findings suggestive of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism
             (e.g., symptoms of estrogen deficiency) including functional hypothalamic amenorrhea
             (which may be suggested by a constellation of symptoms including restrictive eating
             patterns, excessive exercise, psychological stress, etc.)

          -  Hematocrit &lt; 36% and hemoglobin &lt; 12 g/dl.

          -  Severe thrombocytopenia (platelets &lt; 50,000 cells/microliter) or leukopenia (total
             white blood count &lt; 4,000 cells/microliter)

          -  Previous diagnosis of diabetes, fasting glucose &gt; or = 126 mg/dl, or a hemoglobin A1c
             &gt; or = 6.5%

          -  Persistent liver panel abnormalities, with two exceptions. Mild bilirubin elevations
             will be accepted in the setting of known Gilbert's syndrome. Also, mild transaminase
             elevations may be seen in obesity/HA/PCOS; therefore, elevations &lt; 1.5 times the upper
             limit of normal will be accepted in such girls.

          -  Significant history of cardiac or pulmonary dysfunction (e.g., known or suspected
             congestive heart failure, asthma requiring intermittent systemic corticosteroids,
             etc.)

          -  Decreased renal function evidenced by GFR &lt; 60 ml/min/1.73m2

          -  A personal history of breast, ovarian, or endometrial cancer

          -  History of any other cancer diagnosis and/or treatment (with the exception of basal
             cell or squamous cell skin carcinoma) unless they have remained clinically disease
             free (based on appropriate surveillance) for five years

          -  History of allergy to micronized progesterone.

          -  Body mass index (BMI)-for-age percentile &lt; 5% (underweight)

          -  Due to the amount of blood being drawn, adolescent volunteers with body weight &lt; 25 kg
             will be excluded.

          -  Restrictions on use of other drugs or treatments: No medications known to affect the
             reproductive system, glucose metabolism, lipid metabolism, or blood pressure can be
             taken in the 2 months prior to the screening visit and in the 3 months prior to the
             start of the study medications. Such medications include oral contraceptive pills,
             progestins, metformin, systemic glucocorticoids, some antipsychotic medications, and
             sympathomimetics/stimulants (e.g., methylphenidate).
