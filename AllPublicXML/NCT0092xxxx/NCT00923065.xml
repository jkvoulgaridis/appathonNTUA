      This study provides cancer care through the National Cancer Institute's Medical Oncology
      Branch (MOB) to patients who are not enrolled in an active treatment research protocol.
      Patients receive standard treatments only; no investigational therapies are provided on this
      protocol.

      Patients 18 years of age and older may be eligible for this protocol. Candidates are patients
      for whom an NCI investigator decides that the interests of the patient and the NCI are best
      served by the patient's enrollment in this protocol to receive care and follow-up within the
      MOB. This includes patients in the following categories:

        -  Patients previously enrolled in NCI trials whose participation in this protocol may
           continue to provide researchers important scientific information

        -  Patients who will be eligible for a research protocol within the foreseeable future

        -  Patients whose medical welfare will be seriously compromised by referral back to the
           community, such as patients with a rare or complex disease for which community resources
           are inadequate or unavailable

        -  Terminally ill patients who have received most of their specialized medical care at the
           Clinical Center and for whom humanitarian considerations dictate that they continue to
           receive their medical care at NIH after going off study for the remaining weeks or
           months of life

        -  Patients with cancer or HIV, or people at risk for cancer or HIV for whom cancer
           treatments at the NCI are requested through the MOB consult service

        -  Patients who are participating in a non-treatment NCI research protocol and require
           standard-of-care therapy

        -  Patients with cancer or HIV or people at risk for cancer for whom cancer treatment or
           management at the NCI would add significant value to the institute's cancer training
           program

      Participants receive standard medical care, including periodic routine laboratory tests,
      diagnostic x-rays, and nuclear medicine scans to monitor the course of illness and the
      effects of any treatment.

      Background:

      It may be in the interest of the Center for Cancer Research (CCR) to evaluate, provide
      treatment/interventions and/or follow certain eligible subjects.

      Objective:

      The objective of this protocol is to add value to the medical or surgical oncology training
      programs by providing consult, treatment and medical follow-up for NCI patients, donors to
      NCI patients and other Institute patients and individuals, as specified.

      Eligibility:

      It is in the best interests of the subject and the CCR for the subject to receive a medical
      evaluation, treatment, or follow-up, or to donate cellular products at the NCI, NIH
      Intramural Research Program.

      Design:

        -  No investigational therapies will be administered on this study. This protocol is not a
           platform to perform pilot studies of off-label uses for standard agents.

        -  This protocol will provide the administrative vehicle to provide cancer care for
           patients in the intramural research program.

        -  This protocol will provide the administrative vehicle for NCI investigators to provide
           consult services to individuals.

        -  Medical/surgical/radiotherapeutic care, treatment and follow-up is provided for eligible
           subjects.

        treatment protocol or by providers outside the NIH.
