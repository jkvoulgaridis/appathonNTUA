  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      The NCI Surgery Branch has developed experimental therapies that involve taking white blood
      cells from patients' tumor or from their blood, growing them in the laboratory in large
      numbers, and then giving the cells back to the patient.

      Objective:

      This study will allow patients to be followed for up to 15 years following treatment on an
      NCI Surgery Branch Gene Therapy Trial as required by the FDA.

      Eligibility:

      Patients must have been enrolled on an NCI Surgery Branch Gene Therapy Protocol

      Design

      Patients will be followed with a physical examination and blood tests for up to 15 years as
      required by the FDA

      Background:

        -  Patients receiving care at the NIH Clinical Center are required to be enrolled on a
           clinical protocol.

        -  Following participation in a treatment protocol, it may be in the best interest of the
           patient to continue to be followed at the Clinical Center.

        -  The National Cancer Institute Surgery Branch (NCI-SB) conducts clinical trials utilizing
           gene transfer. The current U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requirements for
           long-term follow-up are up to fifteen years for some products. As this time-period is
           frequently longer than studies are expected to be open, a long-term follow-up protocol
           is necessary to ensure the follow-up of these subjects.

      Objective:

      -Primary objective:

      --Provide a mechanism for long-term follow-up of subjects who have participated in research
      studies in the NCI-SB.

      Eligibility:

        -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years.

        -  Patient has been enrolled on an NCI-SB treatment protocol.

      Design:

      -Patients will undergo physical exams, laboratory evaluation, imaging, or phone follow-up as
      required by the treatment protocol and/or as clinically indicated.
