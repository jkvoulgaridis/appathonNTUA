  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, observer-masked, controlled study. Subjects will be patients undergoing
      bilateral total knee arthroplasty (TKA). One side (left or right) will be randomized to one
      of two treatment groups: a postoperative ropivacaine concentration of 0.1% or 0.4%. The
      contralateral side will receive the other possible ropivacaine concentration of 0.1% or 0.4%.
      The basal rate and patient-controlled bolus volume will depend upon the treatment group, but
      the total dose of local anesthetic is the same for each. For the duration of the study, all
      patients will receive the current usual and customary analgesics for bilateral TKA patients.
      All patients will receive a ropivacaine perineural infusions initiated in the operating room
      and continued until at least the afternoon of postoperative day (POD) 2, as well as oral
      acetaminophen, a sustained-release oral opioid; and celecoxib. Rescue opioid and route of
      administration will be determined by pain severity using a Numeric Rating Scale of 0-10, with
      0 equal to no pain and 10 being the worst imaginable pain.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to test the null hypothesis that differing concentrations of
      ropivacaine (0.1% vs. 0.4%) at an equal total dose has no impact on quadriceps muscle
      strength during a continuous femoral nerve block following total knee arthroplasty (TKA).
      These results will help define the optimal concentration of local anesthetic used for
      continuous peripheral nerve blocks.

0.1% and 0.4% perineural ropivicaine: Patients will be randomized to one of two groups: Ropivicaine 0.1% infusion on the right leg and Ropivicaine 0.4% infusion on the left leg, or Ropivicaine 0.4% infusion on the right leg and Ropiviciane 0.1% infusion on the left leg for treatment of postoperative pain following bilateral TKA. Both groups will receive the same total dose of medication and will have the infusion for the two days following surgery.</description>

          <title>Quadriceps Femoris Muscle Strength Maximum Voluntary Isometric Contraction (MVIC)</title>
          <description>A device was used called a dynamometer to measure the force during maximum voluntary isometric contraction. The dynamometer was placed on ipsilateral anterior tibia perpendicular to the tibial crest, just proximal to the medial malleolus. Subjects were asked to take 2 seconds to come to maximum effort contracting the quadriceps, maintain this effort for 5 seconds, and then relax.</description>
