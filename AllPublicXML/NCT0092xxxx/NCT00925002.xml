    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 3, open-label study designed to obtain additional long-term safety and
      efficacy data for oral tafamidis (20 mg soft gelatin capsule) administered once daily (QD).
      In addition, this study continued to provide tafamidis to Val30Met subjects who had completed
      Protocol Fx-006 (a 1-year, open-label extension study to Protocol Fx-005 which was a
      randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 18-month study to evaluate the safety and
      efficacy of tafamidis) or non-Val30Met subjects who had completed Protocol Fx1A-201 (a Phase
      2, open-label study to evaluate TTR stabilization, safety, and tolerability of tafamidis) for
      up to 10 years or until subjects had access to tafamidis for ATTR-PN via prescription. Upon
      regulatory approval for the treatment of ATTR-PN in their respective country and access to
      prescription tafamidis, subjects may have been withdrawn from the study. Such subjects were
      considered study completers.

        Key Inclusion criteria:

          -  Subject had successfully completed either Protocol Fx-006 or Fx-1A-201.

          -  Male or female subjects with ATTR-PN who had not undergone liver or heart
             transplantation at time of enrollment.

          -  If female, subject was post-menopausal, surgically sterilized, or willing to use an
             acceptable method of birth control

          -  Pregnant or breast feeding female subjects.

          -  Clinically significant medical condition that, in the opinion of the investigator,
             would place the subject at an increased risk to participate in the study.

          -  An alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) value &gt;3 ×
             upper limit of normal (ULN) that, in the medical judgment of the investigator, was due
