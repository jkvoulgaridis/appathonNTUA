      This study will collect tumor samples from people with cancers of the blood, bone marrow, or
      lymph glands for laboratory study of the biology of these conditions. Such studies contribute
      to a better understanding of cancer biology and to the development of new treatments. Planned
      studies include:

        -  Examination of individual cancer cells and to search for differences compared to other
           types of cancer and normal cells

        -  Examination of the chromosomes and genes in cancer cells and to search for differences
           compared to other types of cancer and normal cells

        -  Development of sensitive methods to detect small amounts of cancer that remain after
           treatment

        -  Search for new cancer proteins that might serve as targets for treatment

        -  Investigation of methods to develop cancer vaccines.

      Patients from birth to 75 years of age with acute lymphocytic leukemia, acute myelogenous
      leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, chronic myelogenous leukemia, juvenile myelomonocytic
      leukemia, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, Hodgkin's disease, and other hematologic malignancies may
      be eligible for this study.

      Blood or bone marrow samples will be collected when sampling is required for the patient's
      medical care. Cells from some individuals will be grown in test tubes, establishing cell
      lines or in animals, establishing xenograft models. (A xenograft is transplantation of cells
      of one species to another species.)

      Background:

      Laboratory-based investigations have contributed to an improved understanding of
      pathophysiology and to the development of new therapies for hematologic malignancies.

      The aim of this protocol is to facilitate biologic study of leukemias, pre-malignant
      conditions, myelodysplastic syndromes, lymphomas, and other blood disorders.

      This is a sample acquisition protocol for targeted study of hematologic malignancies by a
      collaborative network of NIH investigators from multiple Institutes/Centers.

      Objective:

      This biology protocol is designed to allow sample acquisition for use in the study of
      hematologic malignancies. A variety of laboratory investigations designed to support NIH
      translational trials; to apply new methodologies in the study of cellular, and molecular
      biology; to probe for new therapeutic targets; and to develop new treatment approaches will
      be performed.

      Eligibility:

      Diagnosis of any hematologic malignancy or pre-malignant conditions, including but not
      restricted to the following: Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia (ALL), Acute Myelogenous Leukemia
      (AML), Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS), Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia (CML), Juvenile
      Myelomonocytic Leukemia (JMML, J-CML), Non-Hodgkin s Lymphoma (NHL), Hodgkin s Disease

      Tumor tissue that has been previously collected and is available for study or that can be
      collected with minimal additional risk to the subject during sampling required for routine
      patient care.

      Patient age: birth to 75 years.

      Design:

      Biologic assays relevant to the investigation of hematologic malignancies will be performed
      in an exploratory fashion, some studies are developmental, i.e., assay design in support of
      current or planned CC clinical trials. Others are standard assays that will be applied in
      attempt to identify new targets or test new therapeutic approaches.
