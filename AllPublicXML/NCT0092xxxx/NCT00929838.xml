  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Blacks or African Americans have greater risk of and are more likely to die from type 2
      diabetes (T2DM). Major barriers to effective diabetes care for Blacks include poor diabetes
      knowledge, self-management skills, empowerment, and perceived control. Few prior studies have
      tested interventions to address these barriers in combination, especially among Blacks who
      have the greatest burden of diabetes related complications. This study provides a unique
      opportunity to address this gap in the literature by testing the efficacy of separate and
      combined telephone-delivered, diabetes knowledge and motivation/behavioral skills training
      intervention in high risk Blacks with poorly controlled T2DM. The findings of this study, if
      successful, will provide new information on how to improve quality of care for diabetes in
      ethnic minorities and reduce the disproportionate burden of diabetes complications and deaths
      in this population.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Blacks (African Americans) with Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) have higher prevalence of diabetes,
      poorer metabolic control, and greater risk for complications and death compared to Whites.
      Poor outcomes in Blacks with T2DM can be attributed to patient, provider, and health systems
      level factors. Provider and health system factors account for &lt;10% of variance in major
      diabetes outcomes. Key differences appear to be at the patient level. Of the patient level
      factors, consistent differences between Blacks and Whites with T2DM have been found in
      diabetes knowledge, self-management skills, empowerment, and perceived control. A variety of
      interventions to improve diabetes self-management have been tested including: 1) knowledge
      interventions; 2) lifestyle interventions; 3) skills training interventions; and 4) patient
      activation and empowerment interventions. Most of these interventions have been tested
      individually, but rarely have they been tested in combination, especially among Blacks who
      have the greatest burden of diabetes related complications. This study provides a unique
      opportunity to address this gap in the literature. Using a 2x2 factorial design, this study
      will test the efficacy of separate and combined telephone-delivered, diabetes
      knowledge/information and motivation/behavioral skills training intervention in high risk
      Blacks with poorly controlled T2DM (HbA1c ≥9%). The primary objective is to test the separate
      and combined efficacy of a telephone-delivered diabetes knowledge/information intervention
      and motivation/behavioral skills training intervention in improving HbA1c levels in Blacks
      with T2DM using a 2x2 factorial design. The secondary objectives are: 1) To determine whether
      patients randomized to the telephone-delivered diabetes knowledge/information intervention,
      the motivation/behavioral skills training intervention or the combined intervention will have
      greater improvement in physical activity, diet, medication adherence, and self-monitoring of
      blood glucose at 12 months of follow-up compared to usual care; and 2) To determine the
      cost-effectiveness of each telephone intervention separately, and then in combination. The
      primary outcome is HbA1c level at 12 months of follow-up. The secondary outcomes are
      cost-effectiveness of each telephone intervention separately, and then in combination, and
      change in physical activity, diet, medication adherence, and self-monitoring of blood glucose
      over 12 months of follow-up. The long-term goal of the project is to achieve improvement in
      diabetes-related outcomes in this patient population.

    <description>Subjects randomized to the diabetes knowledge/information arm will complete 12 diabetes education modules over a 12-week period. The educational materials were developed based on guidelines for diabetes education by the American Diabetes Association. The content is based on the principles of the Adult Learning Theory.

The modules are designed to be delivered via telephone in 10-15 minutes, so that the maximum contact time per telephone call including introduction and closing would not exceed 30 minutes.</description>

The behavioral skills training will be focused on 4 behaviors - physical activity, diet, medication adherence, and glucose self-monitoring. Guided by subjects' current problem areas and preferences, subjects will be asked to choose 1 of 4 behaviors to focus on every 3 weeks (4 behaviors over 12 weeks).</description>

            <description>Subjects randomized to the diabetes knowledge/information arm will complete 12 diabetes education modules over a 12-week period. The educational materials were developed based on guidelines for diabetes education by the American Diabetes Association. The content is based on the principles of the Adult Learning Theory. The information is designed to be relevant, person centered, and presented in a non-threatening manner. The modules are designed to be delivered via telephone in 10-15 minutes, so that the maximum contact time per telephone call including introduction and closing would not exceed 30 minutes.

The behavioral skills training will be focused on 4 behaviors - physical activity, diet, medication adherence, and glucose self-monitoring. Guided by subjects' current problem areas and preferences, subjects will be asked to choose 1 of 4 behaviors to focus on every 3 weeks (4 behaviors over 12 weeks).
