      Background:

      The standard treatment of locally advanced cervical cancer is radio-chemotherapy including
      external beam radiotherapy (EBRT), brachytherapy (BT) and concomitant chemotherapy with
      weekly Cisplatin. While image based conformal EBRT is routinely used, prescription and
      reporting of BT is still based on specific dose points defined in 2D. Thus, for several
      decades the BT dose has most often been prescribed and reported to the Manchester point A
      defined according to different traditions.

      Recently, a working group from GEC-ESTRO has published recommendations on contouring of
      tumour target and organs at risk (OAR) as well as on dose volume parameters to be reported
      for image guided BT in definitive radiotherapy for locally advanced cervical cancer. These
      recommendations are mainly derived from retrospective single institution experience with MRI
      based intracavitary BT. The major advantage of this technique is the possibility to conform
      the dose given by BT with regard to both volume (3D) and time (4D). Thus, by repetitive
      imaging performed before each BT implant it is possible adapt the dose given by BT to the
      anatomy of each individual patient taking into account not only the position of OAR but also
      the tumour regression which often is obtained by preceding EBRT and chemotherapy. Based on
      the experience collected so far, the image based BT approach is expected to have a major
      impact on the clinical outcome with a concomitant decrease in the rates of both local failure
      and morbidity.

      Aims:

        -  To introduce MRI based 3D-4D BT in locally advanced cervical cancer in a multicenter
           setting within the frame of a prospective observational study.

        -  To establish a bench-mark for clinical outcome with image based BT in a large patient
           population with respect to local control, survival, morbidity and QoL

        -  To establish a reference material with regard to image based DVH parameters according to
           the guidelines from the GEC ESTRO working group.

        -  To correlate image based DVH parameters for CTV and for OAR with outcome

        -  To develop prognostic and predictive statistical models for clinical outcome including
           volumetric, dosimetric, clinical and biological risk factors

        -  To establish radiobiological parameter estimates that will allow a precise risk
           estimation in individual patients and aid in the development of new treatment protocols

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A prospective observational multicenter study will be performed in patients with locally
      advanced cervical cancer considered to be potentially curable by definitive radio-(chemo)
      therapy. The patients will be divided and analyzed in three strata according to risk of
      recurrence:

        1. Small tumours

        2. Large tumours favourable response

        3. Large tumours with unfavourable response to the initial radio-(chemo) therapy.

      A clinical local failure has to be validated by MRI and topographically correlated to the MRI
      based BT targets (HR CTV and IR-CTV) and the dose volume parameters of the treatment plan. It
      has to be classified as &quot;inside&quot;, &quot;at the edge&quot;, &quot;outside&quot;.

      Major events with regard to morbidity have to be reported using 3D imaging information
      integrating e.g. clinical examination, endoscopy and MRI. The location of organ damage (i.e.
      fistula) has to be identified in 3D and a correlation to the dose volume parameters for the
      affected region should be investigated.

      Specific Aims

        -  To assess prospectively outcome for disease (local control, survival), for morbidity and
           for QoL life applying appropriate clinical, imaging and QoL protocols.

        -  To test that there are three groups representing different risks of recurrence: small
           tumours; large tumours with favourable response; large tumours with unfavourable
           response to initial radio-(chemo)therapy.

        -  To correlate local control (survival) and dose volume parameters for GTV and CTV for the
           overall cohort and for the 3 different risk groups and to establish hazard ratios and
           dose effect curves for the primary tumour.

        -  To correlate outcome data and dose volume parameters for the different OAR (rectum,
           sigmoid, bladder) and to establish hazard ratios and dose effect curves for OAR.

        -  To correlate QoL outcome to morbidity outcome.

        -  To quantify the change in DVH parameters obtained by image guided dose optimization of
           BT in the individual patient.

        -  To compare volumetric data on GTV and CTV at diagnosis and during treatment and relate
           them to dose volume parameters within the 3 different risk groups of the overall patient
           cohort.

        -  To evaluate the indicators for quality assessment throughout the whole study period in
           order to define systematic and random variations for the different indicators (e.g.
           contouring, applicator reconstruction, dose volume assessment).

        -  To validate from clinical outcome data the radiobiological equivalence calculations used
           for assessing dose and volume parameters in gynaecological radiotherapy.

        -  To test if the GYN GEC ESTRO recommendations for BT in cervical cancer are feasible in a
           multi-centre setting.
