      RATIONALE: Specialized radiation therapy that delivers a high dose of radiation directly to
      the tumor may kill more tumor cells and cause less damage to normal tissue.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase II/III trial is studying how well image-guided radiosurgery or
      stereotactic body radiation therapy works and compares it to external-beam radiation therapy
      in treating patients with localized spine metastasis.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the feasibility of successfully delivering image-guided radiosurgery or
           stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) in patients with spine metastases in a cooperative
           group setting. (Phase II)

        -  Determine whether image-guided radiosurgery or SBRT (single dose of 16 Gy) improves pain
           control as measured by the 11-point Numerical Rating Pain Scale (NRPS) compared to
           conventional external beam radiotherapy (single dose of 8 Gy). (Phase III)

      Secondary

        -  Determine whether image-guided radiosurgery or SBRT improves the rapidity of pain
           response and increases the duration of pain response at the treated site(s) compared to
           conventional external beam radiotherapy, as measured by the NRPS. (Phase III)

        -  Compare adverse events associated with these treatment regimens, as measured by NCI
           CTCAE v3.0 criteria. (Phase III)

        -  Evaluate the long-term effects (24 months) of image-guided radiosurgery or SBRT on the
           vertebral bone (e.g., compression fracture) and the spinal cord, as measured by MRI.
           (Phase III)

      DETAILS:

      This is a multicenter, phase II study followed by a randomized phase III study. Patients
      enrolled in the phase III portion are stratified according to the number of spine metastases
      to be treated (1 vs 2-3) and the type of tumor (radioresistant [including soft tissue
      sarcomas, melanomas, and renal cell carcinomas] vs other).

      Phase II patients undergo MRI of the treated spine at baseline and at 3 months; phase III
      patients undergo MRI at baseline and at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months. Patients enrolled in the
      phase III portion also complete the Numerical Rating Pain Scale at baseline, at 1, 2, and 3
      weeks after randomization, and at 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 months. Patients are followed after
      completion of study treatment.

    <description>Treatment delivery was centrally reviewed by the study chair and medical physics co-chair. Success was defined as having a review of &quot;per protocol&quot; or &quot;minor variation&quot;. A 70% success rate was required for continuation to the phase III component.
Target volume compliance in is defined as the following levels of target coverage in reference to dose volume:
Per protocol: ≥ 90%
Minor variation: 80%-90%
Major deviation: &lt;80% of of dose volume.
Image-Guided Radiotherapy (IGRT) compliance is defined as the following differences in IGRT images between simulation/planning and treatment, as well as at the end of treatment:
Per protocol: &lt;2 mm
Minor variation: 2mm - 3mm
Major deviation: &gt; 3mm</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Patients With Complete or Partial Pain Response at 3 Months (Phase III)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Pain is measured by the Numerical Rating Pain Scale (NRPS) a numerical 11-point scale (0-10) with 0 = no pain, 1-4 = mild, 5-6 = moderate, and 7-10 = severe with 10 the worst pain imaginable. Pain response is calculated as 3 month score - baseline score with a positive value indicating increased pain and a negative value indicating decreased pain. Patients with complete or partial pain response as defined below are considered responders. The index site is the lesion with the highest baseline (day of radiosurgery) pain score. If multiple sites have the same baseline pain score, the index site is the most cephalad lesion.
Complete response: post-treatment pain score of 0 at the index site, no increase in narcotic pain medication, and no increase in pain score at the secondary treated site(s).
Partial response: post-treatment improvement of at least 3 points at the index site, no increase in narcotic pain medication, and no increase in pain score at the secondary treated site(s).</description>

    <measure>Change in Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - General (FACT-G) Total Score at 3 Months (Phase III)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The FACT-G is a validated 27-item measure in which a higher score represents higher quality of life (QOL). Physical, functional, social and emotional well-being subscale scores are added together to form the FACT-G total score. Responses range from 0=Not a lot to 4=Very much. Certain items must be reversed before being added, by subtracting the response from 4. Subscale items are added together, multiplied by the number of items in the subscale, then divided by the number of items answered to obtain subscale totals. Total score ranges from 0-108; physical, social and functional subscales from 0-28; emotional subscale from 0-24. Each subscale requires at least 50% of the items to be completed while the overall response rate must be greater than 80%. If items are missing the subscale scores can be prorated. Change at 3 months is calculated as 3 month score - baseline score with a positive change indicating improvement in QOL.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. The patient must have localized spine metastasis from the C1 to L5 levels by a
             screening imaging study [bone scan, positron emission tomography (PET), computerized
             tomography (CT), or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)] (a solitary spine metastasis;
             two separate spine levels; or up to 3 separate sites [e.g., C5, T5-6, and T12] are
             permitted.) Each of the separate sites may have a maximal involvement of 2 contiguous
             vertebral bodies. Patients can have other visceral metastasis, and radioresistant
             tumors (including soft tissue sarcomas, melanomas, and renal cell carcinomas) are
             eligible. See Figure 1 in Section 3.1.1. of the protocol for a depiction of eligible
             metastatic lesions: 1) a solitary spine metastasis; 2) two contiguous spine levels
             involved; or 3) a maximum of 3 separate sites. Each of the separate sites may have a
             maximal involvement of 2 contiguous vertebral bodies. Epidural compression (arrow) is
             eligible when there is a ≥ 3 mm gap between the spinal cord and the edge of the
             epidural lesion (see #10). A paraspinal mass ≤ 5 cm is allowed (see #11).

               -  There can be multiple small metastatic lesions shown in other vertebral bodies as
                  shown in referenced diagram. The metastatic lesion of each spine should be less
                  than 20% of the vertebral body as opposed to the diffuse vertebral involvement.
                  These small lesions are often seen in the MRI even when bone scan or PET was
                  negative. Most of these lesions are not clinically required to be treated and are
                  therefore not included in the target volume of this protocol. Only the painful
                  spine (pain score≥ 5) is to be treated .

          2. Zubrod Performance Status 0-2;

          3. Age ≥ 18;

          4. History/physical examination within 2 weeks prior to registration;

          5. Negative serum pregnancy test within 2 weeks prior to registration for women of
             childbearing potential;

          6. Women of childbearing potential and male participants who are sexually active must
             agree to use a medically effective means of birth control;

          7. MRI (contrast is not required but strongly recommended) of the involved spine within 4
             weeks prior to registration to determine the extent of the spine involvement; an MRI
             is required as it is superior to a CT scan in delineating the spinal cord as well as
             identifying an epidural or paraspinal soft tissue component. Note: If an MRI was done
             as a screening imaging study for eligibility (see Section -1), the MRI can be used as
             the required MRI for treatment planning.

          8. Numerical Rating Pain Scale within 1 week prior to registration; the patient must have
             a score on the Scale of ≥ 5 for at least one of the planned sites for spine
             radiosurgery. Documentation of the patient's initial pain score is required. Patients
             taking medication for pain at the time of registration are eligible.

          9. Neurological examination within 1 week prior to registration to rule out rapid
             neurologic decline; see Appendix III for the standardized neurological examination.
             Patients with mild to moderate neurological signs are eligible. These neurological
             signs include radiculopathy, dermatomal sensory change, and muscle strength of
             involved extremity 4/5 (lower extremity for ambulation or upper extremity for raising
             arms and/or arm function).

         10. Patients with epidural compression are eligible provided that there is a ≥ 3 mm gap
             between the spinal cord and the edge of the epidural lesion.

         11. Patients with a paraspinal mass ≤ 5 cm in the greatest dimension and that is
             contiguous with spine metastasis are eligible.

         12. Patients must provide study specific informed consent prior to study entry.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Histologies of myeloma or lymphoma;

          2. Non-ambulatory patients;

          3. Spine instability due to a compression fracture;

          4. &gt; 50% loss of vertebral body height;

          5. Frank spinal cord compression or displacement or epidural compression within 3 mm of
             the spinal cord;

          6. Patients with rapid neurologic decline;

          7. Bony retropulsion causing neurologic abnormality;

          8. Prior radiation to the index spine;

          9. Patients for whom an MRI of the spine is medically contraindicated;

         10. Patients allergic to contrast dye used in MRIs or CT scans or who cannot be
             premedicated for the use of contrast dye.

        <title>Percentage of Patients With Complete or Partial Pain Response at 3 Months (Phase III)</title>
        <description>Pain is measured by the Numerical Rating Pain Scale (NRPS) a numerical 11-point scale (0-10) with 0 = no pain, 1-4 = mild, 5-6 = moderate, and 7-10 = severe with 10 the worst pain imaginable. Pain response is calculated as 3 month score - baseline score with a positive value indicating increased pain and a negative value indicating decreased pain. Patients with complete or partial pain response as defined below are considered responders. The index site is the lesion with the highest baseline (day of radiosurgery) pain score. If multiple sites have the same baseline pain score, the index site is the most cephalad lesion.
Complete response: post-treatment pain score of 0 at the index site, no increase in narcotic pain medication, and no increase in pain score at the secondary treated site(s).
Partial response: post-treatment improvement of at least 3 points at the index site, no increase in narcotic pain medication, and no increase in pain score at the secondary treated site(s).</description>

        <description>The FACT-G is a validated 27-item measure in which a higher score represents higher quality of life (QOL). Physical, functional, social and emotional well-being subscale scores are added together to form the FACT-G total score. Responses range from 0=Not a lot to 4=Very much. Certain items must be reversed before being added, by subtracting the response from 4. Subscale items are added together, multiplied by the number of items in the subscale, then divided by the number of items answered to obtain subscale totals. Total score ranges from 0-108; physical, social and functional subscales from 0-28; emotional subscale from 0-24. Each subscale requires at least 50% of the items to be completed while the overall response rate must be greater than 80%. If items are missing the subscale scores can be prorated. Change at 3 months is calculated as 3 month score - baseline score with a positive change indicating improvement in QOL.</description>
