    <textblock>
      The purpose of this phase II open label study was is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of
      ofatumumab and bendamustine followed by maintenance ofatumumab in subjects with indolent
      B-NHL who had relapsed after Rituximab treatment. A maximum of 53 subjects at least 18 years
      old with Small lymphocytic, lymphoplasmacytic, marginal zone lymphoma, or follicular
      lymphoma; Grades 1, 2 and 3a, would have been enrolled (34 in Stage 1 and 19 in Stage 2).
      Subjects should have had Rituximab-sensitive disease, defined as a Partial Remission (PR) or
      Complete Remission (CR) to the last rituximab-containing therapy lasting at least 6 months
      following completion of therapy or subjects should have relapsed or have had disease
      progression following response to prior rituximab-based therapy a Eastern Cooperative
      Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance status of 0 1 or 2. During the induction phase, ofatumumab
      1000 mg IV on day 1 of each cycle (cycles 1-6) were followed by Bendamustine 90 mg/m2 IV on
      days 1, 2 of each cycle (cycles 1-6).During the maintenance phase, subjects with a PR or CR
      after the induction phase received ofatumumab 1000 mg IV every 2 months for 2 years.

    <description>Complete response (CR) included all of the following: complete disappearance of all detectable clinical evidence of disease and disease-related symptoms if present before therapy. All target nodes had to have regressed to ≤ 1.5cm in the longest diameter. Non-measureable nodes 1.1 to 1.5cm in the longest diameter and &gt;1cm in the short axis at baseline had to regress to ≤ 1cm in the short axis by visual estimation; enlarged spleen or liver (with nodules) must have returned to normal size and nodules disappeared and if bone marrow was involved, infiltrate had to have cleared on repeat biopsy sample. CR was not valid without imaging data. The corresponding 2-sided 95% exact confidence interval (CI) of the response rate was estimated by the Clopper-Pearson method.</description>

    <description>Progression free survival (PFS) is defined as the interval between first treatment and disease progression or death due to any cause. PFS criteria: A previously normal node (≤ 1.5 x ≤ 1.0cm), including nodes that were not previously visible, must increase to &gt;2.0 x ≥ 1.5cm; ≥ 50% increase from nadir in the PPD of any target node. The long axis must increase by at least 5 mm and to &gt;2.0cm.; ≥ 50% increase from nadir in the long axis of any target node. The long axis must increase by at least 5 mm and to &gt;2.0 cm.; ≥ 50% increase from nadir in the SPD of target nodes and at least one node should have a long axis &gt;1.5 cm.</description>

        <description>Complete response (CR) included all of the following: complete disappearance of all detectable clinical evidence of disease and disease-related symptoms if present before therapy. All target nodes had to have regressed to ≤ 1.5cm in the longest diameter. Non-measureable nodes 1.1 to 1.5cm in the longest diameter and &gt;1cm in the short axis at baseline had to regress to ≤ 1cm in the short axis by visual estimation; enlarged spleen or liver (with nodules) must have returned to normal size and nodules disappeared and if bone marrow was involved, infiltrate had to have cleared on repeat biopsy sample. CR was not valid without imaging data. The corresponding 2-sided 95% exact confidence interval (CI) of the response rate was estimated by the Clopper-Pearson method.</description>

        <description>Progression free survival (PFS) is defined as the interval between first treatment and disease progression or death due to any cause. PFS criteria: A previously normal node (≤ 1.5 x ≤ 1.0cm), including nodes that were not previously visible, must increase to &gt;2.0 x ≥ 1.5cm; ≥ 50% increase from nadir in the PPD of any target node. The long axis must increase by at least 5 mm and to &gt;2.0cm.; ≥ 50% increase from nadir in the long axis of any target node. The long axis must increase by at least 5 mm and to &gt;2.0 cm.; ≥ 50% increase from nadir in the SPD of target nodes and at least one node should have a long axis &gt;1.5 cm.</description>

          <description>Progression free survival (PFS) is defined as the interval between first treatment and disease progression or death due to any cause. PFS criteria: A previously normal node (≤ 1.5 x ≤ 1.0cm), including nodes that were not previously visible, must increase to &gt;2.0 x ≥ 1.5cm; ≥ 50% increase from nadir in the PPD of any target node. The long axis must increase by at least 5 mm and to &gt;2.0cm.; ≥ 50% increase from nadir in the long axis of any target node. The long axis must increase by at least 5 mm and to &gt;2.0 cm.; ≥ 50% increase from nadir in the SPD of target nodes and at least one node should have a long axis &gt;1.5 cm.</description>

        <description>Progression Free Survival (PFS) is defined as the interval between first treatment and disease progression or death due to any cause. PFS events: progression documented between scheduled visits, death before first PD assessment (or death at baseline or prior to any adequate assessments), death between adequate assessment visits. For the PFS analysis, the survival function was estimated using Kaplan-Meier estimates.</description>
