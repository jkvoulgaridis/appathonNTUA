    <textblock>
      A prospective population-based cohort study to examine whether varenicline use during
      pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of major congenital malformations in infants
      above that associated with smoking during pregnancy.

      Sampling will not be employed. The data sources record nearly all (&gt;98.6%) births in Denmark

    <description>Major congenital malformations were defined as any codes within the Q-chapter of The Tenth Revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10), excluding certain minor anomalies.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Infants With Stillbirths</measure>
    <time_frame>At the time of birth</time_frame>
    <description>Stillbirth was defined as death at a gestational age of greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 22 weeks, with the exception that in Sweden prior to 2008 it was defined as death at a gestational age of &gt;=28 weeks.</description>

    <measure>Number of Infants Born Small for Gestational Age (SGA)</measure>
    <time_frame>At the time of birth</time_frame>
    <description>An infant was defined as SGA if birth weight was below the 10th percentile of its sex-specific national distribution at the respective gestational week. Data on birth weight and gestational age from the medical birth registries were used to calculate the 10th percentiles for each sex based on all Danish and Swedish births during the study observation period.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Infants Born Preterm</measure>
    <time_frame>At the time of birth</time_frame>
