    <textblock>
      Cluster headache is a disorder marked by frequent attacks of short-lasting, severe,
      unilateral head pain with associated autonomic symptoms. It is the most severe head pain
      syndrome known. Currently, the two most common treatments for cluster headaches are inhaled
      oxygen and injectable sumatriptan. These treatments do not work for all cluster headache
      patients, and patients who smoke may eventually develop contraindication to triptans. New
      treatment options are needed.

      An alternative method of oxygen delivery (as opposed to continuous flow) uses a demand valve
      that is controlled by respiration rate, allowing increased oxygen flow in response to
      increased demand. This system may be more efficacious at stopping a cluster headache attack
      than the currently prescribed oxygen delivery system.

      This study will compare the effectiveness of oxygen delivered via demand valve versus
      continuous high flow oxygen via non-rebreather face mask in the acute treatment of a cluster
      headache attack. All patients will treat one cluster headache with each of the 2 treatment
      methods.

    <textblock>
      Cluster headache is a primary headache disorder marked by frequent attacks of short-lasting,
      severe, unilateral head pain with associated autonomic symptoms. The goal of acute therapy
      for cluster headache is fast, effective and consistent relief.

      In the currently recommended dosing strategy of continuous flow 100% oxygen given via a
      non-rebreather face mask at 7-15L/min, the time to improvement can sometimes take upwards of
      20-30 minutes and is not effective for all cluster headache sufferers.

      An alternative method of oxygen delivery (versus continuous flow) uses a demand valve which
      is controlled by the respiration rate, allowing increased oxygen flow in response to
      increased demand. This delivery system may be better at stopping a cluster headache attack
      than the continuous flow model as it can support hyperventilation which can enhance cerebral
      arterial vasoconstriction via a state of hyperoxia and hypocapnia. Arterial vasoconstriction
      is one hypothesized method by which oxygen can abort a cluster headache attack.

      This proof of concept trial will evaluate if oxygen delivered via demand valve with a
      specific breathing technique is effective as a cluster headache acute treatment and is more
      effective than the traditional continuous high flow oxygen treatment with a non-rebreather
      face mask.

If the user inhales more deeply, more oxygen will flow in response to the increased demand, hence the name demand valve. Unlike a constant flow O2 regulator, a demand valve has no flow meter or flow rate controls, but it is capable of delivering O2 from 0 to 160 liters per minute (LPM). When using a demand valve, O2 dosage is controlled by respiration rate</description>
