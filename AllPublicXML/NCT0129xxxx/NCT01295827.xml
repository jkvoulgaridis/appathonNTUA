  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study has 5 parts. In Parts A and A1, the dose of intravenous (IV) pembrolizumab
      (MK-3475) will be escalated from 1 to 10 mg/kg to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)
      and recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) for participants with a histologically- or
      cytologically-confirmed diagnosis of any type of carcinoma or melanoma (MEL) by evaluating
      the Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs). Following completion of the dose escalation, additional
      patients will be enrolled in Part A2 to further define pharmacokinetic characteristics. Part
      B of the study will investigate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of pembrolizumab (2
      mg/kg and 10 mg/kg) in participants with advanced or metastatic MEL and compare every 2 week
      dosing (Q2W) to every 3 week dosing (Q3W). Part C of the study will investigate the safety,
      tolerability, and efficacy of pembrolizumab administered at 10 mg/kg Q3W in participants with
      non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) that is locally advanced or metastatic. Part D of the
      study will investigate the low and high doses of study drug identified in Parts A and B (2
      mg/kg and 10 mg/kg) administered Q3W in participants with advanced or metastatic MEL. Part E
      (closed with Amendment 7) was planned to investigate low, medium, and high doses of
      pembrolizumab in combination with standard chemotherapy in participants with locally advanced
      or metastatic NSCLC. Part F will investigate low and high doses of pembrolizumab (2 mg/kg and
      10 mg/kg) administered Q2W or Q3W in treatment-naive and previously-treated participants with
      NSCLC with programmed cell death 1 ligand (PD-L1) gene expression. The primary hypotheses are
      the following: that pembrolizumab will have acceptable safety and tolerability; that
      pembrolizumab will show a clinically meaningful response rate (RR) or disease-control rate
      (DCR) in participants with melanoma (ipilimumab-refractory or not) and NSCLC, and that
      pembrolizumab will show a more clinically meaningful RR in participants with either cancer
      whose tumors express PD-L1.

      Per protocol, all participants who were receiving study intervention or in survival follow-up
      could enroll in the extension study, KEYNOTE-587 (NCT03486873), which would allow further
      study participation after the Primary Completion Date cut-off. Thus, all efficacy outcome
      measures except for survival (Overall Survival [OS]) were to be followed up to the Interim
      Database cut-off of 18-Sept-2018, and the primary safety analyses (except for the DLT
      analysis) and Overall Survival were to be followed up to the study Primary Completion Date
      (Final Database cut-off of 05-Nov-2018).

      Five participants did not have end of study assessments completed by the Primary Completion
      Date cut-off and were subsequently followed up to the Study Completion Date (11-Dec-2018).
      End of treatment and end of study assessments are missing for these 5 and the status was
      noted as unknown as of the Primary Completion Date cut-off. Per protocol, any safety
      information after the Primary Completion Date cut-off (Final Database cut-off of 05-Nov-2018)
      would not be included in the safety analysis but reported by the Investigator to the Sponsor
      via the Sponsor Communication Form and filed in the electronic Trial Master File.

        <title>Lowest Plasma Concentration (Ctrough) of Pembrolizumab in Solid Tumor Participants (Parts A, A1, and A2)</title>
        <description>Pre-dose samples were collected 24 hours before infusion of pembrolizumab at specified intervals for the determination of Ctrough. Ctrough was defined as the lowest concentration of pembrolizumab reached before the next dose was administered. Ctrough was reported for each Part A arm according to cycle and nominal time after first dose (Day). Results for each cycle reported for arms with N&gt;1 at that timepoint. Ctrough data for melanoma (Parts B and D) and NSCLC (Parts C and F) participants are presented separately and are not included here.</description>
        <time_frame>Parts A and A1: pre-dose at Cycles 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14 (cycle=14 days); A2 Cohorts: pre-dose at Cycles 2, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11 (cycle=21 days)</time_frame>
        <population>All Part A participants receiving ≥1 dose of drug and having available Ctrough samples collected pre-dose before each cycle. Due to differing dosing schedules or N&lt;1, some time points were not applicable for certain arms if data were not collected or analyzed (indicated by zero participants analyzed entered in the table).</population>

        <title>Ctrough of Pembrolizumab in Melanoma Participants (Parts B and D)</title>
        <description>Pre-dose samples were collected 24 hours before infusion of pembrolizumab at specified intervals for the determination of Ctrough. Ctrough was defined as the lowest concentration of pembrolizumab reached before the next dose was administered. For the purposes of the Ctrough analysis, samples were collected and analyzed separately for each Part B and D enrolment cohort, and Ctrough was reported for each cohort according to cycle and nominal time after first dose (Day). Results for each cycle reported for arms with N&gt;1 at that timepoint. Ctrough data for solid tumor (Part A) and NSCLC (Parts C and F) participants are presented separately and are not included here.</description>
        <time_frame>Part B arms treated every 3 weeks: pre-dose at Cycles 2,5,9,13,17,25,33 (cycle=21 days); Part B treated every 2 weeks: pre-dose at Cycles 2,3,7,13,19,25,31,37 (cycle=14 days); Part D: pre-dose at Cycles 2,3,6,8,12,16,24,32 (cycle=21 days)</time_frame>
        <population>All melanoma participants receiving ≥1 dose of drug and having available samples collected pre-dose before each cycle. Per protocol, Ctrough analyzed separately by Part, dose, and dosing schedule. Due to differing dosing schedules, some time points were not applicable for certain arms (indicated by zero participants analyzed entered in the table).</population>

        <title>Ctrough of Pembrolizumab in NSCLC Participants (Parts C and F)</title>
        <description>Pre-dose samples were collected 24 hours before infusion of pembrolizumab at specified intervals for the determination of Ctrough. Ctrough was defined as the lowest concentration reached by pembrolizumab before the next dose was administered. For the purposes of the Ctrough analysis, samples were collected and analyzed separately for each Part C and F enrolment cohort, and Ctrough was reported for each cohort according to cycle and nominal time after first dose (Day). Results for each cycle reported for arms with N&gt;1 at that timepoint. Ctrough data for solid tumor (Part A) and melanoma (Parts B and D) participants are presented separately and are not included here.</description>
        <time_frame>Part C: pre-dose at Cycles 2,5,9,13,17,21 (cycle=21 days); Part F treated every 3 weeks: pre-dose at Cycles 2,3,6,8,12,14,16,24,32 (cycle=21 days); Part F treated every 2 weeks: pre-dose at Cycles 2,3,6,7,8,9,12,16,18,24,32,36,40,48 (cycle=14 days)</time_frame>
        <population>All NSCLC participants receiving ≥1 dose of drug and having available samples collected pre-dose before each cycle. Per protocol, Ctrough analyzed separately by Part, dose, and dosing schedule. Due to differing dosing schedules, some time points were not applicable for certain arms (indicated by zero participants analyzed entered in the table).</population>

        <title>Maximum Change From Baseline (CFB) in Tumor Size Assessed by IRC Per RECIST 1.1 According to Programmed Death-Ligand 1 (PD-L1) Immunohistochemical (IHC) Expression Status in Ipilimumab (Ipi)-Exposed and Ipi-Naive Melanoma Participants (Parts B Plus D)</title>
        <description>The percent change from baseline in tumor size based on IRC per RECIST 1.1 was reported according to PD-L1 status in Ipi-Exposed and Ipi-Naïve melanoma participants. Tumor PD-L1 status was measured by the tumor proportion score (TPS), which was the percentage of tumor cells identified using IHC analysis that expressed PD-L1. Tumors with ≥1% positive staining for PD-L1 were considered positive. Maximum tumor change was defined as the percent change of the participant's smallest post-baseline tumor size from the baseline. The number of participants in a percent change from baseline range was reported categorically according to PD-L1 status (PD-L1-Positive, PD-L1 Negative, PD-L1 Status Unknown). Negative percent change from baseline values indicate tumor size reduction, with the greatest reduction possible indicated as &quot;≤ -30%&quot;. As specified by the protocol, this analysis of melanoma participants was performed according to ipilimumab exposure (Ipi-Exposed and Ipi-Naïve).</description>

        <title>Maximum Change From Baseline (CFB) in Tumor Size Assessed by IRC Per RECIST 1.1 According to PD-L1 IHC Expression Status in Prior Treatment (TRT)-Naïve and Previously-Treated NSCLC Participants (Parts C Plus F)</title>
        <description>Percent CFB in tumor size based on IRC per RECIST 1.1 was reported according to PD-L1 status in prior treatment-naïve and previously-treated NSCLC participants. Tumor PD-L1 status was measured by TPS, which was the percentage of tumor cells identified using IHC analysis that expressed PD-L1, as follows: TPS ≥50% =tumor strongly positive, TPS of 1%-49% =tumor weakly positive, TPS &lt;1% =tumor considered negative, or TPS unknown. Maximum tumor change for a participant was defined as the percent change of the participant's smallest post-baseline tumor size from baseline. The number of participants in a percent CFB range was reported categorically according to PD-L1 status (TPS ≥50%, TPS = 1-49%, TPS &lt;1%, TPS Unknown). Negative percent CFB values indicate tumor size reduction, with the greatest reduction possible indicated as &quot;≤ -30%&quot;. As specified by the protocol, analysis of NSCLC participants was performed according to prior treatment exposure (Treatment Naive and Previously Treated).</description>

        <title>Duration of Response (DOR) According to RECIST 1.1 as Assessed by IRO in Melanoma Participants (Parts B and D)</title>
        <description>For participants who demonstrated a confirmed CR (disappearance of all target lesions) or PR (At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions) per RECIST 1.1, DOR was defined as the time from first documented evidence of a CR or PR until progressive disease (PD) or death. DOR for participants who had not progressed or died at the time of analysis was censored at the date of their last tumor assessment. Per RECIST 1.1, PD was defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also have demonstrated an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. The appearance of one or more new lesions was also considered PD. DOR assessments were based on IRO with confirmation. The DOR according to RECIST 1.1 for all participants who experienced a confirmed CR or PR was reported for each melanoma dose arm (Parts B plus D).</description>

DOR for participants who had not progressed or died at the time of analysis was censored at the date of their last tumor assessment. According to irRC, PD was defined as at least a 25% increase in SPD relative to nadir (minimum recorded tumor burden) with confirmation by a repeat, consecutive assessment no less than 4 weeks from the data first documented. The DOR according to irRC as assessed by the investigator for all participants who experienced a confirmed irCR or irPR was reported for each melanoma dose arm (Parts B plus D).</description>

        <description>For participants who demonstrated a confirmed CR (disappearance of all target lesions) or PR (at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions) per RECIST 1.1, DOR was defined as the time from first documented evidence of a CR or PR until PD or death. DOR for participants who had not progressed or died at the time of analysis was censored at the date of their last tumor assessment. Per RECIST 1.1, PD was defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also have demonstrated an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. The appearance of one or more new lesions was also considered PD. DOR assessments were based on IRC with confirmation. The DOR according to RECIST 1.1 for all participants who experienced a confirmed CR or PR was reported for each NSCLC dose arm (Parts C plus F).</description>

          <description>For participants who demonstrated a confirmed irCR (complete disappearance of all tumor lesions whether measurable or not, and no new lesions) or irPR (decrease in SPD of ≥50% by a consecutive assessment ≥4 weeks after first documentation) according to irRC, DOR was defined as the time from first documented evidence of an irCR or irPR until PD or death. DOR for participants who had not progressed or died at the time of analysis was censored at the date of their last tumor assessment. According to irRC, PD was defined as at least a 25% increase in SPD relative to nadir (minimum recorded tumor burden) with confirmation by a repeat, consecutive assessment no less than 4 weeks from the data first documented. The DOR according to irRC as assessed by the investigator for all participants who experienced a confirmed irCR or irPR was reported for each NSCLC dose arm (Parts C plus F).</description>
          <population>All NSCLC (Parts C plus F) participants that received ≥1 dose of study treatment and who demonstrated a confirmed response (CR or PR). Per protocol, Part A (dose-escalation) was not analyzed for efficacy. Melanoma (Parts B and D) participants were analyzed and presented separately and are not included in this analysis.</population>
