    <textblock>
      This randomized controlled trial tests the efficacy of a mental health peer-led educational
      intervention called BRIDGES (Building Recovery of Individual Dreams and Goals through
      Education and Support). The BRIDGES program is a 10-week, manualized education course
      designed to provide basic information about the etiology and treatment of mental illness,
      self-help skills, and recovery principles in order to empower participants to return to
      valued social roles within their communities. BRIDGES is a peer-led program and all
      instructors are adults with mental illnesses. For study purposes, the 10-week course was
      modified to 8-weeks, meeting 2 1/2 hours once a week.

      Hypothesis #1: Compared to wait-list controls, intervention participants will report
      increased feelings of psychological empowerment.

      Hypothesis #2: Compared to wait-list controls, intervention participants will report
      increased feelings of hopefulness.

      Hypothesis #3: Compared to wait-list controls, intervention participants will report enhanced
      coping ability.

      Hypothesis #4: Compared to wait-list controls, intervention participants will report enhanced
      recovery.

      Hypothesis #5: Compared to wait-list controls, intervention participants will report greater
      ability to advocate for themselves with health care providers.

      Hypothesis #6: Compared to wait-list controls, those in the BRIDGES education course will
      report increased knowledge of the causes and treatment of mental illness and recovery
      principles.

      Eligibility criteria included having a diagnosis of serious mental illness and experiencing
      severe functional impairment in one or more life roles. All study participants completed
      telephone interviews at three points in time: study entry (pre-intervention); 8-weeks later
      (immediate post-intervention); and 6-months after intervention (approximately 8 months after
      study entry). Blinded interviewers administered valid and reliable outcome assessments that
      measured changes in subjects' knowledge about mental illness; emotional well-being;
      empowerment; hopefulness; self-advocacy; and recovery. All study participants were
      compensated for their time at each interview. All BRIDGES instructors were people in recovery
      from serious mental illnesses who were certified and experienced BRIDGES teachers. Fidelity
      to the BRIDGES curriculum was assessed on an ongoing basis throughout the study.

    <description>Recovery from mental illness is measured by the Recovery Assessment Scale (RAS) (Giffort et al., 1995). Recovery is a psychosocial outcome assessed via patient self-ratings on a 41-item scale using a 5-point Likert-response format ranging from &quot;strongly disagree&quot; to &quot;strongly agree.&quot; The minimum value for the RAS is 41 and the maximum is 205, with higher scores indicating a better outcome. Dimensions of recovery include personal confidence and hope, willingness to ask for help, goal and success orientation, reliance on others, and no being dominated by one's residual psychiatric symptoms.</description>

    <description>Personal psychological empowerment is measured via the Boston University Empowerment Scale (Rogers et al.,1997). This 28-item instrument designed to measure subjective feelings of empowerment via self-report in which respondents answer questions on a four-point scale ranging from Strongly Agree to Strongly Disagree. The minimum score is 28 and the maximum is 112, with higher scores indicating a better outcome.</description>

    <time_frame>Study entry (Pre-intervention/T1), 8-weeks later (Post-Intervention 1/T2), &amp; 6-months after T2 (Post-Intervention 2/T3)</time_frame>
    <description>Hopefulness is measured by the State Hope Scale (Snyder et al., 1991). Hopefulness as a cross-situational long-term trait is assessed via patient self-report using a 12-item scale assessed on a 4-point Likert response scale with options ranging from &quot;definitely false&quot; to &quot;definitely true&quot; and summed to produce a total score and sub-scale scores. The minimum value for this scale is 12 and the maximum value is 48. Higher scores indicate a better income.</description>

    <measure>Patient Self-advocacy</measure>
    <time_frame>Study entry (Pre-intervention/T1), 8-weeks later (Post-Intervention 1/T2), &amp; 6-months after T2 (Post-Intervention 2/T3)</time_frame>
    <description>The ability to advocate for oneself with medical care providers is assessed via self-report using The Patient Self-Advocacy Scale (Brashers et al., 1999), an 18-item scale with a 5-point Likert response set ranging from &quot;strongly disagree&quot; to &quot;strongly agree.&quot; Dimensions include in patient knowledge, assertiveness, and potential for mindful non-adherence to treatment. Scoring involves computing the mean scale score, so therefore values range from a minimum of 1 to a maximum of 5, with higher scores indicating a better outcome. Reported below are findings for the assertiveness sub-scale.</description>

    <measure>Coping Style</measure>
    <time_frame>Study entry (Pre-intervention/T1), 8-weeks later (Post-Intervention 1/T2), &amp; 6-months after T2 (Post-Intervention 2/T3)</time_frame>
    <description>Coping is measured via patient self-report using The Brief COPE Inventory (Carver, 1997), a 28-item instrument with 4-point Likert responses ranging from 1-&quot;I haven't been doing this at all&quot; to 4-&quot;I have been doing this a lot.&quot; This measure includes two subscales that assess participants' adaptive coping skills (e.g., planning and using emotional support to deal with problems) and maladaptive coping skills (e.g., self-blame and denial). Scoring involves computing the means for each subscale, with a minimum value of 1 and a maximum value of 4. Higher adaptive coping scores indicate a greater use of positive coping styles; higher maladaptive coping scores indicate a greater use of negative coping styles (in other words, lower maladative coping scores indicate a better outcome).</description>

        <title>Recovery From Mental Illness</title>
        <description>Recovery from mental illness is measured by the Recovery Assessment Scale (RAS) (Giffort et al., 1995). Recovery is a psychosocial outcome assessed via patient self-ratings on a 41-item scale using a 5-point Likert-response format ranging from &quot;strongly disagree&quot; to &quot;strongly agree.&quot; The minimum value for the RAS is 41 and the maximum is 205, with higher scores indicating a better outcome. Dimensions of recovery include personal confidence and hope, willingness to ask for help, goal and success orientation, reliance on others, and no being dominated by one's residual psychiatric symptoms.</description>

        <title>Hopefulness</title>
        <description>Hopefulness is measured by the State Hope Scale (Snyder et al., 1991). Hopefulness as a cross-situational long-term trait is assessed via patient self-report using a 12-item scale assessed on a 4-point Likert response scale with options ranging from &quot;definitely false&quot; to &quot;definitely true&quot; and summed to produce a total score and sub-scale scores. The minimum value for this scale is 12 and the maximum value is 48. Higher scores indicate a better income.</description>

            <description>BRIDGES Peer-Led Education: The BRIDGES program is a 10-week, manualized education course designed to provide basic education about the etiology and treatment of mental illness, self-help skills, and recovery principles in order to empower participants to return to valued social roles within their communities. BRIDGES is a peer-led program and all instructors are adults with mental illnesses. For this intervention study, the BRIDGES curriculum was modified from a 10-week course to an 8-week course, meeting for 2 1/2 hours once a week.</description>

        <description>The ability to advocate for oneself with medical care providers is assessed via self-report using The Patient Self-Advocacy Scale (Brashers et al., 1999), an 18-item scale with a 5-point Likert response set ranging from &quot;strongly disagree&quot; to &quot;strongly agree.&quot; Dimensions include in patient knowledge, assertiveness, and potential for mindful non-adherence to treatment. Scoring involves computing the mean scale score, so therefore values range from a minimum of 1 to a maximum of 5, with higher scores indicating a better outcome. Reported below are findings for the assertiveness sub-scale.</description>

        <description>Coping is measured via patient self-report using The Brief COPE Inventory (Carver, 1997), a 28-item instrument with 4-point Likert responses ranging from 1-&quot;I haven't been doing this at all&quot; to 4-&quot;I have been doing this a lot.&quot; This measure includes two subscales that assess participants' adaptive coping skills (e.g., planning and using emotional support to deal with problems) and maladaptive coping skills (e.g., self-blame and denial). Scoring involves computing the means for each subscale, with a minimum value of 1 and a maximum value of 4. Higher adaptive coping scores indicate a greater use of positive coping styles; higher maladaptive coping scores indicate a greater use of negative coping styles (in other words, lower maladative coping scores indicate a better outcome).</description>
