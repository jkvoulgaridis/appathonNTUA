    <measure>Tumour Shrinkage</measure>
    <time_frame>Tumour assessment were performed at screening, week 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, 48 and then every 12 weeks until progression or death whichever occurs first up to week 374</time_frame>
    <description>Tumour shrinkage is calculated as the minimum post-baseline sum of longest diameters of target lesions (longest for non-nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) (SLD), as assessed by central independent review. The mean of these minimum values are presented after adjusting for baseline sum of longest diameters and EGFR mutation category. Only data collected up until the analysis cut-off date (27 Dec 2013) were considered. A negative value means the smallest post-baseline SLD was smaller than baseline (decreased since baseline); a positive value means tumor size increased since baseline.
The means are adjusted for baseline sum of lesions and EGFR mutation category.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Two-arm, randomised (2:1 ratio), open-label, active-controlled, parallel-group comparison of afatinib versus gemcitabine / cisplatin chemotherapy.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>All patients were screened for eligibility to participate in the trial. Patients attended a specialist sites which ensured that they met all strictly implemented inclusion/exclusion criteria. Patients were not to be entered to trial treatment if any one of the specific entry criteria was violated.</pre_assignment_details>

        <group group_id="P1">
          <title>Afatinib 40 Milligram (mg)</title>
          <description>Patients received Afatinib film-coated tablets 40 mg once daily (q.d.) orally with possible dose escalation to 50 mg q.d. and dose reduction to 40 mg q.d. (if applicable), 30 mg q.d., or 20 mg q.d. (according to the protocol-defined dose-escalation and dose-reduction scheme), if required. No dose increase was allowed after dose reduction. Each treatment course was planned to be 21 days. For afatinib, patients received continuous daily dosing until disease progression, unacceptable adverse events (AEs) occurred, or withdrawal of consent for any reason.</description>

        <description>The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) as assessed by central independent review according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST) version 1.1. Progression-free survival was defined as the time from randomisation to disease progression or death whichever occurs earlier. A pre-defined set of censoring rules were used for patients who did not have a PFS.
Only data collected up until the analysis cut-off date (27 December 2013) were considered. Median time results from unstratified Kaplan-Meier estimates.</description>
        <time_frame>Tumour assessment were performed at screening, week 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, 48 and then every 12 weeks until progression or death whichever occurs first up to week 168</time_frame>

        <description>OR is defined as a best of overall response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) assessed by central independent review according to RECIST version 1.1.
For patients with an objective response, duration of objective response was defined as the time from the first objective response to disease progression or death whichever occurs earlier. A pre-defined set of censoring rules were used for patients who did not progress/die. The Median values are Kaplan-Meier estimates.</description>

        <title>Tumour Shrinkage</title>
        <description>Tumour shrinkage is calculated as the minimum post-baseline sum of longest diameters of target lesions (longest for non-nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) (SLD), as assessed by central independent review. The mean of these minimum values are presented after adjusting for baseline sum of longest diameters and EGFR mutation category. Only data collected up until the analysis cut-off date (27 Dec 2013) were considered. A negative value means the smallest post-baseline SLD was smaller than baseline (decreased since baseline); a positive value means tumor size increased since baseline.

        <title>Health Related Quality of Life (HRQOL): Time of Deterioration in Coughing</title>
        <description>HRQOL as measured by standardised questionnaires (EuropeanOrganisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC)) quality of life questionaires (OLQ-C30) and its lung cancer module (QLQ-LC13). Analysis for cough: QLQ-LC13, question 1.
Time to deterioration was defined as the time from randomisation to a score increase (i.e. worsened) of at least 10 points from baseline (0 to 100 point scale). Patients without deterioration (including those with disease progression) were censored at the date of the last available HRQOL assessment; patients without post-baseline assessments were censored at the date of randomisation. Patients were considered as having deteriorated at the time of death. The median is Kaplan-Meier estimates.</description>

          <description>HRQOL as measured by OLQ-C30 and its lung cancer module QLQ-LC13. Analysis for pain: composite of QLQ-C30, questions 9 and 19; individual items from QLQ-LC13, questions 10, 11 and 12.
Time to deterioration was defined as the time from randomisation to a score increase (i.e. worsened) of at least 10 points from baseline (0 to 100 point scale). Patients without deterioration (including those with disease progression) were censored at the date of the last available HRQOL assessment; patients without post-baseline assessments were censored at the date of randomisation. Patients were considered as having deteriorated at the time of death. The median is Kaplan-Meier estimates.</description>

For Potassium; only CTCAE grades resulting from hypokalemia (low values) are presented.</description>
        <time_frame>From first administration of study medication up to 28 days after the last administration of study medication up to 374 weeks.</time_frame>
        <population>Treated set (TS) included all randomised patients who were documented to have taken at least 1 dose of study medication. Patients were allocated according to the treatment actually received. Patients with a baseline and at least one on-treatment assessment of the parameter are of interest.</population>

            <title>Afatinib 40 Milligram (mg)</title>
            <description>Patients received Afatinib film-coated tablets 40 mg once daily (q.d.) orally with possible dose escalation to 50 mg q.d. and dose reduction to 40 mg q.d. (if applicable), 30 mg q.d., or 20 mg q.d. (according to the protocol-defined dose-escalation and dose-reduction scheme), if required. No dose increase was allowed after dose reduction. Each treatment course was planned to be 21 days. For afatinib, patients received continuous daily dosing until disease progression, unacceptable adverse events (AEs) occurred, or withdrawal of consent for any reason.</description>

            <title>Gemcitabine / Cisplatin Chemotherapy</title>
            <description>Patients received Gemcitabine (lyophilised powder) 1000 milligram per square metre (mg/m²) as an intravenous infusion over 30 minutes on day 1 and day 8, cisplatin (solution for infusion) 75 mg/m² as an intravenous infusion on Day 1 of each 21-day treatment course up to 6 cycles; Chemotherapy could be delayed or the dose could be reduced in accordance with the guidance in the current summary of product characteristics. For gemcitabine / cisplatin, patients were to receive a maximum of 6 treatment courses unless they developed disease progression, experienced unacceptable AEs, or withdrawal of consent for any reason.</description>

      <desc>The treated set (TS) included all randomised patients documented to have taken at least 1 dose of study medication. Analysis of Adverse Events (AEs) was based on the concept of treatment-emergent AEs. AEs with onset after the first administration of study drug and within 28 days after the last administration were considered to be on-treatment.</desc>
