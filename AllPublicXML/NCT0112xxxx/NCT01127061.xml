  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose a pilot randomized controlled trial to determine the safety and
      potential benefits of moderate intensity exercise in patients with hypertrophic
      cardiomyopathy. The investigators hypotheses are that exercise parameters derived from a
      baseline cardiopulmonary exercise test will target an appropriately safe level of exercise
      intensity that will not cause significant arrhythmias or exacerbate symptoms and that
      exercise training for 4 months will result in significant improvements in peak oxygen
      consumption (peak VO2) and quality of life, with neutral effects on the clinical
      characteristics.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this randomized clinical pilot trial is to establish the safety profile and
      potential benefits of moderate intensity exercise in patients with hypertrophic
      cardiomyopathy (HCM). Participation in competitive athletics is associated with an increased
      risk of sudden cardiac death (SCD) in individuals with structural heart disease, including
      HCM. This has appropriately led to the establishment of national guidelines based on expert
      opinion that discourage participation in high intensity competitive sports, burst exertion
      (e.g., sprinting), or isometric exercise (e.g., heavy lifting). Non-competitive, low to
      moderate intensity exercise is allowable, although many physicians and HCM patients are still
      understandably apprehensive. Data on the safety of a recreational exercise program, and how
      to gauge appropriate intensity level, are desperately needed so that HCM patients can reap
      the well established health benefits of regular physical activity. Limited, but compelling
      animal data suggest that moderate intensity exercise is not only safe, but may also prevent
      or even reverse cardiac hypertrophy, fibrosis, myocellular disarray, and apoptosis associated
      with HCM. There are no published studies on exercise in patients with HCM, although large
      clinical trials in heart failure have shown exercise training to be safe, to improve peak VO2
      and quality of life, and to lower cardiovascular mortality. The pilot randomized control
      trial proposed here is the first to determine the safety of moderate intensity exercise
      training and explore its potential benefits in patients with HCM.

          <title>New York Heart Association Class II-III</title>
          <description>The New York Heart Association (NYHA) Functional Classification system is used to classify severity of heart failure symptoms as follows with Class I indicating best outcome and Class IV, the worst:
Class I: No limitation of physical activity.
Class II: Slight limitation of physical activity. Comfortable at rest. Ordinary physical activity results in symptoms (fatigue, palpitations, or shortness of breath).
Class III: Comfortable at rest. Less than ordinary physical activity results in symptoms.
Class IV: Symptoms of heart failure at rest.</description>

            <description>Participants in the exercise group will be follow an individualized moderate-intensity exercise prescription (designed in consultation with an exercise physiologist based on data from the initial cardiopulmonary stress test). Exercise regimen will begin at a low level of intensity (3 sessions per week, 20 minutes per session, at a heart rate corresponding to 60% of heart rate reserve), then increase in duration and training intensity to a goal of up to 60 minutes per session, 4 to 7 sessions per week, at 70% of the heart rate reserve during the 1st month of the study protocol with maintenance of the program thereafter. No strength training or burst activity will be prescribed and all activities will fall well within the recommended national guidelines for recreational exercise.</description>

Exercise regimen will begin at a low level of intensity (3 sessions per week, 20 minutes per session, at a heart rate corresponding to 60% of heart rate reserve), then increase in duration and training intensity to a goal of up to 60 minutes per session, 4 to 7 sessions per week, at 70% of the heart rate reserve during the 1st month of the study protocol with maintenance of the program thereafter. No strength training or burst activity will be prescribed and all activities will fall well within the recommended national guidelines for recreational exercise.</description>

        <description>Cardiac MRI was performed in all patients without implantable devices/claustrophobia requiring sedation at study enrollment and termination (4 months later). Scar volume was calculated as total delayed gadolinium enhancement mass at each time interval. Change over time was compared between study arms.</description>

Exercise regimen will begin at a low level of intensity (3 sessions per week, 20 minutes per session, at a heart rate corresponding to 60% of heart rate reserve), then increase in duration and training intensity to a goal of up to 60 minutes per session, 4 to 7 sessions per week, at 70% of the heart rate reserve during the 1st month of the study protocol with maintenance of the program thereafter.
