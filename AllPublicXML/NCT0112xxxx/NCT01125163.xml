  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In preterm infants with birth weights less than 1500 grams, does iron supplementation with
      2mg/kg/day in addition to routine feeding with routine iron-fortified milk (formula or
      fortified mother's milk), as compared to routine iron fortified milk, increase hematocrit at
      36 weeks adjusted postmenstrual age (or at discharge if sooner)?
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fortified mother's milk or fortified formula is routine practice in neonatal units and is not
      an intervention.

    <description>For infants discharged home prior to 36 wks PMA, the last Hct was used.For infants transferred prior to 36 wks PMA, the Hct at receiving hospital was used if available. A non-parametric rank sum analysis was performed as follows so that infants who died before 36 wks and those transfused could be included in an intention-to-treat analysis.Infants were ranked by death (lowest rank) then by number of transfusions (next lowest ranks). For infants who survived and were not transfused, the 36 wk PMA Hct was used as the primary outcome.</description>

            <groups_desc>A non-parametric rank sum analysis was performed as follows so that infants who died before 36 wks and infants who were transfused could be included in an intention-to-treat analysis. Infants were ranked by death (lowest rank) then by number of transfusions (next lowest ranks). For infants who survived and were not transfused, the 36 wks PMA Hct was used as the primary outcome.</groups_desc>

      <restrictive_agreement>There is NOT an agreement between Principal Investigators and the Sponsor (or its agents) that restricts the PI's rights to discuss or publish trial results after the trial is completed. </restrictive_agreement>

    <limitations_and_caveats>This trial was done in a setting where relatively liberal transfusion guidelines (based on PINT study) are used so difficult to generalize to settings where restrictive transfusion guidelines are used.</limitations_and_caveats>
