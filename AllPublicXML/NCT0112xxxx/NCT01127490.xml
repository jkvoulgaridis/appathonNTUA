  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the characteristics of the nerves and the small veins
      in the skin of people with fibromyalgia. The investigators will then use this information to
      identify possible processes in the skin that may help explain why some people feel pain
      relief with the study drug (duloxetine) and others do not.

      Duloxetine affects certain chemicals in the brain called neurotransmitters. An abnormality in
      these chemicals is thought to be related to fibromyalgia. Duloxetine is a selective serotonin
      and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI), similar to some drugs used for the treatment of
      depression. Duloxetine is approved for sale in the United States by the Food and Drug
      Administration (FDA) for the treatment of fibromyalgia.
