      Multicenter, open-label, phase 1, cohort dose escalation study to determine the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) of 3 intermittent OSI-906 dosing schedules.

  <detailed_description>

      Multicenter, open-label, phase 1, cohort dose escalation.

      The study will open with Dosing Schedule 1 (S1) (OSI-906 Once Daily (QD) Days 1-3 every 14
      days). Dosing Schedule 2 (S2) (OSI-906 QD Days 1-5 every 14 days) will be initiated following
      observation of clinically significant related toxicity ≥ grade 2 in S1 or after a review of
      preliminary safety and pharmacokinetic data from ≥ 6 dose levels in S1 indicate that toxicity
      is acceptable and potential improvement in exposure may be achieved by an increased number of
      dosing days. Dosing Schedule 3 (S3) (OSI-906 QD Days 1-7 every 14 days) will occur upon
      observation of clinically significant related toxicity ≥ grade 2 in S2 or after ≥ 1 dose
      level in S2 has been examined.

      A 3-patient bridging dose cohort will be opened in S1 to qualitatively compare the 25 mg
      capsule with 100 mg capsule dosage strengths in order to confirm that no gross differences in
      safety or exposure exist between the formulations. In order to characterize the tablet, a
      6-patient dose cohort will be opened to qualitatively examine the pharmacokinetics of this
      dosage form.

      Once the MTD has been determined for S1 and once the safety and pharmacokinetic data from the
      tablet cohort have been reviewed, a Fed-Fasted Expansion Cohort will be opened.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically or cytologically documented malignancy that is now advanced and/or
             metastatic and refractory to established forms of therapy or for which no effective
             therapy exists

          -  Patients with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status &lt;/= 2

          -  Predicted life expectancy ≥ 12 weeks

          -  Patients may have had prior therapy, providing the following conditions are met:

               -  Chemotherapy: A minimum of 3 weeks (4 weeks for carboplatin or investigational
                  anticancer agents and 6 weeks for nitrosoureas and mitomycin C) must have elapsed
                  between the end of treatment and registration into this study. Prior tyrosine
                  kinase inhibitor therapy is permitted. Patients must have recovered from any
                  treatment-related toxicities (except for alopecia, fatigue, and grade 1
                  neurotoxicity) prior to registration

               -  Hormonal therapy: Patients may have had prior anticancer hormonal therapy
                  provided it is discontinued prior to registration into this study. However,
                  patients with prostate cancer with evidence of progressive disease may continue
                  on therapy that produces medical castration (eg, goserelin or leuprorelin),
