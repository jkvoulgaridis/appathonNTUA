      This research study is being held at UCSD to determine whether the medication Quetiapine
      helps people suffering from anorexia nervosa by reducing core eating disorders symptoms. This
      study will see if the medication Quetiapine helps symptoms of anxiety, depression, and
      obsessionality, in addition to increasing BMI. Men and women between the ages of 18-65 and

    <description>Subjects will start with 25mg hs on day 1, 25mg bid on day 2, 25mg am and 50mg hs on day 3, 50mg bid on day 4, 50mg am and 75mg hs on day five, and 75mg bid on day six. Dosage will be increased further on an individual basis as determined by the study physician and as tolerated by the subject with a maximum dosage of 400 mg. Dose can be reduced as determined by clinical judgment. In order to determine the most effective dose, the dose of Quetiapine (or placebo) will be titrated at intervals by staff according to the previously stated guidelines, the Pittsburgh Quetiapine Medication Management Assessment and Interview. Subjects will be interviewed about the factors described above and medication dose will be adjusted upward or downward depending upon symptom persistence or side effects.</description>
