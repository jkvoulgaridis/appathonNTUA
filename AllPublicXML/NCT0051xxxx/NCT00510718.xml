  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center open-label dose-escalation study of a novel compound (MDV3100) to
      treat patients with castration-resistant (hormone-refractory) prostate cancer. Additional
      patients will be enrolled in expanded cohorts at doses determined to be tolerable. Patients
      who tolerate the drug and do not progress will be allowed to continue to look for PSA
      response.

      This is a Phase 1, open-label, uncontrolled, dose-escalation study with dose-expansion at
      doses determined to be tolerated. Patients who tolerate the drug and do not progress will be
      allowed to continue treatment. The study endpoints are safety and tolerability and
      pharmacokinetics. PSA values will also be collected to look for PSA response.

    <time_frame>Baseline up to 30 days after last dose of study treatment (approximately maximum of 129 months)</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse events (AE) was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. An SAE was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. A treatment emergent AE was defined as an event that emerged during the treatment period that was absent before treatment, or worsened during the treatment period relative to the pretreatment state. AEs included both SAEs and non-SAEs.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With at Least 1 Dose-limiting Toxicity (DLT): Multiple Dose Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to first 35 days of the study treatment in multiple dose period</time_frame>
    <description>DLT was defined as a national cancer institute's common toxicity criteria for adverse events (NCI-CTCAE) version 3.0 grade 3 or greater toxicity regardless of perceived causality that is not improved by the use of adequate/maximal medical intervention. Grade 3 alopecia, fever without neutropenia, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, and self-limited or medically controllable adverse events were not considered as DLTs.</description>

    <measure>Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of MDV3100: Multiple Dose Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to first 35 days of the study treatment in multiple dose period</time_frame>
    <description>Tolerability was defined as if less than (&lt;) 4/12 in participants with no prior exposure to MDV3100 (chemo-naive) and &lt; 4/12 prior chemotherapy participants experienced a DLT within the first 35 days of the multiple dose period. For doses higher than 360 mg/day, tolerability was defined if &lt;8/24 participants previously treated with chemotherapy experience a DLT within the first 35 days of the multiple dose period. MTD was defined as a dose below the intolerable dose.</description>

          <description>Participants with no prior exposure to chemotherapy received single oral dose of MDV3100 in 1 out of the 7 cohorts of 30, 60, 150, 240, 360, 480 or 600 milligram per day (mg/day) dose on Day 1 and were followed up for 6 days in single dose (dose escalation) period. Dose escalation from 30 to 600 mg/day continued until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was determined or until a dose of 600 mg/day was evaluated. After dose-escalation, the cohorts receiving 60-600 mg/day dose were expanded in multiple dose (dose expansion) period, where participants received MDV3100 according to their dose in single dose period for 84 days. This was followed by long-term dosing period in which participants continued to receive 160 mg/day dose of MDV3100 until withdrew of consent, dose limiting toxicity (DLT) or disease progression occurred. Participants were followed up for 30 days after last dose of study drug for safety follow up.</description>

        <description>An adverse events (AE) was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. An SAE was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. A treatment emergent AE was defined as an event that emerged during the treatment period that was absent before treatment, or worsened during the treatment period relative to the pretreatment state. AEs included both SAEs and non-SAEs.</description>

        <title>Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of MDV3100: Multiple Dose Period</title>
        <description>Tolerability was defined as if less than (&lt;) 4/12 in participants with no prior exposure to MDV3100 (chemo-naive) and &lt; 4/12 prior chemotherapy participants experienced a DLT within the first 35 days of the multiple dose period. For doses higher than 360 mg/day, tolerability was defined if &lt;8/24 participants previously treated with chemotherapy experience a DLT within the first 35 days of the multiple dose period. MTD was defined as a dose below the intolerable dose.</description>

Dose escalation from 30 to 600 mg/day continued until the MTD was determined or until a dose of 600 mg/day was evaluated. After dose-escalation, the cohorts receiving 60-600 mg/day dose were expanded in multiple dose (dose expansion) period, where participants received MDV3100 according to their dose in single dose period for 84 days.</description>

          <description>Tolerability was defined as if less than (&lt;) 4/12 in participants with no prior exposure to MDV3100 (chemo-naive) and &lt; 4/12 prior chemotherapy participants experienced a DLT within the first 35 days of the multiple dose period. For doses higher than 360 mg/day, tolerability was defined if &lt;8/24 participants previously treated with chemotherapy experience a DLT within the first 35 days of the multiple dose period. MTD was defined as a dose below the intolerable dose.</description>
