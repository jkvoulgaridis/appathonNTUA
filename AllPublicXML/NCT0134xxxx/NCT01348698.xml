  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      - Tumors of the adrenal gland are common. Most of them are not cancerous. However, there are
      no tests that can accurately tell which adrenal tumors are cancerous and which are not. The
      only way to tell is to remove the tumor with surgery and then examine it. Researchers have
      been using new methods to study samples of adrenal tissue. These methods may help identify
      whether the cells are or may become cancerous without an operation. This information will
      help doctors determine which tumors will need to be removed.

      Objectives:

      - To collect adrenal tumor tissue biopsy samples in order to study and evaluate new methods
      that may help identify cancerous or precancerous cells.

      Eligibility:

      - Individuals at least 18 years of age who have an adrenal tumor that may or may not be
      cancerous.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with a physical examination, medical history, blood and
           urine tests, and imaging studies.

        -  Participants will be examined to determine whether they have a specific type of adrenal
           tumor

      (pheochromocytoma).

        -  Participants whose tumor does not secrete hormones will have a tumor biopsy to collect
           tissue for study.

        -  Participants who have a large tumor or one that secretes hormones will have standard
           surgery to remove the tumor. Tissue will be collected for study.

        -  Researchers will examine the collected tissue. They will try to determine whether the
           cells are cancerous or may become cancerous.

        -  Participants will be asked to return to the National Institutes of Health Clinical
           Center every year for about 5 years. During these visits they will have imaging studies,
           lab tests, and a physical examination.

      Background:

        -  Adrenal neoplasms are common and are incidentally discovered in 4-10% of abdominal
           imaging studies.

        -  The majority of adrenal incidentalomas are cortical adenoma.

        -  Many patients with nonfunctioning adrenal incidentalomas undergo adrenalectomy to
           exclude a cancer diagnosis.

        -  There are no reliable clinical, radiographic or laboratory studies that accurately
           distinguish between localized benign and malignant adrenal neoplasm.

        -  This protocol is designed to determine the feasibility and accuracy of using novel
           molecular markers of malignant adrenal neoplasm in fine needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy
           and surgically resected samples.

      Objectives:

        -  Primary Objectives:

             -  To evaluate the feasibility of molecular testing in adrenal neoplasm FNA biopsy
                samples.

             -  To determine the accuracy of novel diagnostic molecular markers in clinical adrenal
                FNA biopsy and surgically resected samples.

        -  Secondary Objectives:

             -  To analyze the gene expression level relative to disease-free survival and overall
                survival in patients with adrenocortical carcinoma

      Eligibility:

        -  An individual with an adrenal neoplasm greater than 2cm in size

        -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years

        -  Adults must be able to understand and sign the informed consent document

      Design:

        -  Prospective observational study.

        -  Demographic, clinical, laboratory and pathologic data will be collected for each patient
           participant. Data will be securely stored in a computerized database.

        -  Patients will have biochemical testing to determine if their adrenal neoplasm is
           functioning or nonfunctioning.

        -  After their initial on-study evaluation, patients who are found to have a nonfunctioning
           adrenal tumor with a low risk of malignancy will be re-screened every year for 5 years
           with non-invasive imaging studies.

        -  Treatment of patients with an adrenal neoplasm will be performed based on standard
           clinical practice.

        -  Projected accrual will be 50 patients per year for a total of 10 years. Thus, we
           anticipate accruing 500 patients on this protocol.

    <description>Here is the count of participants with serious and non-serious adverse events assessed by the Common Terminology Criteria in Adverse Events (CTCAE v4.0). A non-serious adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence. A serious adverse event is an adverse event or suspected adverse reaction that results in death, a life threatening adverse drug experience, hospitalization, disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, congenital anomaly/birth defect or important medical events that jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the previous outcomes mentioned.</description>
