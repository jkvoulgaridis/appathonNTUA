  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research is being done to learn more about nonmyeloablative bone marrow transplantation
      (BMT), also known as a &quot;mini&quot; transplant for patients with blood cancers, using bone marrow
      from a relative.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The main goal is to learn whether a drug called tacrolimus, which is an immune-lowering drug
      (an immunosuppressant) given after transplant to help prevent certain complications, can be
      given safely for a shorter period of time than it has been in the past.

      At the present time there are few or no cures for your type of disease outside of a bone
      marrow transplant. The bone marrow for this transplant comes from a relative who is a
      half-match or &quot;haplo&quot; match to you. Possible donors include parents, siblings, and children.
      In order to help the bone marrow grow, or &quot;take&quot;, inside your body, you will receive
      chemotherapy and radiation before the transplant. After the transplant you will receive high
      doses of cyclophosphamide (CytoxanÂ®) along with other medications to lower the immune system,
      tacrolimus. These medications may lower the risk of graft versus host disease (GVHD) and of
      your body rejecting the bone marrow graft.

    <intervention_model_description>Participants were initially enrolled on the 90-day arm. When that arm completed enrollment, participants were enrolled on the 120-day arm while safety of the 90-day arm was evaluated. The 90-day arm was found to be safe, so participants were then enrolled on the 60-day arm for the remainder of the study.</intervention_model_description>

    <measure>Safety of reduced-dose tacrolimus as assessed by Percentage of Participants with severe graft versus host disease (GVHD)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 5 - Day 120</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage of participants with severe graft versus host disease (GVHD) defined as grade III-IV acute GVHD or extensive chronic GVHD. Acute GVHD is defined by the Przepiorka criteria, which stages the degree of organ involvement in the skin, liver, and gastrointestinal (GI) tract, based on severity, with Stage 1+ being least severe and stage 4+ being the most severe. Grading of acute GVHD is as follows: Grade I (skin involvement stages 1+ to 2+, with no liver or GI involvement), Grade II (skin involvement stages 1+ to 3+, liver 1+, GI tract 1+), Grade III (skin involvement stages 2+ to 3+, liver 1+, GI tract 2+ to 4+), Grade IV (skin involvement stages 4+, Liver 4+). Chronic GVHD is defined by the NIH consensus criteria. This system gives scores from 0 to 3 for Karnofsky performance score, skin, mouth, eyes, gastrointestinal, liver, lungs, joints, and genitals, as well as an overall severity. Higher scores indicate more severe disease. Scores are not totaled or added up.</description>

               2. Previous BMT within 6 months prior to start of conditioning. --Note: Patients who
                  have received treatment outside of these windows may be eligible if it is deemed
                  sufficient to reduce graft rejection risk; this will be decided on a case-by-case
                  basis by the PI or co-PI.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Active extramedullary leukemia or known active Central Nervous System (CNS)
             involvement by malignancy.

             conditioning.
