    <textblock>
      This research is being done to find out if the investigators can improve outcomes for
      multiple myeloma patients by giving a myeloma vaccine to patients who are already on
      lenalidomide (Revlimid) and in a near complete remission.

    <textblock>
      This is a single institution, single arm, Phase II study examining the clinical efficacy of
      an allogeneic GM-CSF secreting myeloma vaccine in combination with lenalidomide. Fifteen (15)
      patients enrolled in the study must have two disease measurements (including the last one)
      consistent with a near complete remission (M-spike negative with persistence of
      immunofixation) per criteria for response in a 6 month period. Patients will continue on the
      dose of lenalidomide they were on prior to being enrolled but will need to discontinue
      steroids for at least 4 weeks. Patients will receive 4 vaccinations on day 14(+/-3 days) of
      cycles 1, 2, 3 and 6 from enrollment that will include both the myeloma vaccine as well as
      Prevnar.

    <description>Immunity is measured by the percentage of CD3+/CSFSE-low/IFN-gamma+ cells. A positive result for a given participant is defined as greater than two standard deviations above that participant's baseline. The data are presented as three groups because the responses were analyzed separately, but all participants were part of the single study arm as represented by the remainder of the record. GVAX-specific immune response and Prevnar-specific immune response was assessed in the same patient by using GVAX and Prevnar-specific co-markers.</description>

        <description>Number of participants who converted from near complete remission (nCR) to complete remission (CR) as measured by the International Myeloma Working Group Uniform Response Criteria. Near complete remission is defined as negative serum and urine electrophoresis, &lt; 5% plasma cells in the bone marrow, and positive serum and/or urine immunofixation. Complete response is defined as negative serum and urine immunofixation and a bone marrow aspirate with &lt; 5% plasma cells.</description>

Doses of lenalidomide for investigation can vary from 5- 25 mg/day, orally on days 1 - 21 followed by 7 days rest (28 day cycle).
Allogeneic Myeloma Vaccine: A total of 4 vaccines will be administered. The first three at monthly intervals and a booster at 6 months from the initial vaccine. Each vaccination will consist of five total intra-dermal injections, two each in the right and left anterior upper thighs, and one in the non-dominant upper arm (unless contraindicated). Each dose will be administered on an outpatient basis. The subject must be observed in the clinic for at least 30 minutes after vaccination is completed.
Prevnar-13: Prevnar-13 will be administered at 0.5ml dose by intramuscular injection at the same time as GVAX vaccine.</description>

          <description>Lenalidomide: Dosage forms: 5, 10, 15 and 25 mg capsules. Patients will be continued on the same dose of lenalidomide as they were prior to being enrolled in the study. Doses of lenalidomide for investigation can vary from 5- 25 mg/day, orally on days 1 - 21 followed by 7 days rest (28 day cycle).
Allogeneic Myeloma Vaccine: A total of 4 vaccines will be administered. The first three at monthly intervals and a booster at 6 months from the initial vaccine. Each vaccination will consist of five total intra-dermal injections, two each in the right and left anterior upper thighs, and one in the non-dominant upper arm (unless contraindicated). Each dose will be administered on an outpatient basis. The subject must be observed in the clinic for at least 30 minutes after vaccination is completed.
Prevnar-13 will be administered at 0.5ml dose by intramuscular injection at the same time as GVAX vaccine.</description>
