      with Lotemax after undergoing cataract surgery.

      This is a single-center study to evaluate the clinical outcomes of Lotemax 0.5% for the
      treatment of Ocular inflammation associated with cataract surgery. Subjects will be screened
      from one to 21 days prior to initiation of dosing with the test article. Subjects who sign
      the informed consent document and meet all inclusion/exclusion criteria will be eligible to
      participate in this study. Subjects will instill one drop of Lotemax into the study
      (operative) eye QID for a maximum of 22 days. Dosing with test article will begin the day of
      surgery and for 21 days after surgery. Subjects will be seen for evaluation on Days 1, 7±1,
      and 21 ± 2 following surgery. Subjects will be seen for a follow-up visit on Day 42 ± 3
      following surgery, about 21 days after their last dose of test article.

      In addition to the test article regimen, subjects will receive Vigamox TID 3 days prior to
      surgery. Patients will receive one drop of Timoptic XE 0.5%, Zymaxid on the day of surgery.
      Postoperatively, patients will receive Vigamox TID for ten days and Bromday QD for 3 weeks.

    <time_frame>baseline to 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Cell scores at the final visit (pod 42) will be compared with baseline cells and will be measured using 1mmx1mm slit lamp beam. White cells present in the anterior chamber in a 1mm x 1mm slit lamp beam measured 3 times with the average number of cells being recorded. The grading scale was 0 (no cells/high power field), 1 (1-5 cells/high power field), 2 (6-15 cells/high power field), 3 (16-25 cells/high power field) and 4 (&gt;25 cells/high power field). Minimal values represent less inflammation or better inflammatory control and could represent a better outcome.</description>

    <measure>Flare Scores in Early Postoperative Period</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline to 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Flare scores will be measured using a 1mmx1mm slit lamp beam. Flare was assessed by looking at a 1mmx1mm slit lamp beam into the anterior chamber. Three measurements were taken and the average flare score was reported. The final outcome measure was the final flare score at 42 days compared to baseline. The grading scale was 0-4 with 0 repesenting no flare, 1mild flare, 2 moderate flare, 3 moderate severe and 4 severe flare. Minmal values represent less inflammation and could represent better inflammatory control.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or Female 18 years of age scheduled for unilateral cataract surgery

             implantation.

          3. Have intraocular inflammation (i.e. cells or flare in the anterior chamber as measured
             on slit lamp exam) in the study eye at the screening visit.

          4. Have a known blood dyscrasia or bone marrow suppression, a diagnosis of
             uncontrolled/unstable peptic ulcer disease, inflammatory bowel disease, or ulcerative
             colitis, or any uncontrolled/unstable pulmonary, cardiac, vascular, autoimmune,
             hepatic, renal, or central nervous system disease.

          5. Have used ocular, topical, or systemic steroids within 14 days or depot steroid 30

             the study. Note: use of an opioid during surgery (e.g., fentanyl) is allowed.

          6. Have uncontrolled glaucoma or IOP &gt;/= 27mmHg.

          7. Have active corneal pathology noted in the study eye at the screening visit. Active
             corneal pathology is defined as corneal pathology that is non-stable, or greater than
             mild, or will compromise assessment of the safety or efficacy of treatment.

          8. Are pregnant or nursing.

        <title>Cell Scores in the Early Outcome Period as Measured at 6 Weeks Post Phacoemulsification</title>
        <description>Cell scores at the final visit (pod 42) will be compared with baseline cells and will be measured using 1mmx1mm slit lamp beam. White cells present in the anterior chamber in a 1mm x 1mm slit lamp beam measured 3 times with the average number of cells being recorded. The grading scale was 0 (no cells/high power field), 1 (1-5 cells/high power field), 2 (6-15 cells/high power field), 3 (16-25 cells/high power field) and 4 (&gt;25 cells/high power field). Minimal values represent less inflammation or better inflammatory control and could represent a better outcome.</description>

        <title>Flare Scores in Early Postoperative Period</title>
        <description>Flare scores will be measured using a 1mmx1mm slit lamp beam. Flare was assessed by looking at a 1mmx1mm slit lamp beam into the anterior chamber. Three measurements were taken and the average flare score was reported. The final outcome measure was the final flare score at 42 days compared to baseline. The grading scale was 0-4 with 0 repesenting no flare, 1mild flare, 2 moderate flare, 3 moderate severe and 4 severe flare. Minmal values represent less inflammation and could represent better inflammatory control.</description>
