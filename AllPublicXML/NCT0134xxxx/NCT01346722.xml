  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is well documented that zinc supplementation to low-income population results in the
      reduced incidence of childhood diarrhoea and pneumonia, and improves growth of stunted
      children. In Bangladesh, the risk of zinc deficiency is considered to be high and children
      could benefit greatly by improving their zinc intakes on a daily basis. Zinc supplementation
      at a national scale would be a formidable task. There is a need to find an alternative. It
      might be sustainable to improve intake of zinc through fortified staples, e.g. rice with
      increased amounts of zinc; in fact such biofortified rice has been developed through
      conventional breeding, which is designed to contain an amount of zinc that could meet at
      least 40% of the daily requirement.

      In our first round of the previously approved and completed studies, total absorbed zinc
      (TAZ) did not differ when diets containing zinc biofortified rice (ZnBfR) or conventional
      rice (CR) were compared. Thus, we plan to repeat this study using a new variety of
      (ZnBfR)that is expected to have higher zinc content than the variety previously studied.
      Initially, we will also conduct a pilot study in 4 subjects using a modified isotope
      administration protocol such that the oral tracers will be given on two days each at half the
      original dose each day so as to provide a lower proportion of the total daily zinc intake as
      tracer solution.

      Hypotheses:

        1. Young children will have greater total absorbed zinc (TAZ) when they consume mixed diets
           containing ZnBfR than when they consume the same diets containing CR.

        2. TAZ will not differ in children who receive the ZnBfR-containing diet or the same diet
           containing CR plus sufficient additional zinc to match the zinc content of the ZnBfR
           diet.

      Objectives:

        1. To measure the amount of zinc absorbed from ZnBfR compared with the amount absorbed from
           CR and from CR fortified with added zinc, using the triple stable isotope tracer ratio
           technique in young children.

        2. To assess the intestinal function of the children, using a sugar permeability test
           (lactulose:mannitol test).

        3. (Pilot study) To verify that the modified tracer dose will provide adequate signal for
           assessing zinc absorption.

      Methods:

      To assess the potentials for biofortified rice in providing a good, bioavailable source of
      additional zinc, we propose to measure zinc absorption from rice-based meals among
      Bangladeshi preschool children. We will measure the amount of zinc absorbed from ZnBfR
      compared to that absorbed from a conventional Bangladeshi rice (Diet-CR) (control). We will
      also compare the zinc absorption from biofortified rice with that from zinc-fortified
      conventional rice (Diet-CR+Z). The study will be a cross-over, randomized, controlled
      clinical study. Initially, a pilot study will be conducted with a modified dose of zinc
      stable isotope among 4 children aged 36-59 months of either sex from a peri-urban community
      in Dhaka. Later on, 44 children aged 36-59 months of either sex will be recruited from the
      same community as mentioned before, and they will be individually randomized, in equal
      numbers, to one of the two comparison groups, A and B. During an initial one-day
      acclimatization period, the study children will receive the conventional rice based diet
      three times a day, to confirm that they will accept the study diets and adhere to the study
      procedures. On study days 2 and 4, in comparison group A, the study subjects will receive
      either the Diet-ZBfR or Diet-CR based on the random assignments, and they will receive
      Diet-CR or Diet ZBfR, respectively, on days 3 and 5 (i.e., the diet not received on days 2
      and 4), Likewise, in comparison group B, the study subjects will receive either Diet-ZBfR or
      Diet-CR+Z on days 2 and 4 based on the random assignments, and they will receive Diet-CR+Z or
      the Diet-ZBfR, respectively, on days 3 and 5 (i.e., the diet not received on days 2 and 4).
      We will use zinc stable isotope tracer techniques to measure the fractional absorption of
      zinc, in which tracer : tracee ratios will be measured in spot urine samples following
      administration of an intravenously administered tracer (68Zn) and one of two oral tracers
      (70Zn, 67Zn) provided with test meals over a four-day period.

      Outcome measures/variables: Intake of total dietary zinc (TDZ) and phytate for each subject
      will be calculated during the clinical study. Fractional absorption of zinc (FAZ) will be
      determined from the isotopic ratios obtained in urine samples using the following equation,
      which shows, as an example, the calculation that will be used for zinc absorption from the
      diet traced with 67Zn:

      FAZ = 67Zn tracer:tracee ratio / 68Zn tracer:tracee ratio * (68Zn dose given IV / 67Zn dose
      given orally)

      Total absorbed zinc (TAZ) for each child will be calculated as follows:

      TAZ (mg/d) = TDZ (mg/d) * FAZ
