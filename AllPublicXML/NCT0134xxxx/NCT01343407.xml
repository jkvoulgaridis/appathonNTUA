  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was a 2-part study in participants with allergen-induced asthma. It included a
      procedural pilot component (Part 1). Part 1 tested the key procedures and timing of Part 2;
      no study drug was administered during Part 1. Part 2 included a pre-randomization placebo
      run-in (Period 1) and 3 treatment periods (Periods 2, 3, and 4) during which participants
      were randomized to receive double-blind placebo, MK-1029 60 mg or MK-1029 500 mg in a
      crossover design. The treatment periods were followed by a minimum 21-day washout. Part 2
      assessed allergen-induced sputum eosinophils and allergen-induced late asthmatic response
      (LAR) compared to placebo.

    <measure>Percent Change From Baseline in Percent (%) Eosinophils in Induced Sputum At 8 Hours Post Allergen</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day -1) and Day 5 (8 hours after allergen challenge in each treatment period)</time_frame>
    <description>The effect of MK-1029 on the reduction of percent (%) sputum eosinophils following allergen challenge with standardized cat pelt or hair (CPH) allergen extract was assessed. Baseline % eosinophils were measured before treatment (and pre-allergen challenge) on Day -1. The change from baseline in allergen-induced % sputum eosinophils at 8 hr post allergen challenge testing on Day 5 was analyzed using a repeated measures linear mixed effects model with treatment, period, time, time-by-treatment interaction as fixed factors, and participant as a random factor. Outcome Measure 6 shows % eosinophil values at baseline.</description>

    <measure>Forced Expiratory Volume in One Second (FEV1) From 3 to 8 Hours Postdose (AUC3-8hr) During the Late Asthmatic Response (LAR)</measure>
    <time_frame>From 3 to 8 hours after allergen challenge on Day 5 of each treatment period</time_frame>
    <description>The effect of MK-1029 on the FEV1 AUC(3-8hr) during LAR was assessed. The unit of measure for an FEV1 AUC value is L*hr. The effect of treatment on LAR was assessed as the percent-fall in FEV1 AUC(3-8hr), evaluated by spirometry following allergen challenge on Day 5. The FEV1 AUC(3-8hr) during LAR was analyzed using a linear mixed effects model with treatment and period as fixed factors and participant as a random factor.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With an Adverse Event (AE)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 26 days in each treatment period</time_frame>
    <description>The number of participants who had at least one adverse event (AE) during study treatment and follow-up was assessed. An AE is defined as any unfavorable and unintended change in the structure, function, or chemistry of the body temporally associated with the use of the SPONSOR's product, whether or not considered related to the use of the product.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants Discontinuing Treatment Due to an AE</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 5 days in each treatment period</time_frame>
    <description>The number of participants who discontinued study treatment due to an AE was assessed. An AE is defined as any unfavorable and unintended change in the structure, function, or chemistry of the body temporally associated with the use of the SPONSOR's product, whether or not considered related to the use of the product.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percent Inhibition of the Expression of Cluster of Differentiation (CD)11b on Blood Eosinophils</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day -1, predose), 24 hours after allergen challenge on Day 5 in each treatment period</time_frame>
    <description>The concentration of CD11b in whole blood samples was assessed. The percent-inhibition of CD11b (a cell-surface biomarker on activated eosinophils) was assessed following inhaled allergen challenge on Day 5. Inhibition of CD11b expression was assessed by analyzing the % inhibition of CD11b expression from baseline (Day -1) using a linear mixed-effects model with period, treatment, time, and treatment by time as fixed terms and subject as a random term. Outcome Measure 7 shows CD11b expression values at baseline.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Baseline (Pre-Treatment) Percent (%) Eosinophils</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day -1), pre-antigen challenge</time_frame>
    <description>Baseline values of the percent (%) sputum eosinophils were measured pre-antigen challenge on Day -1. The baseline % eosinophil values were provided to assess the change from baseline after treatment.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Baseline Expression of Cluster of Differentiation (CD)11b on Blood Eosinophils</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1, predose</time_frame>
    <description>Baseline values for the antibody-specific expression of CD11b in whole blood samples, as obtained by flow cytometry, were obtained. The baseline CD11b values were obtained before treatment with MK-1029 60 mg, MK-1029 500 mg, or placebo, and were used to assess the effects of treatment.</description>

        <description>The effect of MK-1029 on the reduction of percent (%) sputum eosinophils following allergen challenge with standardized cat pelt or hair (CPH) allergen extract was assessed. Baseline % eosinophils were measured before treatment (and pre-allergen challenge) on Day -1. The change from baseline in allergen-induced % sputum eosinophils at 8 hr post allergen challenge testing on Day 5 was analyzed using a repeated measures linear mixed effects model with treatment, period, time, time-by-treatment interaction as fixed factors, and participant as a random factor. Outcome Measure 6 shows % eosinophil values at baseline.</description>

        <description>The concentration of CD11b in whole blood samples was assessed. The percent-inhibition of CD11b (a cell-surface biomarker on activated eosinophils) was assessed following inhaled allergen challenge on Day 5. Inhibition of CD11b expression was assessed by analyzing the % inhibition of CD11b expression from baseline (Day -1) using a linear mixed-effects model with period, treatment, time, and treatment by time as fixed terms and subject as a random term. Outcome Measure 7 shows CD11b expression values at baseline.</description>
