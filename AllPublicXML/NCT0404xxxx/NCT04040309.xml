  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators set up a randomized controlled clinical trial to evaluate the effectiveness
      of plasma rich in growth factors (PRGF) injections into the masseter muscle trigger points
      for myofascial pain treatment. The investigators also seek to compare PRGF injections
      effectiveness with local anesthetic injections.

      Dry needling and local anesthetics injections release trigger point by disrupting the
      membranes of a tout band. However, the injected substance itself does not affect the
      pathophysiological mechanism of the trigger point.

      It is known that the platelets release growth factors who can enhance muscle regeneration
      processes and moreover reduce chronic pain.

      The investigators raised a hypothesis that PRGF injections into the trigger points in
      masseter muscle can be an effective treatment method for the myofascial pain.

    <description>Plasma rich in growth factors will be prepared following the protocol described by E. Anitua. 9 ml of patients venous blood will be taken into one tube with 3,8% sodium citrate used as an anticoagulant. The blood then will be centrifuged (PRGF Centrifuge System, Biotechnology Institute, Vitoria, Spain) at room temperature for 8 min at 1800 rpm. After centrifugation 1 ml of 2nd plasma fraction will be collected by using a pipet. To activate plasma 10% calcium chloride will be used immediately before injecting plasma into the trigger point in the masseter muscle.</description>
