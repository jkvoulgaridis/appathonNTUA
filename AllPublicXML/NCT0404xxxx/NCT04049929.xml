      Protocol YY-20394-003 is a phase I single arm, open label study. The primary objective is to
      assess the safety of YY-20394 in subjects with advanced solid tumor. The secondary objective
      is to determine the preliminary efficacy and pharmacokinetics (PK).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this clinical trials, patients will be dosed YY-20394 orally at 80mg per day until disease
      progression, unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal from the study. A treatment cycle is
      defined as 28 days. Drug safety will be evaluated by NCI-CTC AE5.0 every week within 28 days
      after first dose and every 2 weeks in the following cycles. Efficacy will be assessed by
      RECIST1.1 after 2 cycles.

    <description>YY-20394 is a new type of PI3K-δ selective inhibitor which differs structurally from idelalisib and its analogs, showing high potency against PI3Kδ, but with markedly improved selectivity (&gt;1,000-fold selectivity for PI3K-δ versus PI3Kγ). This higher selectivity for PI3Kδ may decrease the risk of serious infection seen with idelalisib and especially with duvelisib due to strong immune suppression.Preclinical evaluation has demonstrated improved efficacy and safety for YY-20394 compared to idelalisib.</description>
