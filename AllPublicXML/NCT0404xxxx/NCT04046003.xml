  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to determine how 8-week Tai Chi intervention alters plasma endocannabinoid and
      its receptors in monocytes/marcrophages, plasma oxylipinds, plasma brain-derived neurotrophic
      factor, brain white matter connectivity/efficiency, and functional/clinical outcomes in women
      with knee OA.

    <textblock>
      Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is one of the five leading causes of disability. Previous studies
      have shown that a mind-body moderate-intensity Tai Chi (TC) exercise (8-24 weeks) reduced
      pain and improved physical function for knee OA, when compared to a waiting list, attention
      control, usual physical activity, or physical therapy. However, TC's mechanisms of action
      regarding improvement of one's clinical condition and its functional outcomes in individuals
      with knee OA are poorly understood. This study is to determine how 8-week TC intervention
      alters plasma endocannabinoid and its receptors in monocytes/marcrophages, plasma oxylipinds,
      plasma brain-derived neurotrophic factor, brain white matter connectivity/efficiency, and
      functional/clinical outcomes in women with knee OA.

Collect venous blood into evacuated tube containing lithium heparin and pour into a Leucosep tube prepared with Ficoll-Paque. Following sequential centrifugation steps, peripheral blood mononuclear cells will be collected and incubate with endotoxin (e.g. LPS or PMA) for 24 hours (Venable 2016). After incubation, PBMC will be collected and stained with cannabinoid receptors (CB1R and CB2R) and markers for monocytes/macrophages (CD14, etc).</description>

    <description>We will follow the protocol of Vachon-Presseau et al. 2006 to collect DTI data. DTI images will be acquired using echo planar imaging (72 x 2-mm thick axial slices; matrix size = 128 x 128; ﬁeld of view = 256 x 256mm2, resulting in a voxel size of 2 x 2 x 2mm). Images will have an isotropic distribution along 60 directions using a b-value of 1000s/mm2. For each set of diffusion-weighted data, eight volumes with no diffusion weighting will be acquired at equidistant points throughout the acquisition.</description>
