    <textblock>
      This study will examine the effects of a school based exercise intervention programme on the
      behaviour and fitness levels in children with autism. Local primary schools who have an
      Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) class will be approached to participate in the project. The
      age profile of the children will be 4-12 years of age and they will have mild-sever levels of
      autism. The exercise intervention programme will be delivered 3 times per week in the schools
      over an 8 week period.

      Children will be fitness tested to assess the change in fitness levels over the 8 week
      period. Questionnaires will be given to the parents and teachers of the children at the
      beginning and at the end of the programme to assess changes in behaviour levels as a result
      of the exercise intervention programme.

    <description>An exercise intervention programme will be implemented 3 times a week for an 8 week period of time in a school setting. Each exercise class will last 60 minutes. The exercise classes will be fun for the students to participate in and will involve aspects of fundamental movement skills.</description>
