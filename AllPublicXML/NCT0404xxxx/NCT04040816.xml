      This is a Phase II, Multicenter, Randomized, Double-blind, Placebo controlled, Multiple Dose
      study to evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics, and Pharmacodynamics of SAP-001
      in Gout Patients with Hyperuricemia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This multiple dose study will include up to 4 cohorts. Each cohort will be comprised of 15
      patients who will be dosed with SAP-001 or placebo once daily (QD) for 28 days. Dose
      escalation from Cohort 1 to Cohort 2 will occur after preliminary data are partially
      unblinded and safety data along with PK and PD parameters are analyzed and reviewed.
      Enrollment in Cohort 3 will begin after the last subject is randomized into Cohort 2.

      Prior to starting enrollment into Cohort 4, a complete safety assessment of Cohorts 1, 2 and
      3 will be performed to select the dose to be used in Cohort 4.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female ≥ 18 and ≤ 75 years of age.

          2. Body mass index (BMI) ≥ 19 and ≤ 42 kg/m2 at screening.

          3. sUA levels ≥ 7.5 mg/dL during screening and at check-in (Day -1).

          4. Patients must meet the American College of Rheumatology scoring criteria for the
             classification of primary gout (Neogi et al 2015).

          5. Patients must be able to take gout flare prophylaxis with colchicine 0.6 mg QD
             throughout the study as the primary method to prevent disease flare. If colchicine is
             not tolerated or contraindicated, naproxen 250 mg BID with or without H2 antagonists
             will be employed as a second line gout flare prophylactic agent. Gout flare
             prophylaxis will be initiated at the Day -1 visit in patients who are sUA-lowering
             agent naïve. For patients that discontinue an sUA-lowering agent(s) (ie, washout from
             current therapy) during the screening period, gout flare prophylaxis should be
             initiated at the time of discontinuation of the sUA-lowering agent(s).

          6. Is a nonsmoker or light smoker (smokes fewer than 10 cigarettes per day).

          7. Female patients either will be postmenopausal (female patients who state they are
             postmenopausal should have had cessation of menses for &gt; 1 year and have serum
             follicle-stimulating hormone [FSH] levels &gt; 40 mIU/mL and serum estradiol &lt; 20 pg/mL);
             or surgically sterile (including bilateral tubal ligation, salpingectomy [with or
             without oophorectomy], surgical hysterectomy, or bilateral oophorectomy [with or
             without hysterectomy]) for at least 3 months prior to screening; or will agree to use,
             from the time of check-in (Day -1) until 90 days following the last dose of study
             drug, the following forms of contraception: double-barrier method, hormonal
             contraceptives, barrier with spermicide, diaphragm or cervical cap with spermicide,
             intrauterine device, oral, implantable, or injectable contraceptives, or a sterile
             sexual partner. All female patients, except those with documented surgical
             hysterectomy in medical history, will have a negative urine pregnancy test result
             prior to enrollment in the study.

          8. Male patients either will be surgically sterile or agree to use, from the time of
             check-in (Day -1) until 90 days following the last dose of study drug, the following
             forms of contraception: male condom with spermicide and a female partner who is
             sterile or agrees to use hormonal contraceptives, female condom with spermicide,
             diaphragm or cervical cap with spermicide, intrauterine device, oral, implantable, or
             injectable contraceptives. Male patients will refrain from sperm donation from the
             time of check-in (Day -1) until 90 days following the last dose of study drug.

          9. Is capable of understanding the written informed consent, provides signed and
             witnessed written informed consent, and agrees to comply with protocol requirements.

             Cohorts 1 through 3:

         10. Patients who are not taking any UA-lowering medications within 2 weeks prior to the
             dose of study drug. Patients may discontinue sUA-lowering agents (ie, washout from
             current therapy) during the screening period. In the cases of a patient who must
             discontinue sUA-lowering agents or a patient not previously taking sUA-lowering agents
             during the screening period, gout flare prophylaxis should be initiated with
             colchicine 0.6 mg QD as the primary method to prevent disease flare and be continued
             during the study period. If colchicine is not tolerated or contraindicated, naproxen
             250 mg BID with or without H2 antagonists will be employed as a second line gout flare
             prophylactic agent.

             Cohort 4:

         11. Patient has been on a stable dose of allopurinol as existing urate-lowering therapy
             for at least 3 months prior to Day 1.

          1. Female patient is pregnant, planning to get pregnant, or lactating/breastfeeding.

          2. Has a history or presence of CS cardiovascular, renal, pulmonary, hepatic, gallbladder

             suitable for the study.

          3. Serum creatinine level &gt; 1.5 mg/dL and/or estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)
             ≤ 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 calculated using the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology
             Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equation (Levey et al 2009; National Institute of Diabetes and
             Digestive and Kidney Diseases, Estimating Glomerular Filtration Rate) at screening.

          4. History of stomach or intestinal surgery (except cholecystectomy, appendectomy, and/or
             hernia repair will be allowed).

          5. History of prescription drug abuse, illicit drug use, or alcohol abuse according to
             medical history within 6 months prior to the screening visit or any alcohol use for at

             defined as aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &gt; 1.5 ×
             upper limit of normal (ULN) or total bilirubin &gt; ULN; or a history of CS acute or
             chronic hepatitis (including infectious, metabolic, autoimmune, genetic, ischemic, or
             other forms), hepatocirrhosis, or hepatic tumors.

          9. Positive screen for alcohol or drugs of abuse (except for patients with a positive
             drug screen if it is a result of a prescribed medication from their physician) at
             screening or check-in (Day -1).

         10. History of a gout flare that is resolved within 14 days prior to the first dose of
             study drug on Day 1 (exclusive of chronic synovitis/arthritis). If a gout flare occurs

             Cohorts 1 through 3:

         19. Concomitant use of or treatment with any prescription drugs, herbal products,
             vitamins, minerals, and over-the-counter (OTC) medications that are known to lower sUA

             days prior to check-in (Day -1). Exceptions may be made on a case-by-case basis (such
