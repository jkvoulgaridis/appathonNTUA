  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The period from conception to 2 years of age ('first 1000 days') has been recognized as a
      critical period for long-lasting programming effects on later obesity and associated NCD and
      a window of opportunity to implement intervention for reducing and treating childhood
      obesity. However, there is a dearth of prospective intervention studies that address this
      nutritional problem in Jamaica and there are no reports of sustainable intervention.

      Jamaica is a middle income country in which overweight and obesity in children are also
      increasing at an alarming rate. The investigators in Jamaica are seeking to provide a more
      comprehensive knowledge on the link between early life nutrition and later childhood health
      and to assess the impact of an intervention of infant feeding counselling/education in
      mothers on growth and body composition in their offspring.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      At least 41 million children younger than 5 years are overweight or obese most of whom reside
      in low-income and middle-income countries (LMIC). Obese children tend to remain obese in
      adulthood predisposing to the huge personal health and economic burden of the
      non-communicable diseases (NCD).

      Several early life factors identified to contribute to development of obesity and adverse
      metabolic profile; pre-pregnancy underweight and overweight, high weight gain in early
      pregnancy in addition to inappropriate infant feeding pattern and rapid weight gain in early
      life have major role.

      The aims of the study are:1) to assess intrauterine and postnatal risk factors for childhood
      obesity in children followed from the second trimester in mother's pregnancy to age 1 year
      and 2) to assess the impact of a nutrition-based educational intervention on infant feeding,
      growth and body composition in the first year of life.

      This study design is a cluster randomized clinical trial with key outputs being : 1) The use
      of deuterium dilution method to provide new data on body composition of mothers from during
      pregnancy and during infancy in addition to obtain accurate measurement of breastmilk intake
      2) new data on the relationship between maternal body composition and/or infant body
      composition and non-communicable disease risk factors; 3) new data on the impact of a
      nutrition-based educational on infant's growth and body composition.

      The first sample will be the baseline sample. After that a dose of deuterium oxide will be
      administered and then two other samples of saliva will be taken at 3 hours and four hour
      intervals. when the dose has equilibrated with total body water. Saliva samples will be
      collected using a dry cotton wool swab. With assistance, the swab will be moved around the
      mouth until the cotton wool is sodden. After removing the plunger from a 20 ml syringe
      barrel, the cotton wool from the swab will be removed and placed in the barrel of the syringe
      the plunger will be replaced and used to squeeze the saliva into a cryovial for storage at -
      20 degrees centigrade for later analysis of deuterium enrichment by FTIR.
