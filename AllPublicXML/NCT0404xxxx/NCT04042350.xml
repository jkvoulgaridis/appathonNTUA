  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate which clinical and laboratory factors are associated
      with major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE) in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients on
      dialysis.

      The study will also establish a cardiovascular (CV) risk equation appropriate for this
      dialysis population.

      This study is a retrospective analysis of dialysis dependent CKD patients participating in
      AURORA. The retrospective analysis will be performed using the AURORA study database.

      AURORA was a prospective clinical trial in which dialysis patients were randomly assigned to
      rosuvastatin or placebo, sponsored by AstraZeneca. Patients included in the AURORA study who
      had end stage renal disease (ESRD) and had been treated with regular hemodialysis or
      hemofiltration for at least 3 months. Patients were recruited from approximately 300 centers
      in 25 countries.

      The clinical study data is held by AstraZeneca AB, Sweden.

      No formal sample size calculation was performed. The sample size is based on the available
      data from the AURORA study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who participated in the AURORA study. In brief, men and women who had ESRD
             and had been treated with regular hemodialysis or hemofiltration for at least 3 months
             (patients were recruited from 280 centers in 25 countries).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The major exclusion criteria in AURORA were statin therapy within the previous 6
             months, expected kidney transplantation within 1 year, and serious hematologic,
             neoplastic, gastrointestinal, infectious, or metabolic disease (excluding diabetes)
             that was predicted to limit life expectancy to less than 1 year.

          -  Other exclusion criteria were a history of a malignant condition, active liver disease
             (indicated by an alanine aminotransferase level that was more than three times the
             upper limit of the normal range), uncontrolled hypothyroidism, and an unexplained
             elevation in the creatine kinase level to more than three times the upper limit of the
             normal range.
