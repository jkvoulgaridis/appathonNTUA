    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Written informed consent and any locally-required authorization (EU Data Privacy
             Directive in the EU) obtained from the subject prior to performing any
             protocol-related procedures, including screening evaluations.

          -  Subject is willing and able to comply with the protocol for the duration of the study
             including undergoing treatment and scheduled visits and examinations including follow
             up.

          -  Age over or equal to 18 years at time of study entry.

          -  Histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the lung stage IIIB/IV according to UICC7

          -  One or two previous lines of systemic therapy including maintenance for advanced or
             metastatic NSCLC. Patients should be offered standard therapy regimens as recommended
             by current local Clinical Practice Guidelines. Neo-adjuvant and adjuvant therapies are
             permitted, provided that disease progression/relapse occurred more than 6 months after
             cessation of therapy.

          -  ECOG performance status 0-1.

          -  Expected life expectancy of at least 3 months.

          -  Patients with measurable disease (at least one uni-dimensionally measurable target
             lesion by CT-scan or MRI) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
             (RECIST 1.1) are eligible. If a potential target lesion has been irradiated
             previously, clear evidence of progression at target site must be documented.

          -  A formalin fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor tissue block (archival or recent) or
             approx. of 10-15 unstained slides of tumor sample (slices must be recent and collected
             on slides provided by the sponsor) must be available for PDâ€‘L1 and other biomarker
             evaluation. Biopsy should be excisional, incisional or core needle. Fine needle
             aspiration is insufficient.

          -  Prior therapies and surgeries are allowed if completed 2 weeks (for minor surgery) or
             4 weeks (palliative radiotherapy for bone pain; major surgeries with complete wound
             healing), respectively prior to start of treatment and patient recovered from toxic
             effects.

          -  Adequate blood count, liver-enzymes, and renal function (obtained no later than 14
             days prior to start of treatment)

          -  Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must use appropriate method(s) of
             contraception. WOCBP should use an adequate method to avoid pregnancy for 5 months (30
             days plus the time required for nivolumab to undergo five half-lives) after the last
             dose of nivolumab. Since the effect of nintedanib on the metabolism and efficacy of
             contraceptives has not been investigated, barrier methods should be applied as a
             second form of contraception, to avoid pregnancy.

          -  Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test
             within 24 hours prior to the start of study treatment and monthly throughout treatment
             until 5 months after last dose of IMP.

          -  Men who are sexually active with WOCBP must use any contraceptive method with a
             failure rate of less than 1% per year. Men receiving nivolumab and who are sexually
             active with WOCBP will be instructed to adhere to contraception for a period of 7
             months after the last dose of investigational product. Women who are not of
             childbearing potential (ie, who are postmenopausal or surgically sterile) as well as
             azoospermic men do not require contraception.

             weeks prior to enrollment. In addition, subjects must be either off corticosteroids,
             or on a stable or decreasing dose of â‰¤ 10 mg daily prednisone (or equivalent).)
