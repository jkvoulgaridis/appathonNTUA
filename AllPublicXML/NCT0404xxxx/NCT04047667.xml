  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Interstitial lung diseases (ILD) are common in clinical practices and need multidisciplinary
      assessment of clinical presentations, radiological and histological features. Transbronchial
      cryobiopsy (TBCB) is one of the most important invasive procedures for ILD when a confident
      diagnosis cannot be made by clinical and radiological assessment. TBCB could lead to higher
      incidence of risks. The pneumothorax and severe bleeding seemed to be more common in patients
      with TBCB.

      Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) could provide 3-dimensinal (3D) CT images which were
      close to the image qualities of conventional CT. The probe-to-pleura relationship could be
      accurately established by the 3D CT scan and the cryobiopsy safety profile might be improved
      under the guidance of CBCT. In this study, we conducted a prospective study to observe the
      safety and diagnostic efficacy of CBCT guided TBCB for the DPLD patients.

    <description>CBCT images are acquried and reviewed in axial, coronal and sagittal planes to most accurately assess the cryoprobe position within the lung parenchyma and relative to other thoracic structures. The minimum probe-to-pleura distance will be measured. If the position of cryoprobe is proper, TBCB will be perfomed.</description>
