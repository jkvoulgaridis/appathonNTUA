  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to investigate the effects of high-intensity noninvasive positive pressure
      ventilation (NPPV), as compared with low-intensity NPPV, on hypercapnia, consciousness,
      inspiratory muscle effort, dyspnea, NPPV tolerance, inflammatory response, adverse events and
      other outcomes in patients with acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

    <description>In the high-intensity NPPV group, patients will undergo pressure-limited NPPV (eg, NPPV in spontaneous/timed mode) at a higher IPAP level. IPAP is initially set at 10 cmH2O and continuously adjusted by increments and decrements of 1-2 cmH2O (typically ranging between 20 and 30 cmH2O), according to patients' tolerance, to obtain a tidal volume (VT) of 10-15 mL/kg. IPAP should be increased as much as possible to decrease PaCO2 to a normal level. However, if PaCO2 decreases to less than 35 mmHg, IPAP should be decreased to achieve normocapnia.</description>
