  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will look at the health results of using the LEGION™ Primary Knee System over a
      period of ten (10) years. This type of surgery uses an artificial knee made of plastic and
      metal. This study will enter subjects who suffer from a variety of conditions that have
      caused at least one of their knees to become nonfunctional. You are being asked to
      participate in the study because you have significant problems with your knee(s) and your
      study surgeon has determined that your knee(s) must be surgically replaced to improve your
      condition. If you decided to participate in this study, you will be one of approximately one
      hundred thirty-eight (138) subjects in the study.
