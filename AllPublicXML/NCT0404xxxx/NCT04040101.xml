    <textblock>
      Background:

      Stroke is the 4th deadly disease in Taiwan, 2016. Long term disabilities, balance impairments
      and limitations of activities of daily living are common characteristics of stroke. Balance
      assessment and training play an important role in stroke rehabilitation. However, there are
      some limitations. Clinical assessments (functional scales) could not avoid some errors caused
      by subjective observations from different test givers; instrumental assessments (force
      plates, Biodex system) are complex to approach, not easy to use, and difficult to get.
      Balance training could not meet the expected effectiveness due to inconvenient
      transportations, forgotten home programs, and time limitation caused by huge amount of
      patients with insufficient therapists. Smartphones had been used for health promoting and
      sport training. The balance training related applications could be found at Google Play
      store, but clinically proved effective App and stroke-designed App has not yet existed. The
      balance rehabilitation of stroke sufferers will be benefited if there is an easy-use and
      effective App that supports balance assessment and personalized training by combining the
      convenience and powerfulness of smartphones.

      Purpose:

      The purposes of this study are: Year 1 Develop a smartphone-based application to assess and
      train static balance for stroke sufferers, and evaluate the feasibility of the application;
      Year 2 Develop a smartphone-based application to assess and train dynamic balance for stroke
      sufferers, and evaluate the feasibility of the application; Year 3 Build a static and dynamic
      balance performance standard by recruiting healthy subjects, then evaluate the training
      effects of the application on balance performance of stroke sufferers.

      Methods:

      Android smartphones will be used to analyze the balance performance by collecting
      acceleration and angular velocity data from the built-in sensors. Static balance assessment
      and training system will be developed in the first year. The system will assess balance
      ability by testing the performance under different standing conditions, then provide a
      training plan according to the assessment result. Dynamic balance assessment and training
      system will be developed in the second year. The system will execute limits of stability test
      to assess dynamic balance, then provide a training plan according to the assessment result.
      Validity and reliability will be tested in the first and second year, by comparing the
      smartphone assessment result with Berg balance scale, force plate, and Biodex balance system.
      In the third year, we will recruit healthy subjects to create a balance performance standard,
      then recruit chronic stroke subjects to evaluate the training effect of the App by comparing
      with traditional rehabilitation therapy.

      Expected Results &amp; Contribution When the study is completed, several valuable contributions
      will be provided. These include (1) developing a smartphone application which can be used to
      assess and rehabilitate static and dynamic balance functions on stroke sufferers; (2)
      evaluating the feasibility and the training effects of the smartphone application, and
      providing evidence-based results for scientific paper publication; (3) clinically offering an
      easy-used and effective tool for clinicians and subjects with stroke to evaluate and improve
      balance performance.
