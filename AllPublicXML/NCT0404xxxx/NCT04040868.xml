    <textblock>
      The investigators present the design of a randomized trial to compare the accuracy and safety
      of screw insertion using the robot-assisted technique versus the conventional
      fluoroscopy-assisted technique in spine surgery at multicenter. The accuracy and safety of
      screw insertion are measured by deviation of guide pin placement position, deviation of screw
      placement position, and intraoperative or postoperative complications. Secondary outcome
      parameters such as radiation exposure, postoperative recovery, duration of surgery, length of
      hospital stay and economic appraisal were also evaluated and compared between treatment
      groups.

    <textblock>
      In spinal surgery, the accurate placement of implants is the key to ensure the success of the
      surgery, to achieve the safety and clinical requirements of internal fixation. Robot-assisted
      technology has become an effective means to improve the accuracy of implants with higher
      accuracy, free from fatigue and equivalent repetitive operation. The investigators present
      the design of a randomized trial to compare the accuracy and safety of screw insertion using
      the robot-assisted technique versus the conventional fluoroscopy-assisted technique in spine
      surgery at multicenter.

      500 participants per group (1000 participants in total) are being recruited after diagnosis
      and before treatment through multi-hospital system and randomised to 1) robot-assisted
      technique or 2) conventional fluoroscopy-assisted technique in spine surgery. Outcomes are
      being measured pre-operatively, during- surgery and at 3, 6, 12 months post-surgery. The
      accuracy and safety of screw insertion are measured by deviation of guide pin placement
      position, deviation of screw placement position, and intraoperative or postoperative
      complications. Secondary outcome parameters such as radiation exposure, postoperative
      recovery, duration of surgery, length of hospital stay and economic appraisal were also
      evaluated and compared between treatment groups.

      The study is addressing key questions of importance by evaluating the TiRobot-assisted
      technique versus the conventional fluoroscopy-assisted technique in spine surgery at
      multicenter. Outputs include evidence to facilitate more effective and safe decision making
      about surgical treatment for spine.

    <description>After completing guide pin placement preparation, do the C arm scan, obtain 3-D scanning image, plan on the image, position by the robot, finish the needle placement and obtain 3-D scanning image again. Fusion two groups of the image, measure the distance between the entry and exit points of the guide pin and the surgical planning, calculate the insertion deviation, and evaluate the insertion accuracy of the guide pin.
Insertion deviation = (Input offset distance + Output offset distance) / 2, the unit is mm.
If more than one guide pin is needed for the operation, the deviation of the insertion shall be calculated separately and the average shall be taken.</description>

    <description>Costs for each arm of the trial will be analysed by components of the intervention pathway (e.g. pre-consultation, work-up, theatre, post-treatment, follow-up, management/coordination, side-effects, etc.); by expenditure category (e.g. capital, staff, consumables, overheads, other); and by incidence (i.e. who bears the costs). The cost component of the economic appraisal will thus assess the cost drivers from a range of perspectives for both intervention approaches. Downstream costs and potential cost offsets incurred beyond the randomized trial data collection period will be modelled from the literature and expert opinion, with sources clearly documented.</description>
