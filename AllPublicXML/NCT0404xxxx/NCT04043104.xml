      Open-label, non-randomized, dose escalation trial of AAV2hAQP1 administered via Stensen's
      duct to a single parotid gland in subjects with radiation-induced xerostomia The objectives
      are to evaluate the safety and identify either a maximum tolerated dose or a maximum feasible
      dose of a single dose of AAV2hAQP1 infused into one targeted parotid gland:

      To evaluate subject improvement of xerostomia symptoms, to evaluate the increase in parotid
      gland salivary output after treatment with AAV2hAQP1, to evaluate additional efficacy
      outcomes.

    <description>The starting dose will be at a titer of 1 x 1011 vg/mL. The viral titer used to dose each consecutive cohort of subjects will be increased as follows: 3 x 1011 vg/mL, 1 x 1012 vg/mL, 3 x 1012 vg/mL, and 6 x 1012 vg/mL. If 2 subjects experience a DLT at the 1 x 1011 vg/mL dose level (Dose Group 1; see Table 2), then a lower dose of 3 x 1010 vg/mL may be studied. Depending upon the occurrence of a protocol-defined toxicity, an additional 1-3 subjects may be enrolled into a dose group.</description>

             salivary flow and a stimulated parotid salivary flow in the targeted parotid gland &gt;0
             and &lt;0.3 mL/min/gland after 2% citrate stimulation.

          5. No evidence of recurrence of the primary malignancy by an otolaryngology (ears, nose,
             and throat [ENT]) assessment. Additionally, all subjects must be disease-free of head

             the end of treatment. Disease status will be determined by negative clinical
             examinations and computed tomography (CT) scans of the neck and chest. If subjects
             have had a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the neck or a positron emission

             surgically sterile) and all male subjects must use a medically accepted contraceptive
             regimen during their participation in the study and until all samples collected at 2
             consecutive visits following AAV2hAQP1 administration are negative. Acceptable methods
             of contraception for male subjects include the following:

               -  Condoms with spermicide. Acceptable methods of contraception for female subjects
                  include the following:

               -  Hormonal contraception (oral, implant, injection, ring, or patch) for at least 12
                  weeks prior to Screening.

               -  Diaphragm used in combination with spermicide.
