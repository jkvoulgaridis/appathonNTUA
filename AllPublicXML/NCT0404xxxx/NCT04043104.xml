      Open-label, non-randomized, dose escalation trial of AAV2hAQP1 administered via Stensen's
      duct to a single parotid gland in subjects with radiation-induced xerostomia The objectives
      are to evaluate the safety and identify either a maximum tolerated dose or a maximum feasible
      dose of a single dose of AAV2hAQP1 infused into one targeted parotid gland:

      To evaluate subject improvement of xerostomia symptoms, to evaluate the increase in parotid
      gland salivary output after treatment with AAV2hAQP1, to evaluate additional efficacy
      outcomes.

    <description>The starting dose will be at a titer of 1 x 1011 vg/mL. The viral titer used to dose each consecutive cohort of subjects will be increased as follows: 3 x 1011 vg/mL, 1 x 1012 vg/mL, 3 x 1012 vg/mL, and 6 x 1012 vg/mL. If 2 subjects experience a DLT at the 1 x 1011 vg/mL dose level (Dose Group 1; see Table 2), then a lower dose of 3 x 1010 vg/mL may be studied. Depending upon the occurrence of a protocol-defined toxicity, an additional 1-3 subjects may be enrolled into a dose group.</description>

             salivary flow and a stimulated parotid salivary flow in the targeted parotid gland &gt;0
             and &lt;0.3 mL/min/gland after 2% citrate stimulation.

          5. No evidence of recurrence of the primary malignancy by an otolaryngology (ears, nose,

             examinations and computed tomography (CT) scans of the neck and chest. If subjects
             have had a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the neck or a positron emission

             regimen during their participation in the study and until all samples collected at 2
             consecutive visits following AAV2hAQP1 administration are negative. Acceptable methods
             of contraception for male subjects include the following:

               -  Condoms with spermicide. Acceptable methods of contraception for female subjects
                  include the following:
