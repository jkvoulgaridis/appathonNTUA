  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the gametocytocidal and transmission reducing activity
      of pyronaridine-artesunate (PA) and dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DP) with and without a
      single low dose of primaquine (PQ; 0.25mg/kg). Outcome measures will include infectivity at 2
      and 7 days after treatment, the duration of infectivity in the artemisinin combination
      therapy (ACT) only arms, and the production and detectability of histidine rich protein II.
