  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Long-acting reversible contraceptives [LARC; copper-intrauterine devices (IUDs), the
      levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) and subdermal implants] are the most
      effective reversible contraceptives available. A common side effect of these methods is
      changes in menstrual bleeding. Dissatisfaction with unpredictable bleeding is the main reason
      for early discontinuation of LARC methods.

      The mechanism of unpredictable bleeding is unknown; it is likely related to the progestogen
      dilating superficial veins and capillaries, which are fragile and susceptible to focal
      bleeding. Other potential influences include changes in structural support of the
      endometrium, altered matrix metalloproteinase activity, and changes in endometrial perfusion
      and hemostasis. Local genetic alterations of the hormonal receptors of endometrium can also
      play a role in the etiology of the unpredictable bleeding experienced by some women.

      Regarding etonogestrel (ENG)-releasing implant, some evidences suggest that the use of
      mefenamic acid, mifepristone with estradiol or doxycycline, or doxycycline alone can
      temporally stop the bleeding; however, all these therapies cannot avert the recurrence of the
      bleeding. Recently, a randomized clinical trial (RCT) evaluated the effectiveness of a
      short-term use of combined oral contraceptive (COC) in stopping bleeding episodes and
      preventing bleeding recurrence. The authors found that bothersome bleeding in ENG-implant
      users stopped within 14-day of COC treatment, but bleeding most often resumes within 10 days
      of treatment cessation.

      Although COC can stop the bleeding, it is not known which component of the COC is responsible
      for this effect. There is evidence suggesting that estrogen alone is not effective in
      stopping the bleeding of progestogen-only contraceptives or a high dose of ethinyl estradiol
      is needed to obtain this effect. Furthermore, the recurrence of the bleeding shown with the
      COC use could be explained by the interruption of the estrogen. For this reason, our
      hypothesis is that a progestogen-only pill could be superior to placebo in stopping the
      bleeding associated with the ENG-implant use as well as being superior to placebo in
      recurrence of bleeding after discontinuation of the therapy.
