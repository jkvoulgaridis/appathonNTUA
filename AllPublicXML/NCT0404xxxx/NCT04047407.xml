  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the induced-pain characteristics after
      suprathreshold pressure stimulation at different intensities in fibromyalgia subjects,
      compared with healthy volunteers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fibromyalgia syndrome is a chronic painful, non-inflammatory rheumatic disease with a high
      negative impact on the quality of life, and is characterized by widespread pain, fatigue and
      generalised hyperalgesia on examination, symptoms that can be the consequence of central
      sensitization.

      Despite several methods have successfully addressed this increased responsiveness of
      nociceptive neurons in the central nervous system, there is a lack of consensus about how to
      systematically perform them and those that are more appropriated for different syndromes.
      Therefore, investigating appropriate simple methods to assess clinical manifestations of
      central sensitization is relevant in the assessment of fibromyalgia.

      The present study aims to investigate the pain response after suprathreshols pressure
      stimulation in fibromyalgia subjects compared with healthy volunteers.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Referred pain induced area after suprathreshold pressure stimulation</measure>
    <time_frame>Inmediately after each stimulation</time_frame>
    <description>After each stimulation (120%, 130%, 140% and 150%), the subject should draw the induced pain area on a digital bodychart using the Navigate Pain application (Navigate Pain, Aalborg University, Denmark). The size of the areas of referred pain will be extracted in pixels.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain intensity</measure>
    <time_frame>Inmediately after each stimulation</time_frame>
    <description>It will be measured with a visual analog scale (VAS) of 100 millimeters in length. The subject has to indicate the level of pain he feels, being 0 the absence of pain and 100 the maximum imaginable.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Body regions afected by pain after suprathreshold pressure stimulation</measure>
    <time_frame>Inmediately after each stimulation</time_frame>
    <description>The digital body chart will be divided into 15 different regions: (1) posterior head and neck area; (2) supraspinal area; (3) infraspinatus area; (4) posterior shoulder area; (5) back area; (6) posterior arm area; (7) posterior forearm area; (8) posterior hand area; (9) anterior head and neck area; (10) supraclavicular area; (11) chest area; (12) anterior shoulder area; (13) anterior arm area; (14) anterior forearm area; (15) anterior hand area. The total number of body regions afected by pain will be recorded.</description>

    <description>Suprathreshold pain stimulation will be applied in the infraspinatus muscle (point equidistant between the midpoint of the spine of the scapula, the inferior angle of the scapula and the midpoint of the medial border of the scapula) with a pressure algometer (Force Ten ™, Wagner Instruments, USA). Four suprathreshold pressure stimulations (pressure pain threshold + 20%, +30%, +40% and +50%) will be made for 60 seconds, with a minimum rest of 5 minutes between each stimulation.
The sequence of stimulation (ascending or descending) will be randomized.</description>
