    <textblock>
      In this trial the investigators aim to evaluate safety and efficacy of combination Ivosidenib
      (AG-120) and nivolumab in the context of adult patients with Isocitrate dehydrogenase-1
      (IDH1) mutated acute myeloid leukemias (AML) or Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS).

      Primary objectives:

        1. To determine the overall response rate of (CR/CRi) of combination ivosidenib (AG-120)
           and nivolumab in patients with high risk MDS and relapsed/ refractory AML

        2. To determine the duration of response of combination ivosidenib (AG-120) and nivolumab
           in patients with high risk MDS and relapsed/ refractory AML 2.2 Secondary Objectives

      1) To determine the progression free survival of patients treated with combination ivosidenib
      (AG- 120) and nivolumab. 2) To determine the overall survival of patients treated with
      combination ivosidenib (AG-120) and nivolumab. 3) To determine hematological response rate of
      patients treated with combination ivosidenib (AG- 120) and nivolumab. 4) To establish the
      duration of response to treatment of patients treated with combination ivosidenib (AG-120)
      and nivolumab. 5) To evaluate the safety and tolerability of combination ivosidenib (AG-120)
      and nivolumab.

      Exploratory objectives:

        1. To assess the relationship between treatment response and correlative studies such as
           plasma and bone marrow 2-HG levels, and IDH variant allele frequency.

        2. Genomic characterization by assaying specimens obtained from patients using an MDS/AML
           specific panel through the duration of therapy to longitudinally assess mutational
           burden before and during therapy, and correlating this mutational data with patient
           outcomes

        3. Correlate exploratory biomarkers including PD-L1 expression, circulating myeloid-derived
           suppressor cells and interferon gamma signatures to response
