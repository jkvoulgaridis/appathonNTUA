  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label Phase 2a clinical study designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of
      AVB-S6-500 in patients with IgA Nephropathy (IgAN). Approximately 24 patients will be
      enrolled. Several dose levels of AVB-S6-500 may be evaluated.

             infection, or positive serology at screening

          -  Recent active infection requiring hospitalization or i.v. treatment within 30 days
             prior to the first dose of study drug

          -  Received transfusion, plasmapheresis or plasma exchange, IV immunoglobulin (IVIg)

             (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of study drug

          -  Known sensitivity to any of the products to be administered during dosing

          -  Subject will not be available for follow-up assessment

          -  Subject has any kind of disorder that compromises the ability of the subject to give
