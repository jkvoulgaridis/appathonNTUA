      Objectives: The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of photobiomodulation
      therapies on root resorption compared with the placebo group. Materials and Methods: 30
      patients, who were admitted to the …………. University Faculty of Dentistry Orthodontics
      Department for treatment, with an indication of upper right 1st premolar tooth extraction was
      included. Before the individuals' orthodontic treatment, 0.022 slot MBT brackets and tubes
      were placed on the maxillary 1st premolar and molar. A 150g buccal tipping force was applied
      to the 1st premolar. Individuals were then randomly divided into 3 groups. For the first
      group; laser application was performed with a 810 nm GaAlAs laser device at 0,3,7,14,21 and
      28 days to 8 J/cm2. Second group; an LED application according to the manufacturer's
      instructions with a 850 nm wavelength and 20 mW/cm2 output power for 10 minutes per day
      during the experiment. Third group; a placebo therapy was completed whereby a laser device
      that did not make active pulses was used. At the end of four weeks, the amount of root
      surface resorption was compared using micro-CT imaging after the extraction of the teeth.
