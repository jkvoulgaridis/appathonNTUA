  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hand movements are particularly impaired in Parkinson's Disease (PD) patients contributing to
      functional disability and difficulties in activities of daily living. AMADEO®. is an
      end-effector system enables intensive training with frequently repeated gripping movements.
      It offers the possibility to select from between passive, assistive and active modes using
      exercise of finger strength, finger movement, movement control and a selective activation of
      the fingers.Aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of the end-effector finger system,
      AMADEO®, on hand-finger movements in PD patients evaluating the improvement on finger tapping
      and agility of hand movement item scores on the MDS-UPDRS, variation on the active finger
      strengths and the active and passive Range of Motion (ROM); variation on Electromyographic
      (EMG)-parameters.

    <description>Twenty PD patients with hand bradykinesia will be treated with the AMADEO® system. They will undergo 15 training sessions, 5 a week for 3 weeks, each session lasting about 60 minutes. During each session, both the hands will be treated using the endeffector in its active and active-assisted modality.</description>

    <description>Twenty control subjects (PD patients) will be treated with traditional rehabilitation focused on fine hand-finger movement skills. The patients in this group will undergo the same amount of treatment.
Both the groups will be trained with conventional physiotherapy concerning postural, balance and gait.</description>

    <description>AMADEO® is an end-effector system enables intensive training with frequently repeated gripping movements. It offers the possibility to select from between passive, assistive and active modes using exercise of finger strength, finger movement, movement control and a selective activation of the fingers.
Moreover, even without muscular strength, active work can be done using EMG-based training. The Continuous Passive Motion (CPM Plus) therapy facilitates the implementation of automatic movement sequences even when the patient is unable to complete the entire range of motion on their own. It may be used in all phases of finger-hand rehabilitation and can be adapted to the needs of every patient.
In patients with PD, it will be useful in improving bradykinesia and potentially distal hypostenia.</description>
