  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As the standard of best practice, care of complicated or difficult patient needs not only
      knowledge but also including skills and clinical thinking in many aspects.

      Simulation is now accepted as the way of teaching for adult learners. This learning method
      can help students to apply their knowledge, practical skills and non-technical skills. A
      systematic review study showed that self-directed learning (SDL) in health professions
      education is associated with moderate improvement in the knowledge domain. SDL also help the
      learners to improve self-efficacy and the learning outcomes in complicated tasks.In this
      study, the investigators wanted to evaluate that simulation can enhance student to do SDL in
      the both pre and post session period.

      After approval from the instution's Ethics Committee, a prospective cohort study was
      conducted between November 2017 to March 2018. Twenty-five anesthesia residents were
      participated in this study. Students were noticed about the simulation classes which are
      emergencies in pediatric anesthesia and complications at one-month prior the day of practice.
      The list of standard references was given. On the day of study, at the institute's simulation
      center, students were voluntarily separated into two groups, directed- learner and observer.
      Post class debriefing sessions were done as routine activities. After the class, the
      investigator invited the students to be enrolled in this study by using the flyers. Following
      the consent process, three consecutive questionnaires (day 0 ,30, 90) were sent to the
      subjects. The data analysis will be done by using R program. The statistically significance
      in this study was classified at p &lt;0.05.
