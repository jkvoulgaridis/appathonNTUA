  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A novel, web-based carepartner focused intervention (CARE-CITE) is designed to foster problem
      solving and skill building while facilitating carepartner engagement during upper extremity
      functional activities in the home setting. The proposed study will evaluate the application
      of the CARE-CITE intervention paired with usual and customary care during the sub-acute
      stroke.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is a leading cause of long-term disability and to date, research has placed little
      emphasis on how to integrate carepartners (family members) into the rehabilitation process
      without increasing negative carepartner outcomes.

    <measure>Change in Carepartner (CP) Depression using Center for Epidemiologic Studies - Depression (CES-D) Scale score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 2 months post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>CES-D is 20-item, Likert-type scale (range 0-none/rare to 3-most/all of the time). The scoring of positive items is reversed. Possible range of scores is zero to 60, with the higher scores indicating the presence of more symptomatology.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Carepartner (CP) quality of life using Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) Scale score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 2 months post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>SF-36 is a 36-item Likert-type scale,mental health domain. The SF-36 consists of eight scaled scores, which are the weighted sums of the questions in their section. Each scale is directly transformed into a 0-100 scale on the assumption that each question carries equal weight. The lower the score the more disability. The higher the score the less disability i.e., a score of zero is equivalent to maximum disability and a score of 100 is equivalent to no disability.</description>

    <measure>Change in SS Upper Extremity Function using Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT) score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 2 months post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT) is a quantitative index of upper extremity motor ability examinable through the use of timed and functional tasks. The first 6 items involve timed functional tasks, items 7 and 14 are measures of strength, and the remaining 9 items consist of analyzing movement quality when completing various tasks. The items are rated on a 6-point scale. Lower scores are indicative of lower functioning levels.</description>

    <description>Stroke Impact Scale (SIS) 59-items are broken down into eight domains: strength, hand function, mobility, activities of daily living, emotion, memory, communication, social participation. Domains are scored on a metric of 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better self-reported health.</description>

    <measure>Change in Family Care Climate Questionnaire - Carepartners (FCCQ-CP) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 2 months post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The Family Care Climate Questionnaire (FCCQ) for carepartners is 14-item questionnaire asking about the carepartners' experiences with the strokes survivor in relation to their rehabilitation activities. Each item is rated on a 7-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (not true at all) to 7 (very true). Item scores are averaged to provide an overall score between 1 and 7 where higher scores indicate the carepartner thinks they are providing high autonomy support to the stroke survivor.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and 2 months post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The Family Care Climate Questionnaire (FCCQ) for stroke survivors is 14-item questionnaire asking about experiences with family members in relation to rehabilitation activities. Each item is rated on a 7-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (not true at all) to 7 (very true). Item scores are averaged to provide an overall score between 1 and 7 where higher scores indicate the stroke survivor perceives receiving high autonomy support from the carepartner.</description>

    <measure>Change in CP Family Conflict using Family Caregiver Conflict Scale (FCCS) score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 2 months post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The FCCS is a unidimensional, Likert‐type scale composed of 15 items. Each item response is in a Likert‐type format with participants indicating their agreement with the item with 1 &quot;not true at all&quot; to 7 &quot;very true.&quot; Item scores are summed and higher scores represent higher levels of conflict within a family.</description>

    <measure>Change in Caregiver Strain assessed by the Caregiver Strain Index (CSI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 2 months post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The CSI is a 13-question tool that measures strain related to care provision. There is at least one item for each of the following major domains: Employment, Financial, Physical, Social and Time. Positive responses to seven or more items on the index indicate a greater level of strain. Scoring ranges from 0 to 26, with 0 indicating no caregiver strain and 26 indicating extreme strain</description>

    <description>The primary CARE-CITE components will be education via web platform. CP completes 6 online CARE-CITE modules (15-30-minute sessions each). Modules include demonstration videos and instructive content covering following areas: principles of functional task practice (i.e., activities of daily living such as eating, grooming, or leisure/vocational activities), adaptation of tasks, and importance of progression of challenging tasks to drive neuroplasticity (i.e., increasing numbers of practice repetitions or weight of objects lifted). Underpinning the content is the concept of autonomy support, with examples of fostering empathy, problem solving, instruction in the use of non-controlling language with role playing situations and the importance of creating choice in activities.</description>
