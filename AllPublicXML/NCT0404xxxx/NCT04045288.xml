  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The SWITCH (School Wellness Integration Targeting Child Health) project is a multi-component
      intervention designed to support school wellness programming and contribute to youth obesity
      prevention. Consistent with social-ecological models, SWITCH is designed to reach multiple
      settings within schools while also facilitating engagement with families and community
      partners. The program focuses on three distinct behaviors known to impact obesity (i.e.,
      physical activity (PA), sedentary behavior (SB) and fruit and vegetable consumption (FV)) in
      a creative way by challenging children to &quot;switch what they do, view and chew&quot;.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Schools provide an ideal setting for coordinated youth obesity prevention but it has proven
      difficult to widely disseminate evidence-based programs in a cost-effective way.
      Multi-component programs that target multiple behaviors and reach multiple settings have been
      widely recommended in both scientific literature and in public health guidelines documents,
      but there are few examples of integrated social-ecological approaches that offer promise for
      broad dissemination.

      SWITCH initially began as a controlled childhood obesity intervention trial. A limitation of
      the original SWITCH program is that the print-based materials made it cost-prohibitive to
      promote broader dissemination, or to engage other schools. Therefore, the focus of subsequent
      work focused on developing and testing implementation strategies that would enable SWITCH to
      be more widely disseminated. In a controlled effectiveness study, we demonstrated that a
      web-based version had similar utility and outcomes as the print-based program, but effects
      were directly related to the degree of engagement within the school. Through a USDA-funded
      project, we developed a novel training method designed to facilitate greater adoption and
      more effective implementation of SWITCH in schools. The focus in this revised SWITCH model
      was on helping schools to independently manage the implementation of the evidence-based
      SWITCH program as part of overall school wellness programming. Thus, we have gradually
      evolved SWITCH from a school-based intervention conducted through schools to a school
      wellness training method provided for schools. Schools received

      Before moving to broader dissemination efforts it was important to determine the dose of
      training and support needed to assist schools with implementation. Therefore, the focus of
      this study was on comparing two different implementation approaches. An enhanced capacity
      building model that included personalized webinars with school leaders (Enhanced) was
      compared to a streamlined model based on email communication (Standard). Thus, a key goal is
      to determine the additive benefit of the enhanced school support relative to the standard
      implementation. Past work has demonstrated that there is considerable variability in the
      capacity of schools to take on and lead school wellness programming. Therefore, the analyses
      also directly examined the moderating influence of school capacity on implementation as well
      as the impact of implementation on outcomes.

    <time_frame>Change from baseline to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The estimate of daily MVPA is obtained from the calibrated , online self-report tool (Youth Activity Profile) built into the web-based content management system. Students complete 5 items capturing school activity and 5 items capturing home activity. The data are then processed using validated algorithms to create estimates of time spent in physical activity behavior.</description>

    <description>The estimate of time spent in sedentary behavior (outside of school) is obtained from a calibrated, online self-report tool (Youth Activity Profile) built into the web-based content management system. Students complete 5 items capturing general amounts of sedentary behavior. The data are then processed using validated algorithms to create estimates of time spent in sedentary behavior.</description>

    <measure>School Capacity for Wellness Programming; School Wellness Readiness Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The assessment of school capacity for wellness programming is obtained at both pre and post time points using the School Wellness Readiness Assessment (SWRA) based on work by Holt et al. (2009). The instrument developed specifically for SWITCH captures Structural barriers (Individual and Organizational) and organizational barriers (Individual and Organizational). The instrument will be completed by the school core teams and the subscale scores will be averaged to create an overall indicator of School Capacity.</description>

    <measure>Average Weekly Tracking Rate (%); Web-based SWITCH tracking tool</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Indicators of school, class and student implementation are obtained by computing engagement and utilization of the web-based SWITCH tracking system. Self-monitoring is a key mediating variable in the SWITCH program, so emphasis in training was placed on helping to promote utilization of the SWITCH tracking system to promote behavior change in the three target behaviors: PA (&quot;do&quot;), SB (&quot;view&quot;), and FV consumption (&quot;chew&quot;).</description>

    <description>The Checkpoint Implementation Surveys (CIS) were used in a formative way to guide to evaluate the degree to which schools followed the SWITCH 'quality elements' for overall school implementation. School teams self-reported the degree to which they followed each of the five quality elements using a 3-point scale (none = 1, somewhat = 2, and fully = 3). The average score was used as the overall indicator</description>

    <description>The Checkpoint Implementation Surveys (CIS) were used in a formative way to guide to evaluate the degree to which schools followed the SWITCH 'best practices' in the three targeted settings (classrooms, physical education, and lunchroom). School teams self-reported the degree to which their school followed the 3 best practices in each setting using a 3-point scale (none = 1, somewhat = 2, and fully = 3). The average score is used as an overall indicator.</description>

    <description>All schools in SWITCH receive training through webinars and an in-person conference to learn about the defining elements and school wellness programming in general. Consistent with the standard implementation, schools were added to the online content management system (CMS) and were given access to an online community of practice (CoP) to interact with other schools / teachers in the study. Schools were provided with resources and program materials (i.e. educational modules, trinkets, posters, etc.) but were given autonomy with regard to how they were used within their school. Weekly updates through the online CMS, the CoP, and via direct email correspondence provided information about the weekly corresponding weekly themes, implementation tips, recommended module activities to incorporate, upcoming evaluation needs, important SWITCH dates, and other program reminders.</description>

    <description>The 'Enhanced' implementation strategy provided schools with the same training, access and resources as the standard SWITCH implementation along with more personalized, web-based training based on motivational interviewing (MI) techniques and feedback throughout the implementation process. The supplemental support was provided through participation in two online 'checkpoint sessions' that helped schools self-assess their use of the recommended quality elements and setting-specific best practices. The sessions used principles of motivational interviewing (MI) to promote autonomy and motivation for school change through the process. Schools were also provided with information about how to capitalize on support from local 4H program leaders in their county.</description>
