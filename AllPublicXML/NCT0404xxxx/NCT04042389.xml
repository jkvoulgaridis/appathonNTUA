    <textblock>
      Objective: To determine the effect of WhatsApp and Email reminders on oral hygiene compliance
      of orthodontic patients.

      Methods: A Randomized, parallel group, double blinded study was conducted on 54 patients
      undergoing orthodontic treatment at MAHSA University. They were randomized to 3 groups,
      namely WhatsApp (W) group, Email (E) group and Control (C) group with 18 subjects in each
      group. Group (W) and Group (E) received oral health messages once a week through WhatsApp and
      E-mail reminders respectively, while Group (C) did not receive any reminders. Plaque was
      measured at baseline (T0), after 4 weeks (T1), and after 8 weeks (T2). For each subject, two
      intraoral photographs were taken after application of plaque disclosing agent; and the area
      covered by plaque was measured on 12, 13, 43, 22, 23 and 33 teeth by planimetry.

    <textblock>
      Fifty-four patients undergoing orthodontic treatment were recruited from the dental clinic of
      MAHSA University between Jan 2018 to April 2018. Voluntary written informed consent was
      obtained from all the subjects before the start of the study. They were randomly assigned
      into 3 groups namely WhatsApp (W) group, Email (E) group and Control (C) group with 18
      subjects in each group. Oral hygiene messages through WhatsApp and Email were sent once a
      week for 8 weeks.

    <description>Plaque disclosing solution was applied to the pre-selected teeth (12,13,43, 22, 23, 33) followed by measurement of plaque using planimetry. All photographs were taken using a Canon Electro-Optical System (EOS) 550D (camera specifications). Plaque was analyzed using Image J software. Change in plaque score is assessed from baseline to 4 weeks in all the three groups.
In the photo, region of interest targeted by the study was manually outlined using &quot;Polygon selection tool&quot;, the total pixel present in this region is calculated by tracing tool. The pixel of the plaque area is determined by adjusting the color threshold to desirable range of value. The plaque sore was calculated in the form of percent covering tooth structure and the value of plaque on each tooth was determined and mean plaque was calculated.</description>
