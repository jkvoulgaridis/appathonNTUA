  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, single-arm, open label and dose escalation clinical study of
      anti-CD147 CART cells in patients with recurrent malignant glioma.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients autologous T cells are activated and then engineered to express chimeric antigen
      receptors (CARs) specific for CD147(CD147-CART). CAR-T cells are expanded in culture and
      returned to the patient by Ommaya Reservoir at specific cell doses. Three CD147-CART doses
      patient are planned at 1-week intervals. Serum cytokine level and CAR-T cell number will be
      measured in whole treatment session.
