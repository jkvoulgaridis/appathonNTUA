  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes prevalence is increasing among people living with HIV (PLWH), yet blood glucose
      control is less successful in this population who are also often food insecure. Food
      assistance programs often provide nutrient-poor foods. This proposal asses the feasibility of
      monitoring diabetes-related health outcomes among food insecure PLWH who are receiving food
      boxes higher in dietary protein and fiber and lower in simple carbohydrates.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this investigation is to develop and assess a study protocol to evaluate the
      impact of food assistance on diabetes-related health outcomes in food insecure people living
      with HIV (PLWH). Compared to the general population, PLWH have increased risk for type 2
      diabetes and worse glycemic control when using similar pharmaceutical treatments.
      Interventions to improve diet quality could thus have a clinically meaningful impact on
      diabetes treatment in this population. However, many PLWH are food insecure and rely on food
      assistance to meet basic nutrition needs. This proposal will determine the feasibility of a
      protocol to evaluate diabetes-related health outcomes in food insecure PLWH and diabetes who
      receive high protein, high dietary fiber food boxes from Birmingham AIDS Outreach. The study
      will consist of retrospective analysis of electronic medical record data and stored
      specimens, and prospective cross-sectional analysis of food security and diet quality in PLWH
      who do versus those who do not receive the food boxes.

      Specific Aim 1: To determine the feasibility of recruiting, enrolling, and collecting dietary
      intake data from people living with HIV who are food insecure.

      Specific Aim 2: To compare changes over twelve months in glycemic control, food security, and
      diet quality in B-FED participants compared to non-participating 1917 clinic patients.

      This proposal aligns with the UAB Diabetes Research Center's goal to facilitate development
      of new methods to treat diabetes and its complications. The investigators will determine the
      effect size for scale-up of larger, longer-term assessment through an NIDDK-R18 grant to
      evaluate the real-world impact of B-FED on glycemic control and food security.

    <description>Six months after program enrollment, B-FED participants will have improved body mass index (calculated using height and weight from electronic medical record) versus PLWH with insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes who do not participate in the program. Body weight will be measured to the nearest 0.1 kg using a Medtronic scale. Height will be measured to the nearest 0.1 cm using a stadiometer. The values will be used to compute the body mass index (weight[kg]/height[m2]).</description>

    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>B-FED participants will report a higher prevalence of food security compared to clinic patients who do not participate in the program. This will be assessed at 1 time point using the validated 2-item Food Security Questionnaire to classify participants as food secure, low food security, or very low food security.</description>

    <description>B-FED participants in the highest tertile of dietary fiber intake will experience greater reductions in hemoglobin A1c levels compared to participants in the lowest fiber tertile. Hemoglobin A1c will be measured using stored blood samples. Dietary fiber intake will be assessed as the average daily fiber intake in grams from three 24-hour diet recalls.</description>
