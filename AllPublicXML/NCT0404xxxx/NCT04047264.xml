  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Microdialysis permits sampling of molecules from the extracellular fluid, and has been
      utilized for studies of pharmacokinetics, and recovery of biomarkers. Gliomas remain
      incurable--in part due to limited access to human tumor biology in available preclinical
      models. This study utilizes a variable rate pump (M dialysis 107) and a high molecular weight
      cut-off catheter (71 high cut-off brain microdialysis catheter) to recover an expanded range
      of potential biomarkers from the diseased human central nervous system in the context of
      surgery for brain tumors. This study is performed under an investigational device exemption
      for use of these clinical grade devices that are not otherwise FDA approved for general use.
      The study will evaluate the safety of these devices and the feasibility of their use to
      collect analytes with sizes up to 100kDA. Analysis will be performed to evaluate the yield of
      oncometabolites and other potential biomarkers in appropriate regions of tumor and brain
      adjacent to tumor. Data obtained from analysis of samples collected will facilitate the
      design of future observational and interventional studies for central nervous system
      malignancies.

    <description>Each microdialysis catheter will be connected to a M dialysis 107 pump, with flow rates between 0.5 and 1.5 ÂµL per minute. Prior to tumor removal, catheters will be placed within appropriate regions of tumor core or adjacent tissue with assistance of neuronavigation. Any awake or asleep neurophysiological mapping and/or additional localization-guided tissue sampling procedures will be performed while microdialysis is in progress, including cortical or subcortical language or motor mapping. Microdialysis will end when the region being sampled is removed as part of the planned tumor resection. The tissue region sampled by each catheter will be harvested separately for correlative analyses.</description>
