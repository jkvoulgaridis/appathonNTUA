    <textblock>
      This is a single arm, open label, multi-centre phase II study using blinatumomab for
      treatment of detectable minimal residual disease (MRD) in the first year following allogeneic
      hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) for patients with B cell acute lymphoblastic
      leukemia (B-ALL). The study has 2 phases: 1. MRD testing phase and 2. blinatumomab treatment
      phase. Participants with B-ALL planning for HSCT meeting other eligibility criteria will be
      enrolled onto the MRD testing phase, which will involve centralized MRD testing of bone
      marrow aspirate samples on day +56, +100, +180, +270 following HSCT. Participants with
      detectable MRD ≥10^-4 leukemic cells/total nucleated cells will enroll onto the treatment
      phase. Blinatumomab treatment will be started following detection of MRD after 7 to 42 days
      from enrollment onto the treatment phase to allow for initiation of taper of
      immunosuppressive medications.
