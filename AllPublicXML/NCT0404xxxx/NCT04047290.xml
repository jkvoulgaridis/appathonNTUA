  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to characterize the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK),
      immunogenicity, pharmacodynamics (PD) and anti-tumor activity of AK112, a PD-1/VEGF
      bispecific antibody, as a single agent in adult subjects with advanced solid tumor
      malignancies. The study consists of a dose escalation phase (Phase 1a) to determine the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD), or recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) for AK112 as a single agent,
      and a dose expansion phase (Phase 1b) in subjects with specific tumor types which will
      characterize treatment of AK112 as a single agent at the MTD or RP2D.
