  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) are rare neoplasms arising from the diffuse endocrine system and
      spreading throughout the different organs and tissues of the body. Tumor-induced osteomalacia
      (TIO) , is a rare, serious paraneoplastic syndrome primarily derived from a benign tumor of
      mesenchymal tissue. NETs and mesenchymal tumors are often insidious and are undetectable by
      conventional imaging techniques including ultrasound, computed tomography and magnetic
      resonance, while a permanent cure will rely on exact localization and completely removal of
      the tumor.

      Positron emission tomography (PET) provides a valuable tool for the diagnosis and
      differential diagnosis, staging, efficacy evaluation and recurrence monitoring of various
      tumors. NETs and mesenchymal tumors overexpress somatostatin receptors (SSTRs), so molecular
      imaging using radiolabeled somatostatin analogues may be one of the best ways to detect the
      occult tumors. Recently, somatostatin analogue labelled with gallium-68 (68Ga-DOTA-TATE) as a
      novel positron tracer has shown to be effective for the detection of NETs and mesenchymal
      tumors. In this prospective study, the investigators will use the most advanced imaging
      equipment, integrated PET/MR，and PET / CT with specific imaging agent 68Ga-DOTA-TATE and
      conventional imaging agent [F-18]fluorodeoxyglucose to image patients suspected or confirmed
      NETs and TIO, the aim is to explore the value of hybrid PET/MR and PET/CT in neuroendocrine
      diseases and TIO.

      suspected of or diagnosed with NETs and TIO, the investigators aim to evaluate the roles of
      integrated PET/MR and PET/CT in differential diagnosis, detecting primary and metastatic
      lesions, guilding biopsy, staging and determining treatment plan prior to treatment; for
      patients with a history of NETs and TIO, the aim is to evaluate the value of integrated
      PET/MR and PET/CT for treatment response assessment, detection of recurrences and metastatic
      lesions; for patients with inoperable and metastatic NETs, the aim is to find the value of
      integrated PET/MR and PET/CT in assessing the expression level of SSTRs to guide peptide
      receptor radionuclide therapy.

    <description>The presence of non-physiological uptake or uptake in a tissue structure can be considered pathological. The signal intensity of PET indicates the presence and density of SSTR in the tissue. The lesion intake is higher than the liver and is classified as clearly positive. The lesion and the surrounding normal tissue ROI, measure the SUV, and calculate the T/B ratio. Special attention should be paid to the analysis of the causes of false positives and false negative results.</description>

        About 90% of NETs, such as pancreatic endocrine tumors, pheochromocytoma, paraganglioma,
        gastrointestinal carcinoid, bronchial carcinoid, medullary thyroid carcinoma, small cell
        lung cancer, pituitary adenoma, some non-NETs (meninga) Tumor, astrocytoma, breast cancer,
        etc. have high expression of somatostatin receptor (SSTR).

        TIO tumors are often derived from benign tumors of mesenchymal tissue, mostly located in
        bone or soft tissue, hiding in location, slow growth, and difficult to be found, making
        diagnosis difficult. According to reports in the literature, most of these tumors are
        positive for SSTR expression, and somatostatin receptor PET/CT imaging can locate lesions,
        which is a good method for screening TIO and has high specificity.
