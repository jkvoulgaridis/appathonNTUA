  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blinded, controlled Phase I study of CMAB809 administered by
      intravenous infusion. This study will characterize the pharmacokinetic, safety and
      immunogenicity of CMAB009 versus Trastuzumab(Herceptin) in healthy male subjects after a
