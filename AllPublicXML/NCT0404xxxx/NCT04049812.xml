  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of pulse magnetic field therapy on
      pain, functional status, and quality of life in patients with chronic radicular pain due to
      lumbar disc herniation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pulsed Electromagnetic Field Therapy (PEMF) is a non-invasive, painless treatment for various
      injuries, bone related conditions and pains. However, further studies on PEMF effects on low
      back and radicular pain is needed due to lack of studies in this area.

    <measure>Nottingham Health Profile (NHP)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Nottingham Health Profile (NHP) is a questionnaire designed to measure a patient's view of their own health status, in a number of areas.
The NHP consists of two parts. The first part focuses on health and comprises 38 items which deal with pain, energy, sleep, mobility, emotional reaction and social isolation. All questions have only yes/no answer options and each section score is weighted. The higher the score, the greater the number and severity of problems. The highest score in any section is 100.</description>
