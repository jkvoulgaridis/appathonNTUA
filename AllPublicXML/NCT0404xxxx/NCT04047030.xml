      The study will prospectively enroll and follow 300 participants ages 18-60 surgically treated
      for a lower-extremity articular injury including fractures of the tibial plateau, pilon,
      ankle, and calcaneus. All participating centers will undergo training to implement the
      Mobility Toolkit (MTK). Research Staff will facilitate a series of performance tests while
      participants wear the MTK device. MTK assessment will also be conducted on 150 non-injured
      adults matched to the injured cohort on age and gender. These individuals will be enrolled
      and assessed once at two participating centers. Study flow and data capture are summarized in
      the figure on the next page.

    <description>Approximately 300 participants treated for a fracture of the tibial plateau, pilon, ankle or calcaneus will be enrolled from METRC civilian trauma centers and military treatment facilities over an 18 month period. Participating centers treat large numbers of severe orthopaedic injuries and have a proven track record for successfully recruiting and retaining participants in prospective studies in orthopaedic trauma. Participants will be enrolled following definitive treatment of their injury.</description>

          2. Open or closed fractures of the tibial plateau, pilon, ankle or calcaneus requiring
             surgical fixation.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Gustilo type IIIB or IIIC injuries

          2. No other surgically or non-surgically treated injuries that impact gait (e.g. upper

          3. Neurologic impairment or deficit that impairs gait

          4. Prior injuries or conditions that alter gait (e.g. severe osteoarthritis)

          5. Severe problems with maintaining follow-up (e.g. participants who are prisoners, who
             are intellectually challenged without adequate family support, or have documented
             psychiatric disorders).

          6. Unable to provide informed consent in English or Spanish.

    <ipd_description>Data sharing beyond manuscripts and scientific presentations will be processed through the METRC website in the short term. Currently, a standard form will be available for researchers outside METRC to request access to final data generated from METRC studies. These requests will be transmitted to the METRC Coordinating Center for initial review to make sure the relevant materials are provided in support of the request. METRC is committed to making data as widely available as possible while safeguarding the privacy of study participants and protecting the intellectual property of the Consortium.
Data will only be made available after it is completely stripped of identifiable information such as dates, geographic locators, and any other event information which is sufficiently rare as to make it possible to deduce the identity of an individual participant. When necessary for complete de-identification, data may be grouped.</ipd_description>
