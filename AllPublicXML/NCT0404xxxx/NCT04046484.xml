  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was a prospective, multicentric, randomized, double blind, parallel, saline controlled
      Phase II clinical study to compare the safety and efficacy of PMZ-1620 (INN: Sovateltide)
      therapy along with standard supportive care in patients of acute ischemic stroke.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are hidden stem cells in the brain, which becomes active following injury to the brain.
      Intravenous administration of PMZ-1620 (sovateltide) augments the activity of neuronal
      progenitor cells in the brain to repair the damage by formation of new mature neurons and
      blood vessels. In addition, PMZ-1620 has anti-apoptotic activity and also increases cerebral
      blood flow when administered following ischemia.
