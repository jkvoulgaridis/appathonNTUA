  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I, open label, single-dose, dose-increasing study to assess the safety,
      tolerability and PK characteristics of healthy humans after injection of SSS11, provide a
      reference for subsequent clinical studies and give preliminary assessment of the
      immunogenicity and PD of SSS11.
