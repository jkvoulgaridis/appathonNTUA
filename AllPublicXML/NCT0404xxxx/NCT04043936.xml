  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is sufficient evidence that military service members markedly underutilize behavioral
      health care services, in part, due to stigma. This study proposes to examine a novel
      application of a cognitive bias modification (CBM) intervention designed to target
      stigma-related cognitions among service members at elevated suicide risk not currently
      engaged in behavioral health treatment.

      This study proposes to examine a novel application of a cognitive bias modification (CBM)
      intervention designed to target stigma-related cognitions among service members at elevated
      suicide risk not currently engaged in behavioral health treatment. Interventions that
      leverage CBM principles involve the completion of brief, web-based tasks in which
      participants are presented with a series of stimuli (e.g., words, sentences) and trained to
      respond to those stimuli in a manner that is positive or neutral, rather than negative and
      unhelpful. Consistent with the theoretical rationale for Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, CBM
      interventions function by reshaping negative cognitions. Repeated reinforcement of adaptive
      cognitions enhances functioning and reduces distress. CBM interventions have efficacy in
      reducing maladaptive cognitions across a range of psychiatric symptoms. However, limited data
      exist regarding the use of CBM to target help-seeking stigma cognitions.

    <intervention_model_description>Participants will be placed in one of three groups (Cognitive Bias Modification Intervention for Help-Seeking Stigma (CBM-HS) condition, the Cognitive Bias Modification (CBM-Placebo) condition, or the Self-Directed Psychoeducation condition [comparison condition]). Participants will then complete 5 additional virtual study visits (3 intervention weeks, 1 post-treatment, 1 two-month follow-up); these study visits will occur through a web-based platform. Self-report measures will be administered at enrollment/baseline, mid-intervention, post-intervention, and two-month follow-up.</intervention_model_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Perceived Stigma and Barriers to Care for Psychological Problems Scale (PS)</measure>
    <time_frame>2-Month Follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The 11-item PS measures the extent to which various concerns might affect an individual's decision to seek psychiatric treatment. Items are rated on a 5-point scale; higher scores (range: 11-55) indicate greater perceived barriers to care. The PS has been used extensively in military populations and has exhibited acceptable to good internal consistency.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Readiness to Change</measure>
    <time_frame>2-Month Follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Consistent with past research, we will use an adaptation of the Readiness to Change Scale to assess readiness to engage in help-seeking behaviors. Responses to each of the 6 items are anchored on an 11-point scale, with higher scores (range: 0-60) indicating greater readiness to engage in behavioral health care. Past research using this approach has yielded good internal consistency.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Self-Stigma of Seeking Help (SSOSH)</measure>
    <time_frame>2-Month Follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The SSOSH is a 10-item measure of help-seeking stigma. Responses are rated on a 5-point scale; higher scores (range: 0-50) reflect greater self-stigma associated with seeking help. The scale has demonstrated strong reliability and validity, and it differentiates between young adults who do and do not seek help for mental health problems.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>World Mental Health Composite International Diagnostic Interview (WMH-CIDI)</measure>
    <time_frame>2-Month Follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>A self-report version of the WMH-CIDI Services subscale will be utilized to assess the presence/absence of specific structural and attitudinal barriers to care. This WMH-CIDI has been used extensively among adult community samples, including among individuals at elevated suicide risk.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Client Satisfaction Questionnaireâ€”8 (CSQ-8)</measure>
    <time_frame>2-Month Follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The CSQ-8 is an 8-item self-report measure that assesses client satisfaction with services, including mental health care services (range: 8-32). The CSQ-8 has demonstrated strong psychometric properties, including among psychotherapy patients.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Intervention Acceptability and Feasibility Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>2-Month Follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Acceptability and feasibility will be measured using recruitment and retention rates and open-ended treatment satisfaction questions administered to participants at post-treatment (e.g., &quot;What aspects of the intervention could be improved?&quot;).</description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>CBM-HS is a 15-minute web-based intervention designed to alter maladaptive cognitions related to mental health help-seeking. In this task, individuals are presented with a series of statements regarding beliefs about using behavioral health services. Individuals then select &quot;True&quot; or &quot;False&quot; in response to each statement. Incorrect responses (i.e., demonstrating help-seeking stigma) are followed by corrective feedback. Conversely, correct responses (i.e., promoting help-seeking) are positively reinforced. Participants in this condition will complete three separate 15-minute CBM-HS sessions.</description>

    <description>Participants randomized to this condition will complete a CBM task with a neutral stimuli. The duration of the CBM-Placebo task will be comparable to the duration of the CBM-HS task (i.e., three 15-minute sessions).</description>

    <arm_group_label>Self-Directed Psychoeducation</arm_group_label>

    <description>Participants randomized to this condition will review psychoeducation on mental health literacy, mental illness stigma, and treatment options. Readings will be compiled from resources available in the public domain. The duration will be comparable to the duration of study tasks for individuals in the CBM-HS study condition (i.e., three 15-minute sessions).</description>
