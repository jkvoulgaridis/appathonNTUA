  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with cancer in developing countries face considerable challenges in obtaining access
      to care due to a lack of human resources and infrastructure. This is particularly pressing
      for vulnerable populations such as older adults. In this setting, many patients receiving
      chemotherapy are unable to report the presence of toxicities, and adverse events can go
      unnoticed for considerable amounts of time. The goal of this study is to assess the accuracy
      of an objective patient-centered measure of physical function (the number of steps taken per
      day measured using an accelerometer-equipped smartphone) for the remote detection of
      chemotherapy toxicity in older adults. This study builds on a pilot trial showing that
      monitoring older patients remotely utilizing an accelerometer-equipped smartphone is feasible
      and acceptable, and that a decline in the number of steps detected using the device can be an
      early sign of chemotherapy toxicity. The hypothesis of this study is that a decline in the
      number daily steps from a prechemotherapy baseline, measured using an accelerometer-equipped
      smartphone, will be accurate for detecting chemotherapy toxicity in older adults with cancer.
      This study will evaluate the ability of a patient-centered measure (a decline in the number
      of daily steps compared with a pre-chemotherapy baseline) to identify the presence of
      clinically-significant chemotherapy-related toxicity in Mexican older adults with cancer
      starting first line chemotherapy. Patients will be provided with an accelerometer-equipped
      smartphone with an installed pedometer application. Baseline steps per day will be obtained
      and recorded before starting chemotherapy. The patients' steps will be monitored daily for
      the first three chemotherapy cycles and compared with baseline recordings. Patients will be
      contacted daily and chemotherapy toxicity will be assessed by a physician. If significant
      toxicities are identified, the patient will be prompted to seek medical attention. The
      optimal cutoff point for detecting chemotherapy toxicity utilizing a decline in the number of
      daily steps will be chosen and validated. The adherence and satisfaction with the
      intervention will also be evaluated. This study could improve current methods and transform
      the way in which cancer care is delivered by demonstrating that a simple patient-centered
      measure obtained using a commercially available smartphone can aid in the accurate
      identification of clinically significant toxicities among a vulnerable population such as
      older adults with cancer.

    <description>Patients will be provided with a Global System for Mobile communications (GSM) accelerometer-equipped Android smartphone (specific model to be decided) with an installed open source, freely available pedometer application (Google Fit, Google, CA, United States) which will record their daily steps. Patients will receive daily calls from a research assistant to document the presence of clinically significant chemotherapy-related toxicity.</description>

    <description>Patients will be instructed to carry the smartphone around their hips during waking hours, regardless of whether they are at home or outside (a nylon hip holster will be provided) and to keep it turned on at all times.
Daily steps will be recorded for at least seven days before the start of chemotherapy, and the median baseline number of daily steps will be calculated for each patient.
On the first day of chemotherapy, patients will receive side effect education as per standard of care. Patients will be instructed to continue carrying the smartphone daily as indicated for the entire duration of the first three chemotherapy cycles.
At the end of the follow-up period (or sooner in cases of early interruption of chemotherapy due to toxicity or disease progression; a change in chemotherapy regimen; or hospitalizations lasting ≥3 days), patients will rate their satisfaction with the intervention using a Likert-scale questionnaire and open-ended questions.</description>
