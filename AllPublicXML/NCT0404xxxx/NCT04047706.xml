      This phase I trial studies the side effects of nivolumab, BMS-986205, and standard radiation
      therapy with or without temozolomide in treating patients with new diagnosed glioblastoma.
      Immunotherapy with nivolumab, may induce changes in body?s immune system and may interfere
      with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. BMS-986205 may stop the growth of tumor
      cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Radiation therapy uses high
      energy x-rays to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as
      temozolomide, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the
      cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving nivolumab
      and BMS-986205 may work better compared to radiation therapy and temozolomide alone in
      treating patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety and tolerability of nivolumab in combination with IDO1 inhibitor
      BMS-986205 (BMS986205) and radiation in newly diagnosed MGMT promoter unmethylated
      glioblastoma and MGMT promoter methylated glioblastoma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Descriptive survival analyses (overall survival [OS] and OS at 12 months [OS12]) in
      patients with MGMT unmethylated and MGMT methylated promoter.

      II. Progression free survival (PFS) and PFS at 6 months (PFS6) in patients with MGMT
      unmethylated and MGMT methylated promoter.

      III. Radiographic response rates (RR) as determined by Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology
      (RANO) and immunotherapy (i)RANO criteria in patients with MGMT unmethylated and MGMT
      methylated promoter.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the T-cell changes that occur in glioblastoma (GBM) treated with nivolumab in
      combination with BMS-986205 and radiation.

      II. Correlate T-cell changes and IDO1 expression with patient outcomes.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of IDO1 inhibitor BMS-986205. Patients are assigned
      to 1 of 2 cohorts.

      COHORT I:

      RADIATION THERAPY: Patients with MGMT methylated promoter undergo radiation therapy 5 days
      per week (Monday-Friday) for up to 6 weeks. Patients also receive temozolomide orally (PO)
      once daily (QD), IDO1 inhibitor BMS-986205 PO QD, and nivolumab intravenously (IV) over 30
      minutes every 2 weeks for up to 6 weeks in the absence of disease progression, unacceptable
      toxicity, withdrawal of consent, the study ends, or until Q4W dosing begins.

      MAINTENANCE THERAPY: Patients receive IDO1 inhibitor BMS-986205 PO QD on days 1-28 and
      nivolumab IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 15 of cycles 1-5 and on day 1 of subsequent
      cycles. Within 4 weeks of radiation therapy completion, patients also receive temozolomide PO
      QD on days 1-5 of cycles 2-6. Cycles repeats every 28 days for up to 2 years in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      COHORT II:

      RADIATION THERAPY: Patients with MGMT unmethylated promoter undergo radiation therapy 5 days
      per week (Monday-Friday) for up to 6 weeks. Patients also receive IDO1 inhibitor BMS-986205
      PO QD and nivolumab IV over 30 minutes every 2 weeks for up to 6 weeks in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      MAINTENANCE THERAPY: Patients receive IDO1 inhibitor BMS-986205 PO QD on days 1-28 and
      nivolumab IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 15 of cycles 1-5 and on day 1 of subsequent
      cycles. Cycles repeats every 28 days for up to 2 years in the absence of disease progression,
      unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, the study ends, or until Q4W dosing begins.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 3
      months thereafter.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have a newly diagnosed histologically confirmed diagnosis of any grade
             IV glioma with documentation of MGMT methylation status. The histological diagnosis
             can be obtained either from a brain biopsy or from a neurosurgical resection of the
             tumor

               -  Note: Study enrollment is to be within 5 weeks from diagnostic surgery or biopsy

               -  Note: Pyrosequencing to determine MGMT methylation status will be performed at
                  Northwestern Memorial Hospital as standard of care (SOC)

          -  Tumor tissue specimens from the GBM surgery or biopsy for central pathology review and

             resonance imaging (MRI) and immediate postoperative Gd-MRI performed within &lt; 72 hours

             contraception prior to study entry, for the duration of study participation, and for 5
             months following completion of therapy. Should a female patient become pregnant or
             suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her
             treating physician immediately. Due to the potential interaction with study drug(s),
             contraceptions that use hormones are not considered to be highly effective for FOCBP
             participants in this study.

               -  NOTE: A FOCBP is any woman (regardless of sexual orientation, having undergone a
                  tubal ligation, or remaining celibate by choice) who meets the following
                  criteria:

                    -  Has not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy. Has had menses
                       at any time in the preceding 12 consecutive months (and therefore has not
                       been naturally postmenopausal for &gt; 12 months)

          -  Males who are sexually active with FOCBP must agree to follow instructions for
             method(s) of contraception for the duration of treatment with study treatment plus 7
             months after the last dose of the study treatment (i.e., 90 days [duration of sperm
             turnover] plus the time required for nivolumab to undergo approximately 5 half-lives).
             In addition, male participants must be willing to refrain from sperm donation during
             this time. Male participants with partners who are FOCBP are required to use a condom
             for study duration and until end of relevant systemic exposure defined as 7 months
             after the end of study treatment. This criteria applies to azoospermic males as well

          -  FOCBP must have a negative serum pregnancy test within 14 days of registration on
             study and within 24 hours of beginning study treatment

          -  Clinically normal cardiac function without history of ischemic heart disease in the
             past 6 months and normal 12 lead electrocardiogram (ECG)

             other complications before study registration

          -  Patients must have the ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written
             informed consent prior to registration on study
