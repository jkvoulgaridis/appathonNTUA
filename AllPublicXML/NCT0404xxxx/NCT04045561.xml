  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis is that the implementation of an initial Pharmaceutical Consultation (PC)
      program based on the provision of standardized information to patients treated for multiple
      myeloma as a first course of chemotherapy, could optimize their compliance with the delivered
      per os treatment.

      The aim of this study is therefore to develop a standardised reference guide of information
      to be provided during prostate cancer in order to optimise the compliance of patients treated
      for multiple myeloma as a first course of chemotherapy per os.
