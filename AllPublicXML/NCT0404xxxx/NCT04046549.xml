    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of dual
      costimulation blockade with VIB4920 in combination of belatacept in adult male or female
      recipients of a renal allograft from a deceased, living unrelated or human leukocyte antigen
      (HLA) non-identical living related donor.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Recipients of a first renal transplant from standard criteria deceased, living
             unrelated or HLA non-identical living related donor.

          -  Recipients who are at low immunologic risk:

               1. No donor specific antibodies (DSA), and

               2. Negative cross-match testing.

          -  Recipients with up to date vaccination as per local immunization schedules.

          -  Male and female participants who agree to follow protocol defined contraceptive
             methods.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants receiving an allograft from an ABO-incompatible donor.

          -  Participants treated with systemic immunosuppressive drug therapy for more than a
             total of 2 weeks within 24 weeks prior to informed consent form signature.

          -  Participants who have undergone lymphodepleting therapy.

             warfarin, others).

          -  Participants requiring long-term systemic anticoagulation after transplantation, which
             would interfere with obtaining biopsies.

          -  Participants with any contraindication to kidney biopsy.

          -  Cytomegalovirus (CMV)-seronegative recipients of a CMV-seropositive donor kidney, or

          -  Receipt of live (attenuated) vaccine within the 4 weeks before screening.

             disease.

          -  Prior solid organ transplant or potential to require a concurrent organ or cell
             transplant.

          -  Positive test for human immunodeficiency viruses antibody.

          -  History of or active tuberculosis (TB), or a positive QuantiFERONÂ®-TB Gold test at
             screening, unless previously treated for latent tuberculosis.

          -  History of cancer, except as follows:

               1. In situ carcinoma of the cervix treated with apparent success with curative
