  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1, interventional, open label, treatment study designed to evaluate the
      safety and feasibility of infusion of CAR-20/19-T in pediatric and young adult subjects with
      B cell ALL that have relapsed after prior therapies or refractory disease and are not
      candidates for curative intent standard therapy. There will be two phases of this study. A
      dose escalation phase to determine the safe CAR-20/19-T cell dose in patients B-cell ALL.
      Once the desired dose has been identified there will be a 6-patient dose expansion phase at
      the specified dose level.

    <time_frame>40 months</time_frame>
    <description>Safety will be determined by assessments of CRS using the Lee et al. grading scale [1] and adverse events via NCI CTCAE version 5.0. Response assessment occur initially at Day +28 post-treatment (+/- 3 days) with CAR-20/19-T cells. Ongoing response assessment will continue until progression and/or death up to 2 years (see Table 1), after which patients will be transitioned to a long-term follow-up protocol.</description>

    <measure>Determine the feasibility to manufacture CAR-20/19-T cells locally from pediatric and young adult apheresis products using the CliniMACS Prodigy Cell processing device.</measure>
    <time_frame>40 months</time_frame>
    <description>Feasibility of CAR-20/19-T cell production by the CliniMACS Prodigy processing device (Miltenyi Biotec) will be measured. At minimum, we expect to reach our target CAR-20/19-T cell dose in at least 75% of subjects with an adequate T cell starting dose. Feasibility will be measured at the end of the study after completion of accrual. If &gt;25% of subjects with an adequate T cell starting dose were unable to achieve goal CAR-20/19-T cell dose, we would deem that this technique is not a feasible method for production.</description>
