      This is a mono-center, randomized, double-masked, cross-over study to evaluate rate of myopia
      progression with novel designed myopia control lens (test) compared to SVL (control). A total
      of 120 children will be recruited where 60 participants each will be randomized either to
      wear test (Group 1) or SVL lenses (Group 2) for 6 months each. At the end of the 6 months
      period, there will be a cross- over of lenses and the lenses evaluated for a further 6
      months.

    <textblock>
      Myopia has been considered as a 'global epidemic' owing to its rapid rise in prevalence
      across the world. Myopia significantly affects the quality of life of an individual socially
      by restriction of employment in various fields and economically by additional cost for eye
      care and spectacles and contact lenses (Lim, Gazzard et al. 2009). In addition, high myopia
      increases the risk of ocular morbidity such as retinal detachment, cataract, glaucoma which
      can could lead to blindness. Several optical and pharmaceutical strategies were developed
      over the recent years that could control or slow the progression of myopia.

      It has been shown that persistent myopic defocus constantly applied on the whole retina has a
      beneficial effect on myopia progression, i.e. decrease in myopia progression (Anstice and
      Phillips 2011, Cheng, Woo et al. 2011, Ehsaei, Chisholm et al. 2011). In addition, a
      meta-analysis on the efficacy of non-invasive optical treatment strategies for myopia control
      reported prismatic bifocals to have the best outcome (Cheng, Woo et al. 2011). Therefore,
      test lenses were designed to increase the area and amount of myopic defocus on the retina
      without compromising vision.

      Thus, this study aims to evaluate the efficacy of test lenses to reduce the progression of
      myopia by either reducing the myopia progression rate per year and/or reducing the elongation
      of eyeball through myopic defocus compared with SVL. A total of 120 healthy children aged 8
      to 13 years will be recruited to participate in a double-masked cross-over clinical trial.
      Cycloplegic autorefraction will be the primary measure for myopia progression and axial
      length will the secondary outcome measure. Visual acuity will also be compared between test
      lens and control lens to determine the quality of vision using test lens.

    <intervention_model_description>This is a mono-center, randomized, double-masked, cross-over study to evaluate if novel design lens can slow down the progression of myopia. A total of 120 healthy children aged between 8 years to 13 years with myopia (-0.75D to -4.75D) meeting the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be recruited. These children will be randomized to wear test lenses followed by control lenses (Group 1) or to wear control lenses followed by test lenses (Group 2). The duration of lens wear with each lens type will be 6 months. All children will be followed at 3-monthly intervals for 1 year to monitor for changes in axial length and 6-monthly for changes in cycloplegic autorefraction. The cross-over design allows to compare treatment effects between the two groups at 6 months and at 12 months. In addition, at the end of the study, the treatment effects can be compared within subject as each subject will have worn both test lenses and control lenses and serves as his/her control.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>Participants and their parents / guardians and investigators will be masked to their lens assignment. Test spectacles will be of similar appearance to control spectacles and will not be easily identified without specialized equipment. Test and control spectacles will be assigned a code (A or B) by the clinical coordinator and stored in a secure location.</masking_description>
