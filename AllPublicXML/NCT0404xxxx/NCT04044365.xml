  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      Some children/adolescents who have had a stem cell transplant live with chronic
      graft-versus-host-disease (cGVHD). cGVHD is a side effect of the transplant that can cause
      multiple bothersome symptoms and negatively affect a child/adolescent squality of daily life.
      The questionnaires that measure thesymptoms caused by cGVHD are designed for adults.
      Children/adolescents may not describe their symptoms in the same way. The goal of this
      research is to improve the way we measure how bothersome these symptoms are for
      children/adolescents living with cGVHD.

      Objective:

      To develop a questionnaire (The Pediatric cGHVD Symptom Scale) for children/adolescents
      living with cGVHD to identify the symptoms they are experiencing and describe how bothersome
      those symptoms are to them. An additional goal is to design a parent/guardian companion
      questionnaire that can be used to capture the symptom experiences of very young children who
      may not be able to complete a questionnaire.

      Eligibility:

      Children/adolescents ages 5-17 who are receiving treatment for cGVHD after a stem cell
      transplant, and their parent/guardian..

      Design:

      This study consists of 2 projects.

      Children/adolescents with cGVHD and their parent/guardianparticipants will be grouped by the
      child/adolescent s age: 5-7, 8-12, and 13-17.

      In project 1, participants will complete an age-appropriate questionnaire about cGVHD
      symptoms. The questionnaire will ask about the child/adolescent s physical functioning and
      emotional well-being. The parent/guardian will out fill out a companion questionnaire online.
      The child/adolescent will then review their completed questionnaire during an interview with
      a researcher and will be asked whether the questions about their symptoms were difficult to
      understand. The parent/guardian and child/adolescent will then be interviewed together to
      further explore their responses to the questionnaires. Interviews will be done in person, by
      phone, and online. . Based on what is learned through these interviews, the wording of the
      questionnaire will be improved for better comprehension and ease of response.

      In project 2, participants will complete this revised questionnairefor their age group along
      with some other questionnaires that ask about quality of life. Both the child/adolescent and
      parent/guardian will fill out the questionnaires online at three separate time points.

      In both projects, children/adolescents with cGVHD and their parent/guardian participants will
      be grouped by the child/adolescent s age: 5-7, 8-12, and 13-17.

      Background:

        -  Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is a curative option for many children
           with cancer and certain genetic disorders. However, recipients of stem cell transplant
           must deal with years of disfigurement and symptoms arising from an undesirable side
           effect of transplant, specifically chronic graft-versus-host-disease (cGVHD).

        -  Children living with cGVHD often face many years of a disabling and painful chronic
           illness compounded by the side effects of prolonged immunosuppression, particularly
           long-term steroid use.

        -  Chronic GVHD can involve almost every organ although it most commonly affects the skin,
           eyes, mouth, liver, intestines, lung and the musculoskeletal system.

        -  There has been a large effort through the NIH cGVHD Consensus Consortium to standardize
           definitions, grading and response criteria for patients with cGVHD on clinical trials.
           Because of the absence of evidence suggesting which response criteria truly correlates
           with improvement, the NIH Consensus Panel has recommended following not only physical
           signs of chronic GVHD, but also symptoms of GVHD.

        -  The Lee cGVHD Symptom Score has been recognized as a core cGVHD outcome measure in the
           adult population, however, the instrument has not been validated for use in
           children/adolescents younger than 18, and many of the symptom terms used in the Lee
           cGVHD Symptom Scale may not be well understood by younger children.

        -  There is currently no available pediatric patient-reported outcome (PRO) measure of
           cGVHD symptom bother.

      Primary Objective:

      -To develop a psychometrically valid Pediatric cGVHD Symptom Scale (PCSS) and a companion
      parent-proxy measure as counterparts to the Lee cGVHD Symptom Scale.

      Eligibility:

        -  Children of 5 to 17 years of age, who have undergone prior allogeneic stem cell
           transplant

        -  Clinical diagnosis of cGVHD

        -  Currently receiving systemic treatment for cGVHD (including phototherapies), or has
           tapered systemic therapy for cGVHD to discontinuation within the past 12 months

        -  No evidence of malignant disease relapse including molecular relapse and minimal
           residual disease. Patients with mixed chimerism are eligible to participate

        -  Comprehend and speak English

      Design:

        -  This multicenter non-interventional psychosocial trial will address the study aims in
           two projects: 1) a qualitative project using cognitive interviewing to confirm the
           comprehension and ease of response to the PCSS, and 2) a quantitative project to
           evaluate test-retest reliability, construct validity and responsiveness of the PCSS, as
           well as to explore concordance of symptom ratings by patients and parent proxies.

        -  In Project 1, we will conduct at least 20 cognitive interviews of patient and proxy
           dyads (parent/guardian) within each age group (5-7; 8-12; 13-17) for a sample of 60
           pediatric transplant survivors with cGVHD to refine the symptom items and response
           choices to ensure that they resonate across the developmental spectrum. Cognitive
           interviews will evaluate the clarity and comprehension of the PCSS items, the ease and
           accuracy of judgement of the response choices, and any errors in understanding the
           response choices, and will refine the PCSS in accordance with study data, before
           proceeding to Project 2.

        -  In Project 2, we will evaluate test-retest reliability, construct validity, and
           responsiveness of the PCSS, in association with the NIH Global cGVHD Symptom Severity
           Score, the Peds QL, clinician ratings of organ specific cGVHD severity scores and cGVHD
           severity using the NIH criteria, in a sample of 120 pediatric transplant survivors with
           cGVHD reflecting three age groups (5-7 years; 8-12 years; 13-17 years) of equal numbers.
           In subjects ages 13-17, we will also compare responses on the PCSS with those from the
           Lee Scale, to determine the youngest age at which adolescent respondents can comprehend
           the Lee Scale.

        -  This study will include CCR investigators as well as extramural investigators at
           national study sites.
