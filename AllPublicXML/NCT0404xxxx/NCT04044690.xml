  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 3, multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study of IgPro20
      (subcutaneous Ig) treatment in adult subjects with dermatomyositis (DM). The primary
      objective of this study is to assess the efficacy of IgPro20 subcutaneous (SC) doses in
      comparison to placebo in adult subjects with DM, as measured by responder status based on
      Total Improvement Score (TIS) assessments.

    <description>A responder is defined as a subject with a total improvement score (TIS) ≥ 20 points at Week 25 and at least 1 of the previous scheduled visits (Week 17 or Week 21), who completes 24 weeks of randomized investigational medicinal product (IMP) treatment without the use of rescue corticosteroid treatment. The TIS is a sum response criterion which incorporates 6 weighted IMACS core set measures (CSMs). Thresholds for minimal, moderate, and major improvement were ≥ 20, ≥ 40, and ≥ 60 points on the TIS.</description>

    <description>The TIS is a sum response criterion which incorporates 6 weighted IMACS core set measures (CSMs). A total improvement score (range 0 to 100), determined by summing scores for each CSM, was based on improvement in and relative weight of each CSM.

    <ipd_description>CSL will consider requests to share Individual Patient Data (IPD) from systematic review groups or bona-fide researchers. For information on the process and requirements for submitting a voluntary data sharing request for IPD, please contact CSL at clinicaltrials@cslbehring.com.
Applicable country specific privacy and other laws and regulations will be considered and may prevent sharing of IPD.
If the request is approved and the researcher has executed an appropriate data sharing agreement, IPD that has been appropriately anonymized will be available.</ipd_description>
    <ipd_info_type>Study Protocol</ipd_info_type>
    <ipd_info_type>Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP)</ipd_info_type>
    <ipd_time_frame>IPD requests may be submitted to CSL no earlier than 12 months after publication of the results of this study via an article made available on a public website.</ipd_time_frame>
    <ipd_access_criteria>Requests may only be made by systematic review groups or bona-fide researchers whose proposed use of the IPD is non-commercial in nature and has been approved by an internal review committee.
An IPD request will not be considered by CSL unless the proposed research question seeks to answer a significant and unknown medical science or patient care question as determined by CSL's internal review committee.
The requesting party must execute an appropriate data sharing agreement before IPD will be made available.</ipd_access_criteria>
