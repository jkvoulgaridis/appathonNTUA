  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Treatment persistence duration (days) with index medication at 12-months will be compared for those with low (≤ median) vs. high (&gt;median)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Non-persistence will be identified based on a gap in treatment with the index medication or switching to another biologic in the 12 months post treatment initation. Persistence with the index medication will be defined as not having a gap in therapy of at least 60 days between fills/infusions.</description>
