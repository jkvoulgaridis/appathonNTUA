  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bladder cancer is a common disease with high rates of mortality, especially at advanced
      stages. Neo-adjuvant cisplatin-based chemotherapy (NAC) followed by radical cystectomy is
      considered standard of care for patients with muscle invasive disease, as NAC improves
      surgical outcomes in these patients. However, some patients are ineligible for
      cisplatin-based chemotherapy due to other medical issues. Although a combination of
      carboplatin and gemcitabine has been used with limited success, most patients proceed
      directly to cystectomy without realizing the potential survival benefit afforded by NAC.
      Intravenous ascorbate (vitamin C) administration (IVC) has been shown to improve both
      carboplatin and gemcitabine-based therapy in other models. This trial will add IVC to
      gemcitabine/carboplatin chemotherapy to evaluate whether co-treatment will increase
      therapeutic efficacy.

FACT-Bl total score range is 0-156, derived by the sum of the sub-scales. Higher scores indicate better QOL.
FACT-Bl includes five sub-scales:
Physical Well-being (PWB), score range of 0-28
Social/Family Well-being (SWB), score range of 0-28
Emotional Well-being (EWB), score range of 0-24
Functional Well-being (FWB), score range of 0-28
Bladder Cancer Subscale (BlCS), score range of 0-48
