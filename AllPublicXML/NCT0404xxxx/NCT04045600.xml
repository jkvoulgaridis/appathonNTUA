  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although treatments for problem behavior, like functional communication training (FCT), can
      be highly effective in the clinic, changes in the way the FCT is implemented (e.g., when
      transferring treatment to the home, when teachers implement treatment with poor fidelity) can
      result in treatment relapse. The goal of this study is to evaluate whether using treatment
      signals and gradually introducing materials from natural contexts can help mitigate treatment
      relapse during context changes and poor treatment-integrity scenarios.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The most common treatment for problem behavior is functional communication training (FCT).
      FCT involves teaching children to request what they want, rather than engaging in problem
      behavior when they don't get their way, and then teach them that they cannot always ask for
      their way and instead must wait or work appropriately first. While FCT is effective, problem
      behavior sometimes comes back after treatment when children encounter treatment challenges,
      like long periods of not getting their way, when caregivers deliver treatment differently
      than what they are used to (e.g., caregivers delivering FCT incorrectly), or experiencing
      treatment in a new place (e.g., the home, the classroom). The purpose of this research study
      is to determine whether the experimenters can reduce the chances of children returning to
      problem behavior during these challenges by teaching them to pay attention to treatment
      signals (e.g., a red card that indicates treatment is in place) and gradually changing the
      treatment setting to appear more like the home or classroom. First, the experimenters will
      provide each child with their way in a home-like environment containing a couch, rug, etc.
      Next, within a barren therapy room, the experimenters will conduct two of the following three
      types of treatments: (1) a treatment with no signals that indicate when their child can and
      cannot have their way, (2) a treatment with signals, and (3) a treatment with signals plus
      introduction of items from the natural environment such as rugs and couches. Then, the
      experimenters will introduce three common treatment challenges in a row to determine whether
      treatment signals reduce relapse of problem behavior. First, the experimenters will introduce
      the treatments in the home-like environment to see if the child continues to respond
      appropriately in a setting different than the therapy room. Second, the experimenters will
      simulate a transition to the school by having the child experience treatment in a
      classroom-like environment (e.g., with desks and chalkboards) while the teacher makes the
      child wait a long period of time to get their way. This would be similar to when a teacher
      cannot give the child attention or a preferred item because they are busy with other
      students. Third, the experimenters will simulate the teacher implementing treatment
      differently than the child is used to in the classroom by the teacher delivering preferred
      activities according to a timed schedule rather than when the child asks. This simulates the
      common event of a teacher delivering preferred activities like breaks or recess regardless of
      the child's behavior. The goal is to determine how well the treatments perform across each of
      these common challenges.

    <description>The investigators will measure the rate of destructive behavior when FCT is implemented in a context not associated with treatment (e.g., a classroom context) by an implementer who fails to reinforce the communication response. This would be similar to a busy teacher in a classroom who is unable to attend to the child due to assisting another student.</description>

    <measure>Rate of Destructive Behavior in Reinstatement Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 3 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will measure the rate of destructive behavior when FCT is not implemented as prescribed (i.e., reinforcement is delivered on a time-based schedule, rather than following communication responses). This would be similar to a teacher who delivers breaks from work based on the school schedule (e.g., switching from math to reading) rather than the child's request for a break during the math period).</description>

    <description>Traditional FCT (trad FCT) thins reinforcement by incorporating unsignaled delays to reinforcement. In this study, trad FCT will be a variable-interval 15-s reinforcement schedule in which communication responses are reinforced every 15 s, on average.</description>

    <description>FCT with multiple schedules (mult FCT) thins reinforcement by incorporating treatment signals (e.g., black and white cards signaling reinforcement and extinction, respectively). In this study, mult FCT will involve 30-s reinforcement components and 15-s extinction components for the communication response (i.e., the extinction component is equivalent to the delay period during trad FCT).</description>
