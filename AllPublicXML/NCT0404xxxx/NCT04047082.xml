  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Following the high feasibility of analyses by core laboratory with videodensitometry
      determined in the ASSESS-REGURGE Registry, this is an early clinical feasibility study of
      online videodensitometric assessment of aortograms to quantitate aortic regurgitation (AR) in
      the cath lab, specifically in the setting of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR)

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      OVAL (Online Videodensitometric Assessment of Aortic Regurgitation in the Cath-Lab) is a
      single centre, prospective, proof-of-principle, feasibility study performed in the Academic
      Medical Centre (Amsterdam). One hundred consecutive patients with aortic stenosis and
      indication to undergo TAVR by the Institution's Heart team are being enrolled in OVAL. All
      final aortograms will be performed according to predetermined acquisition protocol and
      analysed immediately after the acquisition in the cath-lab. All aortograms will also be
      analysed off-line by an independent core laboratory in the Netherlands (Cardialysis,
      Rotterdam, The Netherlands).

      The primary endpoint of the study is the feasibility of the on-line assessment of
      regurgitation (percentage of analysable cases). The secondary endpoint is the reproducibility
      of results between the on-line assessment and the off-line analysis by the independent core
      laboratory.

    <description>Feasibility of analysis (percentage of cases considered analyzable by videodensitometry - online). The investigators will assess the percentage of cases that are considered by the investigators as analyzable (i.e., that the investigators are able to perform an on-line analysis of videodensitometry).</description>

    <time_frame>immediately</time_frame>
    <description>Since ASSESS-REGURGE has the highest feasibility of analysis with quantitative aortogram, the investigators aim to compare the present feasibility (of OVAL) with the new standard from ASSESS-REGURGE. In other words, the percentage of analyzable cases in the present study will be compared with the percentage of analyzable cases found in ASSESS-REGURGE (95.5% of analyzability).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Comparison of online feasibility with core lab feasibility</measure>
    <time_frame>immediately</time_frame>
    <description>The feasibility of analysis (i.e., if a cases is considered to be analyzable by videodensitometry) will be assessed on-line by the investigators and also assessed by an academic core laboratory. The result of the feasibility of analysis (percentage of analyzable cases) will be compared between the investigators assessment (on-line) and also by the core laboratory.</description>
