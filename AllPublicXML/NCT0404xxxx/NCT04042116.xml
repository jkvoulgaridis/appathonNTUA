  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, Phase 1b/2 study to determine the recommended dose of lucitanib in
      combination with nivolumab in patients with an advanced solid tumor (Phase 1b); followed by
      evaluation of the safety and efficacy of lucitanib and nivolumab in patients with an advanced
      gynecological solid tumor (Phase 2).
