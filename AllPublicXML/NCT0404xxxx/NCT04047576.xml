    <textblock>
      Retroperitoneal fibrosis refers to a group of diseases characterized by hyperplasia of the
      fibrosclerotic tissues in the retroperitoneal space, which can compress the surrounding
      ureters and inferior vena cava and cause serious complications such as aortic aneurysm, renal
      failure, and even death. The lesion is diffuse and difficult to resect. corticosteroid is the
      first-line medication, but the recurrence rate of the disease is high, especially after dose
      reduction of corticosteroid. Therefore, the combined use of immunosuppressants is very
      important in preventing disease recurrence and reducing the toxic and side effects of
      long-term corticosteroid. Sirolimus plays dual roles in inhibiting lymphocyte activation and
      fibroblast proliferation. It is inferred from its mechanism that sirolimus is a good
      potential treatment option for idiopathic retroperitoneal fibrosis. Therefore, we conducted
      this RCT on patients with idiopathic retroperitoneal fibrosis to determine the efficacy and
      safety of sirolimus.

      Retroperitoneal fibrosis refers to a group of diseases characterized by hyperplasia of the
      fibrosclerotic tissues in the retroperitoneal space, which mostly involve the abdominal aorta
      and iliac artery distal to the kidneys. The hyperplastic tissues can compress the surrounding
      ureters and inferior vena cava and cause serious complications such as aortic aneurysm, renal
      failure, and even death. There is no clear boundary between the lesion and its surrounding
      tissues. The lesion is diffuse and difficult to resect. corticosteroid is the first-line
      medication, but the recurrence rate of the disease is high, especially after dose reduction
      of corticosteroid. Therefore, the combined use of immunosuppressants is very important in
      preventing disease recurrence and reducing the toxic and side effects of long-term high- and
      medium-dose corticosteroid. In recent years, as the immunological characteristics of
      retroperitoneal fibrosis have gradually been recognized, some rheumatologists and
      immunologists have attempted to use immunosuppressants commonly used for autoimmune diseases
      in this population, including biologics. However, high-level evidences of evidence-based
      medicine such as randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were still lacking. Sirolimus plays dual
      roles in inhibiting T lymphocyte activation and fibroblast proliferation. It is inferred from
      its mechanism that sirolimus is a good potential treatment option for idiopathic
      retroperitoneal fibrosis. Therefore, we conducted this RCT on patients with idiopathic
      retroperitoneal fibrosis to determine the efficacy and safety of sirolimus.
