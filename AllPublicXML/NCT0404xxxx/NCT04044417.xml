  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Among the root conditioning materials is the Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). EDTA
      exposes the collagen fibers on dentin surfaces and also enhances early cell colonization.
      Statins have an anti-inflammatory effect, inhibit the bone resorption and stimulate the bone
      formation. Curcumin is effective in preventing periodontal disease destruction by targeting
      both bacteria and host inflammatory cells. Curcumin has anti- inflammatory, antioxidant,
      anticarcinogenic, antiviral, and antimicrobial functions. This study will be carried out to
      examine the effect of simvastatin-curcumin paste following EDTA root surface etching when
      used in conjunction with open flap debridement treating deep periodontal pockets (suggesting
      that it may have positive effect)

      The present study entailed thirty patients having stage II or stage III, Grade A
      periodontitis with 30 intrabony defects. Patients were divided into three groups; group I was
      subjected to open flap debridement only. Group II was subjected to open flap debridement
      followed by application of curcumin-simvastatin paste (2% curcumin and 1.2% simvastatin).
      Group III was subjected to open flap debridement followed by 24% EDTA root surface etching
      and application of curcumin-simvastatin paste (2% curcumin and 1.2% simvastatin).Clinical
      parameters including plaque index, sulcus bleeding index, probing depth and clinical
      attachment level were recorded pre-surgical. Moreover, radiographic examination was performed
      by cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) just before the surgery . Vertical bone defects were
      exposed by full thickness mucoperiosteal flap following intrasulcular incision and thorough
      debridement was performed. Group II received local application of curcumin-simvastatin paste
      .Group III received curcumin-simvastatin paste after debridement and 24 % EDTA. The same
      initial clinical parameters were recorded three and six months postoperatively. Radiographic
      measurements were recorded six months post surgically.
