    <textblock>
      In phenotypic animal models of Parkinson's Disease (PD), chronic physical exercise has
      produced nigrostriatal neuroprotection and symptom improvement, provided training was of
      high-intensity and prolonged duration (&gt;3 months in rodent models). Conventional physical
      therapy in Parkinson's disease (PD) has traditionally avoided fatigue and high intensity
      workouts. Yet, in PD controlled studies have shown that: (i) an acute aerobic stress produces
      endogenous dopamine immediately after the exercise and (ii) short term (a few weeks) high
      intensity aerobic training enhances D2 striatal receptor density and cortical excitability
      and clinically improves walking, upper limb and executive functions; (iii) long-term (six
      months) high intensity aerobic treadmill training is associated with less deterioration of
      subjective UPDRS III score compared to a waiting list. Long-term high intensity aerobic
      training has not been compared to low or medium intensity training in PD patients for its
      objective motor, cognitive and putative neuroprotective effects.

      A short description, 5000 characters Intro: In phenotypic animal models of Parkinson's
      Disease (PD), chronic physical exercise has produced nigrostriatal neuroprotection and
      symptom improvement, provided training was of high-intensity and prolonged duration (&gt;3
      months in rodent models). Conventional physical therapy in Parkinson's disease (PD) has
      traditionally avoided fatigue and high intensity workouts. Yet, in PD controlled studies have
      shown that: (i) an acute aerobic stress produces endogenous dopamine immediately after the
      exercise and (ii) short term (a few weeks) high intensity aerobic training enhances D2
      striatal receptor density and cortical excitability and clinically improves walking, upper
      limb and executive functions; (iii) long-term (six months) high intensity aerobic treadmill
      training is associated with less deterioration of subjective UPDRS III score compared to a
      waiting list. Long-term high intensity aerobic training has not been compared to low or
      medium intensity training in PD patients for its objective motor, cognitive and putative
      neuroprotective effects.

      Hypothesis/Objective

      Hypothesis High-intensity aerobic exercises practiced over 9 months will produce greater
      symptomatic motor and cognitive benefits and neuroprotective effects in PD patients, than low
      or medium intensity training.

      Primary Objective To compare the motor effects of a 9-month conventional physical therapy
      program (light aerobic exercises), an aerobic program of medium intensity on stationary
      bicycle (50% maximal oxygen uptake, VO2 max), and an aerobic program of high intensity (70%
      VO2 max) in Parkinson's disease.

      Secondary Objectives

        -  To evaluate aerobic capacities before and after the program.

        -  To evaluate cognitive functions, depression, quality of life before and after each
           program as well as 3 months following program termination and motor function 3 months
           following program termination.

        -  To explore potential neuroprotective effects of a 9-month aerobic program through
           specialized brain imaging (123I-Ioflupane SPECT) and a potential aerobic
           intensity-effect of such neuroprotection.
