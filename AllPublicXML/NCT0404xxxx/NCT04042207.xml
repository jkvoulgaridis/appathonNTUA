  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Feasibility study, comparing experimental treatment (DBLHU closed-loop system) with reference
      treatment (Low Glucose Predictive Suspend system) in 7 patients going through a series of
      N-of-1 trials. Each N-of-1 trial consists in a prospectively planned, multiple crossover
      study in a single individual. Two blocks of two periods of four weeks each (closed loop or
      open loop) will be conducted. Within each block, the sequence closed loop-open loop or open
      loop-close loop is randomized. Outcomes will be analyzed on the third and fourth weeks of
      period.

      A remote monitoring system managed by specialized nurse on behalf of diabetologist, is
      provided in closed-loop session.

      An extension period of 6 months with the DBLHU System (closed-loop condition) will be
      performed at the end of the crossover study phase in real life conditions (without remote
      monitoring).

    <description>DBLHU system embeds a regulation algorithm to automatically regulate the patient's glycaemia. It takes as input glycaemia value received every 5 minutes from the CGM and patient inputs related to meals and physical activities and it calculates the amount of insulin to be delivered. It sends this information to the pump that automatically delivers this quantity.</description>
