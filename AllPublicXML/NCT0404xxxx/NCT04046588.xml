  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although some important progresses were made in the field of the meridian research, no
      breakthroughs have been achieved. Besides,there are some problems in meridian researches.
      Particularly, previous research of meridian phenomenon involved lots of subjective elements
      and outcomes.Researches that use modern scientific techniques to investigate the biological
      characteristics of meridian phenomenon are urgently needed. Therefore, this study is designed
      to assess the heat transport characteristics of meridian phenomenon for the Heart and Lung
      meridians by using infrared thermography. Thus, the biological characteristics of meridian
      phenomenon could be presented objectively in a scientific methodology.

      This study will include 40 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and 80
      healthy adults. Infrared thermal imaging(ITI) examination will be adopted to assess the heat
      transport characteristics of the Heart and Lung meridians and investigate the specificity for
      the meridian-visceral correlation and site-to-site correlation between two specific
      meridians.
