    <textblock>
      Doose syndrome is a rare epileptic syndrome that can lead to learning difficulties and a poor
      quality of life. The goal of this study is to evaluate the evolution of epilepsy and its
      consequences on cognitive development and learning issues in children with Doose syndrome.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Doose syndrome is a rare epileptic syndrome beginning between ages two and five,
      characterized by myoclonic-astatic seizures which can be associated with myoclonic seizures,
      astatic seizures, absences and generalized tonic-clonic seizures. These seizures can be
      difficult to treat effectively and may lead to learning difficulties. During this study,
      parents of children with Doose syndrome will receive a questionnaire regarding learning
      disabilities, quality of life and epilepsy of their children.

        During this study, parents of children with Doose syndrome will receive a questionnaire
        regarding learning disabilities, quality of life and epilepsy of their children. Children
        with doose syndrome diagnosed between ages 1 and 6 and with normal development until onset
        of seizures will be included in this study.
