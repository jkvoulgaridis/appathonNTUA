      To compare maternal and newborn outcomes among pregnant women with OUD receiving care via
      telemedicine versus in-person.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants: Pregnant women with OUD.

      Intervention: Participants were seen weekly for four weeks, every two weeks for four weeks
      and monthly thereafter and provided relapse-prevention therapy and buprenorphine.

      Design: A cohort derived from a prospectively collected database including 98 women receiving
      perinatal OUD treatment in an obstetric practice by telemedicine or in-person and followed
      until 6-8 weeks postpartum from September, 2017 to December, 2018. Logistic regression with
      propensity score adjustment was applied to reduce group selection bias and control for
      potentially confounding variables.

      Setting: Four outpatient obstetric practices in the southeast.
