      The purpose of this study is to determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of the
      combination of lonsurf, gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel in Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma
      (PDAC)

    <textblock>
      This is a single-institution, prospective, phase I dose escalation trial of lonsurf combined
      with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel using the 3+3 design. This study will enroll 18 patients
      over 12-15 months.

      Primary Objective To determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of the combination of
      lonsurf, gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel

      Secondary Objectives

        1. Examine safety and toxicity of the combination

        2. Estimate response rate to the combination

        3. Estimate median overall survival (mOS) of the treated population

        4. Estimate median progression free survival (mPFS) of the treated population

        5. Estimate disease control rate (DCR) at 8 weeks

        6. Evaluate quality of life while receiving the combination therapy

    <intervention_model_description>Initially 3 patients will be enrolled to the starting cohort. If 1 of 3 patients experience a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) in the first cycle, then an additional 3 evaluable patients will be accrued to that dose level. Dose reductions are not permitted during cycle 1. If 2 or more patients in a cohort experience a DLT, then the previous dose will be considered the recommended phase 2 dose (PR2D) and dose escalation will terminate. Dose escalation will proceed according to the scheme above only after all patients (3 or 6 evaluable patients, depending on the incidence of DLT) have been followed for at least 1 full cycle.
Once dose escalation has been completed, if only 2 dose levels were used to determine the RP2D and depending on how many patients were replaced, additional patients will be enrolled at the RP2D in order to obtain data for 18 patients total.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Scale scores were calculated by averaging items within scales and transforming average scores linearly. All of the scales range in score from 0 to 100. A high score for a functional scale represents a high/healthy level of functioning whereas a high score for a symptom scale or item represents a high level of symptomatology or problems.</description>
