  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We aim to conduct a nonrandomized open pilot trial comparing 2 mind body physical activity
      programs for older adults with self-reported memory problems and chronic pain: Active Brains
      and Active Brains with Fitbit. We will explore feasibility, acceptability and within group
      changes in physical, emotional and cognitive functioning.

      We aim to conduct a nonrandomized open pilot trial comparing 2 mind body physical activity
      programs for older adults with self-reported memory problems and chronic pain: Active Brains
      and Active Brains with Fitbit. We will explore feasibility, acceptability and within group
      changes in physical, emotional and cognitive functioning.

      Each group meets for 8 90 minute sessions. Each group has 5-8 participants. Participants
      receive a treatment manual. There are 2 assessment points: baseline, and post program.
      Assessments involve questionnaires, a walk test, and objective step count with Actigraphs for
      1 week.

    <description>Active Brains uses a multimodal approach to introduce and reinforce new skills, including didactics, in-session activities, discussions, and weekly practice assignments (homework). The Active Brains sessions reflect a purposeful integration of the three treatment approaches (relaxation methods, stress appraisal &amp; coping, and growth enhancement). The format is an 8-week program with weekly meetings and a focus on relaxation response strategies, cognitive behavioral training, positive psychology and mind-body interactions</description>
