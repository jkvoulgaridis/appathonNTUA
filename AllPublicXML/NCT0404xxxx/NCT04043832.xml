  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In addition to muscle thickness and average echo intensity, this study aimed to use
      quantitative ultrasonic technology to increase the number of related parameters of power
      Doppler ultrasonography measured to describe the number, quality, and recruitment level of
      muscles. In addition, this method was compared with the existing muscle strength testing
      methods. Image recognition was performed using the traditional multivariate linear regression
      statistical method and the AI convolutional neural network algorithm to investigate the
      application of quantitative ultrasonic technology for direct evaluation of muscle strength in
      clinical practice.

    <textblock>
      Collection of all quantitative ultrasonic data was performed by one ultrasound physician. The
      Aixplorer® series color ultrasonic diagnostic instrument of Supersonic Imagine (France) and
      an L15-4 linear array probe were used. The medial head of the quadriceps muscle was measured.
      The subjects wore short pants that settled above the knees. Tight pants were avoided to
      prevent impaired venous return, which can affect the power Doppler ultrasonography result.
      The subjects did not exercise within half an hour before testing. Two-dimensional images of
      the subjects' muscles were collected in a quiet resting state and used to measure muscle
      thickness and the average echo intensity. The power Doppler images were used to measure the
      level of muscle hyperemia. The measurements were performed in the 0° knee extension position
      and the most prominent part of the medial head of the quadriceps muscle was measured by the
      ultrasound physician using visualization. The probe angle was perpendicular to the trajectory
      of the muscle bundle, and the measurement was performed with the muscle in a relaxed state.
      After the measurements, the knee was restrained to complete the isokinetic muscle strength
      test. When testing of the last group was completed, the knee was released immediately. The
      two-dimensional image and the power Doppler image at the same location were captured and the
      image acquisition time was no more than 3 s.
