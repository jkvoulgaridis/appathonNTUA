        It is anticipated that approximately 18,000 patient records will be included in the trial.

        It is anticipated that approximately 1,200 undiagnosed patients would be invited for AF
        diagnosis across all study sites.30 years is taken as the minimum age entry criteria as the
        algorithm was built on information from patients &gt;30 years where AF becomes more prevalent.
