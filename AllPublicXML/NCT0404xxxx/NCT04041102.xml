  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Owing to the rarity, severity, speed of progression and fatal prognosis of infantile and
      juvenile GM1, there is a limited understanding of overall disease progression and meaningful
      outcome measures. A natural history data set to assess disease progression, particularly in
      the infantile population, and to explore potential efficacy endpoints and biomarkers for
      future clinical trials would benefit both the scientific and patient communities. This
      natural history study will follow up to 40 subjects diagnosed with GM1 gangliosidosis (up to
      20 infantile (Type 1) and 20 late infantile/juvenile (Type 2)) for up to 3 years. Visits will
      be conducted every 6 months, during which several procedures will be performed and the data
      recorded in order to learn about the natural course of the disease, including changes in
      clinical and neurological assessments and electrophysiologic, imaging and biofluid
      biomarkers. The procedures/interactions include: physical &amp; neurological exam, blood &amp; urine
      sample collection, questionnaires &amp; assessments of development, ECHO, ECG, x-ray and
      ultrasound (if MRI not performed). Optional procedures include: EEG, general anesthesia (for
      MRI and LP), MRI and lumbar puncture (spinal tap).

    <measure>Change from baseline in standard scores for each domain on the Vineland-II (Juvenile GM1 population)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline through 36 months (3 years)</time_frame>
    <description>The Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales, Second Edition (Vineland-II) is a standard assessment for measuring personal and social skills for children and adults (birth through 90 years of age). This assessment aids in diagnosis of intellectual and developmental disabilities or delays associated with a variety of diseases/disorders. The assessment includes 5 domains. Scores for each domain and a composite adaptive behavior score are then converted to standard scores with a range of 20 to 140, with a score of 140 correlating to a high adaptive level.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in total score for each sub-domain of the BSID-III OR the KABC-II (Juvenile GM1 population)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline through 36 months (3 years)</time_frame>
    <description>Based on the outcome of the Vineland-II, each subject will be given a developmental age score that will determine whether the Bayley Scale of Infant and Toddler Development, Third Edition (BSID-III) or the Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children, Second Edition (KABC-II) is administered. Children with a developmental age of 42 months or less will be administered the BSID-III and those with a developmental age of greater than 42 months will be administered the KABC-II.
The BSID-III assesses 5 major areas of development. Each domain results in a raw score that is converted to a composite score. A higher composite score generally corresponds with higher function.
The KABC-II assesses 4 major areas of intelligence and achievement in young children. Each domain results in a raw score that is converted to a standard score. Scores from 90-109 are generally considered average, with scores higher than 109 considered to be above average.</description>
