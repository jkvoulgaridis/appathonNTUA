  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study of descriptive and analytical, prospective feasibility, monocentric,
      longitudinal with 6 months of bi-weekly practice of Taïso in patients with Parkinson's
      disease with mild to moderate postural instability.

      The intervention is planned over 6 months (25 consecutive weeks) for the whole project of the
      patient group. Patients are included in the month before the start of the treatment of the
      intervention. Four standardized evaluation sessions are conducted: a first evaluation during
      the first week of Taiso and then every 8 weeks (2 months, 4 months and 6 months). Incident
      collection and fitness assessment tests are performed by the physical trainer while the
      balance and are performed by a physiotherapist. The quality of life assessment and the
      MDS-UPDRS II rating are performed during the inclusion visit and then the final study visit
      (within 2 weeks) after 6 months of practice) with the coordinating neurologist. An evaluation
      of incidents is also carried out during this end-of-study visit.

    <description>Taiso is a physical preparation practice of which the French Judo Federation is a state delegate. It is practiced in most French dojos. During each course, Taiso's practice works the fundamental motor skills (coordination, static and dynamic balance, locomotion and grip), muscle strengthening, target work by simulated attacks-defenses exercises without blows or projections, relaxation and the specific work of knowledge to fall and rise with graduation and progressivity in the intensity and complexity of the exercises as and when practiced.</description>
