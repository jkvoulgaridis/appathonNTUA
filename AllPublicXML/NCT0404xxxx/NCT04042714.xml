  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the safety and efficacy of drug, TAS-102
      (trifluridine/tipiracil), in patients with extrapulmonary (outside the lung) high-grade
      neuroendocrine cancer. TAS-102 demonstrated improved survival and tolerability in patients
      with colorectal cancer and is currently approved by the FDA and marketed under the brand name
      Lonsurf for the treatment of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). Recently, a
      study evaluating TAS-102 showed a case of complete remission of high-grade NEC. Given the
      safety profile of TAS-102 and the remarkable single agent activity in a disease with
      otherwise dismal outcomes, we hope that TAS-102 may show tolerability and efficacy in
      neuro-endocrine cancer and propose further exploration in patients with extrapulmonary
      (outside the lung) high-grade neuroendocrine cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Neuroendocrine tumors are highly prevalent cancer showing heterogeneous array of behaviors.
      For intermediate/high grade and poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinomas (NEC) that
      occur outside the lung, there is no acceptable standard of care. Most patients are treated
      with a platinum-based chemotherapy in the front-line setting and evidence for therapies in
      the second line setting is minimal representing a significant unmet need. However, the
      response rates have been unsatisfactory with progression-free survival of only 2.3 to 6.2
      months, and there is an unmet need for an effective treatment for patients with refractory
      disease.

      TAS-102 is a novel combination medicinal product consisting of a thymidine-based nucleoside
      analogue (trifluridine; FTD) as the active component and the thymidine phosphorylase
      inhibitor tipiracil hydrochloride (TPI) that has shown promising activity in phase I trials
      in patients with solid tumors and phase II in patients with gastric cancer. FTD enters cancer
      cells, interferes with DNA synthesis, inhibits cell proliferation and inhibit tumor growth.
      TPI helps FTD sustain its level in cells without degradation by thymidine phosphorylase
      (Tpase).Thus TAS-102 uses dual approach to inhibit rapid degradation of trifluridine and
      subsequent tumor growth.

      Given the safety profile and efficacy, the study is designed to explore/evaluate efficacy of
      TAS-102 and identify characteristics of patients who may respond to this treatment.
