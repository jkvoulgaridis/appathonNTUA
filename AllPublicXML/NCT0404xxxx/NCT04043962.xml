  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The MOCAS Study aims to describe the mechanisms through which sleep deficiency affects youth
      responses to an online pain self-management intervention over a 6-month period. The study is
      a single arm trial with repeated measurements using surveys, daily diaries, and actigraphic
      monitoring.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study objective is to characterize how sleep deficiency influences youth's ability to
      engage with, implement, and benefit from pain self-management intervention. The investigators
      will recruit a cohort of 80 youth, ages 12 to 17 years, with chronic musculoskeletal, head,
      or abdominal pain into a single arm trial conducted at one site. Assessments will occur at
      baseline, immediately after intervention, and repeated at 3 months post-intervention.
      Mediators will be assessed at mid-treatment (4 weeks). All youth will receive an 8-week
      internet-delivered pain self-management intervention (WebMAP). Following the recommended
      Common Data Elements for self-management three self-management processes are measured
      including patient activation, pain self-efficacy, and self-management skills, and
      patient-reported outcomes of health (global health, fatigue) and pain (pain symptoms,
      pain-related disability). Positive and negative affect and executive function are assessed as
      potential mediators. Sleep deficiency is comprehensively assessed with subjective measures,
      daily sleep logs, and ambulatory actigraphy monitoring to measure disrupted sleep, amount of
      sleep, sleep quality, and insomnia symptoms.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in pain intensity ratings</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 weeks, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Pain intensity will be measured using the 11-point NRS (numerical rating scale) completed by children via daily diary assessments over a 7-day period. Scores are averaged at each timeframe with higher scores indicating higher pain intensity.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in pain-related disability</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 weeks, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Child Activity Limitations Interview (CALI-9) is a daily diary validated to assess perceived difficulty in completing 9 daily activities as a measure of pain-related disability. Responses are rated on a 5-point scale (0-4) with higher scores indicating greater perceived difficulty with activities. Youth will provide ratings daily for 7 days on their online diaries at each assessment period. Mean total activity limitations across the reporting period is used in analyses, with higher scores indicating greater disability.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in fatigue</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 weeks, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Children will complete ratings of fatigue on the PedsQL Multidimensional Fatigue Scale, which yields three scores for general fatigue, cognitive fatigue, and sleep-rest fatigue. Higher scores indicate fewer problems with fatigue. It has been widely used in many pediatric chronic health conditions demonstrating strong reliability and validity.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in global health</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 weeks, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Global health will be assessed by child self report with the PROMIS pediatric global health measure, a 7-item measure summarizing a child's physical, mental, and social health into a single score. Higher scores indicate better global health.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of treatment modules completed</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Measured as the number of pain self-management modules completed by each participant during the intervention period ranging from 0 to 8 modules. Module usage information is obtained from the administrative database of the internet program and is stored in real time.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Treatment acceptability</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Measured using the Treatment Evaluation Inventory (TEI) completed via child and parent report, which includes 9 items that are rated on a 5 point likert scales. Higher scores indicate greater treatment acceptability and scores over 37 indicate moderate treatment acceptability.</description>

    <description>The eight child modules include: 1) education about chronic pain, 2) recognizing stress and negative emotions, 3) deep breathing and relaxation, 4) implementing coping skills at school, 5) cognitive skills (e.g., reducing negative thoughts), 6) lifestyle interventions, 7) staying active (e.g., pleasant activity scheduling), 8) relapse prevention. The eight parent modules are: 1) education about chronic pain, 2) recognizing stress and negative emotions, 3) operant strategies I (using attention and praise to increase coping), 4) operant strategies II (using rewards to increase positive coping and reach school goals), 5) modeling, 6) lifestyle, 7) communication, 8) relapse prevention.</description>
