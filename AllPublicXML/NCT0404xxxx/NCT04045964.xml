    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to explore the potential for directly targeting smoking
      cessation, regardless of motivation level, in a subsample of neonatal intensive care unit
      (NICU) parents with the ultimate goal of reducing secondhand smoke (SHS) in their homes.

             use during the course of the study

          -  Current use of NRT or enrollment (or plans to enroll) in another smoking cessation
             program in the next 3 months
