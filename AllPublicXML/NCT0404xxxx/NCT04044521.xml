  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to understand the optimal sequencing and combination of implementation
      strategies that specific types of clinics and prescribers need to adopt clinical guidelines
      for opioid prescribing. The pragmatic goal is to give health systems a tool they can use to
      predict which clinics and prescribers will benefit most from which sequence and combination
      of implementation strategies.

    <textblock>
      The proposed study evaluates a sequence and combination of implementation strategies that is
      tailored to the needs of stakeholders at different levels (health system, clinic, and
      prescriber). We will deliver an adaptive version of systems consultation that progressively
      and adaptively drills down to offer more and more personalized levels of implementation
      support. The intervention starts with academic detailing, a systems-level strategy consisting
      of an expert-led training session plus distance-based follow up support. This strategy
      continues for the 18-month intervention for all clinics, but at 3 months, half of the clinics
      will be randomized to receive practice facilitation. Practice facilitation is a clinic-level
      strategy in which a highly-skilled external change agent helps clinics improve processes
      related to opioid prescribing. At 6 months, half of prescribers will be randomized to receive
      physician peer coaching. Physician peer coaching is a clinic-level strategy in which a
      physician expert gives one-on-one support to prescribers in managing their patients on
      long-term opioid therapy. These 3 discrete strategies will be delivered in a sequential,
      multiple-assignment randomized trial to 38 clinics from 2 Wisconsin health systems. The study
      has 3 specific aims:

        1. Compare the effect over 18 months of (1). An adaptive systems consultation
           implementation strategy (intervention group) vs. (2). Academic detailing alone (control
           group) on average morphine milligram equivalent dose (the primary outcome).

        2. Develop an assessment of contextual factors that influence the effectiveness of
           different implementation strategies. This aim will test 4 moderators and assess other
           factors that affect implementation. The goal is to develop a tool that decision-makers
           can use to predict which implementation strategies will be most effective in different
           settings.

        3. Estimate the costs of delivering 4 different sequences and combinations of strategies,
           including the incremental cost effectiveness of adding facilitation and physician peer
           coaching. Results will help decision-makers weigh the costs and effects of using
           different implementation strategies.

The PHQ-9 is a 9-question instrument given to patients in a primary care setting to screen for the presence and severity of depression. It is the 9-question depression scale from the Patient Health Questionnaire. Total score can range from 1-27. Interpretation of total scores is as follows:
1-4=Minimal depression, 5-9=Mild depression, 10-14= Moderate depression, 15-19=Moderately severe depression, 20-27= Severe depression.</description>

    <description>Systems consultation consists of three implementation strategies: academic detailing (AD), practice facilitation (PF), and physician peer consulting (PPC). Clinics will receive a combination of these strategies for 18 months.
AD: Clinicians will attend an educational meeting that will detail the study and Center for Disease Control guidelines for opioid prescribing in primary care. Clinicians will then will get a monthly audit &amp; feedback report on their prescribing.
PF: clinics will be randomized to receive practice facilitation. Facilitators will travel to each clinics. Facilitators walk through the clinic, identify areas of opioid prescribing workflow improvement, conduct a nominal group technique with the change team, and set a Plan-Do-Study-Act cycle. Clinics will follow-up with the facilitators monthly.
PPC: Clinicians of the clinics will meet quarterly with the physician peer consultant to discuss tough patient cases and panels regarding opioid prescribing.</description>

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Clinics will be eligible for the study if they:

          -  are a primary care clinic (non-pediatric primary care, internal medicine, or family
             medicine);

          -  have not received the systems consultation intervention;

          -  do not explicitly prohibit initiating opioid therapy;

          -  do not exceed the performance on key measures of guideline concordance (fewer than 80%
             of long-term opioid patients have treatment agreements and a urine drug screen in the
             past 12 months)

        Prescribers will be eligible if they:

          -  are a primary care provider at the clinic;

          -  are not temporary providers who do not manage stable panels or patients;

        While patients are not subjects of study, de-identified prescriber panel data will be used
        to assess outcome measures. To be included in the de-identified prescriber panel data,
        patients must:

          -  have a primary care provider at the clinic;

          -  are prescribed opioid therapy for at least 3 consecutive months;

          -  do not have a cancer diagnosis or are receiving hospice care.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Clinics will be excluded if they are not a primary care clinic, have received the systems
        consultation intervention, prohibit initiating opioid therapy, or exceed the threshold on
        key measures of guideline concordance.

        Prescribers will be excluded if they don't have prescribing privileges or are temporary
        providers who do not manage stable panels or patients.

        De-identified prescriber panel data will be excluded from outcome measures if they do not
        have a primary care provider at the clinic, are not prescribed opioid therapy for at least
        3 consecutive months, or have a cancer diagnosis or are receiving hospice care.
