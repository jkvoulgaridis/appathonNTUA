      To observe the safety, tolerability and clinical effects of PD-1, chidamide, lenalidomide and
      gemcitabine in the treatment of newly diagnosed and relapse/refractory peripheral T-cell
      lymphoma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with peripheral T-cell lymphoma usually have a bad prognosis. These patients cannot
      be treated successfully with the conventional CHOP regimen. The investigators have been
      proceeding this trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the PD-1, chidamide,
      lenalidomide and gemcitabine in the treatment of newly diagnosed and relapse/refractory
      peripheral T-cell lymphoma.

    <description>PD-1 blocking antibody inhibits PD-1. Chidamide is an histone deacetylase inhibitor. Lenalidomide is a potent inhibitor of TNF-α. Gemcitabine is a cytosine nucleoside derivative, its main metabolite incorporates into DNA in cells and mainly acts on G1 / S phase.</description>
