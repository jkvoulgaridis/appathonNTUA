  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A prospective cohort design will be used to assess differences in outcomes between pivoting
      sport athletes with anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) who follow usual care
      and those who follow a treatment algorithm with a RTS and rehabilitation tool. Athletes aged
      15-40 at injury with primary ACLR who express a goal to return to sports with frequent
      pivoting are eligible. The RTS and rehabilitation tool includes standardized clinical,
      functional and muscle strength testing 6, 8, 10, and 12 months after surgery. Individual test
      results guide progression in sports participation and the content of further rehabilitation
      according to a standardized algorithm.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fewer than half of athletes with ACLR return to competitive sports, and, for those who
      return, 1 in 5 sustain reinjury. Insufficient functional recovery and poor psychological
      readiness to RTS are thought to contribute to these low RTS rates and high reinjury rates.
      Previous research has shown that return to sport (RTS) should be delayed until the athlete
      passes the criteria of a clinical decision-making tool for RTS. However, to successfully
      improve RTS and reinjury outcomes, it is imperative that a decision-making tool (1) guides
      RTS decisions at a specific point in time, and (2) directs the planning and execution of
      treatments that eventually enable the athlete to safely RTS.

      Nonprofessional athletes are often discharged from rehabilitation prior to RTS, and most are
      treated by rehabilitation clinicians who do not have access to the sophisticated and
      expensive test equipment used in previous research on functional readiness for RTS. The RTS
      and rehabilitation tool is therefore designed in collaboration with athletes, coaches and
      primary care physical therapists as a low-cost intervention that is feasible to implement on
      a broad scale.

      The athletes who follow the RTS and rehabilitation tool will be recruited from Oslo, Norway,
      while the control group that receives usual care will be recruited from multiple sites in
      Sweden.

      Predefined adjustment factors for the comparative analyses are: age, sex, specific preinjury
      sport, family history of ACL injury, time from injury to surgery, meniscal and cartilage
      injury/surgery at ACLR, and ACL graft type. The analysis of reinjury will be adjusted for
      sports exposure.

      Objectives

        -  To compare 1 and 2-year sports participation, psychological readiness to RTS, knee
           function and reinjury outcomes between athletes with ACLR who follow a treatment
           algorithm with a RTS and rehabilitation tool and those who follow usual care

        -  To assess adherence and barriers to adherence in athletes with ACLR who follow a
           treatment algorithm with a RTS and rehabilitation tool

    <description>Six months after ACLR, athletes will commence a standardized RTS assessment. The athlete will follow a standardized, sport-specific progression protocol designed to increase athletic confidence and trust in the knee during sports. Readiness to return to full, unrestricted practice will be determined based on 7 time-based, load-based, clinical and functional criteria. If the athlete fails any of the criteria, he or she will continue to participate in restricted practice. Depending on which of the specific criteria the athlete fails, a targeted treatment plan will be developed. Standardized protocols for effusion management, knee control and strength training will be triggered if the athlete fails the criteria for knee joint effusion, hopping and muscle strength, respectively. The RTS assessment and development of the targeted treatment plan will be repeated every 2 months until the athlete is cleared to RTS, up to a maximum of 12 months after ACLR.</description>

    <description>The RTS assessment includes a Lachman test, modified stroke test, side hop test, triple hop test, and quadriceps muscle power test. The sport-specific progression plans have 6 participation levels in practice and 6 participation levels in match play. A minimum of 2 weeks and 4 training sessions without pain or effusion must be completed before the athlete progresses to the next level. Criteria for full, unrestricted participation in practice: (1)at least 9 months from ACLR, (2)modified stroke test grade 0, (3)completed previous levels in the sport-specific progression plan, (4)negative Lachman test, (5)side hop test limb symmetry at least 90%, (6)triple hop test limb symmetry at least 90%, (7)quadriceps power symmetry at least 90%. The strength training and knee control exercise protocols each have 3-4 different exercises of 3-4 sets that are performed 3 days per week.</description>
