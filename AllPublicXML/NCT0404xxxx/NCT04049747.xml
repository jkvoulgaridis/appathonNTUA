      Men diagnosed with significant cancer confined to the prostate currently undergo radical
      therapy directed to the whole prostate (radiotherapy or prostatectomy). These provide good
      cancer control but can cause significant side effects.

      Focal Therapy involves targeting the cancer alone, whilst leaving healthy prostate gland
      alone. Case series have shown similar cancer control over 5 years with a much better side
      effect profile. However, there have been no randomised control trials (RCTs) comparing the
      success in cancer control and the quality of life in patients that undergo radical therapy vs
      those that undergo focal therapy. Further, there is a need to assess the use of additional
      therapies that may improve the cancer control outcomes following focal therapy. By having a
      trials platform with two RCTs (CHRONOS-A and CHRONOS-B) that reflect best patient and
      physician preferences/ equipoise, the investigators aim to answer these questions.

      To improve acceptability, recruitment and compliance, the investigators have an embedded
      study aimed at reviewing clinician and patient perspectives and trial acceptability.
      CHRONOS-A will compare radical therapy to focal therapy, whilst CHRONOS-B will compare focal
      therapy alone to focal therapy with various therapies targeting the testosterone pathway that
      can shrink the cancer before it is treated. The investigators think this might improve
      outcomes further for men that definitely want focal therapy.

      AIM:

      CHRONOS-A Pilot: To determine if men will agree to participate in a randomised controlled
      trial that randomly assigns them to focal therapy alone or radical therapy (radiotherapy or
      prostatectomy).

      Main: To determine if focal therapy alone is non-inferior when compared to radical therapy
      (radiotherapy or surgery) in terms of progression-free survival at 5 years in men with
      clinically significant non-metastatic cancer.

      CHRONOS-B Pilot: To determine if men expressing a preference for focal therapy will agree to
      participate in a multi-arm, multi-stage Randomised Controlled Trial that randomly assigns
      them to focal therapy alone or focal therapy in combination with neoadjuvant and/or adjuvant
      agents.

      Main: To determine if focal therapy combined with neoadjuvant and/or adjuvant agents,
      compared to focal therapy alone, will improve failure-free survival at 5 years, in men with
      clinically significant non-metastatic cancer.

      OBJECTIVES To deliver a trials framework that fits with existing patient and physician
      equipoise so that the investigators can answer the next generation of research questions to
      evaluate medium-term outcomes following minimally invasive focal therapy in the treatment of
      clinically significant, non-metastatic prostate cancer.

      Embedded internal pilot objectives:

        -  Determine patient acceptance to randomisation.

        -  Conduct an embedded qualitative study of patient and clinician acceptance and experience
           of the linked randomised controlled trial CHRONOS design.

        -  Establish the feasibility of an economic evaluation alongside the main trial.

        -  Determine acceptability and completeness of resource use and utility measures.

        -  Identify the relevant NHS and non-NHS resource use to be collected alongside the main
           trial.

        -  Identify the relevant items to populate the Cost and Consequences framework.

        -  Perform preliminary analysis of pattern of missing data.

      MAIN STUDY PRIMARY OBJECTIVES

      CHRONOS-A:

      To evaluate progression-free survival rates of focal therapy alone compared to radical
      therapy (radiotherapy or surgery) in the treatment of non-metastatic clinically significant
      prostate cancer. Progression-free survival is defined as time from randomisation to salvage
      whole-gland or systemic therapy, prostate cancer metastases or prostate cancer-specific
      mortality.

      CHRONOS-B:

      To evaluate Failure-Free-Survival rates of focal therapy alone compared to focal therapy
      combined with other therapies as a neoadjuvant strategy. Failure-Free-Survival is defined as
      time from randomisation to further focal therapy session or salvage whole-gland or systemic
      therapy or prostate cancer metastases or prostate cancer-specific mortality.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  PSA &lt;/=20ng/ml

          -  Patients must have undergone a diagnostic pre-biopsy MRI compliant with national
             uro-radiology consensus guidelines. Dynamic contrast enhancement using gadolinium is
             not required at diagnostic stage. However, contrast enhancement MRI will be required
             in those men who undergo focal therapy prior to focal therapy as a baseline for
             comparison during follow-up. In the absence of a compliant MRI (for clinical or other
             reasons), a transperineal template mapping biopsy using a 5-10 mm sampling frame will
             be required

          -  Histologically proven prostate adenocarcinoma

          -  Overall Gleason score of 7 (either 3+4=7 or 4+3=7) of any length or Gleason 3+3=6
             provided &gt;/=6mm cancer core length in any one core. Patients with Gleason 4+4=8 in
             some cores but where the overall Gleason score is 7 will be included.

          -  Bilateral histologically proven prostate cancer is permissible provided the following
             criteria are met:

               -  The index lesion to be treated if focal therapy is used meets the above
                  histological criteria.

               -  The patient may have a PIRADS or Likert score 3, 4, 5 mpMRI lesion on the same
                  hemi-gland (either right/left or anterior/posterior) as the histological index
                  lesion

               -  Secondary areas of Gleason 3+3=6 of &lt;/=5mm cancer outside of the treatment field
                  can be monitored, if present, and patient undergoes focal therapy.

               -  If a Likert or PIRADS score 3,4 or 5 mpMRI lesion is present in an area outside
                  of the treatment field with a negative biopsy for cancer then pathology must be
                  reviewed and confirm the presence of inflammation or atrophy if the patient is to
                  undergo focal therapy*

          -  Radiological stage T2b/T3a will require central review regarding suitability for focal
             therapy.

          -  Index tumour volume, as seen on mpMRI if carried out, will be restricted to 50% of one
             lobe for either unilateral or bilateral ablation, patients with tumour volume &gt;/=50%
             of one lobe will require central review prior to enrolment. Final decisions on
             suitability of focal therapy will lie with the trial central review in these cases.

          -  No restriction exists in CHRONOS-A on previous or current use of 5-alpha reductase
             inhibitors or anti-androgens or LHRH agonists or LHRH antagonists.

          -  Age at least 18 years of age

          -  Participants must be fit to undergo all procedures listed in the protocol as judged by
             clinical team
