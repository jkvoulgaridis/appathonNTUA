  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Smokers do not know the symptoms of cancer and wait on average 5 months with symptoms before
      consulting. 80% of lung cancers are diagnosed at too late and incurable stage.

      Systematic CT screening of smokers is under evaluation and currently not supported because
      expensive and little used in real life (in the US 1.8% of smokers after 7 years of
      establishment in the USA).

      An English study showed an increase in the number of operable stage cancers of 3% among
      smokers by calling them on a trailing cough by a simple poster campaign (&quot;You smoke, you
      cough for more than 3 weeks, consult&quot;).

      Regarding COPD, it is linked to tobacco in 85% of cases, affects 3.5 million French and is in
      2013 the 4th leading cause of death in France. The evolution of COPD is marked by
      exacerbations, period of acute aggravation of symptoms, responsible for the deterioration of
      the quality of life or even hospitalization or death. COPD remains a silent killer
      responsible, according to this same summary review, of 16,500 deaths per year in France.

      Dr DENIS and SIVAN INNOVATION have developed a Moovcare web application that has shown a
      7-month survival benefit by early detection of lung cancer relapses based on the reporting of
      patient symptoms analyzed by a validated algorithm in 300 patients and 1 randomized trial.

      The SmokecheckTM app takes this concept of symptom self-assessment by patients. By
      multiplying the number of symptoms analyzed compared to the English study, SmokecheckTM
      should be able to increase the sensitivity of this early detection of COPD and increase the
      number of operable bronchial cancers and increase the chances of survival of patients.
