  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although some important progresses were made in the field of the meridian research, no
      breakthroughs have been achieved. Besides,there are some problems in meridian researches.
      Particularly, previous research of meridian phenomenon involved lots of subjective elements
      and outcomes.Researches that use modern scientific techniques to investigate the biological
      characteristics of meridians are urgently needed. Therefore, this study is designed to assess
      the metabolic characteristics of the Heart and Lung meridians by using functional near
      infrared spectroscopy. Thus, the biological characteristics of meridians could be presented
      objectively in a scientific methodology.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Lung and Heart meridians are chosen as two specific studied meridians. Participants of
      chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and healthy volunteers will be enrolled.

      120 participants will be included and divided into the healthy control group, chronic
      obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) group and healthy intervention group. Functional near
      infrared spectroscopy will be used to assess the metabolic characteristics of the Heart and
      Lung meridians. The specificity for the meridian-visceral association will be investigated by
      comparing the metabolic difference between the Heart and Lung meridians in the healthy
      control group and COPD group. Besides, participants in the healthy intervention group will
      receive two sessions of moxibustion in the Heart meridian and Lung meridian respectively to
      explore the specificity for the site-to-site association.

    <description>Functional near infrared spectroscopy will be adopted to assess the metabolic characteristics of the Heart and Lung meridians.

    <description>Two sessions of moxibustion will be performed in the Heart meridian and Lung meridian successively.
Intervention in the Heart meridian: moxibustion will be performed above Shaohai (HT3) for 15 minutes. During moxibustion, the probes of near infrared spectroscopy will detect the metabolic characteristics of three measuring sites, which include the midpoint of the Heart meridian along the forearm, Chize (LU5) of the Lung meridian, and the midpoint of the Lung meridian along the forearm.
Intervention in the Lung meridian: moxibustion will be performed above Chize (LU5) for 15 minutes. During moxibustion, the probes of near infrared spectroscopy will detect the metabolic characteristics of three measuring sites, which include the midpoint of the Lung meridian along the left forearm, Shaohai (HT3) of the Heart meridian, and the midpoint of the Heart meridian along the forearm.</description>
