      This study will compare the effect of dry needling and sustained pressure in the lumbar
      Paraspinal trigger points in terms of pain threshold and muscle length.

      There will be two groups ; experimental and control. Half of study group will receive dry
      needling session along with stretching and strengthening exercises and half of study group
      will receive sustained pressure technique along with stretching and strengthening exercises .

    <textblock>
      The study is Randomized Control Trail , which is being conducted in Pakistan Railway hospital
      and Riphah international hospital (march 2019-june 2019) . Sample size of 50 individual was
      calculated using epitool with 95% confidence interval (CI), and power 80%. 50 individual are
      screened out according to inclusion criteria. Individuals are allocated randomly into two
      groups , 25 in experimental group and 25 in control group by sealed envelope method.Both
      groups will receive conventional physiotherapy protocol (hot pack, stretching exercises and
      strengthening exercises) and then experimental group will receive cervical sensorimotor
      control training. Assessment will be done on baseline, 2nd week, 4th week and 6th week.

      Myofascial trigger point (MTrP) is moreover removed or inactivate by means of mechanical
      stimuli through filiform needle. A swift and repetitious needle insertions into myofascial
      trigger point is a treatment technique use for dry needling commonly has many therapeutic
      advantages. It interrupts motor end plates, muscle fibers and distal axons of myofascial
      trigger points and shortening of related sarcomere of myocytes.

      Use of dry needling in combination Muscle Energy Technique (MET) has more significant effects
      in improving Visual Analog Scale (VAS), Pain Pressure Threshold (PPT) and Range of Motion
      (ROM) of females patients having latent trigger points in upper trapezius than alone use of
      MET.

      Laser therapy has verified as to be more successful than dry needling in treating MTrPs. It
      is a preferred option for the patients having apprehensive behavior towards dry needling and
      health practioners inexpert with the dry needling procedure.

      Dry needling is indicated for the treatment when MTrPs are present, may leads to functional
      restrictions. They are the source of constant peripheral nociceptive contribution which needs
      to be inactivated. Dry Needling (DN) is also indicated in fascial adhesions, soft tissue
      restrictions, shortened muscle fiber due to which restricted range of motion is
      present.Secondary trigger point (TrP) due to different neuromuscular dysfunctions for example
      in tendonitis, radiculopathies, disk pathology, migraines, carpal tunnel syndrome, tension
      type headache, joint dysfunction, cranio-mandibular dysfunction, phantom pain , additional
      regional urological syndromes and other exceptional neurogenic pruritus, Barre Lieou syndrome

    <measure>The Oswestry Disability Index (ODI)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Changes from the base line, The Oswestry Disability Index is an extremely important tool that researchers and disability evaluators use to measure a patient's permanent functional disability. The test is considered the 'gold standard' of low back functional outcome tools.At the end score is calculated by dividing the obtained score by total (50) multiplied by 100.As one question(section 8) was dropped in all participants ,so total score was considered as 45 instead of 50.</description>

    <measure>Para-spinal muscle length</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Changes from the base line, Muscle length assessment technique is use to measure available range of muscle. In paraspinal muscles length assessment patient would be sitting position. Palpate anterior superior iliac spine (ASIS) bilaterally and instruct the patient to flex forward producing posterior pelvic tilt. Feel when ASIS starts to move this is the end of thoracolumbar flexion and initiation of posterior pelvic tilt. , Patient forehead would come 10 inches of the knees normally.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Visual analog scale</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Changes from the base line, The visual analogue scale is one dimensional measure of pain intensity in adults inclusive those with chronic pain. The intensity of pain experienced by the patients on this scale range from no pain (score 0) to very severe pain (score 100). It is marked by paper and pencil on a line consist of horizontal (HVAS) or vertical (VVAS) comprised of 10centimeters (100mm) in length.</description>

    <measure>Pain Pressure Threshold (PPT).</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Changes from the base line, Algometer is a device used to recognize the minimum pressure or force which induce pain pressure threshold (PPT). It is uncomplicated portable tool with a spring install in it. Peak force or pressure provided by this device is kilopond (kp) = 10 N, Newton = 100 kilopascal (kPa).</description>
