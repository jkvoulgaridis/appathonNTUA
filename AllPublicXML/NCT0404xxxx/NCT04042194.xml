  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study aimed to increase the thickness of the gingiva and prevent possible crestal
      bone resorption by placing the CTG or T-PRF membrane under the mucosa immediately after the
      implant treatment in individuals with thin gingival phenotype. The null hypothesis was that
      T-PRF used simultaneously with implant placement can be considered an alternative to CTG.

    <textblock>
      Although connective tissue graft (CTG) is considered as the best technique for soft tissue
      augmentation, limited supply of donor tissue because of palatal vessels and nerves, and
      postoperative pain may require alternative methods.

      The purpose of this study is to reduce the crestal bone resorption around the implant site by
      augmenting the Peri-Implant Soft Tissue with T-PRF (titanium prepared platelet-rich fibrin)
      or CTG and to compare the effectiveness of the two techniques.

      Through simultaneous augmentation of the soft tissue by T-PRF or CTG, a total of 30 implants
      were implanted in 30 patients (12 males, 18 females) with a mean age of 38.4 years. In the
      test group, implants were placed in thin tissues and thickened with T- PRF membrane at the
      same time, while in the control group, implants were placed in thin tissues and thickened
      with CTG at the same time. During the surgery (T 0 ) and at postoperative 3 months (T 1 ),
      keratinised tissue width (KTW) and Peri-Implant soft tissue thickness (STT) were measured
      from three points: occlusal part of the alveolar crest (OAC), midbuccal mucosa level (MBML),
      and over 1 mm of mucogingival junction (MGJ1).

    <description>Following local anaesthesia, the measurement of soft tissue thickness at three points [1) occlusal part of the alveolar crest (OAC), 2) midbuccal mucosa level (MBML), 3) over 1 mm of mucogingival junction (MGJ1)] was performed with an endodontic spreader and digital caliber. Following the mid-crestal incision, the buccal flap was raised with double layer technique, while the lingual flap was left to enable direct visibility. The implant bed was drilled according to the manufacturer's protocol. The implants (BEGO Semados® RS/RSX implant system, Bremen, Germany) were placed at the bony crest. Right after the implant placement, the randomisation procedure was performed. In this group, the implants were placed in thin tissues, and T-PRF was inserted in the prepared mucoperiosteal flap at the facial site and secured with horizontal mattresses.</description>

    <description>A total of 40 ml blood sample was collected from the antecubital vein of the patients' right or left arms with 10 ml injectors. 40 ml blood was transferred to a grade-IV titanium tube for the T-PRF group. The titanium tubes containing the blood samples were instantly centrifuged in a tabletop centrifuge at room temperature. The blood samples of the T-PRF group were centrifuged clockwise at 2700 RPM for 20 minutes. Subsequent to the centrifugation process, the clots of the T-PRF group were removed from the tubes with sterile tweezers, separated from the RBC base with scissors, and left for over 20 minutes on sterile woven gauze to release the serum slowly from the collected clots. The implants were placed in thin tissues, and the thickness of the thin tissues was simultaneously increased with T-PRF.</description>
