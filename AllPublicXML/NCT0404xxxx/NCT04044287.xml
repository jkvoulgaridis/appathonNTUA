  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postpartum haemorrhage is a major contributor to maternal mortality in the developing world.
      The incidence is between 5 and 12% in Jamaica and varies depending on the route of delivery.
      Misoprostol is a uterotonic agent which has the potential to augment the effects of the
      standard parenteral oxytocic agents used as best practice in the active management of the
      third stage of labour, thereby reducing the risk of postpartum haemorrhage and its attendant
      complications.

      The Aim of the study is twofold: to show that this additive effect translates to a reduced
      postpartum haemorrhage rate and secondly to demonstrate reduced side effects of misoprostol
      resulting from the lower dose and the powdered sublingual administration.
