  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with neck, shoulder, low back, or hip pain that is exacerbated by movement will be
      randomized 1:1:1 to receive either verum hand acupuncture at the correct location (with or
      without movement) or control acupuncture at a nearby incorrect location. After needling and
      as part of the intervention, the movement groups will perform gentle active range of motion
      (ROM) exercises, while the without movement group will lay on the examination table, all for
      10 minutes. Immediately pre- and post- intervention, numeric pain rating scores (NPRS) and
      goniometer- or inclinometer-obtained ROM measurements will be recorded for the most
      provocative movement plane.

      In the physical therapy literature, within-session improvements in pain and ROM have been
      shown to correlate with between-session improvements.All patients will complete PROMIS Pain
      Interference, Physical Function, Anxiety, and Depression measures prior to the acupuncture
      intervention and then 1,2, 4, and 8 weeks later.

      Four potential treatment response modifiers will be assessed. In Traditional Chinese Medicine
      (TCM), a strong needling sensation felt by the patient during an acupuncture treatment is
      called a &quot;deqi&quot; response and is thought to be a positive prognostic sign. In Western
      medicine, a local twitch response (LTR) observed during needling of muscle trigger points is
      thought to represent a polysynaptic reflex and has been linked to local pain
      improvements.Other potential modifiers include patients' underlying musculoskeletal
      structural diagnosis and the provider's experience performing acupuncture.

    <measure>Change in Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-acupuncture, post-acupuncture + 10 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Change in Numeric Pain Rating Scale from Baseline. Range is -10 to +6 by increments of 1. NPRS of later time point minus NPRS at baseline with lower number being better.</description>

    <description>Percentage Change in Pain after Needling Treatment. Options are 0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 100%. Patient reported outcome at 2 time points with higher percentage indicating more improvement and being better.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Total Arc of Motion</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-Acupuncture, post-acupuncture + 10 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Total Arc of Motion is defined as Painful Range of Motion + Reciprocal Range of Motion. Cervical motion include active flexion + extension, active left rotation + right rotation, active left sidebend + right sidebend. Lumbar motions include active flexion + extension, active left rotation + right rotation, active left sidebend + right sidebend. Shoulder motions include active flexion + extension, active abduction + cross arm adduction, passive external rotation with arm down at the side + internal rotation behind the back, passive external rotation with the shoulder abducted to 90 + internal rotation with the shoulder abducted to 90. Hip motions include active flexion + extension with knee straight, passive flexion and extension with the knee bent to 90, passive internal rotation with the hip flexed to 90 + external rotation with the hip flexed to 90. Measurements in degrees with range from 0 to 360, the larger the change in total arc of motion the better.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information Systems (PROMIS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-Acupuncture, 1 week post-acupuncture, 2 weeks post-acupuncture, 4 weeks post-acupuncture, 8 weeks post-acupuncture</time_frame>
    <description>PROMIS is a computerized adaptive testing that our institution administers that provides patient reported measures in the domains of pain interference, physical function, anxiety, and depression. PROMIS scores are normalized to the general population with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10. Range is 0 - 100. A decrease in pain interference, increase in physical function, decrease in anxiety, and decrease in depression is good with larger absolute changes being better.</description>
