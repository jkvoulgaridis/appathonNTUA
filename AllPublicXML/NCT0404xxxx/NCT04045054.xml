  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The project focuses on supporting home care in the post-hospitalization period (Home Health
      Phase), and then further optimizing the older Veterans' recovery of mobility and physical
      activity in the transition back to the home/community (Follow-up Phase).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Medicare-funded home care bridges gaps in the transition of patients from hospital to home;
      yet, it is a bridge with gaps of its own, having limited communication with both the
      discharging hospital physician and the receiving primary care provider and having limited
      knowledge of the longitudinal medical history of the patient. Once home care is completed,
      there is often no plan of continued support to transition the older Veteran back to optimal
      home/community function.

      In the Home Health Phase, a VA-home care Link Team (physician, clinical pharmacist, social
      worker, and physical activity trainer) will provide immediate communication/coordination
      between the VA Ann Arbor Healthcare System (VAAAHS) and home care agencies contracted by
      VAAAHS. The intervention is based on a conceptual model of home care as a bridge between
      hospital and home, in which three interconnected domains determine short-term and long-term
      outcomes: medical complexity (e.g., medication management), social complexity (e.g.,
      caregiving, environment), and functional impairment (e.g., mobility, physical activity). The
      VA Link Team will provide support and assessment for each domain. The team will use
      telemedicine technology and wearable sensors in the home to gather patient data and
      facilitate communication between the patient, health care providers, and the Link Team. The
      Follow-up Phase begins at the end of formal home care services, when the Link Team will
      provide patient-centered care in two ways: 1) support for the the Veteran and caregiver in
      the event of changes in medical condition or medications as well as social or caregiver
      stressors; and 2) coaching to the Veteran and the caregiver during this transition period to
      optimize functional mobility and physical activity.
