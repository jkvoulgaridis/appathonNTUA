  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will determine the dose-related efficacy of a 20-week treatment of omalizumab
      started 8 weeks before the onset of a symptom-driven multi-food oral immunotherapy (OIT)
      protocol at decreasing time to OIT maintenance dose. Two doses of omalizumab will be compared
      to placebo during an oral immunotherapy protocol for three simultaneous food allergens.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2b, multi-center randomized controlled trial comparing 2 doses of omalizumab
      to placebo in subjects 6 to 25 years old with multiple food allergies undergoing a
      symptom-driven multi-food OIT protocol.

      Subjects will undergo a screening period involving a DBPCFC to a mix of three allergens which
      will determine their eligibility and eliciting dose.

      Eligible subjects will be randomized to one of 2 omalizumab dosages or placebo at a ratio of
      2:2:1 for a total period of 20 weeks.

      They will undergo initial food escalation (IFE) to determine their starting food treatment
      mix dose for three simultaneous food allergens after a pre-treatment period of 8 weeks with
      the study drug.

      Subjects will undergo up-dosing OIT visits at the clinic every two weeks, until a maintenance
      dose of 1500mg of protein (500mg per food) is reached (primary endpoint).
