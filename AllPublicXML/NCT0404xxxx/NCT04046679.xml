      This intervention, called MMP®, is a procedure whereby drugs are injected through tattoo
      machines.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Treatment consists of Bleomycin infusion (3.0 U/ml) compared to saline infusion (parallel
      treatment).

      Results will be evaluated after a maximum of 7 treatments, through clinical evaluation and
      Antera equipment analyze.

      Laboratory tests are being requested to verify hematologic, renal and hepatic integrity.

      The treatment will be double blind, one side of the scar will be treated with bleomycin and
      the other side saline infusion.

      The test will consist of 5 subgroups of scars:

        1. Subgroup 1 - Postoperative achromic scars. N1 = 10 participants

        2. Subgroup 2 - post-laser therapy achromic scars. N2 = 10 participants

        3. Subgroup 3 - achromic scars after non-laser ablative treatments. N3 = 10 participants

        4. Subgroup 4 - Posttraumatic achromic scars. N4 = 10 participants

        5. Subgroup 5 - achromic scars after phenol therapy. N5 = 10 participants

      Therefore, the total will be 50 participants.
