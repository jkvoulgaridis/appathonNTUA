  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pneumonia is one of the top causes of death in children aged below 5. More than 10% of
      children with severe pneumonia die. We are not sure that the currently recommended
      antibiotics used in children with pneumonia are the most effective. No studies have been
      carried out to find out whether children with pneumonia should be given intravenous (IV)
      fluids or nasogastric (NG) feeds.

      The SEARCH trial aims to find out which antibiotics and modes of feeding are the most
      effective in treating children with severe pneumonia and therefore helping reduce mortality.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pneumonia is one of the leading causes of death among young children with more than 10% of
      children aged under-five with severe pneumonia dying. The World Health Organisation (WHO)
      guidelines recommend the use of benzyl penicillin plus gentamicin as the standard of care of
      treatment for severe pneumonia. However, there have been increasing concerns about the
      effectiveness of the current recommendations.

      Some authorities advise against the use of enteral nutrition in severely ill patients due to
      concerns of compromised respiratory status and risk of aspiration with nasogastric feeding.
      Evidence to support these concerns is lacking.

      This trial aims to find out which antibiotics are the most effective in the treatment of
      children with severe pneumonia by comparing the current standard of care (benzyl penicillin
      or ampicillin plus gentamicin) to injectable ceftriaxone and injectable
      amoxicillin-clavulanic acid. The study will also determine whether providing feeds through a
      nasogastric tube is superior to intravenous fluid therapy in children with severe pneumonia.

      The SEARCH trial will be a multi-site pragmatic randomised controlled trial that will assess
      the efficacy of both interventions in children admitted with severe pneumonia in a 3x2
      factorial design. The sites will be in East Africa.

      Data from the trial will be used to inform policy and contribute to guidelines and improve
      clinical practice in settings where the burden of pneumonia is highest.
