  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A multicentric randomized controlled trial has been designed to study the effects of a
      decompression prototype splint on symptoms, functional capacity and nerve conduction studies
      in patients with carpal tunnel syndrome.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A decompression prototype splint was designed to simulate an manual mobilization that is able
      to increase the CSA of the carpal tunnel and the median nerve in cadavers. These changes are
      important because they may relate to the decrease in CTS symptoms.

      Patients with mild or moderate carpal tunnel syndrome will be selected for the trial. They
      will be randomized in 2 groups. One group will wear an standard splint for carpal tunnel
      syndrome and the other the decompression prototype splint.

    <description>Intensity of the symptoms (pain, paraesthesia...) will be assess with a visual analogic scale (VAS). A VAS is usually a 100-mm long horizontal line with verbal descriptors (word anchors) at each end to express the extremes of the feeling. Patients mark the point on the line that best corresponds to their symptom severity . When reading the VAS, the position of the respondent's cross is generally assigned a score between 0 and 100. The scores can then be simply transferred to a 100-value scale using a millimeter tape measure.</description>

    <description>This outcome will be assess with The Boston Carpal Tunnel Questionnaire (BCTQ), that is a disease-specific measure of self-reported symptom severity and functional status. The Boston Carpal Tunnel Questionnaire (BCTQ), is a patient-based outcome measure that has been developed specifically for patients with CTS. It has two distinct scales, the Symptom Severity Scale (SSS) which has 11 questions and uses a five-point rating scale and the Functional Status Scale (FSS) containing 8 items which have to be rated for degree of difficulty on a five-point scale. Each scale generates a final score (sum of individual scores divided by number of items) which ranges from 1 to 5, with a higher score indicating greater disability.</description>

    <measure>Global Perceived Effect at 6 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Global perceived effect will be assess with the Global Perceived Effect scale. The global perceived effect scale (GPES) is a commonly used method for measuring patients' assessment of their condition. One of the underlying assumptions of the GPE is that it measures a global assessment of change in the patient's chief complaint. Global Perceived Effect Scale (GPES) consists of a scale of five points that varies from less than five points (much worse), zero (no change) and five points (completely recovered). The participants are asked in the following way for all the measures of the overall effect perceived: &quot;Compared with the beginning of the episode, how do you describe your wrist/hand today?&quot;. Positive scores represent better recovery and negative scores indicate a worsening of symptoms.</description>
