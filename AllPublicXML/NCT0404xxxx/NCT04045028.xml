    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I open-label, multicenter study designed to evaluate the safety,
      tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and preliminary activity of tiragolumab
      administered as a single agent or in combination with daratumumab or rituximab in
      participants with relapsed or refractory (R/R) multiple myeloma (MM) or R/R non-Hodgkin
      lymphoma (NHL).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the Phase Ia part of the study, tiragolumab is administered as a single agent in
      participants with R/R MM or R/R NHL.

      In the Phase Ib part of the study, tiragolumab is administered in combination with
      daratumumab in participants with R/R MM or with rituximab in participants with R/R NHL for
      whom combination therapy is considered an acceptable treatment option.
