  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a crossover study utilizing a Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet and
      a whole-food, plant-based diet among subjects with type 2 diabetes who require insulin.
      Outcomes are short-term changes in insulin requirements and changes in various biomarkers.

      This is a single center, prospective, non-randomized crossover study. The aim of the study is
      to perform a comprehensive evaluation of factors that may contribute to improvements in
      glycemic control in obese patients with type 2 diabetes during a plant-based dietary
      intervention. The primary end point will be the change in total daily insulin requirements
      during the plant-based dietary intervention period compared against a Dietary Approaches to
      Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet. Evaluation of insulin requirements will be carried out in
      three phases of this study: pre-intervention (Phase 1), intervention (Phase 2), and
      post-intervention (Phase 3). Each phase is 7 days. In addition, investigators plan to
      evaluate the effects of a plant-based diet on glucose homeostasis by estimating the insulin
      sensitivity index and beta cell function using weekly sampled oral glucose tolerance tests
      (oGTT) and will explore if these effects correlate with changes in urinary glucose excretion
      by using weekly sampled urinary tests. Investigators will also be assessing changes in
      obesity-related inflammatory biomarkers, stress biomarkers and metabolic markers during the
      three phases of the study. Lastly, given the current technological advantages in the field of
      diabetes monitoring, investigators plan to monitor the glycemic excursion curve using a
      continuous glucose monitor during the complete study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adults (older than 18 years old) of both genders, of all races and ethnicities.

          -  Pre-existing diagnosis of Type 2 diabetes mellitus, as documented in medical records,
             on basal insulin with or without mealtime bolus insulin and no changes in
             antihyperglycemic medications in the past 3 months; Patient's on sulfonylureas,
             glinides and SGLT2 inhibitors will not be included in the study.

          -  Adult's on stable dose of GLP-1 analogs for at least 6 months prior to the study
             enrollment

          -  BMI of 30 kg/m2 or greater
