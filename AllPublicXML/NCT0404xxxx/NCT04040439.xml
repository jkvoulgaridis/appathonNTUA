      To assess the data, including safety profile, of Precedex Intravenous Solution administered
      for &quot;sedation during and after mechanical ventilation in the intensive care setting&quot; in
      pediatric patients under actual medical practice in Japan.

      Maruishi Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. and Pfizer Japan Inc. will collect 50 subjects each.

    <description>Regarding Time Frame, if a participant leaves the ICU before 24 hours after the end of administration of Precedex, adverse events (AEs) observed up to 24 hours after the end of administration should be entered in the case report form (CRF) as much as possible, and the AEs should be monitored until the outcomes become known as far as possible.</description>

    <description>[Sedation during and after mechanical ventilation in the intensive care setting] For pediatric patients ages of 6 years and over, dexmedetomidine is usually administrated by continuous intravenous (IV) infusion of at a rate of 0.2 μg/kg/hr, following by continuous infusion at a range of 0.2 to 1.0 μg/kg/hr adjusted to achieve the optimal level of sedation depending on the patient's condition.
For pediatric patients with corrected gestational ages (gestational age + postnatal age) of 45 weeks to under 6 years, dexmedetomidine is usually administrated by continuous IV infusion at a rate of 0.2 μg/kg/hr, following by continuous infusion at a range of 0.2 to 1.4 μg/kg/hr adjusted to achieve the optimal level of sedation depending on the patient's condition. The dosing rate could be decreased according to the patient's condition as appropriate.</description>
