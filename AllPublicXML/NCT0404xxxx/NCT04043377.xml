  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      68Ga-DOTATATE is a PET radiotracer with high affinity and selectivity for somatostatin
      receptor 2 (SSTR 2) and is approved clinically for the evaluation of patients with
      neuroendocrine tumors. The SSTR2 receptor is also highly expressed at the surface of human
      macrophages and lymphocytes. In comparison to FDG, 68Ga-DOTATATE presents the advantage of
      fast clearance from tissues, which are not expressing somatostatin receptors, in particular
      muscular and myocardial tissues, and the level of blood glucose does not influence its
      uptake.

      Accumulation of 68Ga-DOTATATE has already been detected in coronary and carotid plaques and
      is associated with the number of activated macrophages present in plaques obtained after
      carotid endarterectomy. In a recent study, Tarkin et al. confirmed the preferential uptake of
      68Ga-DOTATATE by macrophages in atherosclerotic plaques. In addition, the intensity of
      68Ga-DOTATATE was higher in culprit lesions in the carotid and coronary arteries than in
      stable lesions. The evaluation of 68Ga-DOTATATE uptake in coronary arteries was also strongly
      facilitated in comparison to FDG thanks to the absence of spillover signal from the
      myocardium.

      AAA has developed a new kit that has markedly simplified the synthesis of 68Ga-DOTATATE and
      has obtained in the US marketing authorization for the kit (Netspot; kit for the preparation
      of Gallium-68-DOTATATE injection for intravenous use) on June 1st 2016 (NDA 208547) for
      evaluation of patients with neuro-endocrine tumors. The Netspot kit will be used in this
      study for the detection of progressing coronary atherosclerosis.

      Design of the trial :

      iPROGRESS is a prospective interventional study. The primary objective of this study will be
      to test the association between the intensity of 68Ga-DOTATATE uptake in coronary plaques
      quantified with PET at M0 and the absolute progression rate of coronary artery calcium
      scoring (CACS) measured between the CT acquired at M0 and after 2 years.

      Patients will be screened until 1 month before the inclusion (M0) visit. Thereafter, 3 visits
      specifics to the study will be performed.

      M0 (baseline): Injection of 68Ga-DOTATATE followed by PET-scan and a CCTA-scan M12 et
      M24(follow-up): Consultation and low-dose cardiac CT for coronary calcium scoring performed
