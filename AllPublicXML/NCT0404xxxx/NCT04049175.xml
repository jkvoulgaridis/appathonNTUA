  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this phase III Study is to demonstrate the efficacy of at least one dose of
      CHF 6532 on moderate and severe asthma exacerbations rate compared to placebo.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase III, randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled multinational, multicentre,
      4-arm parallel-group, study evaluating 3 doses of CHF 6532.

      The effect of CHF 6532 compared to Placebo on severe asthma exacerbations over 52 weeks of
      treatment will be assessed.

      The effect of CHF 6532 compared to Placebo in terms of change from baseline in pre-dose
      morning Forced Expiratory Volume in the first second (FEV1) as well as on St. George's
      Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ), Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ-5) and Asthma Quality of
      Life Questionnaire (AQLQ+12), at Week 52 will be assessed .

      The inter-subject variability in the drug exposure and the effect of selected covariates on
      Pharmacokinetics (PK) will be investigated.

      The impact of study treatments on health economics outcomes will be also investigated.

      Standard safety assessments will be conducted during the Study, including electrocardiograms
      (ECGs), vital signs and laboratory tests.

      Approximately 1392 severe eosinophilic asthmatic adult subjects and additional 248 severe
      eosinophilic asthmatic adolescent subjects will be randomised in about 150 investigational
      sites.
