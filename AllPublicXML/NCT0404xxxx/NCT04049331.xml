  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this study is to evaluate the effect of a testosterone drug called
      Depo-Testosterone (or 'testosterone cypionate'), an FDA-approved drug for improving fatigue,
      sexual function, quality of life, body composition, muscle strength, and physical activity in
      young cancer survivors who report fatigue and have low testosterone. Main hypothesis is that
      Testosterone administration in young male cancer survivors who are in remission for at least
      1 year, report cancer-related fatigue and have symptomatic testosterone deficiency will be
      associated with greater improvements in fatigue scores compared with placebo.

      The overall goal of this proposal is to evaluate the efficacy of testosterone replacement
      therapy in improving fatigue and other outcomes such as sexual function, quality of life,
      body composition, muscle strength and physical activity in a double-blind, randomized,
      placebo-controlled trial in young cancer survivors who report fatigue and have testosterone
      deficiency.

      Fatigue is one of the most prevalent and debilitating symptoms in men with cancer affecting
      70-100% of patients irrespective of their age. Cancer-related fatigue is experienced by
      patients not only during active cancer treatment, but is also highly prevalent in cancer
      survivors who exhibit persistent fatigue months to years after the end of their treatment
      with the highest prevalence being in recipients of chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy.

      In addition to fatigue, sexual dysfunction is also highly prevalent in male cancer survivors.
      Male cancer survivors also have increased fat mass and decreased lean body mass, a phenotype
      that predisposes them to reduced muscle strength. This phenotype of fatigue, sexual
      dysfunction and adverse body composition is commonly encountered in non-cancer patient
      populations with testosterone deficiency, a condition which is also highly prevalent (50-90%)
      in cancer survivors. Pivotal trials of testosterone replacement therapy in non-cancer patient
      populations have shown an improvement in fatigue, sexual function and body composition in men
      randomized to testosterone compared with placebo. However, the efficacy of testosterone
      replacement therapy on cancer-related fatigue has not been studied.

    <description>Mood and well-being will be assessed by the Positive and Negative Affect Scale (PANAS) affectivity balance scale, which includes 10 questions each for Positive Affect and Negative Affect. Many behavioral scientists consider affectivity as the cleanest window on an individual's wellbeing. The most sensitive indicator of impaired wellbeing has been shown to be affective dysregulation, which is reflected in affectivity balance. The latter incorporates negative affects (e.g., anxiety, depression) as well as positive affects (e.g., joy).</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Cancer survivors who have received chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy for their
             cancer and are now in remission for at least one year

          -  Non-hormone-dependent cancer, including most solid tumors, lymphomas and leukemias

          -  Age: 18-50 years

          -  Serum testosterone, measured by mass spectrometry (gold standard method), of &lt;348
             ng/dl and/or free testosterone &lt;70 pg/ml. The lower limits of the normal range for
             total testosterone in healthy young men (age 19-40 years), is 348 ng/dL and the lower
             limits of free testosterone is &lt;70 pg/ml in the Framingham Heart Study sample97.
             Therefore, young symptomatic men with total testosterone &lt;348 ng/dl could be
             considered testosterone deficient. As sex hormone binding globulin levels may be
             elevated in some men with cancer (resulting in elevation in total testosterone level),
             some of these symptomatic men may still be hypogonadal despite having total
             testosterone above this cut-off limit. However; their free testosterone levels may
             still be below the lower limit of normal. Thus, we will also include men with free
             testosterone &lt;70 pg/mL.

          -  Self-reported fatigue. We have selected these symptoms because they are commonly
             reported in male cancer survivors. Fatigue will be defined as a score on Functional
             Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue (FACIT-F) subscale of &lt;40, which best
             divides cancer patients from the general population with 84% accuracy96,185, and was
             used as the cut-off for the NIA-funded 50-million-dollar testosterone trial (The
             T-Trial).

          -  Ability and willingness to provide informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Men with hormone-dependent cancers (breast, prostate or adenocarcinoma of unknown
             origin)

          -  Men with brain (potential cognitive impairment) and pancreatic cancers (short
             life-expectancy)

          -  Use of anabolic agents (testosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone, growth hormone) within
             the past 6 months

          -  Appetite stimulating agents e.g. megestrol acetate within the past 6 months

          -  Systemic glucocorticoids e.g. prednisone 20 mg daily or equivalent doses of other
             glucocorticoids for more than two weeks in the past 6 months

          -  Baseline hematocrit &gt;48%

          -  PSA &gt;4 ng/ml in Caucasians; &gt;3 ng/ml in African-Americans; nodule/induration on
             digital rectal exam

          -  Men with 1st order relatives with a history of prostate cancer

          -  Uncontrolled congestive heart failure

          -  Severe untreated sleep apnea

          -  Myocardial infarction, acute coronary syndrome, revascularization surgery, or stroke
             within 3 months

             o Previous stroke with residual cognitive or functional deficits; Mini-Mental State
             Examination score &lt;24

          -  Serum creatinine &gt;2.5 mg/dL; ALT 3x upper limit of normal

          -  Poorly controlled diabetes as defined by hemoglobin A1c &gt;8.5%; Body mass index (BMI)
             &gt;40 kg/m2

          -  Untreated unipolar depression (treated depression with medications or counseling will
             be allowed

          -  Bipolar disorder or schizophrenia
