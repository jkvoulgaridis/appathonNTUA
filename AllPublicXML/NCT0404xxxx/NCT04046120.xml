  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The importance of wearing medical compression to heal the venous ulcer has already been
      shown. However, no studies have been carried out on variations in medical compression tape
      and their impact on interface pressures which explains the lack of consensus on how to lay,
      including or not to include the heel. Studies on adherence to patients with medical
      compression have been carried out showing that one of the determining factors is comfort. The
      investigators therefore wish to conduct a randomized open prospective quantitative study
      comparing these two modes: including or not the heel .
