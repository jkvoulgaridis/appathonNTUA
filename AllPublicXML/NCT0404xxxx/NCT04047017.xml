  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Apatinib is an oral small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor that selectively binds to and
      inhibits VEGF receptor 2. Novel immunotherapy using the immune checkpoint inhibitors such as
      anti-PD-1 antibody has received much attention. Camrelizumab as one of the anti-PD-1 drug
      have impressive clinical activity.
