  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Much recent interest was raised by the use of Action Observation Treatment (AOT) in stroke
      patients rehabilitation. AOT, well-grounded in neurophysiology, is an updated approach, based
      on mirror neuron system (MNS) used to rebuild motor function despite injuries by engaging the
      brain regions active during action execution in individuals with limited mobility. This
      project aims at identifying, for the first time in Italy, neurophysiological
      electroencephalographic (EEG) biomarkers able to predict rehabilitation outcomes and
      providing an innovative optimized AOT rehabilitation protocol for chronic Stroke outpatients.
      EEG will be recorded to identify the most effective stimuli, quantify changes/recovery,
      profile patients.

      Moreover, an innovative AOT home-based program will be implemented. The translational
      research results will ensure advances in the optimization and personalization of the
      rehabilitative process thus contributing to improve the quality of life of chronic stroke
      patients.

      Stroke is a leading cause of death and one of the greatest causes of long-term disability
      that interferes with a good quality of life. Nowadays the rehabilitation interventions are
      the major component of patient's care to achieve functional outcome. In the last few years,
      in order to improve Activity of Daily Living (ADL), new noninvasive strategies have emerged
      as rehabilitative treatments rather than traditional physical therapies. The Action
      Observation Treatment (AOT), supported by results collected through randomized controlled
      trials, is one of these. This new rehabilitation approach is based on the properties of the
      Mirror Neuron System (MNS; 11-13). The extensive research of the last 20 years on the human
      MNS (hMNS) showed its importance not only in action recognition but also in motor intentions
      and other social cognitive functions. Lastly, because recruited also in damage brain (18,19),
      the MNS is demonstrated to provide satisfactory rehabilitative outcomes. The AOT takes
      advantage of the opportunity to restore functions despite the patient's impairment and it
      seems to be a valid example of translational medicine from basic neuroscience to
      rehabilitation. To date, neurophysiological outcomes were never used for translational
      purposes aimed to the optimization of the therapy and no evidence, in Italy, related to the
      effectiveness of the home-based program were proposed.

      This study protocol provides 3 experimental designs to satisfy 3 different specific aims as
      follows.

      Experimental design aim 1:

      To assess which kind of ADL visual stimuli will be most effective inducing motor excitability
      during action observation, EEG recording will be performed. 20 Stroke patients (10 with right
      lesion and 10 left one) will be recruited and video of feeding, self care and external
      actions showed. The EEG biomarkers will be identify. A comparison on EEG rhythm and
      biomarkers between the two groups and the ADL categories observed will be investigated. The
      most effective category will be subsequently selected for the Randomized Controlled Trial
      (RCT).

      Experimental design aim 2:

      This is an RCT study aimed to deeply investigate if EEG biomarkers are predictive of
      effectiveness of AOT on 40 Chronic Stroke outpatients in order to confirm the translational
      power of the optimized treatment. The subjects accurately enrolled for hospital program, will
      be randomly assigned to the Experimental Group (EG) or to the Control one (CG). The EG will
      observe and execute ADL actions, the CG will observe landscapes and perform the same actions
      observed by the others one but after verbal instructions. For each condition the patient will
      be presented with only 1 typology of motor task per day, starting from the easiest and ending
      with the most complex action throughout 15 sessions spread on 5 weeks (3 sessions/week).
      Tasks will be based on some relevant activities of daily living belonging to at least one
      between feeding, self-care or external actions category on the affected side. Each session
      will last about 15 minutes and will be repeated twice a day, at least 60 minutes apart.
      Before, after and in the middle of the treatment sessions all patients will be clinically,
      neurophysiologically (EEG and EMG) and behaviorally (Kinematics) assessed to verify neural
      plasticity and motor recovery.

      The follow-up at 2 months later will be carried out to assess retention of effects.

      Experimental design aim 3:

      The health policy to develop appropriate home-based rehabilitation programs for chronic
      stroke patients (24,25) could induce to explore whether AOT can meet the necessary
      translational requirements also for this type of care. A New group of 20 chronic stroke
      patients will be recruited and randomly assigned to the EG OR CG to follow the optimized AOT
      rehabilitation programs.

      After appropriate training of patients and caregivers, the use of tablets will let the
      home-based treatment. The investigators will define a low-cost highly accessible system based
      on tablet consumer technology for facilitating the AOT. In particular a tablet will be
      proposed with a web-based program that will be used to train the patients and receive a
      feedback of their progress.

      The whole treatment period will last 6 weeks. The focus of this evaluation will be on the
      feasibility of the home-based treatment and the usability of the platform as well as the
      subjects satisfaction with the services. A preliminary estimate of the recovery and overall
      improvement of functional performances of participants will also be provided with respect to
      clinical outcomes.

    <description>The Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA) is a stroke-specific, performance-based impairment index. It is designed to assess motor functioning, balance, sensation and joint functioning in patients with post-stroke hemiplegia. It is applied clinically and in research to determine disease severity, describe motor recovery, and to plan and assess treatment. The scale is comprised of five domains and there are 155 items in total:
Motor functioning (the score ranges from 0 (hemiplegia) to 100 points (normal motor performance). Divided into 66 points for upper extremity and 34 points for the lower extremity.
Sensory functioning (from 0 to 24 points)
Balance (from 0 to 14)
Joint range of motion (from 0 to 44)
Joint pain (from 0 to 44 ) Scale items are scored on the basis of ability to complete the item using a 3-point ordinal scale where 0=cannot perform, 1=performs partially and 2=performs fully. The total possible scale score is 226.</description>

    <description>The Chedoke-McMaster Stroke Assessment measures physical impairment and disability in people with stroke and other neurological impairment. The measure consists of an Impairment Inventory and an Activity Inventory (Moreland, Gowland, Van Hullenaar, &amp; Huijbregts, 1993). The first inventory aims to determine the presence and severity of common physical impairments, to classify or stratify patients when planning, selecting interventions and evaluating their effectiveness and to predict outcomes. The second inventory measures changes in physical function (Gowland, Stratford, Ward, Moreland, Torresin, Van Hullenar, Sanford, Barreca, Vanspall, &amp; Plews, 1993).

    <description>Il Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) (Folstein et al., 1975), is a neuropsychological test for the assessment of intellectual efficiency disorders and the presence of cognitive deterioration.
The total score is between a minimum of 0 and a maximum of 30 points, where a score of 30 represents the best cognitive condition, and 0 the worst.
The Mini-Mental state examination (MMSE) is often used as a screening tool in the investigation of subjects with dementia, and with neuropsychological syndromes of different nature.</description>

    <time_frame>At baseline-day 0 (T0), at the end treatment-day 30 (T2) and at the follow up visit-day 90 (2 months both for the hospital-based and for the home based program) (T3)</time_frame>
    <description>Electroencephalography (EEG) is an electrophysiological monitoring method to record electrical activity of the brain. It is noninvasive, with the electrodes placed over the scalp. Each conscious and unconscious mental function is the result of the electrical communication among the human brain neurons. It is not possible to record in a no-invasive way the electrical activity related to each neuron, however the EEG technique is able to measure the voltage fluctuations over the scalp caused by the concomitant electrical activity of a neurons population. Such voltage fluctuations could be characterized in terms of spectral content (EEG rhythms or bands) or of time-domain characteristics (Evoked Potentials and Event-Related Potentials). Alph (8-13 Htz), Beta (14-30 Htz) and Mu (8-13 Htz) bandwidth will be registered. The last band will be analysed specifically to investigate the motor areas and mirror neuron system's activity.</description>

    <description>Surface electromyography (sEMG) is a non-invasive procedure involving the detection, recording and interpretation of the electric activity of groups of muscles at rest (i.e., static) and during activity (i.e., dynamic). The procedure is performed using a single or an array of electrodes placed on the skin surface over the muscles to be tested. Recording can also be made using a hand-held device, which is applied to the skin surface at different sites. Electrical activity is assessed by computer analysis of the frequency spectrum, amplitude, or root mean square of the electrical action potential.</description>
