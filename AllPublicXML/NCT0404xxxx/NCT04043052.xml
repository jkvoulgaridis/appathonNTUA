  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The recent development of acute phase treatments has dramatically improved stroke functional
      outcome but post-stroke neuropsychiatric disorders, notably post-stroke depression, continue
      to contribute to the heavy burden of stroke. While these conditions affect about 25% of
      stroke patients at 3 months, they are under-reported spontaneously by patients and are
      under-evaluated and treated by clinicians. Other than stroke severity and psychiatric
      history, risk factors for post-stroke depression remain a matter of debate, thus preventing
      identification of high-risk patients. Moreover, to date, neither pharmacological nor
      nonpharmacological treatments have demonstrated a significant benefit in the prevention of
      this disorder, thereby also impeding the development of early treatment strategies. Yet,the
      early management of post-stroke depression is critical given its negative influence on
      long-term functional outcomes, medication adherence, efficient use of rehabilitation services
      and the risk of stroke recurrence or vascular events. There is a pressing need to develop new
      tools allowing for the early detection of post-stroke neuropsychiatric complications for each
      individual patient. The rapid expansion of ambulatory monitoring techniques, such as
      Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA), allows daily evaluations of mood symptoms in real time
      and in the natural contexts of daily life. The investigators have previously validated the
      feasibility and validity of EMA to assess daily life emotional symptoms after stroke,
      demonstrating its utility to investigate their evolution during the 3 months following stroke
      and to identify early predictors of post-stroke depression such as stress reactivity and
      social support, suggesting that EMA could be used in the early personalized care management
      of these neuropsychiatric complications. Recently, preliminary data have also emphasized the
      potential of EMA interventions to improve the outcome of psychiatric disorders.

Though anxiety can be thought of as having several components, including cognitive, somatic, affective, and behavioral components included only two components in the BAI's original version: cognitive and somatic symptoms, with the cognitive subscale providing a measure of fearful thoughts and impaired cognitive functioning whereas the somatic subscale measures the symptoms of physiological arousal. Care was taken during scale construction to eliminate items that would be confounded with depression items. Patients respond to the frequence of 21 symptoms using a scale from 0 (Never) to 3 (Frequently, Almost every day).</description>
