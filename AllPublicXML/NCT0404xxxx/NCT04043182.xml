  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It's evident that the literature shows good results on the use of aesthetic ultrasound in the
      treatment of localized fat, however, little has been explored so far, about possible
      psychological influences of this method and therefore, it is believed that it is pertinent to
      elaborate studies that include a placebo group, in order to measure the real effects from the
      exclusive application of ultrasound. Therefore, the objective of this study will be to verify
      the influence of the application of aesthetic ultrasound in the treatment of localized fat,
      using for both clinical, biochemical and functional parameters.

      There will be included 30 participants, female gender, communities between 18 and 30 years,
      apparently Saudi, local abdominal fat, located in three groups: control (n = 10),
      experimental (n = 10) and placebo (n = 10) . Or group control não recebeu nenhum type of
      intervention. No experimental group, 10 sessões de ultrassom (Skinner brand, São Paulo) will
      be carried out in the previous region for 20 minutes. No placebo group will be applied
      ultrassom (Skinner brand, São Paulo), pormem com zerada intensities. Anthropometric avaliação
      e of dobras cutâneas will be carried out at this time before applying the treatment protocol.
      As skin folds will be measured by means of adipometers.

    <description>A biochemical analysis will be carried out with the use of soro from blood collection in the antecubital vein, collected at a quantity of 10 mL as participants in the jejum study did not start and end the treatment as ultrassom. As shown below, BIOPLUS 2000 semi-automatic biochemical method will be evaluated for a dosage of parameters such as Triglycerides, Total Cholesterol, High Density Lipoprotein - HDL and Baixa Densidade Lipoprotein Estimates - LDL and Baixíssima Densidade Lipoprotein - VLDL through calculation formula Friedewald As dosagens will be carried out not the Laboratory of Biochemistry of the University Center of Vale do Araguaia - UNIVAR).</description>
