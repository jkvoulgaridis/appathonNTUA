  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Immunotherapy with PD-1 blockade is a first-line treatment for patients with advanced
      melanoma, but unfortunately most patients progress on this therapy. Recent evidence suggests
      that radiation can enhance the immune response in the presence of checkpoint blockade. The
      investigators aim to determine if radiation can elicit increased immune responses in patients
      who have stable or progressive disease on nivolumab.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To determine safety of stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) in presence of ICB in
      patients with advanced unresectable melanoma. Toxicity will be deemed acceptable if the rate
      of Grade 3+ adverse events (CTC v4) is ≤ 33%, with relevant AEs defined as either of the
      following occurring between the start of SBRT and 12 weeks following SBRT completion:

        -  Any grade 3-5 metabolic or hematological toxicity that is related, probably related or
           possibly related to nivolumab or SBRT.

        -  Any grade 3-5 non-hematological toxicity that is related, probably related or possibly
           related to SBRT.

      Secondary Endpoints:

      • To determine whether SBRT results in a clinical abscopal effect on unirradiated lesions.
      The hypothesized rate of abscopal effect is &gt;14%.

      Exploratory Correlative studies:

        -  In select patients for whom TCRseq reveals clonal expansion in non-irradiated tumor and
           serial blood specimens, the relevance of such expansion to tumor-specific responses will
           be investigated using mutation-associated neoantigens (MANAFEST) assays.

        -  Serial stool specimens will be studied to correlate potential changes in microbiome with
           abscopal effect.

        -  To determine whether SBRT promotes clonal expansion of melanoma-specific T-cells, in
           both peripheral blood and within TME of non-irradiated lesions.

        -  To determine whether TCR clonal expansion correlates with clinically observed abscopal
           response.

        -  To identify additional immunological biomarkers in the non-irradiated (abscopal) TME
           using intratumoral gene expression profiling to assess for induction and upregulation of
           a Type I IFN signature among responders1-3. IHC in TME will be used to characterize
           modulation of immune cell populations pre- and post-SBRT, and to assess correlation of
           PD-L1 and other immune-checkpoint receptor expression with responsiveness to SBRT and
           changes in TME post-SBRT.
