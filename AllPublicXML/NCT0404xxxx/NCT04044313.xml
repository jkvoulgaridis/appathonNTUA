  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of hepatic arterial infusion
      chemotherapy of oxaliplatin, 5-fluorouracil and leucovorin plus lenvatinib and toripalimab in
      patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) of oxaliplatin, 5-fluorouracil and leucovorin
      was effective and safe for hepatocellular carcinoma. Lenvatinib was non-inferior to sorafenib
      in overall survival in untreated advanced hepatocellular carcinoma, and programmed cell death
      protein-1 (PD-1) antibody was effective and tolerable in patients with advanced
      hepatocellular carcinoma. No study has evaluated HAIC plus lenvatinib and toripalimab. Thus,
      the investigators carried out this prospective, single-arm study to find out it.
