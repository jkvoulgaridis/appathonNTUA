      1. To assess the acceptability and feasibility of a study design aimed at evaluating the
           efficacy of a newly developed intervention for children and their caregivers following
           discharge from PICU

        2. To assess the acceptability of the newly developed 'storybook intervention'

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Admission to a Paediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) can be extremely stressful for patients
      and their caregivers. Both are at heightened risk of psychological distress, including
      post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS), which sometimes persist for months or years
      post-discharge. Unfortunately, few post-PICU psychological interventions have been studied.
      Documented challenges in PICU research (e.g. low recruitment rates) means feasibility issues
      require investigation before investing resources in intervention trials.

      In adult intensive-care, diaries are used to help patients and families undergo key processes
      that underpin therapies to reduce PTSS: talking about and understanding their experiences. In
      the only published study exploring paediatric ICU diaries, families gave positive feedback,
      but their clinical effectiveness has not yet been evaluated. Further, it is hypothesised that
      formatting diaries as 'storybooks' is more adaptable to the developmental variation of the
      paediatric population.

      Using a case-series design, this research aims to establish the feasibility of recruiting to
      a study evaluating PICU storybooks. It will explore the acceptability of research tasks to
      families, the utility and sensitivity of psychometric measures, plus how storybooks are used
      and perceived in supporting psychological recovery. It is anticipated that the findings will
      directly inform the planning of a larger scale evaluation study, and adaptations to the
      intervention. The hope is this will lead to improved support for families leaving PICU.

      Pairs of caregivers and their children aged 3-15 will be recruited upon discharge from a PICU
      and will receive an individualised, developmentally-appropriate storybook about their PICU
      experiences. At discharge, and one, three and six months post-discharge, caregivers and
      children aged 8+ will complete questionnaires about psychological distress symptoms
      (depression, anxiety and PTSS) and their impact on functioning. Participants will be asked to
      keep a brief log of their storybook use and will be interviewed about their experience of the
      intervention and research procedures at three and six months post-discharge.

    <measure>Post-traumatic Adjustment Screen (parent participants)</measure>
    <time_frame>24 hours</time_frame>
    <description>This is a brief measure consisting of 10 items that ask parents to rate the extent to which they experienced factors relating to before, during or after their child's intensive care unit stay. Each item is rated on a 5 point scale, from 0= not at all to 4=totally. Scores are summed to provide a total (0- 40), with totals above 16 indicating risk of post-traumatic stress.</description>

    <measure>Work and Social Adjustment scale (parent participants; change being assessed)</measure>
    <time_frame>24 hours, 1 month, 3 months and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>This is a five-item measure assessing functional impairment in relation to work, home management, social leisure activities, private leisure activities, and family and relationships. Each item is rated on a nine-point scale ranging from 0 (no impairment) to 8 (severe impairment) and all items scores are added together to give a total score indicating mild (0-9), moderate (10-19) or severe (20-40) impairment.</description>

    <measure>Paediatric Quality of Life (PedsQL) (child participants; change being assessed)</measure>
    <time_frame>24 hours, 1 month, 3 months and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The PedsQL is a 23-item generic measure of health-related quality of life divided into four dimensions (Physical, Emotional, Social, School) designed for 2-18 year olds. It is available in four separate versions for ages 2-4, 5-7, 8-12 and 12-18 year olds (self-report versions available for children 8 years and above). Each item is rated on a 5-pint scale from 0=never, to 4=almost always, where 0= a score of 100, 1= score of 75, 2=score of 50, 3=score of 25 and 4= score of 0. Scores from different items can be summed to compute two Summary Scores (the Psychosocial Health Summary Score and the Physical Health Summary Score), or all can be summed to provide a total score. Higher scores indicate better health related quality of life.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) (child participants; change being assessed)</measure>
    <time_frame>24 hours, 1 month, 3 months and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The SDQ comprises of 25 questions on psychological attributes, divided into five 5-item symptom subscales: Conduct Problems, Peer relationships, Emotional Symptoms, Hyperactivity-Inattention, and Prosocial Behaviour. Items are rated on 3-point scale (0= not true, 1= somewhat true, 2= certainly true) and summed to provide total scores for each scale.</description>

    <measure>The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) (for parent participants; change being assessed)</measure>
    <time_frame>24 hours, 1 month, 3 months and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>This is a self-report scale containing two 7- item Likert subscales to assess the presence of symptoms of anxiety and depression. Items are rated on a scale from 0-3, with higher scores indicating greater symptom severity. Items are combined and summed to give a total score for anxiety and a total score for depression symptoms.</description>

    <measure>The PTSD (post traumatic stress disorder) Checklist for DSM (diagnostic statistical manual) 5 (PCL5) (for parent participants; change being assessed)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month, 3 months and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>This is a 20-item self-report measure in which participants rate how much they are bothered by symptoms of PTSD on a 5-point scale (0 = &quot;Not at all&quot; to 4 = &quot;Extremely&quot;). A total symptom severity score (range - 0-80) can be obtained by summing the scores for each of the 20 items, with scores of 33-80 indicating clinical levels of symptoms.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Child revised Impact of Events Scale - 8 (CRIES-8) (For child participants; change being assessed)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month, 3 months and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>This is an 8-item self report measure in which participants rate how much they experience symptoms of PTSD on a 4-point scale (0= not at all, 1=rarely, 3=sometimes, 5=often). Scores are added together to give a total score (0-40), with scores over 17 suggestive of clinical levels of symptoms.</description>
