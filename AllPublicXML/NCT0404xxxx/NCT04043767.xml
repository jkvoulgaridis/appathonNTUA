    <textblock>
      Difficult intubation is the situation that anesthesiologists don't want to face. Sometimes,
      difficult intubation affects the patient's oxygen saturation and harms for life. Many studies
      try to identify the predictors of difficult airway in pediatric patients. In this study, the
      investigator team want to identify the predictors of difficult intubation in pediatric
      patient by using additional parameters which are including hyomental distance, sternomental
      distance, neck circumference, ratio of hyomental distance to Thyromental distance, ratio of
      hyomental distance to sternomental distance, ratio of height to neck circumference, ratio of
      height to thyromental distance, Ratio of height to hyomental distance.

      After approval from the instution's Ethics Committee, a prospective cohort study was
      conducted in pediatric patients aged between 1-8 years, ASA physical status I-II who were
      scheduled for general anesthesia in elective surgery. One day prior surgery, Children and
      their parents were invited to be participated in the study by using verbal invitation and
      flyer. After giving consent, Addition physical examinations which are the measurements of
      hyomental distance, sternomental distance and neck circumference were done by two independent
      investigators. The ratio of hyomental distance to Thyromental distance, ratio of hyomental
      distance to sternomental distance, ratio of height to neck circumference, ratio of height to
      thyromental distance and ratio of height to hyomental distance. At the day of surgery,
      standard general anesthesia (balance technique) was done. The child was intubated using aged
      appropriated laryngoscope by general anesthesiologist. Cormack-Lehane grading was used to
      identify the difficult intubation. (grade III and IV). Data will be analyzed by R Program.
      The statistically significance was set as P&lt;0.05. Multivariate Logistic Regression analysis
      will be used to identify the predictors of difficult intubation.
