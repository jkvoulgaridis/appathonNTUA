  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this randomized controlled trial will be to determine the effectiveness of ELDOA
      for treating lumbar disc protrusion. Two randomized groups of patients with lumbar disc
      protrusion will be treated with conservative physical therapy and the experimental group will
      be given ELDOA, in addition. Both, male and female patients meeting the inclusion criteria
      will be included. Patients having concurrent malignancy, infection, trauma or any bony
      deformity will be excluded

      The study is aimed at determining the effects of ELDOA in treating disc protrusion at lumbar
      region and is being conducted in Max Rehab &amp; Physical Therapy Centre Islamabad and Pakistan
      Railway General Hospital, Rawalpindi (March 2019-June 2019). Sample size of the study is 34
      with confidence interval of 95% and power of 0.8. 30 patients were screened and 29 were
      included in the study on the basis of inclusion criteria. Sealed envelope contained total 34
      questionnaires, 17 for each group. Patients were allocated randomly on the basis of group
      mentioned on the Performa. Similar conservative rehabilitation protocol was designed for both
      control and experimental group except for experimental group had ELDOA Exercises in addition.
      Patients were examined at 1st visit before administration of any treatment and at 4th visit
      which was also the last one (after completing 4 sessions at alternate days). Baseline
      evaluation for demographics and symptomatology was taken. Self-reported questionnaire, ODI,
      NPRS, lumbar ROM and SLR were recorded at first and fourth visit for comparison. 26 patients
      completed the study while 1 patient from control group and 2 patients from experiment group
      were lost to follow up and were considered drop outs.

    <description>Changes from the Baseline, Oswestry disability index (ODI) was developed in order to assess disability related to pain in individuals with acute, sub-acute, or chronic LBP. The total score of ODI range from 0 (no disability) to 100 (maximum disability). Scores from 0-20 to indicate &quot;minimal disability,&quot; 20-40 to indicate &quot;moderate disability,&quot; 40-60 to indicate &quot;severe disability,&quot; 60-80 to indicate &quot;housebound,&quot; and 80-100 to indicate &quot;bedbound&quot;. The ODI score is recommended as a back pain-specific measure of disability.</description>
