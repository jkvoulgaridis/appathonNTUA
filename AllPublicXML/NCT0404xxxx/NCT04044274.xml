  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adequate perfusion is necessary for maintaining tissue function. This applies also for the
      eye, in which ocular perfusion pressure (OPP) is generally estimated as the difference
      between mean arterial pressure (MAP) and intraocular pressure (IOP). In the latter formula,
      IOP substitutes for central retinal venous pressure (CRVP), which is assumed to be slightly
      higher than IOP to allow blood flow to exit the eye. It has, however, been found that in some
      patients CRVP is elevated and significantly higher than IOP, which would lead to a decrease
      in OPP which is not taken in account with the proposed formula. Therefore, techniques for
      measurement of CRVP are warranted. Recently, a new, method for measurement of this parameter
      without corneal contact has been introduced. Briefly, with this method, IOP is elevated until
      the vein collapses, which then equals CRVP. In the present study this technique will be
      applied in 12 healthy subjects to validate whether the values that are preset by the device
      correlate to measurements obtained with standard Goldmann applanation tonometry. For this
      purpose, IOP will be experimentally increased in steps of approximately 5mmHg until it
      reaches 40mmHg as measured by applanation tonometry. After a resting period of 30 minutes,
      IOP will be again increased stepwise to 40 mmHg while retinal vessel diameters will be
      monitored using dynamic vessel analyzer. During this session CRVP will be measured. After
      another resting period of 30 minutes IOP will be stepwise increased a third time and after
      each step OCT, OCT-A and OCT EDI will be performed.
