      This is open-label, single arm study designed to evaluate the safety of tezepelumab in adults
      and adolescents with severe, uncontrolled asthma on medium to high-dose ICS and at least one
      additional asthma controller medication with or without OCS. Approximately 66 subjects will
      be dosed in Japan. Subjects will receive tezepelumab administered via subcutaneous injection
      at the study site, over a 52-week treatment period. The study also includes a post-treatment
      follow-up period of 12 weeks.
