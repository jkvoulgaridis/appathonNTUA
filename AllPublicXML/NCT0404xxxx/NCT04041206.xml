  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although some important progresses were made in the field of the meridian research, no
      breakthroughs have been achieved. Besides,there are some problems in meridian researches.
      Particularly, previous research of meridian phenomenon involved lots of subjective elements
      and outcomes.Researches that use modern scientific techniques to investigate the biological
      characteristics of meridian phenomenon are urgently needed. Therefore, this study is designed
      to assess the microcirculatory characteristics of meridian phenomenon for the Heart and Lung
      meridians by using laser doppler. Thus, the biological characteristics of meridian phenomenon
      could be presented objectively in a scientific methodology.

      This study will include 40 patients diagnosed with chronic stable angina pectoris (CSAP) and
      40 healthy volunteers. Laser doppler examination will be adopted to assess the
      microcirculatory characteristics of meridian phenomenon for Heart and Lung meridians in the
      physiology/pathological state. In addition, by comparing microcirculation in the acupoints
      along the Heart and Lung meridians, the relative specificity of the two meridians will also
      be investigated. Primary outcomes will be blood flow curve and blood perfusion units(PU).
      Furthermore, this study will build standardized techniques and schemes for detecting the
      microcirculatory characteristics of meridian phenomenon for Heart and Lung. The results of
      this study could also provide scientific foundation for traditional meridian theories.

    <description>Laser doppler will be adopted to assess the microcirculatory characteristics of meridian phenomenon for participants in the two groups.
Experimental device: Four-channel laser doppler flowmetry (PeriFlux System 5000, Sweden).
Experimental process: The participants will be allowed to stabilize for 15 minutes in a supine position in the experimental room before formal examination. They are asked to keep silent and normal breath and avoid limb movement during the whole measuring period. The probes will be left at 4 measuring sites. Blood flow curve will be recorded constantly using Perisoft software (PeriFlux, Sweden). Microcirculatory flux in the measuring sites will be calculated [Perfusion units (PU) =concentration of moving blood cells (CMBC)×velocity (V)]. The acupoint microcirculation will be recorded for 5 minutes.
Measurement sites: Shenmen (HT7) and Shaohai (HT3) of the Heart meridian, Taiyuan(LU9) and Chize (LU5) of the Lung meridian</description>
