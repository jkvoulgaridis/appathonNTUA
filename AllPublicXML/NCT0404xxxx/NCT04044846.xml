    <textblock>
      It is well known that exercise is great medicine, however, for frail older adults who are
      often homebound and require assistance with personal care, there are gaps in both prescribing
      this &quot;medicine&quot; and in filling the prescription. The investigators will uncover and address
      the barriers that prevent frail older adults from increasing their level of physical
      activity. With input from frail older adults, caregivers, and healthcare providers, the
      investigators will create a free, easy to use, home-based program that incorporates physical
      activity such as gentle stretches and range of motion exercises when personal care is being
      provided. This innovation will add great value to the type of care that is being provided to
      homebound frail older adults. Incorporating physical activity as part of the care provided
      offers a unique opportunity for homebound frail older adults to move more, and improve their
      well-being.

      Mobilization in frail older adults (OAs) can improve cardiovascular outcomes, musculoskeletal
      function, and functional independence (Bray, Smart, Jakobi, &amp; Jones, 2016) (Roland, Theou,
      Jakobi, &amp; Frailty, 2014) (Theou et al., 2011). Detriments of immobility include an increased
      risk of functional disability, falls, and premature mortality (Hubbard, Parsons, Neilson, &amp;
      Carey, 2009). There are numerous mobility interventions targeted to community-dwelling frail
      OAs (Sherrington et al., 2019); however, they either have a narrow focus on falls prevention
      (Fairhall, Sherrington, &amp; Cameron, 2013) (Sherrington et al., 2019) or they target mildly
      frail OAs (Johnson, Myers, Scholey, Cyarto, &amp; Ecclestone, 2003) (Giangregorio et al., 2018)
      (Binder et al., 2002). A review of home-based mobility interventions concluded that high-risk
      OAs who have been recently discharged from hospital may require an intervention that is
      tailored specifically for them (Hill, Hunter, Batchelor, Cavalheri, &amp; Burton, 2015)
      (Sherrington et al., 2019). The intervention will focus on active range of motion exercises
      in frail OAs who are homebound or recovering from a health crisis and unable to participate
      in more rigorous exercise regimens. Gentle stretches and range of motion activities can have
      immediate benefits to frail OAs. (O'Brien Cousins &amp; Horne, 1999).

      The first objective is to create an evidence- informed, theory-driven mobility intervention
      for community-dwelling OAs who are moderately and severely frail according to the clinical
      frailty scale (Rockwood et al., 2005). The intervention, entitled Promoting Movement in OAs
      (ProMO), will be implementable with frail OAs in partnership with any care provider in the
      home such as personal support workers (PSWs) and families. The investigators will focus the
      study on the two main providers of care- PSWs. OAs, PSWs, and caregivers will co-create ProMO
      with us. ProMO will be distinct from existing home-based exercise programs (Johnson et al.,
      2003) (Giangregorio et al., 2018) because it will optimize natural opportunities for
      mobilization during care (e.g., bathing and dressing) and will be embedded in facilitated
      activities of daily living. The second objective is to pilot and evaluate ProMO in the
      Greater Toronto Area (GTA). The primary output will be a free, user-friendly, and sustainable
      mobility intervention. A secondary output will be new knowledge about the process and outcome
      of a tailored, home-based mobility intervention.

    <description>The 10-item Vitality Plus Scale (VPS) was developed to measure the health-related benefits of mobilization specifically in OAs. It is a self-administered, 10-item scale, which assesses multiple domains, including sleep, energy, pain and mood. Participants will be asked to provide a rating from 1 to 5 for each of the 10 items. A total score will be calculated for each individual and a total score can range from 1 to 50. A 10% increase in VPS score was considered clinically significant for an individual. The investigators hypothesize that the intervention will result in an increase in post VPS scores. The VPS has been shown to be reliable and valid, sensitive to change and easy for OAs to use. It has been used to measure the effects of mobilization in randomized controlled trials (Li et al., 2013) (Burton, Lewin, Clemson &amp; Boldy, 2013) (Chin A Paw, van Poppel, Twisk &amp; van Mechelen, 2004) (Stiggelbout, 2004).</description>
