    <textblock>
      This study will utilize a longitudinal study design to better understand the natural history
      of oncogenic Human Papillomavirus (HPV) infections in Human Immunodeficiency Virus
      (HIV)-infected and HIV-uninfected Kenyan women, including the potentially modifiable (and
      non-modifiable) factors that are associated with progression of oncogenic HPV infection to
      clinical disease, including cervical cancer.
