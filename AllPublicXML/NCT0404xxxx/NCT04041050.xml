  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are 2 parts to this study for which the primary objectives are to evaluate safety and
      tolerability, including dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), and pharmacokinetics of navitoclax
      when administered alone (Part 1) or when administered in combination with ruxolitinib (Part
      2). In Part 2, participants must have been receiving a stable dose of ruxolitinib therapy for
      at least 12 weeks prior to study enrollment.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Navitoclax Monotherapy (Part 1):

               -  Documented diagnosis of myelofibrosis (MF), polycythemia vera (PV) or essential
                  thrombocythemia (ET) as defined by the World Health Organization classification.

             drug and during navitoclax administration.

        Exclusion Criteria:
