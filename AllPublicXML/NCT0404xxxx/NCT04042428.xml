  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      Somatropin, also known as recombinant growth hormone (rhGH), is one of the World Anti-Doping
      Agency (WADA) prohibited substances. Its consumption in athletes has been banned since 1990,
      as it is known to improve physical performance.

      Hypothesis:

      The subcutaneous administration of recombinant somatropin (rhGH) in healthy subjects allows
      obtaining positive doping samples.

      The concentrations of hGH variants (isoforms) and biomarkers can be measured in serum.

      Objectives:

      Primary objective: To generate enough serum samples positive to recombinant somatropin in
      order to be analyzed as control samples by anti-doping laboratories.

      Secondary objective: To determine the analytical parameters necessary to detect the
      administration of recombinant somatropin in healthy volunteers by direct and/or indirect
      methods.

      Methods:

      Phase I, open, randomized clinical trial, with a treatment condition (recombinant somatropin
      or rhGH) administered subcutaneously to 4 subjects (2:1 ratio). Control samples of the study
      correspond to basal samples of 2 subjects who do not receive any treatment.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A blood sample volume of 450 mL is obtained from each subject receiving the treatment
      condition to perform the proposed tests.

      In order to validate the determination methodology of hGH variants and biomarkers, blood
      samples from treatment group subjects are compared to reference blood samples of 450 mL from
      a control group (not receiving treatment) as it is not possible to obtain a basal sample of
      such volume from the subjects receiving treatment.
