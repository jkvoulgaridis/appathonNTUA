    <textblock>
      Low back pain is one of the reasons for applying to health institutions. Low back pain, which
      seriously affects patients' lives and leads to major financial losses, causes serious
      deficiencies in both developing and developed countries. Health professionals' perception of
      pain, factors associated with pain and fear avoidance attitudes of patients affect the
      success of treatment. The aim of this study is to determine the Turkish version, validity and
      reliability of ''Health Care Providers and Impairment Relationship Scale (HC-PAIRS)''. 165
      physiotherapist working with chronic low back pain were included in the study. In order to
      determine the reliability of the scale, the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) will be
      used to determine the level of the relationship between the results of the first and second
      measurements. Cronbach's alpha coefficient will be used for homogeneity of the questions in
      the scale. For concurrent validity, correlation coefficient will be used to determine the
      agreement between the previously validated scales and the Turkish version of HC PAIRS.

    <time_frame>10 minute</time_frame>
    <description>The Health Care Providers' Pain and Impairment Relationship Scale (HC-PAIRS) is a questionnaire for assessing the attitudes and beliefs of health care providers about functional expectations for CLBP patients.17 It consists of 15 statements rated on a 6-point Likert scale ranging from &quot;totally disagree&quot; to &quot;totally agree.&quot;</description>

    <measure>Turkish version of Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia</measure>
    <time_frame>10 minute</time_frame>
    <description>TSK was used for the assessment of kinesiophobia. The items are rated on a 4-point Likert-type scale (1=definitely disagree, 4=completely agree) and the total score is between 17 and 68 points. Higher total score indicates higher level of kinesiophobia.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain Attitudes and Beliefs Scale for Physiotherapists (PABS-PT)</measure>
    <time_frame>10 minute.</time_frame>
    <description>This tool was developed to distinguish between biomedical and biopsychosocial orientations toward the treatment of low back pain in physiotherapists. The scale uses a 6-point Likert-type scale (1=definitely disagree, 6=definitely agree). Treatment orientation is measured on the biomedical (factor 1) and biopsychosocial (factor 2) subscales. Subscale scores are calculated by simply adding the scores corresponding to the selected response for each item. The subscale with the highest score indicates the respondent's dominant treatment orientation</description>
