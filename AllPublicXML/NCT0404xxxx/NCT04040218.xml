    <textblock>
      Two surveys were completed to identify the reported harms by physical therapists in the
      provision of dry needling in Colorado, and by patients who received dry needling from
      physical therapists in Colorado in April 2017. Retrospective analysis of the data
      (de-identified) was completed to provide a representative reporting on harms associated with
      the dry needling provided and received for patients.

    <intervention_model_description>The target population for this study was a representative sample of PT providers that administer and patients that receive dry needling as a treatment modality in the state of Colorado. 440 PT's licensed in Colorado and 2167 patients were recruited for this study. Purposive sampling was implemented through convenience sampling methods; by which PT respondents were included through their association to APTA CO or Kinetacore@ (an education provider in DN) and patients through their PT provider. The PT survey was sent out to APTA CO members and via a Kinetacore email list; which included approximately 900 individuals trained by Kinetacore in CO. All respondents to the PT survey were requested to provide patients with a direct link to the patient survey. Invitation was promoted by APTA CO outside of their member portal to non-members and word of mouth was encouraged.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Dry needling is utilized by multiple practitioners to address impairments in neuromusculoskeletal function, often related to pain and loss of mobility. Dry needling, according the American Physical Therapy Association (APTA), is defined as a skilled intervention that uses a thin filiform needle to penetrate the skin and stimulate underlying myofascial trigger points, muscular, and connective tissues for the management of neuromusculoskeletal pain and movement impairments</description>
