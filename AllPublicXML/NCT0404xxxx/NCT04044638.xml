      Introduction: Strength training (ST) is an important non-pharmacological means to reduce
      blood pressure (BP). Objective: To verify the pressure response of women after 8 weeks of ST.
      Method: Fourteen women were divided into young group (YG) and middle age (MAG) and submitted
      to ST for 8 weeks, lasting 60 minutes in 11 alternating exercises per segment with intensity
      of 12 to 13 on the subjective perception scale of effort. BP was verified at weeks 1, 4 and
      8.

      The sample consisted of 14 women, which were divided into two groups: young group (YG = 7)
      and middle age group (MAG = 7). Inclusion criteria were: females aged 18 to 59 years,
      sedentary or who had not been engaged in any physical activity in the last 6 months, and the
      availability of time three times a week in the afternoon shift. Exclusion criteria were:
      morbid obesity (BMI&gt; 40 kg.m-2), presenting any osteo-articular dysfunction.

      After the adaptation period, resistance exercise sessions were started, which were performed
      3 times a week on alternate days, in which each session lasted 60 minutes, and performed for
      a period of 8 weeks. Each session consisted of 10-minute warm-up on the treadmill or bicycle,
      shortly after, starting the exercises in the form of alternating circuit by segment, as:
      machine bench press, extension chair, high pull (front), flexor table, direct curl, leg
      press, triceps pulley, adductor, abdominal, abductor and calf. In all 10 exercises, 3 sets of
      8 to 12 repetitions were performed, with an interval of 60 seconds between sets and intensity
      of 12 arbitrary units (a.u.) to 14 a.u., measured by the rate perception effort scale. In the
      first, fourth and eighth week, pre-exercise blood pressure (BP) was verified, in which the
      participants sat for a period of 10 minutes at rest, in a comfortable chair, with legs
      uncrossed, feet flat on the floor, back leaning on the chair, left arm at heart level and
      palm up1 to measure BP using a G * Tech-branded automatic digital device (MASTER MA100
      model).
