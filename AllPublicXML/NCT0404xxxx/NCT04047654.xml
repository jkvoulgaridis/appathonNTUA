  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A retrospective cohort study of Thai octogenarians with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation
      (NVAF) initiating apixaban, dabigatran, rivaroxaban or warfarin was conducted in medical
      school hospital in Thailand. Patients were recruited from January 1, 2013, to December 31,
      2018. The efficacy outcome was early recurrence of stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA)
      in 90 days after initiation of oral anticoagulants (OACs). The safety outcome were major
      bleeding and clinically relevant non-major bleeding complications in 180 days. Continuous
      variables were compared using independent t test and MannWhitney U test, and categorical
      variables were compared using chi-square test or Fisher's exact test. Furthermore, hazard
      ratios and P values were calculated by the use of multivariable Cox's regression analysis.

      This is a retrospective cohort study of Thai octogenarians with NVAF. Patients who were
      prescribed with apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, rivaroxaban or warfarin from January 1, 2013,
      to December 31, 2018 were recruited. The primary efficacy was recurrent ischemic stroke or
      TIA in 90 days after initiating OACs. The secondary efficacy were recurrent ischemic stroke
      or TIA in 180 days after initiating OACs. While any bleeding complications were defied as
      primary safety outcomes. Continuous variables were compared using independent t test and
      MannWhitney U test, and categorical variables were compared using chi-square test or Fisher's
      exact test.
