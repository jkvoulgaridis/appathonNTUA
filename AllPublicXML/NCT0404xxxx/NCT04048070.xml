  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) protocols have been widely applied during
      perioperative periods for different diseases, there are few reports of ERAS in patients
      undergoing endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS). This study therefore aimed to evaluate the
      benefits of ERAS protocol compared to traditional care following ESS.
