    <textblock>
      In light of experimental models showing that neuronal electrical activity is crucial for the
      remyelination process, we hypothesize that maintenance of electrical axonal activity in the
      early stages of optic neuritis may promote myelin repair, limiting thereby axonal
      degeneration.

      In humans, electrical stimulation of the optic nerve has been tested mainly in ischemic
      neuropathy and retinitis pigmentosa, which are both associated with severe axonal/retinal
      pathology and poor visual prognosis. In contrast, the inflammation of the optic nerve in
      optic neuritis is generally transient, with less severe axonal damage at the acute phase,
      which would allow for better efficacy of electrical stimulation as a strategy to promote
      remyelination and neuroprotection.In light of experimental models showing that neuronal

      This is a randomized, controlled, prospective, interventional, blinded trial which aims to
      evaluate the safety and efficacy of transorbital electrical nerve stimulation on
      remyelination and neuroprotection after an acute episode of retrobulbar optic neuritis in
      patients with multiple sclerosis (MS).

      Expected Explorations: The study is composed of 14 visits: a screening/inclusion visit with
      neurological and ophthalmological evaluation, electrophysiology, MRI and
      Magnetoencephalography (MEG), 10 transorbital electrical stimulation or sham stimulation
      visits and finally 3 follow-up visits and evaluations (neurological and ophthalmological).
      Patient's participation will last 49 weeks (inclusion visit and 48 weeks of follow-up).
      Participation of healthy volunteers will last one day.

      MS patients diagnosed with an optic neuritis will be randomized either in the active arm
      (transorbital electrical stimulation of the optic nerve - 10 sessions during 2 consecutive
      weeks) or in the placebo arm (sham stimulation - 10 sessions during 2 consecutive weeks)
      Expected benefits: Electrical stimulation of the optic nerve after an acute episode of
      retrobulbar optic neuritis may promote remyelination in the optic nerve and a better
      long-term visual outcome.

The persons in charge of the stimulation will be in &quot;open label&quot; and will ensure the inclusion, the follow-up of the patient throughout the study, the stimulation (SHAM or stimulation), the clinical and neurological examination as well as the collection of the treatments and the notification of the Adverse Events/Serious Adverse Events (AE/SAE).</masking_description>

Stimulation phase: From these 2 parameters (amplitude and frequency), the stimulation session will begin for a duration of approximately 40 to 50 minutes, the settings being dependent of the individual thresholds.</description>
