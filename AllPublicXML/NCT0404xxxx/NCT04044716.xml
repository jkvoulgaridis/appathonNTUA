  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of pilot study is to test the feasibility of nurse initiated post-operative
      bilateral auricular acupressure as an adjunct to medication for post-operative pain
      management.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative pain management has become an area of concern over the last decade due to the
      opioid epidemic and concerns related to their use as the primary pain management strategy.
      Joint Commission requires that hospitals have additional pain non-pharmacologic pain
      management tools at their disposal to an effort decrease the reliance on opioids. Acupuncture
      and acupressure have been used for centuries in the management of a variety of disorders
      including pain. Unlike acupuncture, acupressure can be easily applied with limited training
      and is within the scope of practice for nurses, according to the North Carolina Board of
      Nursing. Thus evidence based non-pharmacologic strategies that can be deployed by nursing are
      of benefit to hospital organizations.

    <description>Trained nurses in auricular acupressure will place acupressure beads on 5 acupoints on each ear (cingulate gyrus, thalamus, omega-2, point zero, and Shen Men). The nurse will do the initial activation of the acupressure site by applying pressure for 30 seconds to each point until the participant reports tingling or moderate degree of pressure. Participant will be given instructions to do this three times a day for a total of 5 days. Acupoints were selected based on recommendation of faculty acupuncturist.</description>
