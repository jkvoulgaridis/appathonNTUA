    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the Pharmacokinetics, Safety and
      Tolerability of L606 (Liposomal Treprostinil) Inhalation Solution in Single Ascending Dose
      study design in healthy volunteers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      L606 (Liposomal Treprostinil) Inhalation Solution and dedicated inhalation system is
      developed by Pharmosa Biopharm Inc. intended to improve the inconvenience, as one of the
      greatest impediments to patient satisfaction to current inhaled treprostinil therapy.
      Pharmosa's liposomal technology offers sustained release of treprostinil which enable bid
      treatment instead of conventional qid treatment offered by current inhaled treprostinil
      therapy for treatment of patients with PAH (WHO Group 1).
