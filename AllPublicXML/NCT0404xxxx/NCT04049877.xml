  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is limited empirical data documenting disease progression and impact on quality of life
      for patients with X-linked hypophosphatemia (XLH). This study seeks to investigate the impact
      of XLH in adults living in the UK retrospectively and prospectively over a 12 month period,
      using qualitative interviews, SEIQoL-DW, EQ-5D-5L, SF36 quality of life tools.

      XLH is a rare, genetic, chronically debilitating and deforming condition
      (www.nice.org.uk/guidance/HST8). XLH is characterised by renal phosphate wasting,
      hypophosphatemia and defective bone mineralisation. The incidence of XLH is reported to be
      between 1:20,000 and 1:25,000 live births. In the UK, it is estimated that there are around
      250 paediatric XLH patients and around 2,500 adult XLH patients (Delmestri,et al [Unpublished
      report]2018). The clinical phenotype of XLH is varied amongst patients, even among affected
      members of the same family. This can range from no signs or symptoms, slow growth in
      children, short stature, bone abnormalities that can affect movement and result in pain,
      bowed legs and knocked knees (where lower legs are positioned at an outward angle), tooth
      abscesses and excessive dental caries and hearing loss (adult patients only).

      This study will recruit 36 adults living with XLH, who are aged 28 years or over and living
      in the UK. The study will be advertised by the Sponsor and funder Medialis Ltd and via the
      patient organisation Metabolic Support UK. All study activities will take place via
      tele-visits and online questionnaires. The study will last approximately 2 years, allowing
      for one-year recruitment and a further 12 months to conduct all study visits.
