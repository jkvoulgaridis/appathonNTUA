  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aim to investigate the roles of the test article in improving gastrointestinal
      functions and gut microbiota of humans. A total 40 healthy adults were recruited and randomly
      divided into experimental and control groups, with 20 subjects each, for a 4-week trial. The
      subjects took the test article, &quot;Super 13 Pro &amp; Prebiotics&quot; or the control article, &quot;The
      placebo without Super 13 Pro &amp; Prebiotics&quot; during the 4-week drug-intake period. Fecal
      specimens were collected at the 0th, 2nd, and 4th weeks of the trial for analyzing the
      bacterial counts of Bifidobacterium spp., Clostridium perfringens, Lactobacillus spp., and
      Coliform.
