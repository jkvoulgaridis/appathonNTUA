  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I, single-center, non-randomized, 3+3 dose-escalation study of alpha lipoic
      acid given during chemotherapy-radiation in HNSCC patients with non-metastatic disease.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be completed when the MTD and RP2D are determined. This will be either when 2
      or more patients have a DLT at a particular dose level, or when 6 patients have completed
      treatment at the highest dose level (600 mg TID). The final 3 patients enrolled at the
      highest tolerated dose will also complete PK studies.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>MTD and RP2D of ALA during chemoradiotherapy for HNSCC patients</measure>
    <time_frame>18 months</time_frame>
    <description>The maximum tolerated dose will be the highest dose in the planned schema that is given without evidence of SAEs.
The RP2D will incorporate the MTD and PKs to determine the dose that is best tolerated as well as has the concentration necessary to be effective according to historical studies.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Safety of ALA by following adverse events (AEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 18 months</time_frame>
    <description>Adverse events will be documented to determine the primary endpoints as well as to categorize potential side effects that can be attributed to ALA. CTCAE version 5.0 will be used to categorize the AEs</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Maximum plasma concentration of ALA at the MTD with chemoradiotherapy</measure>
    <time_frame>At start of ALA, Day 1, and Day 15, for 3 dose expansion PK patients</time_frame>
    <description>Maximum plasma concentration will be evaluated on the 3 patients in the dose expansion group at the MTD. This will be studied when given with cisplatin for standardization to ensure concentration is similar to when ALA is given alone.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Oral Mucositis Assessment Scale (OMAS) from baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>From start of treatment to post-treatment surveillance scans, up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>OMAS scores will give preliminary measures on efficacy of drug to control pain and improve quality of life which will be the primary focus in future studies. Total scores will be collected from 0 (no mucositis) to 45 (worse mucositis). Average OMAS and change from baseline to worst score will be evaluated.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Visual Assessment Score (VAS) for pain from baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>From start of treatment to post-treatment surveillance scans, up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>VAS for pain will give preliminary measures on efficacy of drug to control pain which will be the primary focus in future studies. The VAS score is from 0-10 with 0 being no pain and 10 being the worse possible pain. Average VAS and change from baseline to worst score will be evaluated.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in quality of life measures using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Head &amp; Neck (FACT-HN) during chemoradiation</measure>
    <time_frame>From start of treatment to post-treatment surveillance scans, up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Head &amp; Neck (FACT-HN) will be used to evaluate quality of life measures at baseline and during treatment. This scale has the sub-categories of physical well being, social/family well-being, emotional well-being, functional well-being, and additional concerns. Each question is scaled from 0 (worst) to 4 (best). Each sub-category will be totaled and a total FACT-HN score will be calculated for each time point. Average sub-category and total scores will be calculated as well as change from baseline to worst scores during treatment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Total concurrent opioid use using patient reported diaries</measure>
    <time_frame>From start of treatment to post-treatment surveillance scans, up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Patients will document every dose of opioid medications taken during the study period. This will be used to used to calculated total opioid amounts taken (as oxycodone equivalents) as well as total duration of opioid use in days.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression free survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Screening, 3 and 6 month follow up visits</time_frame>
    <description>Progression free survival will be calculated as time to disease progression from start of treatment measured in weeks. This will be documented by PET/CT and/or CT neck and chest completed prior to start of treatment and approximately 3 and 6 months after treatment discontinuation</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall survival (OS)</measure>
    <time_frame>From start of treatment up to 18 months</time_frame>
    <description>OS will be calculated as time from start of treatment to death as measured in weeks. This will be documented by survival follow-up during study visits</description>

    <description>Stage II-IVB HNSCC patients receiving concurrent systemic therapy and radiation as standard of care will receive ALA before, during, and after treatment. The drug will have dose escalation in a 3+3 design. The first group of 3 patients will receive 600 mg twice a day. If there are no DLTs, the next 3 patients will receive the highest dose of 600 mg three times a day. If one or more patients develop a DLT at any of the dosing levels, the group will either be expanded or dropped to a lower dose level.</description>

    <description>Stage II-IVB HNSCC patients receiving concurrent systemic therapy and radiation in the definitive, adjuvant, or palliative setting will receive ALA according to their prescribed dose level. ALA will be taken orally or per feeding tube. It will start 1 week prior to the start of CRT, continue on through CRT, and then continue for 2 weeks after the completion of CRT. Patients will be given dosing diaries to document date and time of each drug administration as well as any missed doses. They will also have weekly visits to report AEs and concurrent medications, have a history and physical exam, report VAS pain scores and OMAS scores, and fill FACT-HN surveys.</description>
