  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      XNW3009 is a small molecule hURAT1 inhibitor developed independently by Sinovent Pty Ltd.,
      and is intended to treat gout-related hyperuricemia.

      Uricosuric drugs increase urinary uric acid excretion by blocking renal tubular reabsorption
      of urate. The human urate transporter 1( hURAT1) is responsible for the majority of the
      reabsorption of filtered urate, and the mutations in the hURAT1 gene have been demonstrated
      to be responsible for urate non-homeostasis.

      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation study to investigate
      the safety, tolerability, PK and PD of XNW3009 after administration of single (Part A) and
      multiple (Part B) oral doses in healthy adult subjects. Approximately six sequential dose
      panels (single oral doses of 1, 5, 10, 20, 35 and 50 mg XNW3009) will be evaluated in SAD and
      approximately three sequential dose panels (ten consecutive days for respectively daily oral
      doses of 10, 20,35 mg, QD) will be evaluated in MAD.
