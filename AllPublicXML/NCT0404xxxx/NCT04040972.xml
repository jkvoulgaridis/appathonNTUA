    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the use of group Compassion Focussed Therapy in a population with
      various and/or multiple long term health conditions. A multiple baseline, single case
      experimental design will be used with a view to evaluate changes in psychological adjustment
      and compassion. Daily data and weekly questionnaire batteries will be collected across a
      baseline period and ten weeks of group intervention. Participants will be those already
      referred to the group by a clinician as part of their routine care.
