  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adolescence is characterized by major transitions in sleep and circadian rhythm. This rapid
      pivotal period increases the risks of sleep debt and poor sleep quality, leading to
      pronounced diurnal fatigue and drowsiness . Some adolescent's populations are more vulnerable
      than others to poor sleep. Obesity and elite sports involvement are two factors that have
      been distinctly associated with disturbed sleep. Several studies show that obesity was
      associated with a decrease in sleep efficiency and increased arousals . On the other hand,
      recent studies point out that sleep problem is widespread in young athletes which
      substantially increase the risks of injury, burnout and concussions .

      Despite the importance of sleep in holistic development, physical (i.e. recovery, metabolism,
      muscle growth, weight control), cognitive (i.e. learning, memory, decision-making, Vigilance)
      and athletic performances (Fullagar et al., 2015).

      A wide range of recent papers emphasize that some nutrients take part in the regulation of
      internal clock and sleep quality. The effect of tryptophan (Trp) on sleep was lifted on the
      basis of the serotonergic hypothesis. Serotonin (5-HT) is synthesized from Trp circulating in
      the brain following two-step procedure in raphe neurons. Serotonin, in turn, is a precursor
      of melatonin and both molecules contribute to the regulation of sleep-wake behaviors.
      However, Trp is an essential amino acid, which means that it cannot be synthesized by the
      organism, and must exclusively be provided via degradation of proteins from the diet. The
      passage of tryptophan to the brain is assured through carrier disposed at the blood-brain
      barrier level. However, carrier transport depends on other competitive amino acids (LNAAs:
      leucine, isoleucine, valine, phenylalanine, and tyrosine). Therefore, increased brain uptake
      of tryptophan does not depend only on Trp concentrations but rather on the blood Trp / LNAA
      ratio.

      PROTMORPHEUS trial, was designed to examine how supplementation with proteins of different
      Trp/LNAA ratio affect sleep on adolescents (obese, athletes) with mild sleep disturbances.

      Double-blind controlled pre-post trial where each subject acts as his own control.

      Three measurement sessions will be performed for each teenager. Each session will be
      conducted over a week. Each teenager will participate in three protein enrichment sessions:
      PROT1 session, PROT2 session, and Tryptophan ratio (Trp) / neutral amino acids (AAN)
      reference session (PROT REF) (PROT1: ratio = 0.07, PROT2 session: ratio = 0.11 and PROT REF
      session: ratio = 0.04). During these sessions the protein intake will be doubled with regard
      to recommended dietary intakes through the consumption of protein shakes (from 0.8 g per kg
      of body weight to 1.6 g per kg).

      At each session:

        -  2 EEG sleep assessments

        -  2 evaluations of the biological profile from fasting blood samples

        -  2 evaluations of melatonin peak from salivary specimens

        -  1 assessment of physical activity and sedentary lifestyle

        -  1 evaluation of the metabolic response to submaximal exercise

        -  1 assessment of muscle strength and fatigue

        -  1 assessment of cognitive performance Control of food intake (3 days at RDI + 3 days
           with doubled protein intake) will be achieved by preparing meals and weighing food. An
           evaluation of the ad libitum food intake of the 7th day will be carried out by the
           weighing method.

    <description>Resting metabolic rate. Resting metabolic rate (RMR) will be measured under fasted state, using indirect calorimetry (MetaMax 3b, Cortex Biophysik, Leipzig, Germany). In agreement with the manufacturer's recommendations gas analysis will be calibrated before the test. The test will be held in a thermoneutral environment (22-25 °C). Participants will extend in a supine position for 45 min before starting the measurements. After achieving a steady state, O2 consumption and CO2 production standardized for temperature, barometric pressure and humidity will be recorded at 1 min intervals for 20-45 min and will be averaged over the whole measurement period. After that, RMR (in kcal/day) and respiratory quotient (ratio of CO2/O2) will be calculated.</description>

In order to limit inter-individual differences, the diet of the first 3 days will be fixed to the RDA followed by 3 days where dietary intake will be supplemented with different protein (PROT REF : ratio = 0,04 PROT1 : ratio = 0,07, session PROT2 : ratio = 0,11). Tryptophan (Trp) / Large neutral amino acids (Lnaa) ratio of proteins taken varies-double-blind between sessions. All proteins had the same dose and packages.
