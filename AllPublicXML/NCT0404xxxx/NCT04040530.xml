    <textblock>
      The present study is an observational study designed to assess and compare clinical outcome
      and quality of life after nephron sparing treatment of small renal tumors.

      Partial nephrectomy, where the tumor is being be surgically removed, has traditionally been
      the preferred nephron sparing treatment for small renal cell carcinomas (RCC). Cryoablation
      was introduced 20 years ago as a treatment option for patients with RCC with a high surgical
      risk. Previously, this group of patients had no available treatment. Cryoablation is a
      minimally invasive treatment that uses extreme cold to destroy the cancer. In recent years,
      indications for cryoablation of RCC has extended. Cryoablation is now offered as a curative
      treatment, also including patients without severe comorbidity.

      Retrospective studies imply that patients with RCC have lower quality of life compared to
      other cancers and that choice of treatment and remaining healthy renal tissue have a
      correlation with quality of life. Knowledge about the patient perspective is crucial in
      relation to delivering the highest quality of care in the healthcare system. Exploring
      quality of life through patient reported outcome is one way of exploring the patient
      perspective.

      In this prospective study the investigators aim to assess clinical outcome and quality of
      life after partial nephrectomy and cryoablation. Results are expected to generate
      evidence-based knowledge essential in treatment decisions for RCC globally.

      The overall aim of this prospective study is to assess and compare clinical outcome and
      health related quality of life after partial nephrectomy and cryoablation of renal tumors at
      stadium T1 in adult patients. The specific objectives is:

        -  To describe treatment characteristics (treatment type, knife time, type of anaesthesia)
           with i) cryoablation and ii) partial nephrectomy on patients with T1 renal tumors in the
           Regions of Southern Denmark and Zealand.

        -  To describe self-reported health related quality of life in adult patients with T1 renal
           tumors undergoing i) cryoablation and ii) partial nephrectomy in the Regions of Southern
           Denmark and Zealand.

        -  To compare patient and tumor characteristics (age, sex, BMI, performance status,
           American Society of Anaesthesiologists' (ASA) classification group, comorbidity, other
           cancer diagnosis, smoking and alcohol use, tumor location and size, and tumor histology)
           in patients with T1 renal tumors treated with i) Cryoablation or ii) partial nephrectomy
           in the Regions of Southern Denmark and Zealand.

        -  To compare complications, length of hospital stay, treatment success within follow-up,
           readmission rate and in-hospital mortality after after i) cryoablation and ii) partial
           nephrectomy of renal tumors at stadium T1 in adult patients in the Regions of Southern
           Denmark and Zealand.

        -  To compare self reported quality of life after i) cryoablation and ii) partial
           nephrectomy of renal tumors at stadium T1 in adult patients in the Regions of Southern
           Denmark and Zealand.

        -  To identify potential patient or tumor characteristics reducing quality of life after i)
           cryoablation and ii) partial nephrectomy of renal tumors at stadium T1 in adult patients
           in the Regions of Southern Denmark and Zealand.

      All eligible patients will be offered inclusion. Patients will be allocated to treatment
      group based on shared decision making between the patient and the treating urologist and
      recommendation from a multidisciplinary team conference. This reflecting the clinical
      practice.

        Patients are recruited from the Department of Urology at Odense University Hospital and
        Zealand University Hospital based in The Region of Southern Denmark and Region Zealand
        respectively. Odense University Hospital and Zealand University Hospital are the only
        centers offering nephron sparing treatment for renal cell carcinomas within the two
        regions.

        The Region of Southern Denmark and Region Zealand are two out of the five regions in
        Denmark. They have a population of about 2 million people combined. The population of the
        regions are considered demographic comparable.
