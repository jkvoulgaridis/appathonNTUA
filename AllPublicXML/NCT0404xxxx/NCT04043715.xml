  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Incomplete spinal cord injuries (SCI) are the most frequent neurologic category, comprising
      66.7% of all SCI cases. People with incomplete SCI may retain some ability to move the legs
      and therefore the capacity to regain walking. Studies that show functional improvement in
      locomotion via electrical stimulation of lumbosacral circuits suggest that the underlying
      mechanisms are neuromodulation of lumbosacral spinal cord automaticity and sensory feedback.

      Both epidural and transcutaneous spinal stimulation are demonstrating exciting potential to
      improve limb function for people after chronic SCI. Available treatment options for SCI are
      less than satisfactory and most often do not achieve full restoration of function. Recent
      experimental results suggest an exciting new approach of using electrical spinal stimulation
      to enable users to regain control of their weak or paralyzed muscles. Using
      surgically-implanted electrodes, epidural stimulation results in remarkable improvements of
      lower extremity function as well as autonomic functions such as bladder function and sexual
      function.

      In addition to epidural stimulation, over only the last few years a novel strategy of skin
      surface electrical spinal stimulation has also demonstrated exciting potential for improving
      walking function. Using a high-frequency stimulation pulse, current can pass through the skin
      without discomfort and activate the spinal cord; this results in patterned stepping movements
      for people without SCI and improved lower extremity function following SCI. This study will
      directly compare skin-surface transcutaneous stimulation with implanted epidural stimulation
      for improving lower extremity function.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the optimal method for delivering spinal
      stimulation to improve walking in people with incomplete spinal cord injury. By directly
      comparing non-invasive transcutaneous (TransQ) stimulation with implanted epidural
      stimulation, investigators hope to guide the field toward the most beneficial method for
      restoration of lower extremity function. In addition, the investigators may identify
      subgroups of people that respond better to each type of stimulation, informing personalized
      treatment for people with different types of spinal cord injury. The research team will
      explore the following specific aims:

      Aim 1: Evaluate the improvements in lower extremity and autonomic function via transcutaneous
      spinal stimulation and intensive physical therapy for people with chronic SCI.

      Aim 2: Quantify additional improvements in lower extremity and autonomic function via
      epidural spinal stimulation and intensive physical therapy for people with chronic SCI.

      The investigators will test the hypothesis that epidural stimulation leads to greater
      improvements than an equal dose of transcutaneous stimulation. To compare these 2 stimulation
      methods the study team will evaluate voluntary control of muscle activity via EMG and
      kinematic parameters of locomotion, as well as improvements in bladder and other autonomic
      functions and overall quality of life.
