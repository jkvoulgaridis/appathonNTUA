  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase Ib, open-label, dose-escalation and expansion study to evaluate the safety,
      tolerability, pharmacokinetics and anti-tumor activity of KN026 combined with KN046 in
      subjects with advanced HER2 positive solid tumors.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is composed of 2 stages. Stage 1 consists of dose escalation cohorts for
      determining the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D). Part 2
      consists of 4 tumor type expansion cohorts for expanding the information on clinical safety,
      clinical pharmacokinetics and antitumor activity in HER2 positive patients.

    <description>KN026 is an anti-HER2 bispecific antibody that can simultaneously bind two non-overlapping epitopes of HER2, leading to a dual HER2 signal blockade.
KN046 is a PD-L1 - CTLA-4 bispecific antibody.</description>
