  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Septic patients with acute kidney injury (SA-AKI) requiring continuous renal replacement
      therapies (CRRT) present high mortality due to systemic inflammatory response, cytokine
      liberation, and finally multiorgan dysfunction. Cytokine plasmatic elimination with
      continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH) presents a high resource cost both technical and
      human. The study primary end-point is to demonstrate a similar cytokine removal of continuous
      venovenous hemodialysis (CVVHD) respect to CVVH, both modalities employing the same
      adsorption capacity membrane. As secondary end-points investigators will try to demonstrate
      technical superiority of CVVHD respect to CVVH. In order to achieve these objectives
      investigators have designed a proof of concept exploratory trial that will include those
      participants whom present SA-AKI meeting CRRT initiation criteria. During the first 72 hours
      investigators will measure plasmatic elimination capacity of main cytokines, and other
      clinical and prognostic relevant molecules. Investigators wil measure mean filter life during
      all CRRT with special attention to the first 72 hours. Investigators will also measure
      hemodynamic, respiratory, and metabolic parameters. Finally, investigators will analyze 90
      days survival. Demonstration of a similar immunomodulating capacity and a minor complication
      rate with its consequent lower cost, should settle the based evidence principles that
      recommend the use of CVVHD associated to an adsorption capacity membrane in patients with
      SA-AKI whom need CRRT.

      Investigators will warrant a correct protocol application. Study data will be reviewed by an
      external monitoring committee from the clinical assay research central unit (UCICEC -
      IDIBELL). Monitors will contrast registered data from the collection data form (CDF) with
      data from patient´s medical record. All patient´s medical records will be indefinitely saved
      in electronical format to be reviewed if necessary. Participants who meet inclusion criteria
      will be randomized for one of both arms with aleatory assignation using a randomisation
      sequential (RndSeq) program for Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS).
      Investigators will report adverse events (in less than 24 hours if severe) to the sponsor
      center to be properly evaluated. If the severe adverse event (SAE) is finally evaluated by
      the study board as related to the intervention arm, urgent notification to health authorities
      must proceed and study should be interrupted until further decision. Data registry has been
      created to include all variables with written individual data collection forms (DCF). Data
      will be bedside registered by the investigators but final software database registration will
      be done by the statistics outside investigator who has no contact with the participant
      situation. Cytokines levels will be introduced in DCF when measured (every six months).
      Statistical analysis will be done by the statistics investigator who wont have any role in
      patient´s selection, randomization, or follow up. SPSS v. 18.0 for statistical analysis will
      be used. Variable distribution will be studied and logarithmic transformation will be used on
      those variables that don't present normal distribution, presumably cytokine levels.
      Univariate analysis comparing clinical, demographic, biochemical, metabolic, hemodynamic and
      respiratory baseline variables between both arms (CVVHD and CVVH), will be done with
      two-tailed t test for continuous variables and chi-square test for categorical variables.
      Variables determined several times (T0, T24, T48, T72) will be analysed using a one-way
      repeated measures ANOVA test in order to demonstrate differences between both arms.
      Multivariate analysis will be completed to control those clinically relevant confounding
      variables as well as to discover baseline differences. According to hypothesis and to the
      dependent variable on study, investigators will use a survival analysis (to study mortality)
      with a cox regression model, or a hierarchic multiple linear regression model when the
      dependent variable is continuous. Arm intervention (CVVHD, CVVH) will be considered as the
      main independent variable adding other control independent variables. As the study is
      measuring cytokine levels in five different moments (T0, T24, T48, T72), in order to maximize
      statistical power and reduce control variables number, the area under the curve (AUC) we´ll
      be determined for every cytokine during the first 72 hours. Due to this statistical maneuver,
      investigators will obtain a continuous variable that represents each cytokine level during
      the biochemical study period (72 hours). To evaluate if the arm intervention improvement in
      terms of efficacy and safety could be related to cytokine levels during the first 72 hours, a
      mediation complementary analysis will be done considering cytokine (represented by AUC) as a
      mediator between the independent variable (intervention arm) and the evaluated effect.
