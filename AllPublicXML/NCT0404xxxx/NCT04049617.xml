  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objectives of this study are to characterize the safety and tolerability of
      GS-4224 and to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D)
      of GS-4224 in participants with advanced solid tumors.

    <description>Dose Escalation (Phase 1b):
Participants will be sequentially enrolled in a dose escalation design to receive GS-4224 starting at 400 mg. Subsequent doses of 700 mg and 1000 mg are planned based on safety and tolerability of each dose level.
Dose Expansion (Phase 2):
Dose expansion will begin when the RP2D has been determined.</description>

        Key Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Dose Escalation Cohorts: Histologically or cytologically confirmed advanced malignant
             solid tumor that is refractory to or intolerant of all standard therapy or for which
             no standard therapy is available.

          -  Dose Expansion Cohort: Individuals must have available sufficient and adequate
             formalin fixed tumor sample preferably from a biopsy of a tumor lesion obtained either
             at the time of or after the diagnosis of advanced disease has been made and from a
             site not previously irradiated. Alternatively, individuals must agree to have a biopsy
             taken prior to entering the study to provide adequate tissue.

          -  Dose Escalation Biopsy Substudy: Documented ligand 1 of programmed cell death protein
             1 (PD-L1) expression in the tumor (tumor proportion score (TPS) &gt; 10% or combined
             positive score (CPS) &gt; 10).

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status of ≤ 2.

          -  Adequate organ function.

        Key Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History or evidence of clinically significant disorder, condition, or disease that, in
             the opinion of the Investigator or Medical Monitor would pose a risk to individual
             safety or interfere with the study evaluations, procedures, or completion.

          -  Dose Escalation Cohorts: History of ≥ Grade 3 Adverse Events (AEs) during prior
             treatment with an immune checkpoint inhibitor, or history of discontinuation of
             treatment with an immune checkpoint inhibitor due to AEs.

          -  Dose Expansion Cohort: Prior treatment with an immune checkpoint inhibitor (anti-PD-1,
             anti-PD-L1, or anti- ligand 2 of programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-L2) antibodies).

          -  History of autoimmune disease (for example, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid
             arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, vascular thrombosis associated with
             antiphospholipid syndrome, Wegener's granulomatosis, Sjögren's syndrome, Bell's palsy,
             Guillain-Barré syndrome, multiple sclerosis, autoimmune thyroid disease, vasculitis,
             or glomerulonephritis).
