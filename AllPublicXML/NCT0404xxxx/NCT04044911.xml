  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Apraxia and action disorganization syndrome after stroke can disrupt activities of daily
      living (ADL). Occupational therapy has been effective in improving ADL performance, however,
      inclusion of multiple tasks means it is unclear which therapy elements contribute to
      improvement. This study evaluates the efficacy of a task model approach to ADL
      rehabilitation, comparing training in making a cup of tea with a gait training control
      condition.

      Apraxia and action disorganization syndrome (AADS) after stroke can disrupt activities of
      daily living (ADLs). Occupational therapy has been effective in improving ADL performance,
      however, inclusion of multiple tasks means it is unclear which therapy elements contribute to
      improvement.

      This trial evaluates the efficacy of a task model approach to ADL rehabilitation, comparing
      training in making a cup of tea with a stepping training control condition.

      Stroke survivors with AADS participate in a cross-over randomized controlled study.
      Participants attend five 1-hour tea making training sessions in which progress is monitored
      and feedback given using a computer-based system which implements a Markov Decision Process
      (MDP) task model (CogWatch). In a control condition participants receive five 1-hour stepping
      sessions.

      Analysis compares tea making training with stepping training effects on error reduction and
      time taken in making 4 different tea types. A complex tea preparation task (making two
      different cups of tea simultaneously) is used to test for generalisation of training effects.

    <description>In three assessment sessions (initial, post-phase 1 training, post-phase 2 training), participants are seated at a table with objects and ingredients required for making a cup of tea placed in standard positions. Participants are instructed to make 8 cups of tea, one at a time, comprising two of each of the following; black tea, black tea with sugar, tea with milk and tea with milk and sugar. Each trial is recorded with a video camera.
Videos of the participants making simple tea are analysed by a researcher blinded to the session definition. The summed errors across the 8 tea making trials at each assessment are used to provide a measure of accuracy for each participant.
Change in tea making accuracy pre- and post-training of tea making is contrasted with change in tea making accuracy pre- and post-training of stepping.</description>

    <description>In three assessment sessions (initial, post-phase 1 training, post-phase 2 training), participants are seated at a table with objects and ingredients required for making two cups of tea placed in standard positions. Participants are instructed to make 4 cups of tea, two at a time, comprising one cup with tea, lemon and 1 sugar cube and the other with tea, milk and 2 sweeteners. Each trial is recorded with a video camera.
Videos of the participants making complex tea are analysed by a researcher blinded to the session definition. The summed errors across the 4 tea making trials at each assessment are used to provide a measure of accuracy for each participant.
