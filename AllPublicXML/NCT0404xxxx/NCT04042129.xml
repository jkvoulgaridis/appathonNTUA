      OBJECTIVE: In the study, investigators aimed to evaluate the urological complications of
      gynecologic operations in a tertiary academic center and to evaluate the treatment methods of
      these complications.

      METHODS: The files of all patients who underwent gynecological surgery between January 2016
      and January 2019 were retrospectively reviewed. The age of patients with urological
      complications, American Anesthesia Society score, menopausal status, body mass index (BMI),
      preoperative hemoglobin level, postoperative hemoglobin level and hospitalization duration
      and number of previous surgeries were recorded. In addition, the patients with urological
      complications were evaluated in terms of the indications for surgery, type of surgery, type
      of urological complication and the way of treatment of the complication.

      In women, the anatomical localization of urinary and genital tracts is very close to each
      other. This proximity can lead to injuries during pelvic operations. Advances in gynecologic
      operation techniques and the growing experience of gynecologists may suggest a decrease in
      urological injuries. However, according to the literature, gynecologists face approximately
      0.2% to 1% urinary tract injuries during pelvic surgeries. The increase in the number of
      recurrent surgeries and adverse situations encountered during the operations such as
      adhesions and anatomical variations factor into the persistence of urologic complications.
      Investigators aimed to evaluate the urological complications of gynecologic operations in a
      tertiary academic center and to evaluate the treatment methods of these complications.

        gynecologic operations with urologic complications Patients' previous medical records,
        detailed physical examination findings, age, menopausal status, American Society of
        Anesthesiologists Classification (ASA) scores, and body mass indexes (BMI) were noted.
        Also, preoperative hemoglobin levels, postoperative hemoglobin levels, and hospitalization
        durations were recorded. In addition, indications for gynecologic surgery, sites of injury
        and management modalities of injury were recorded
