  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Young-onset dementia (YOD) is a devastating condition, and it produces substantial
      psychosocial impacts on individual's functioning and family's care burden. Alzheimer's
      disease (AD) dementia is the most common type in YOD. Medication treatment Response was
      limited and unsatisfactory. In recent years, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation
      (rTMS) has been considered an alternative for the improvement of cognition in older patients
      with cognitive impairment. This study aims to examine the effects and potential mechanisms of
      theta-burst stimulation (TBS) on cognitive function in individuals with young-onset AD.

    <textblock>
      The investigators apply the National Institute on Aging—Alzheimer's Association (NIA-AA)
      criteria to recruit the biomarker-defined, young-onset AD patients with intermediate-to-high
      levels of biological evidence. This is a randomized, sham-controlled, 2-way crossover study,
      and combined neuroimaging study of 18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose fluorodeoxyglucose
      (18F-FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) to further explore the potential mechanisms.
      This study will consist of two intervention periods. A total of 50 young-onset AD patients
      will be consecutively recruited and be randomized into one of two groups: active and sham
      stimulation (n = 25 per group) in every intervention period. Besides, 20 cognitively normal
      subjects will be recruited for neuroimaging comparison. Cognitive evaluation will be
      performed before and immediately after treatment at 2 weeks of TBS intervention, and 4 weeks
      after TBS. Data on functional neuroimaging will be also collected before and after TBS
      protocol.

    <description>We will perform standard intermittent TBS (iTBS) parameters to left DLPFC of every patient in the study. The frequency parameters of TBS are 3-pulse 50-Hz bursts, every 200 ms at 5 Hz, and the intensity is 90% of active motor threshold. A single session of iTBS contains 2 s of TBS repeated every 10 s for 20 times. In this study, we will give two sessions of iTBS separated by 15 min.</description>
