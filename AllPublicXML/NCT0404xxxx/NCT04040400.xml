  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to establish a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) through a
      dose-escalation trial using intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) following neurosurgical
      resection for large brain metastases, and to determine the progression-free survival rate as
      in the recurrence rate of treated brain metastasis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The potential for delivering ablative doses of radiation to the tumor bed while
      simultaneously sparing normal brain parenchyma from significant doses of radiation and
      reducing the potential for tumor repopulation has led to interest in the use of
      intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) for brain metastasis.

    <intervention_model_description>The resection procedure should be performed with image guidance (neuronavigation) with standard surgical technique.
Optimal balloon applicator size will be selected with accordance to tumor bed/cavity geometry and adjacent normal brain parenchyma by the team of surgeons and radiation oncologists.
The radiation oncologist will place the miniature x-ray source inside the balloon shaped catheter placed inside the tumor cavity. Radiotherapy will be initiated by the treating radiation oncologist for a defined time interval calculated by the machine planning software.
After IORT has been delivered, the surgeon will remove the balloon applicator. Surgery will be continued in the regular fashion without additional requirements.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Maximum tolerated dose will be determined by classical 3+3 dose-escalation design. Toxicity will be measured using the National Cancer Institute Common terminology criteria for adverse events (version 5.0).
The first dose of 18Gy will be administered to the first 3 subjects, after 90 days from treatment a safety assessment for dose limiting toxicities will be done to determine if the next 3 subject will escalation to dose of 21Gy or receive 18Gy.
If escalation to 21Gy is permitted, then after 90 days from treatment a safety assessment for dose limiting toxicities will be done to determine if next cohort of 3 subjects will escalate to a dose of 24Gy or receive 21Gy. The highest dose level to be administered will be 24 Gy if permitted by safety assessments.</description>

    <measure>Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Brain (FACT-Br)</measure>
    <time_frame>through study completion, an average of 10 years</time_frame>
    <description>The Questionnaire Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT) is a self-reported quality of life questionnaire that includes 27 items. The brain tumor specific version, is an additional 23-item sub-scale set of disease-specific questions pertaining to brain neoplasms.
Patients rate each question using a five-point Likert scale ranging from 0 &quot;not at all&quot; to 4 &quot;very much.&quot; Item areas are: physical well-being, social/family well-being, emotional well-being, functional well-being and sub-scale item area relevant to patients with brain tumors.
Overall, higher ratings suggest higher Quality of Life score.
Items are totaled (summed) to produce the following subscales, along with an overall QOL score:
physical well-being (7 items); social/family well-being (7 items); emotional well-being (6 items); functional well-being (7 items); and concerns relevant to patients with brain tumors (23 items).</description>
