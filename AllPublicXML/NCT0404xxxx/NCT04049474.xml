    <textblock>
      This is a safety and feasibility study of bronchoscopic cryo-immunotherapy (BCI) of
      peripheral lung tumors in advanced non-small cell lung cancer for the intention of inducing
      anti-tumor immune responses. The sample size for this study will be 15 patients. Pre- and
      post- BCI peripheral blood samples will be analyzed to assess for anti-tumor immune
      responses. Post-BCI peripheral blood will be collected 7 and 14 days after the procedure.

    <description>BCI is performed by advancing a flexible cryoprobe through a bronchoscope to reach a peripheral tumor. The cryoprobe is activated to freeze a portion of the tumor. The cryoprobe is allowed to thaw to prevent removal of lung or airway tissue. The tumor must be located by radial EBUS and a guide sheath placed prior to cryoablation.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Peripheral lung tumor on pre-procedure chest CT scan, which is known or suspected to
             be advanced, inoperable non-small cell lung cancer (stages IIIA/B/C and IVA/B) based
             on the 8th edition TNM staging guidelines

          -  Pre-procedure chest CT scan with the presence of a bronchus or airway path leading
             directly to the peripheral lung tumor (also known as a &quot;bronchus sign&quot;)

          -  Undergoing bronchoscopy for diagnostic and/or palliative purpose unrelated to this
             study.

          -  Documentation of non-small cell lung cancer either prior to procedure or via on-site
             pathology review during bronchoscopy (prior to proceeding with planned BCI)

          -  Ability to provide informed consent

          -  Concomitant chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and/or radiation therapy are allowed

          -  ECOG performance status less than or equal to 2

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnancy

          -  Currently on a platelet inhibitor (such as Clopidogrel) other than aspirin or NSAIDS,
             or on a blood thinner (such as heparin, enoxaparin, or a novel oral anticoagulant),
             which is unable to be held for planned bronchoscopy

          -  INR &gt;= 1.5 (post correction)

          -  Platelets =&lt; 100,000 (post correction)

          -  Bleeding diathesis

          -  Contraindication to bronchoscopy

          -  Absence of tissue diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer either prior to procedure or
             during on-site pathology review at time of bronchoscopy.
