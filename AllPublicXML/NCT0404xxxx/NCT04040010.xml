  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Osteoporosis constitutes a major public health concern. For instance, in European Union 1 in
      3 women and at least 1 in 6 men will suffer an osteoporotic fracture during their lifespan.
      The burden of osteoporosis is estimated to raise 25% by 2025. Worldwide, by 2050, the
      incidence of osteoporotic fractures is expected to increase 240% in women and 310% in men
      compared to 1990. The aforementioned estimates might indicate the existence of some gaps
      related to current products on the market for prevention and treatment of osteoporosis.
      Actually, the use of the approved pharmacological agents for osteoporosis have been
      decreasing in European Union and worldwide. Patients are becoming increasingly reluctant to
      take medicines; even those with severe osteoporosis are refusing treatment. Recent published
      reports on the matter revealed that patients fear the side effects of current pharmacological
      agents. Actually, therapy with bisphosphonates, the most prescribed medication for the
      treatment of postmenopausal, glucocorticoid-induced and male osteoporosis has been associated
      with severe side effects as osteonecrosis of the jaw and atypical femoral fractures.

      Colostrum, a milky substance produced by mammals, known to be responsible for the development
      of the immune and skeleton systems of the offspring, has on its constituent's lactoferrin
      (LF). This multi-functional protein has been shown to affect both bone resorbing and bone
      formation pathways. The safety and tolerance on the use of bovine colostrum in humans
      (children and adults) have been well documented; it has a 'Generally Recognized As Safe'
      status from the United States Food and Drug Administration. Allergies and lactose
      intolerance, which are main shortcomings of milk consumption, have not been reported in
      relation to colostrum. Actually, human colostrum and bovine colostrum share the same
      bioactive components, but bovine sources are more potent than that of human. In accordance,
      bovine colostrum supplementation has been used in several therapeutic applications as
      gastrointestinal disorders, allergies and autoimmune diseases, viral and bacterial illnesses,
      and HIV-associated immunomodulation HIV. However, the effectiveness of bovine colostrum (as a
      whole and not only LF) to reduce bone losses has not been considered yet. Therefore, this
      study aims at analyzing the effects of bovine colostrum in diminishing bone mass losses in
      humans.

      Postmenopausal women (without any bone condition), osteopenia and osteoporosis patients
      (female and male) will be invited to join the study. Participants enrolling the project will
      be first measured on the following parameters: 1) general characteristics (age, sex, medical
      history); 2) bone mass parameters through Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA); 3) bone
      formation and resorption markers (alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin, N-telopeptides and urine
      deoxypyridinoline). After measuring the aforementioned parameters, consenting participants
      will be randomized into the following groups: Group 1: postmenopausal women taking colostrum
      supplementation; Group 2: postmenopausal women taking placebo; Group 3: osteopenia patients
      taking colostrum supplementation; Group 4: osteopenia patients taking placebo; Group 5:
      osteoporosis patients taking colostrum supplementation; Group 6: osteoporosis patients taking
      placebo. Power calculations (90% power, 0.05%) were performed in order to calculate the
      sample size needed in each group (considering stratification according to group, a minimum of
      7 participants in each group are needed). Following 5 months intervention, participants will
      be re-assessed on the following parameters: 1) general characteristics (age, sex, medical
      history); 2) bone mass parameters through Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA); 3) bone
      formation and resorption markers (alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin, N-telopeptides and urine
      deoxypyridinoline).
