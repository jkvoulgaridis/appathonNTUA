  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Women of reproductive age are a high-risk population for anemia and micronutrient
      deficiencies, and there is increasing evidence of the role of periconceptional nutritional
      status in the risk of birth defects and other pregnancy complications. However, there is
      limited population-based data from India, where the burden and consequences of these
      deficiencies is unacceptably high. The objective of this study is to conduct a
      population-based biomarker survey to determine the burden of anemia and vitamin B12 and
      folate status in women of reproductive age, as part of a periconceptional surveillance
      program in Southern India. Findings from this biomarker survey will establish the burden of
      anemia and B-vitamin deficiencies in women of reproductive age, and inform the development of
      a randomized efficacy trial of quadruple-fortified salt for the prevention of anemia and
      birth defects in Southern India.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Women of reproductive age are a high-risk population for anemia and micronutrient
      deficiencies due to social structures, and the physical demands of pregnancy and lactation
      particularly in South Asia. Periconceptional vitamin B12 and folate status are implicated in
      the development of birth defects and other pregnancy complications. Preliminary findings from
      clinical populations suggest that vitamin B12 and folate deficiencies early in pregnancy are
      the leading nutritional causes for neural tube defects. However, there is little
      representative population-level data from Southern India. Surveillance programs are urgently
      needed to establish the burden of anemia and key micronutrient deficiencies in high-burden
      settings such as Southern India, and to inform the development of interventions for anemia
      and birth defects prevention.

      The objective of this study is to conduct a biomarker survey to determine the burden of
      anemia and vitamin B12 and folate status in women of reproductive age, as part of an ongoing
      periconceptional surveillance program in Southern India. The goals of this surveillance
      program are to establish the World Health Organization (WHO)-recommended microbiological
      assay for folate in Southern India, to determine the burden of anemia and B-vitamin
      deficiencies in women of reproductive age, and to inform the development of a randomized
      trial of quadruple-fortified salt for anemia and birth defects prevention in Southern India.
      This laboratory will also serve as the foundation for future intervention trials and public
      health programs to improve the health of women and young children in this population.

        In order to obtain representative, population-level data in this setting, all rural
        households and a random subset (n=1,000) of urban households in the catchment area will be
        selected for subsequent screening and recruitment of WRA for the biomarker study, with a
        target sample size of 1,500 women of reproductive age. The random sample of urban
        households (n=1,000) will be selected from the Census, through a simple random sample
        conducted by a biostatistician from the CDC otherwise unaffiliated with the study. For
        households with more than one eligible woman of reproductive age, an a priori algorithm
        will be developed to randomly select one eligible WRA as the proband for the biomarker
        survey, for a final sample with one eligible WRA per household.
