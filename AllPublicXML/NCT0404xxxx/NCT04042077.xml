  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of delafloxacin administered
      as IV and oral formulation in comparison with Best Available Therapy (BAT) in patients with
      superficial or deep incisional surgical site infection following a cardiothoracic/related leg
      or abdominal surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, observer-blinded, active-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter, phase
      IIIb study for the treatment of incisional, superficial or deep, surgical site infection
      after cardiothoracic /related leg or abdominal surgery (i.e patients who are at risk of
      microbiologically resistant infections). IV to be switched to oral delafloxacin will be
      compared to treatments that represent the best available therapy (BAT) for either
      cardiothoracic/related leg or abdominal surgical site infection (SSI).

      Approximately 600 male and female eligible patients will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio
      to receive delafloxacin or BAT. For patients who are randomised to BAT, the investigator will
      choose one out of two treatments available (two available for the cardiothoracic/related leg
      and two available for abdominal SSI) as most appropriate for patient characteristics and
      local epidemiological pattern.

      Duration of study depends on treatment duration (range: minimum 5 to maximum 14 days, as per
      Investigator's judgment) followed by visits up to 30 days after end of treatment.

      Patients will be hospitalized from Screening (within 30 days from surgery) and will remain
      hospitalized until considered improved or cure as per Investigator's judgment.
