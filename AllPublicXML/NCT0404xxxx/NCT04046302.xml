  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To investigate whether vaginal dinoprostone administered before intrauterine device (IUD)
      insertion reduces failed insertions, insertion-related complications, and pain in multiparous
      women.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Women may experience pain and technical difﬁculties may be encountered when insertion of an
      intrauterine device (IUD) is attempted through a narrow cervical canal.IUD insertion- related
      complications and side effects are more common among women who had never delivered vaginally.
      Pain can be perceived during all steps of IUD insertion including the application of the
      tenaculum to the cervical lip, sounding the uterus and advancing the IUD introducer through
      the cervical canal inside the uterine cavity
