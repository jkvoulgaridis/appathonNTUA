      The goal of this study is to assess hepatitis C virus (HCV) treatment with Zepatier
      (elbasvir/grazoprevir) in HCV monoinfected and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-HCV
      co-infected, HCV treatment-naïve or peginterferon/ribavirin-experienced patients with HCV
      genotype 1a, without baseline NS5A resistance, 1b, or 4 and substance use in urban,
      multidisciplinary specialty clinics.

      Previously, people who use substances and those without liver fibrosis or cirrhosis were
      excluded from receiving direct-acting antiviral (DAA) treatment due to Illinois Medicaid
      restrictions. These sobriety and staging restrictions were recently lifted. However, due to
      these previous stringent requirements for sobriety, many patients were not able to be treated
      for HCV. This created a data gap for real-world outcomes of HCV treatment in people who use
      substances. This study presents a unique opportunity to provide patients with hepatitis C
      treatment and obtain much needed data on the use of elbasvir/grazoprevir in patients with
      substance use and other underrepresented comorbidities. Additionally, this study will
      determine if our current standard of care for the treatment of HCV is effective for patients
      with substance use.
