  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Asthma is a common pathology (prevalence 6.4% in 2018, in France), currently managed by the
      general practitioner in general practice. It is a chronic disease at risk of exacerbation,
      which can lead to the use of care. The treatment of asthma is based on a basic treatment, to
      be taken every day, the purpose of which is to avoid acute exacerbations and lead a normal
      life. There is also an emergency treatment, to be taken in case of sudden worsening of the
      respiratory state. The asthmatic patient is the first actor in his care. He must be able to
      react in case of emergency. A good knowledge of the disease and its treatment as well as
      training in self-management of crises are thus fundamental and must be part of its medical
      care. The existence of an exacerbation represents a criterion of non-control of the disease,
      thus a failure of the long-term care of the patient. The optimization of this care includes
      individual issues aimed at improving the quality of life and collective by reducing the
      avoidable use of care and thus the expenses related to this disease. It relies on therapeutic
      education sessions as well as the provision of written information, clear and detailed by the
      doctor. This information consists of the writing of a detailed medication prescription as
      well as the dispensing of a written action plan.

      The action plan must describe the actions to be taken by the patient in case of exacerbation
      of his asthma, to regain control. Regarding the format, it can be coupled to the prescription
      drug (action plan and prescription on the same prescription) or distinct from the
      prescription drug (a prescription for drugs and a prescription for the action plan). In some
      countries, &quot;ready-to-use&quot; action plans have been validated by learned societies, which is not
      the case today in France. In Canada, a study demonstrated in 2006 that 46% of asthmatic
      patients followed in hospital had an action plan, while the national average was estimated at
      about 10% in 2010. There is little data in France on the proportion of patients with asthma
      action plans.

      Unlike the action plan, which is little distributed to the patient, the prescription drug for
      asthma is always given to the patient at the end of the consultation and specifies the
      procedures for taking treatments.

      As part of this work, the investigators are interested in evaluating the written information
      given to the adult asthmatic patient by their general practitioner: the action plan but also
      the prescription medication.

    <description>The patient presents to the emergency department for an aggravation of his asthma. The patient later sees an emergency investigator for medical care for his aggravation of asthma. When the patient's condition is stabilized, the investigator checks his eligibility for study and offers to participate. If the patient agrees, the investigator gives him the questionnaire and possibly helps to fill it out.
When the investigator returns to see the patient for a reassessment of his condition, he retrieves the completed questionnaire. He verifies that the patient has completed the questionnaire. Prescriptions and action plans are retrieved by the principal investigator either in digitized format from the patient's computerized medical record or in paper format. Each medication prescription and each action plan are read by the principal investigator and evaluated according to the grids.</description>
