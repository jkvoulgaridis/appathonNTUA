  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      the number of immunocompromised patients hospitalized in the intensive care units (ICU) is
      increasing. They are at higher risk of colonization and/or infection with multi-resistant
      bacteria (MDR). However this risk is not well characterized. ICU acquired infections related
      to MDR are associated with increased morbidity and mortality. The aim of this study is to
      compare the incidence of ICU-acquired colonization and ICU-acquired infection related to MDR
      between immunocompromized and immunocompetent patients. The risk factors for ICU-acquired
      colonization and ICU-acquired infections, and their impact on outcome will also be evaluated
      and compared between immunocompromised and immunocompetent patients.
