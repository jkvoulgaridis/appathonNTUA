      This prospective observational study will examine the incidence of intracranial hemorrhage.
      The investigators will compare patients on anticoagulant and/or antiplatelet therapy with
      head trauma compared to patients not on these medications. While many studies have sought to
      quantify the incidence of intracranial hemorrhage in these patients, there is considerable
      controversy regarding their care and what to do after an initial negative head CT in
      anticoagulated geriatric patients who have experienced head trauma.

        The Delray Medical Center and St. Mary's Medical Center emergency departments will be the
        major focal points for the study. These medical centers are located in Palm Beach County,
        Florida. Florida has the highest percentage of geriatric patients in the United States and,
        in particular, Palm Beach County has over 250,000 residents over the age of 65.
