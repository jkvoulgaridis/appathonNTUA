      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics of rectal
      administration of a tenofovir alafenamide (TAF)/elvitegravir (EVG) insert at two dose levels
      in HIV-uninfected individuals.

      This study will evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics of rectal administration of a
      tenofovir alafenamide (TAF)/elvitegravir (EVG) insert at two dose levels in HIV-uninfected
      individuals.

      All participants will receive a single TAF/EVG Insert at Study Visit 3. After a washout
      period of at least 7 days, participants will receive two TAF/EVG Inserts at Study Visit 7.
      The inserts will be administered rectally by study staff. After each dosing visit, samples
      will be collected over a 3-day period.

      Participants will attend 10 study visits and will be followed for approximately 6 to 13
      weeks. Study visits may include physical and rectal examinations; collection of blood, urine,
      rectal and vaginal fluid; and interviews. The total duration of the study will be
      approximately 11 months.

                  for inclusion; however, a self-reported pregnancy is adequate for exclusion from
                  screening/enrollment into the study.

             including any significant uncontrolled active or chronic medical condition.
