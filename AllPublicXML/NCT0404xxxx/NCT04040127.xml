  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The experiments outlined in this proposal are designed to test the hypothesis that the in
      vivo injection of cord blood stem cells (InvitRx®) into the root canal system will facilitate
      teeth initially diagnosed with irreversible pulpitis, to form normal healthy pulpal tissue.

      Patients will be recruited from the various dental clinics at UCSF (student clinic, Advanced
      Education in General Dentistry clinic, post-graduate endodontics clinic, etc) that meet the
      inclusion and exclusion criteria. Patients in the control group will have root canal therapy
      initiated; instrumentation and cleaning up to 4mm from the radiographic apex. Bleeding will
      be induced and blood clot formed 3mm from the CEJ. MTA followed by glass ionomer and
      composite will be placed over the clot. Patients in the experimental group will have root
      canal therapy initiatied; instrumentation and cleaning up to 4mm from the radiographic apex.
      Bleeding will be induced and blood clot formed 3mm from the CEJ. 1 cc (30 million cord blood
      stem cells) will then be injected into the clot formation. MTA followed by glass ionomer and
      composite will be placed over the clot.

    <description>Umbilical cords are collected from eligible donors at the time of delivery and transported to the processing facility on ice (2-8℃) in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Media (DMEM). Cords are processed immediately under aseptic conditions and MSCs are collected for culture. Culture is maintained this way until the target number of cells has been reached, at which point passaged cells are suspended in Stem Cellbanker (Amsbio, Cambridge, MA) and frozen at -80℃.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        A. Patients must be systemically healthy, Class I dental category. B. Involved teeth must
        have no periodontal disease detectible by periodontal examination.

        C. Patients must present without radiographic signs of endodontic disease (i.e. no
        periapical radiolucencies).

        Exclusion Criteria:

        A. Presence of any disease or medication that alters the immune system or interferes with
        healing ability B. Smokers (more than 10 cigarettes per day) C. External or internal tooth
        resorption D. Tooth perforation from the pulp cavity through the tip of the root exposing
        the tissue to material in the oral cavity.

        E. Pregnant or nursing mothers because hormonal factors may influence the condition.

        F. Allergies or adverse reactions to local anesthetic medications G. Patients under the age
        of 18. H. Patients with an ASA Classification II or higher
