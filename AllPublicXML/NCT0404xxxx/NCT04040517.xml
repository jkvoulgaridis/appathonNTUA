      All children with hearing loss should have access to resources necessary to reach their
      maximum potential. The following principles provide the foundation for effective EHDI[Early
      Hearing Detection &amp; Intervention] systems and have been updated and expanded since the 2000
      JCIH [ joint Committee on Infant Hearing ] position statement .

      1. All infants should have access to hearing screening using a physiologic measure at no
           later than 1 month of age.

        2. All infants who do not pass the initial hearing screening and the subsequent rescreening
           should have appropriate audiological and medical evaluations to confirm the presence of
           hearing loss at no later than 3 months of age.

        3. All infants with confirmed permanent hearing loss should receive early intervention
           services as soon as possible after diagnosis but at no later than 6 months of age. A
           simplified, single point of entry into an intervention system that is appropriate for
           children with hearing loss is optimal.

      The importance of early identification and habilitation of hearing loss for improved access
      to auditory stimuli and for positive prognosis of speech and language is well established in
      the literature . Auditory brain stem response (ABR) is the most commonlly used test in
      clinical practice to estimate the degree of hearing loss, but the auditory brainstem response
      (ABR) cannot differentiate between severe and profound SNHL [5], whereas the ASSR can provide
      threshold information in a frequency-specific manner at intensity levels of 120 dB and
      higher. This intensity stimulation advantage uniquely qualifies the ASSR for investigation of
      residual hearing in young and difficult-to-test cochlear implant candidates.
