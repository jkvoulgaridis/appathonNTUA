  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      SN1011 (the study drug), is currently being developed by Sinomab as a new drug for treating
      autoimmune disease (diseases occurring when your body's natural immune/defence mechanism
      attacks healthy tissue and nerves), such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA). RA causes recurrent
      joint pain and swelling, particularly in the hands and feet, and can lead to bone erosion and
      joint deformity.

      SN1011 is known as a BTK inhibitor. Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) is an enzyme that plays a
      key role in B-cell development, and B-cells play an important role in immunity throughout the
      body. It is thought that blocking the BTK signal may inhibit disease progression in people
      with RA and may even resolve the disease.

      The purpose of this research study is to assess the safety and tolerability of SN1011 as well
      as the pharmacokinetics (PK - how your body handles the study drug) and pharmacodynamics (PD
      - how the study drug affects your body) of the study drug. The investigators are doing this
      study in healthy men and women.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will compare SN1011 with placebo. A placebo has no active drug in it. One group of
      participants will take SN1011 and another group will take the placebo. The effects seen in
      participants taking the study drug will be compared to the effects seen in participants who
      are taking the placebo.

      This study will look at how participants react to and how the human body uses SN1011 at
      different dose levels.

      The design of the study is double-blind, randomised and placebo-controlled. In total there
      are planned to be 2 parts to the study. Part A will look at the effects of a single dose of
      the study drug and Part B will look at the effects of multiple doses of the study drug.
