  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Severe challenging behaviors such as aggression and self-injury can cause significant
      morbidity and decrease the quality of life for individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorders
      (ASD). There are only two medications (Risperdal and Abilify) rigorously studied and
      FDA-approved for the treatment of irritability in individuals with ASD. These medications are
      not always successful and have many short and long-term side effects. Well-designed studies
      demonstrating efficacy and safety of alternative medication treatment choices are needed.
      There is preliminary evidence that high-dose propranolol can be effective in individuals with
      ASD who display severe aggression and have not responded to antipsychotics or mood
      stabilizers. Concerns regarding the safety of high dose propranolol have limited its clinical
      application. Well-designed clinical trials demonstrating the efficacy and safety of high dose
      propranolol will have significant effects on clinical practice and improve the physical and
      behavioral quality of life for an underserved subset of individuals with ASD.

      This study will pilot the safety and efficacy of high dose propranolol. The investigators
      will randomly assign participants to either propranolol or to placebo later crossing each
      participant over to the other group. As propranolol can cause changes in blood pressure and
      heart function, each participant will complete initial comprehensive testing to monitor
      cardiac safety throughout the study. The investigators will be utilizing telemedicine and
      computer based telemetry to minimize the burden of office visits on the individual and
      family.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled crossover study. A complete cardiac
      exam will be conducted by the pediatric cardiology team at the Robert Wood Johnson Medical
      School. All participants will remain on their existing, pre-study medication throughout all
      phases of the study.

      Once admitted to the study, a baseline period will begin. During the baseline period,
      cognitive and adaptive information will be collected. The participant will then be randomly
      assigned to propranolol (Phase A) or placebo (Phase B). The titration schedule will be
      flexible and the dose can be held steady for an extended period. Dose reduction to manage
      side effects are allowed at any time. Each week the family will complete behavioral forms
      online and meet with the study psychiatrist via telemedicine. Following the initial Phase (A
      or B), participants will undergo a washout period (whether propranolol or placebo). Then,
      they will crossover to the other Phase (A or B). Upon completion of the crossover phase, the
      study blind will be broken. The participant will then continue in the open label phase.

    <measure>Change in Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC-C)</measure>
    <time_frame>Weekly through study completion, up to 7 months</time_frame>
    <description>The ABC-C is a global behavior checklist that measures drug and other treatment effects in people with developmental disabilities. It is made up of five subscales, including Irritability, Lethargy, Inappropriate Speech, Hyperactivity, and Stereotypy based on 58 items that describe various behavioral problems. The Irritability Subscale will serve as the primary dependent measure.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Clinical Global Impression Scale (CGI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Weekly through study completion, up to 7 months</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI is used by the study psychiatrist to judge the overall clinical condition relative to baseline using the same scale as the CGI-S. The study psychiatrist will rate the improvement from baseline. The CGI consists of a 7-point subjective scale assessing symptom. On this scale, scores of 1, 2, and 3 represent normal, some presence of symptoms, and mild behavior, respectively. A score of 4 represents moderate behavior. Scores of 5, 6, and 7 represent marked, severe, and among the most severe behavior, respectively.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Modified Overt Aggression Scale (IBR-MOAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Weekly through study completion, up to 7 months</time_frame>
    <description>The IBR-MOAS is a questionnaire that includes 5 types of aggression (verbal aggression towards self and others, physical aggression towards objects, self, and others) with four levels of severity for each type of aggression. Only the section assessing the 5 types of aggression will be used for repeat evaluations: Verbal aggression toward others, Verbal aggression toward self, Physical aggression against other people, Physical aggression against objects, Physical aggression against self. The frequency of occurrence of each items are as follows: 0 = Never (never happens); 1 = Rarely (averages about once a year to once a month); 2 = Sometimes (averages about several times a month to several times a week); 3 = Often (averages about daily to several times a day); and U (Used to happen but not this past year).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Questions About Behavior Function (QABF)</measure>
    <time_frame>Weekly through study completion, up to 7 months</time_frame>
    <description>The QABF is an indirect assessment of behavioral function for individuals with developmental disabilities. It contains 25 items. The QABF yields five behavioral function categories: Access to Attention, Escape from Demands, Physical, Access to Tangible, and Nonsocial (i.e., sensory or automatically-maintained). Each question is scored with frequency descriptors of Never, Rarely, Some, and Often. A function is endorsed if the score for a particular function is at or above 4 points or higher.</description>
