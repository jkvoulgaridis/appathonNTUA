  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mental health problems affect 10-20% of children and adolescents worldwide and account for a
      large portion of global burden of diseases. A growing body of literature suggests that sleep
      disturbances (e.g., insomnia, sleep deprivation) may result in emotional distress, which in
      turn may precipitate mood disorders. Recent neuroimaging and neurophysiological findings
      converge to suggest that emotional networks are activated during sleep. In addition,
      emotional activation during sleep may be a necessary factor for emotional maturation, and the
      emergence and maintenance of consciousness in the developing brain. Recent studies support
      the role of sleep in emotional maturity. Since as early as the 13th week of gestation and
      neonatal period, smiles and other expressions are extremely common, especially during active
      REM sleep. Also, it was shown that sleep-state transitions characterized by shifts between
      quiet sleep and wakefulness are important for an optimal emotional and cognitive development.
      But studies in early childhood are really scarce compared with those in adults and it makes
      difficult to draw the conclusion that early sleep intervention would positively affect
      emotional well-being, and conversely, certain emotions may lead to compromised sleep. Thus,
      the investigators employ infant sleep intervention protocol to explore the causal
      relationship of sleep and early sleep-emotional development. The study will provide a better
      understanding of the multifaceted role of sleep in emotional functions and further
      demonstrate key component of sleep in mental health and well-being in infants.

      Study Design: Randomized controlled trial (RCT). Approximately 400 participants will be
      randomized to a control condition or behavioral sleep intervention condition.

      Participants: Participants are healthy infants between the ages of 0 and 12 months and their
      parents. Parents must be willing to engage in infant behavioral sleep intervention.

      Study Procedure: Participants recruitment strategy is direct referrals from Renji hospital,
      affiliated shanghai jiaotong university school of medicine. Participants will be screened and
      consented via interview. Individuals (parents) of the interventional group were subject to
      standardized sleep hygiene education at 5 timepoints when the baby was born, 42 days, 3month,
      6month and 9month. Children diagnosed with behavioral insomnia (international diagnostic
      criteria for sleep disorders II) at 3month, 6month or 9month, investigators should carry out
      standardized behavioral sleep intervention. For children with sleep disorders in the control
      group, treatment was in accordance with the current clinical therapy and should be recorded.

      Intervention: The intervention consists of 5 times sleep hygiene education and infant
      standard behavioral sleep protocol. Interventionist will collaborate with the family to
      design a tailored sleep schedule and bedtime routine. The interventionist will then teach the
      family a behavioral approach, which involves placing the infant in his/her crib awake.The
      behavioral approach will be individually tailored for each family (e.g., periodic checks).
      Parents are educated to implement the behavioral protocol at bedtime and subsequent night
      wakings.

      Measures: Infant sleep will be assessed by parent-report (sleep diary and validated scale)
      and actiwatch; Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) Study and eye-tracking, Parent
      sleep condition, Parent mood condition.

      Collaborators on this study include: Renji hospital, affiliated shanghai jiaotong university
      school of medicine

    <description>Different sleep parameters, such as sleep onset latency (SOL) and wake after sleep onset (WASO) will be determined using wrist actigraphy. Participants will be provided with an actiwatch after 3 month, 6 month,9 month and 12 months follow-up of the study. The actiwatch will be worn on the non-dominant arm 24 hours a day, except for while bathing, during the 1-week screening period.</description>

    <description>Infant sleep problems reported by the mother and according to Brief Infant Sleep Questionnaire (BISQ). It is not a scale. The variables of the questionnaire included 1) nocturnal sleep duration (between the hours of 7 pm and 7 am); 2) daytime sleep duration (between the hours of 7 am and 7 pm); 3) number of night wakenings; 4) duration of wakefulness during the night hours (10 pm to 6 am); 5) nocturnal sleep-onset time (the time when the child falls asleep for the night); 6) settling time (latency to falling asleep for the night); 7) method of falling asleep; 8) location of sleep; 9) preferred body position; 10) age of child; 11) gender of child; 12) birth order; and 13) role of the responder who completed the BISQ. If the child woke up more than 3 times per night, spent more than 1 hour in wakefulness during the night, or spent less than 9 hours in sleep (day and night), then they were considered as poor sleepers</description>
