  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized intervention study to determine if electronic prompted interruptions in
      sitting time have an effect on job satisfaction, musculoskeletal complaints, sitting time and
      biophysical markers for obesity.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A sedentary lifestyle has been deemed deleterious to health. It contributes to many chronic
      diseases and illnesses as well as an increase in all-cause mortality. The objective of this
      study is to investigate if electronic prompted interruptions in sitting time can reduce
      sedentary behavior at work as well as have an effect on job satisfaction, musculoskeletal
      complaints and biophysical markers for obesity. The participants will be randomly assigned to
      one of two groups, intervention (n=31) and control (n=31). Informed consent, demographic and
      socioeconomic data will be obtained from each participant. A questionnaire that includes
      three different scales will be administered before and after the 12-week intervention to all
      participants: Occupational Sitting and Physical Activity Questionnaire, Job Satisfaction
      Index, and Nordic Musculoskeletal Symptoms. Also, physical data will be measured: BMI,
      percent body fat and waist circumference. All participants will be provided with the Amazfit
      BIP device to track steps during work hours. The intervention group will receive a prompt
      every hour during their workday via an iOS application, Stand-Up, through the Amazfit BIP
      device. The prompt is to interrupt sitting time and encourage two-minutes of physical
      activity. The intervention group will receive examples of physical activity in addition to
      educational material on the health benefits of increasing physical activity in the workplace
      via verbal instruction and written materials. Data analysis will be conducted to determine if
      there is a difference in sitting time between the two groups over time using
      repeated-measures ANOVA. Independent samples t-tests will be used to compare job satisfaction
      and the physical biomarkers for obesity among the intervention and control groups. Chi-square
      will be used to analyze the reported musculoskeletal complaints between the two groups. If
      necessary, all analyses will be controlled for age, gender, race/ethnicity, and socioeconomic
      status.

    <intervention_model_description>Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two groups: intervention or control after informed consent is obtained. The intervention will be conducted for 12-weeks and consist of two components: education and electronic prompt to interrupt sitting time. Upon receiving the electronic prompt, they are encouraged to participate in 2 minutes of physical activity. Both groups will be provided an Amazfit BIP device to record and submit their step count during weeks: 1,2,3,6,9, and 12.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The intervention will consist of two components: education and an electronic prompt via the iOS application Stand Up and notification through the Amzafit BIP device. The Stand-Up application will generate a prompt every hour during the workday to interrupt sitting time and encourage 2 minutes of physical activity. The intervention group participants will be given verbal and written educational materials on the health benefits of incorporating physical activity throughout their workday as well as the health risks of a sedentary lifestyle. Suggestions and demonstrations of physical activity will be given including but not limited to: use a restroom further away from their workstation, take a brief walk around the office, walk-in place, stretch. In addition, they will record their steps via the Amazfit BIP device and submit their daily step counts for weeks: 1,2,3,6,9, and 12.</description>
