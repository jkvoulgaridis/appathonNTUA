  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This 12 week placebo-controlled study evaluates the safety and impact of 2 different
      strengths of the medical food formulation WBF-0011.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The medical food formulations being tested in this study contain butyrate-producing organisms
      plus a microbial strain that contributes to the integrity of the colonic mucin barrier. The
      microbes have been fully characterized, certified as Generally Recognized As Safe (GRAS) and
      manufactured to Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) standards using excipients that are also
      GRAS qualified.

      Subjects will receive their randomized formulation twice a day for 12 weeks.The target
      population will be patients with Type 2 Diabetes who are not treated with anti-diabetic
      agents or are treated with metformin alone.
