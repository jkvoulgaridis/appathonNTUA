  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a social media-based parenting program can
      improve responsive parenting among mothers with Postpartum depression (PPD) symptoms.
      Participants will be randomized to receive the parenting program plus online depression
      treatment or online depression treatment alone to assess target engagement. Our overall
      objective for this application is to study whether this program combined with online
      depression treatment leads to more responsive parenting (target) and signals improved child
      language, socioemotional and cognitive development (outcomes) compared to depression
      treatment alone.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Postpartum depression (PPD) symptoms are common among women following the birth of a child
      and can adversely impact a mother's ability to care for her child. As a result, infants of
      mothers with PPD symptoms may experience less responsive parenting, placing them at greater
      risk for delays in development. Evidence- based parenting programs have been developed to
      guide mothers with caring for their infants but may not address the impact of depression on
      parenting, are intensive and expensive to administer with limited ability for scale up, or
      are not available in a format that facilitates participation by women with depressive
      symptoms. To address these barriers, we developed a theoretically-driven social media-based
      parenting program on responsive parenting and child development.

      To determine whether the social media-based parenting program can improve responsive
      parenting among women with PPD symptoms, we will conduct a prospective individually
      randomized group treatment trial. 75 eligible women who screen positive for PPD at their
      infants' well child visit and their children will be consented, enrolled, and randomized as
      mother-child dyads 1:1 to receive a) the social media-based parenting program plus online
      depression treatment or b) online depression treatment alone. We chose a randomized design,
      because it is most effective in guarding against bias and will ensure that patients in both
      arms are similar in observed and unobserved characteristics. Treatment assignment will be
      done at the time of enrollment following informed consent.

      Descriptive statistics for demographic and poverty characteristics and PPD symptoms measured
      at baseline will be examined across the two treatment groups to assess the success of the
      randomization. We will assess responsive parenting at baseline and 3 months post-enrollment.
      Secondary outcomes, including changes in EPDS, PSOC, and PSI-SF scores measured between
      baseline and the 3-month follow-up between groups, will be explored to determine if the
      effects of the parenting program are consistent with preliminary pilot findings. The
      intervention arm will also be assessed with the Therapeutic Factors Inventory-8 (TFI-8) to
      measure cohesion at 3-months post-enrollment.

      The results of this application would be expected to contribute important new knowledge and
      inform a future trial on parenting strategies to better assist mothers with PPD symptoms and
      improve child developmental outcomes.

    <time_frame>3 Months</time_frame>
    <description>The Patient Child Early Relational Assessment (PCERA) is a validated 65-item videotape assessment designed to measure the quality of affect and behavior in parent-infant interactions. The PCERA uses ratings that are based on observations of 5-minute videotaped interactions with parent-infant dyads engaged in free play at a research lab at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP). The PCERA has been shown to possess good interrater reliability, internal consistency, discriminant and concurrent validity, and sensitivity to change. The PCERA contains 8 subscales of which 3 parenting subscales will be the focus: 1) Parental Positive Affective Involvement and Verbalization, 2) Parental Negative Affect and Behavior, and 3) Parental Intrusiveness, Insensitivity, and Inconsistency. Administration and coding will follow the PCERA manual. Higher scores indicate more responsive parenting.</description>

    <description>The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) is a validated 10-item self-report measure of depressive symptoms with strong evidence for reliability, validity, and utility in varying populations. It has been used extensively in mental health research and provides cutpoints to determine the severity of depressive symptoms. It includes a question on suicidal thoughts and wishes (#10) that will be used to monitor for suicidality. The total score will be used with scores of 10 or higher representing minor or moderate depression and scores of 20 or greater representing severe depression.This outcome will assess changes in EPDS from baseline to 3 months.</description>

    <measure>Change in parenting self-esteem and confidence</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Parenting Sense of Competence Scale (PSOC) is a validated 17-item self-report measure of parenting self-esteem and competence and consists of two factors: satisfaction and efficacy. Response categories are on a 6-point likert-scale from strongly disagree to strongly agree. The total score (which includes the sum of the two factors) will be used. A higher score indicates a higher parenting sense of competency. There are no average scores or 'cut-off's' for this tool. This outcomes will assess changes in PSOC from baseline to 3 months.</description>

    <measure>Change in parenting stress</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Parenting Stress Index-Short Form (PSI-SF) is a validated 36-item scale that measures parenting stress. The PSI-SF is a direct derivative of the full-length test (PSI) and it has been shown to have excellent internal consistency and to be positively associated with maternal psychological distress. Scores on the PSI-SF correlate well with the full-length PSI. It yields a Total Stress score from three scales: Parental Distress, Parent-Child Dysfunctional Interaction, and Difficult Child. The total score will be used, with higher scores indicating higher levels of stress.This outcomes will assess changes in PSI-SF from baseline to 3 months.</description>

    <description>The National Comorbidity Survey (NCS) provides data on mental health treatment in the United States. We will include a question from the NCS on prior mental health services use in the past month: &quot;In the past month, did you receive treatment for problems with your emotions or nerves, or your use of alcohol or drugs?&quot; We will consider mental health service use to have occurred in the past month if a mother responds affirmatively to this question. We will determine total months of mental health service use (0-3).</description>

    <description>Participants in the intervention group will be enrolled in Facebook secret user groups, administered by a trained facilitator, in order to permit participants to view and comment on posted materials. Content and user identity are restricted to invited participants to maintain privacy. For each topic, we organize educational materials into video vignettes, narrated PowerPoint presentations, and written materials. The facilitator reviews and comments on postings daily, provides feedback to participants, and removes inappropriate postings if they occur. Facebook analytics for the secret groups are available to group administrators and will provide information on any sessions viewed (engagement) and counts of sessions viewed and comments posted (dosage). Women in the intervention group will also be enrolled in the online depression treatment program, MoodGym.</description>
