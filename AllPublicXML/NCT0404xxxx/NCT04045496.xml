  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, first-in-human, open-label dose-escalation study to determine the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) and assess the DLT of JAB-3312.
      It is anticipated that approximately 24 subjects will be enrolled in the dose-escalation
      phase of the study. JAB-3312 will be administered orally once daily (QD) in 21-day treatment
      cycles.
