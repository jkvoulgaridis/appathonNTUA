  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare, prospectively, the quality of life of patients with
      cleft lip and palate before and after orthognathic surgery. This is done through two
      validated questionnaires: OHIP-14 (Oral Health Impact Profile) and OQLQ (Orthognathic Quality
      of Life Questionnaire) Improving the quality of life is the goal of any functional treatment.
      The demonstration of its improvement would validate the validity of this additional surgery
      for patients with cleft lip and palate.
