    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of ibrutinib based on overall response
      rate (ORR) (partial response [PR] or better) by investigator assessment per the modified
      Consensus Response Criteria from the Sixth International Workshop on Waldenstrom's
      Macroglobulinemia (IWWM) (NCCN 2019), in Chinese participants with relapsed or refractory
      waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia.
