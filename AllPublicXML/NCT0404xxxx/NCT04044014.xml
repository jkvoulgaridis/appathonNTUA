  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study will be to establish the safety of the two different
      Gellan formulations (sheet and fluid gel) following its application to the epidermis of
      healthy volunteers. This will be compared to a control dressing-- Mepitel One (Polyurethane
      net with soft Silicone).

      This contact study is part of the Wellcome trust Anti-scarring Dressing project to develop a
      carrier dressing that will be used to deliver therapeutic agents to the skin. A
      polysaccharide, Gellan, has been chosen as the main component of this dressing (the
      biomembrane)and it can be produced in either a sheet or fluid gel forms. Gellan is a widely
      used material in both the food and medical industry e.g. as a lubricant in eye-drops (e.g.
      Timoptol XE, Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme, USA).

      As part of the development of the dressing, the epidermal (skin) response to Gellan needs to
      be evaluated to check its safety.

      The main objective of this study is to establish the safety of the two different Gellan
      formulations (2% Gellan sheet and 2% Gellan fluid gel) following application to the epidermis
      (skin).

    <intervention_model_description>Participants will be randomised to receive the treatment dressing (either the Gellan sheet or Gellan fluid gel) on one arm (Left or Right), and the control dressing (Mepitel One) on the other arm. The first phase will be for 1 hour and the 2nd phase will be for 3 days.</intervention_model_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Skin reaction</measure>
    <time_frame>3 days (72 hours+/-3 hours)</time_frame>
    <description>Skin will be evaluated for erythema, dryness and oedema by two observers using a visually based scale (Visual skin assessment scale; this is a novel scale devised by the research team).
The scale is as follows:
Erythema: 0-4 (Higher values are worse)
Dryness: 0-3 (Higher values are worse)
Oedema: 0-1 (Higher values are worse)
Each subscale is evaluated individually and not combined.</description>

Name of questionnaire: &quot;Participant evaluation questionnaire&quot;
Questions:
Was the dressing comfortable? (Yes/No)
Was there any itch? (Yes/No)
Was there any pain? (Yes/No)
Was the dressing comfortable to remove? (Yes/No)</description>

    <description>Clinician satisfaction in terms of ease of application, handling, removal, durability, conformity (evaluated using a questionnaire).
Name of questionnaire: &quot;Clinician evaluation questionnaire&quot;
Questions:
Is the dressing still moist? (Yes/No)
Is the dressing still intact? (Yes/No)
Has any fragmentation occurred? (Yes/No)
Has any tearing occurred? (Yes/No)</description>
