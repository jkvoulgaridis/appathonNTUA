  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A completely new type of digital dermatoscope has been developed in order to take a
      significant step forward in technology for skin cancer imaging. By means of this study a
      better insight can be gained of the current performance and workflow in clinical
      dermatoscopy. This knowledge will be used to further improve the developed technology.

        accessible to the new digital dermatoscope and are able to give informed consent (guardian
        in case of patients under 18 years).
