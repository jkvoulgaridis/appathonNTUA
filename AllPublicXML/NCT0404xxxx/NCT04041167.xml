  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to investigate the effectiveness and safety of alpha-lipoic acid in patients
      with diabetes and ischemic stroke treated with reperfusion therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite significant advances in the prevention and treatment of stroke, it is still one of
      the leading causes of death and debilitating disease. Unfortunately, several neuroprotective
      strategies have failed in clinical trials. At present, it is reported that there are no
      pharmacological agents with putative neuroprotective actions that have demonstrated efficacy
      in improving outcomes after acute ischemic stroke (AIS) in humans. Previous stroke studies
      have confirmed that oxidative stress plays a vital role in stroke and in reperfusion
      following stroke. Therefore, the use of antioxidants could be a promising strategy for
      treating ischemia-reperfusion injury. Alpha-lipoic acid (aLA) is a potent antioxidant
      commonly used for the treatment of diabetic polyneuropathy (DPNP). The investigators
      previously demonstrated the neuroprotective and neurorestorative effects of aLA, mediated at
      least partially via insulin receptor activation, after cerebral ischemia in rats. Moreover,
      previous observational study of the investigators showed that patients with diabetes treated
      with aLA have better functional outcomes following AIS after reperfusion therapy than
      patients not using aLA.

      Therefore, the investigators investigate whether patients with diabetes treated with aLA have
      better functional outcomes after AIS and reperfusion therapy than patients not treated with
      aLA in this prospective randomized trial.
