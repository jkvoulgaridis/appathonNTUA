      ABSTRACT

      Work-related musculoskeletal disorders are seen as a public health problem, and can often
      lead to temporary or permanent incapacity to work. These disorders generate high costs for
      the global economy, which include health care costs, sickness benefits for workers and sick
      leave, and is considered one of the three major causes of absence from work. Objectives: The
      objective of this study is to analyze the effects of occupational kinesiotherapy in the
      reduction of pain and discomfort in the upper limbs and cervical region perceived by the
      workers of a university hospital. Methods: 100 workers will be recruited and assigned
      randomly to the &quot;labor kinesiotherapy&quot; group (GCL) and another 100 to the &quot;control group&quot;
      (CG). The primary outcomes will be the pain perceived by the Numerical Pain Scale (NDT) and
      Nordic Questionnaire, and isokinetic muscle strength through the mean peak torque work. The
      discomfort and disability will be evaluated by the PSFS and QuickDASH questionnaires. The
      Ergonomic Analysis of Work will be evaluated by the manual &quot;Ergonomic Analysis Focused on
      Activities&quot; - EAFA and application of QEC, RULA, REBA and HARM tools. Statistical analysis
      will be performed through PASW Statistics ™, version 20.0. The independent sample T test will
      be used to compare the groups. The Cohen index will be set for the effect size calculation.
      All analyzes will be conducted with 95% confidence interval and p &lt;0.05 significance.

    <description>The intervention will be performed by a physical therapist, which will consist of preparatory labor kinesiotherapy, which aims to prepare the workers' osteo-articular system for the beginning of the work activity, acting more specifically on those muscle groups that will be most required during the journey which will be identified in the evaluation. Labor kinesiotherapy will be performed in the workplace before the workday and will last 20 minutes, 3 times a week, for 12 weeks.</description>

    <description>The intervention group will perform 5 minutes of warm-up with free active exercises, 10 minutes of specific resistance exercises for the cervical and upper limbs and 5 minutes of stretching and muscle relaxation.The initial free active exercises will be performed in 3 sets of 15 repetitions; Resistance exercises will be performed in 3 sets of 10 repetitions and stretching will be performed in 3 sets of 30 seconds.
Regarding the intervals between exercises, active recovery will be adopted to counteract the effects of muscle fatigue.</description>
