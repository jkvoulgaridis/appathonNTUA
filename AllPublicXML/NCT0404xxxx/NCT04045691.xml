  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      BERING-MELANOMA - designed as a prospective, longitudinal, non-interventional study -
      investigates real-world effectiveness, quality of life, safety and tolerability of
      encorafenib plus binimetinib in unresectable advanced or metastatic BRAF(Rapidly Accelerated
      Fibrosarcoma isoform B)-V600-mutant malignant melanoma after commercial availability of these
      two products in Germany, Austria and Switzerland. The study focusses on the documentation of
      the first and second line setting (i.e. after one line of prior checkpoint inhibition) by
      documenting patients treated according to the SmPC (Summary of Product Characteristics).
