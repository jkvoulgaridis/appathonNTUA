  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      preoperative anxiety is an undesirable outcome in pediatric surgical patients.It can lead to
      behavioral trouble such as enuresis, apathy and sleep disorders.

      to prevent this anxiety,many tools can be used for premedication like
      pharmacological:Midazolam, clonidine, hydroxysine or non pharmacological tools such as
      parental presence,hypnosis and interactive tablet.

      the purpose of the study is to compare the effect of interactive tablet to oral midazolam.on
      preoperative anxiety in children prior to elective surgery

    <textblock>
      this study is a prospective,randomized, active treatment controlled trial.It enrolls 100
      children .

      after written and informed consent,the study participants were randomly assigned using a
      computer generated table to one of two treatment groups prior to elective surgery.

      Group T: will receive an interactive tablet containing many cartoon's videos 20 minutes
      before the parental separation and until the anesthesia induction Group MD:will receive oral
      midazolam 20 minutes before parental separation with 0.5 mg/kg (max 20mg) Anxiety assessement
      was done using the Modified Yale Perioperative Anxiety Scale( MYPAS) at the separation of
      parents,the admission in the operating room and the anesthesia induction.

      Facial mask acceptance,post operative agitation (PAEDS score: Pediatric Anesthesia Emergence
      of Delirium) and parental satisfaction were also assessed.
