  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial will study SGN-CD228A to find out whether it is an effective treatment for
      different kinds of cancer. It will also look at what side effects (unwanted effects) may
      occur. The study will have two parts. Part 1 of the study will find out how much SGN-CD228A
      should be given for treatment and how often. Part 2 of the study will use the dose found in
      Part 1 and look at how safe and effective the treatment is.

      This study is designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK, and antitumor activity of
      SGN-CD228A in select advanced solid tumors. The study will include dose escalation and dose
      expansion, with multiple disease-specific expansion cohorts.

        Exclusion Criteria

          -  History of another malignancy within 3 years before the first dose of study drug, or
             any evidence of residual disease from a previously diagnosed malignancy. Exceptions
             are malignancies with a negligible risk of metastasis or death.

          -  Pre-existing neuropathy Grade 2 or greater

          -  Retinal or macular disease requiring treatment or ongoing active monitoring

          -  Prior receipt of SGN228A or MMAE-containing agents
