    <textblock>
      This randomized control trial will compare traditional patient education methods (pamphlets,
      clinical visits) to the implementation of an innovated patient education platform. The
      purpose of the project is to determine whether the use of this animation based patient
      education platform prior to undergoing surgery will lead to improved patient satisfaction and
      quality of life.

      Hypothesis/Study question:

      Does the implementation of an animation based patient education platform prior to undergoing
      surgery lead to improved patient satisfaction and quality of life?

      Study objectives:

      Help address patient gaps in understanding, reduce learning barriers in order for patients to
      make informed decisions, improve behaviors, and better partner with their health providers to
      attain optimal health outcomes

      Methodology / Study design:

      Patients will receive access to the patient education platform during the clinical visit in
      which they receive their diagnosis, and will be asked if they wish to enroll in the study
      consisting of completing questionnaires before and after their surgical procedure. Questions
      will inquire on levels of anxiety, patient satisfaction, knowledge retention, and platform
      feedback.
