  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine the safety profile, maximum tolerated dose (MTD), dose-limiting toxicities
      (DLTs), and recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of FF-10850 (topotecan liposome injection) in
      patients with advanced solid tumors.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dose-escalation Phase: Approximately 48 patients are planned for the dose-escalation phase,
      with at least 6 patients treated at the RP2D.

      Cohort Expansion Phase: Four additional cohorts of 12 patients each are planned. Cohort E1:
      advanced ovarian cancer; Cohort E2: advanced cervical cancer, Cohort E3: advanced sarcomas,
      and Cohort E4: advanced neuroendocrine tumors including small cell lung cancer. Each cohort
      will be treated at the RP2D.

      In each cohort, FF-10850 will be administered intravenously (IV) until progression of
      disease, observation of unacceptable AEs, or, after discussion between the Investigator and
      the Medical Monitor, changes in the patient's condition that prevent further study
      participation. A sufficient number of cohorts will be enrolled to identify the RP2D.

      There will be 3 initial dose levels in this study. FF-10850 will be diluted and infused over
      60 minutes.

      Approximately 96 patients are planned for the entire trial.

      It is anticipated that approximately 4 centers will participate in the dose-escalation phase,
      with an expansion to approximately 10 centers in the cohort expansion phase. Accrual for the
      dose-escalation and expansion phases is expected to be approximately 3 years, with patients
      followed every 3 months from the last dose of study treatment to assess survival.
