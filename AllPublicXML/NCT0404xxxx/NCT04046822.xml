  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the trial is to assess whether the beneficial effect of liraglutide on weight
      is mediated by changes in the composition of the intestinal Microbiome. The main mechanisms
      of action of liraglutide were traced to a reduction in the secretion of glucagon and slowing
      gastric emptying resulting in decreased appetite and body weight. It also seems that
      liraglutide is capable of increasing the satiety signals thanks to a dual mechanism of
      stimulation and inhibition induced by medication. Pomc neurons (opiomelacortin) present in
      hypothalamic arcuate nuclei, stimulated by liraglutide, glucagon-like peptide- 1 (GLP-1)
      receptor expressed by inhibiting intensely appetite. At the same time through the GABAergic
      neuronal activity is inhibited neuropeptide Y(NPY) deputies to the production of orexins that
      are powerful promoters of appetite. Alterations in the composition of the human gut
      microbiome occur in metabolic disorders such as obesity, diabetes. Liraglutide has been
      reported to switch microbiome composition towards lean-related bacterial phylotypes in animal
      studies. This leads to hypothesize that the switch of microbiome by liraglutide may be one of
      the mechanisms through which liraglutide may exert its effect. In particular the
      investigators hypothesize that liraglutide could restore a healthy microbiome or at least
      improve the microbiome composition through slowing gastrointestinal motility. Moreover, the
      liraglutide-related change of microbiome could be an additional mechanism that contribute to
      the beneficial metabolic effect of liraglutide. To test this hypothesis the investigators
      will investigate if there will be any change of gut microbiome assessed as
      Firmicutes-to-Bacteroidetes ratio after liraglutide treatment. In order to understand if the
      change of gut microbiome after liraglutide treatment occurs as an association or contributes
      to the effect of liraglutide ,the investigators will correlate the
      Firmicutes-to-Bacteroidetes ratios with the changes of Body Mass Index, Body Composition,
      appetite parameters, chronic inflammation parameters, lipid profile and insulin resistance.
      All the subjects will follow the same diet in order to avoid any bias.

      This is a randomized, double-blind, parallel group, placebo-controlled trial comparing
      liraglutide 3.0 mg with placebo both administered subcutaneously once-daily in subjects with
      established obesity. Subjects will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive either liraglutide
      3.0 mg or placebo as an adjunct to standard-of-care.All baseline assessments will be done
      prior to administration of the first dose of trial product while all the follow up
      assessments will be done at the end of the trial. Dose escalation of liraglutide/placebo will
      take place during the first 4 weeks after randomisation as described. All subjects will aim
      at reaching the recommended target dose of 3.0 mg liraglutide once-daily or the corresponding
      volume of placebo. In this trial approximately 70 subjects will be randomly assigned to trial
      product.
