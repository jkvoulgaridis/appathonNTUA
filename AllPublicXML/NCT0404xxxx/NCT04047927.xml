  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The EpiFinder device, which is the investigational device in this study, is intended for use
      in epidural procedures, between a luer syringe and an epidural needle, to give the treating
      physician a clear indication that the needle tip has entered the epidural space. The
      objective of this First In Human study is to evaluate the safety and performance of using the
      EpiFinder to identify the epidural space in subjects with a clinical indication to receive a
      lumbar Epidural Steroid Injections.

    <description>cumulative incidence of device-related complications and Serious adverse events (AE), observed during the procedure and throughout the follow-up period. Device related adverse events include: dural puncture with or without headache, epidural hematoma, seizures, neurological deficit or relevant device complications.
All related and non-related adverse events will be observed on a continuous basis from the baseline through the study completion.</description>

    <description>The EpiFinder is a sensing device intended to assist physicians performing placement of epidural needle analgesic and/or anesthesia injection in a safely and accurately manner. The device is a single use sterile device consisting of a probe (Stylet), an actuator (micro DC motor), IR sensor and Controller. The device is integrated to a standard LOR Syringe and an 18G Tuohy needle and enables to simultaneously work with the standard LOR technique.</description>
