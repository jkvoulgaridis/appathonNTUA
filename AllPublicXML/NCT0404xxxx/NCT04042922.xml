  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by significant memory loss and toxic protein
      deposits (amyloid and tau) in the brain. The investigators' lab found a non-invasive way to
      remove these toxic proteins from the brain in AD mouse models. Remarkably, treated mice also
      have improved memory on behavioral testing. The investigators aim to translate this
      non-invasive method, which uses light and sound to stimulate the brain, to be used in mild
      Alzheimer's patients. 40 participants with mild Alzheimer's disease will be recruited, and
      the investigators will assess their brain waves with electroencephalogram (EEG) before,
      during, and after light and sound stimulation for safety, feasibility, and to optimize the
      stimulation device for use in the mild AD population.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is known that Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients have significant disruptions in brain
      waves, especially the gamma frequency (~30 - 100 Hz) waves. Recently, the investigators' lab
      found that gamma entrainment using light and sound stimulation, which the investigators call
      GENUS, improves memory and decreases toxic accumulation of amyloid and tau in AD mouse
      models. This study aims to translate these findings in the mouse models to be used in mild
      Alzheimer's patients. The investigators will recruit 40 patients diagnosed with mild AD who
      will be randomly assigned to two study arms. Cognitive and mental health evaluations as well
      as memory tests will be performed on all subjects. All subjects will also be exposed to the
      GENUS device, which can deliver light and sound waves at different frequencies. The GENUS
      device is composed of a panel with light-emitting diode (LED) illumination and speakers for
      auditory stimulation. Each of the 2 groups will have different combinations of light and
      sound settings. The investigators will use electroencephalography (EEG) to check for how the
      participant's brain waves respond to the stimulation, and use questionnaires to evaluate for
      safety and tolerability.

    <description>Exploratory measure to check if there is any change in n-back test performance, between baseline and immediately after the completion of the stimulation.
The n-back test involves a sequence of stimuli (e.g., letters, numbers), presented one at a time, and a subject is asked to indicate when the current stimulus is the same as the stimulus presented n times earlier in the sequence. The performance metrics will include the &quot;hit&quot; rate (number of correct responses out of total number of target stimuli; ranging from 0 to 1), &quot;false alarm&quot; rate (number of incorrect responses out of total number of non-target stimuli; ranging from 0 to 1), and response time.</description>
