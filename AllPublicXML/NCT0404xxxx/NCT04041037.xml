      A case series involving the concomitant use of MicroMatrix® and Cytal® Wound Matrix 2-Layer

      This is a prospective case series examining the concomitant use of MicroMatrix® and Cytal®
      Wound Matrix 2-Layer with standard of care negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) during the
      management of pilonidal wound healing. Wound healing will be evaluated at 2 weeks, 6 weeks,
      and 3 months. If subjects heal prior to the 3 month visit, wound healing will be documented
      at that visit. A maximum of ten subjects will be included in this series.
