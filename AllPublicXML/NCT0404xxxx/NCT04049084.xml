      This observational long-term follow-up study is designed to collect safety and efficacy data
      from ADA-SCID patients previously treated with autologous ex vivo gene therapy products based
      on the EFS-ADA LV encoding for human adenosine deaminase (ADA) gene (EFS-ADA LV), as part of
      the OTL-101 clinical development program. No investigational medicinal product will be
      administered to these patients as part of the OTL-101-6 study.

        This observational LTFU study is open for enrollment to ADA-SCID patients previously
        treated with autologous ex vivo gene therapy products based on the EFS-ADA lentiviral
        vector as part of the OTL-101 clinical development program. Patients treated in clinical
        trials as part of IND #15440, study OTL-101-5 (EudraCT No 2017-001275-23) or study 10-MI-29
        (EudraCT No 2010-024253-36), as well as in Expanded Access or Compassionate Use Programs,
        will be eligible for enrollment.
