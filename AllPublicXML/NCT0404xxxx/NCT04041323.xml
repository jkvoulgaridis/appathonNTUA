  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common complication in critically ill patients. Based on the
      sensitive KDIGO criteria, the incidence of AKI on ICU varies between 30-60 %. These large
      variations of incidence of AKI are due to different baseline characteristics of studied
      patients, the length of observation period, use of creatinine criteria only or use of
      creatinine and urine output criteria. Furthermore, back estimation of baseline creatinine
      instead of measured creatinine in patients with missing laboratory values may lead to
      overestimation of AKI severity and outcomes. Major surgery, trauma, infection, sepsis or a
      complication of severe illness can lead to an abrupt decrease in glomerular filtration in
      critically ill patients. Such episode of AKI is associated with short term adverse effects
      such as fluid overload, electrolyte imbalance, acid-base derangements, immune dysfunction,
      coagulation abnormalities and alterations in mental status. Additionally, AKI in critically
      ill patients leads to prolonged ICU length of stay, increase in morbidity and mortality as
      well as higher costs. Multiple large studies found, after correction for potential
      confounders, that AKI was independently associated with worse outcomes. Moderate and severe
      AKI stages were associated with 2.9 - 6.9 fold increased in-hospital mortality (3).
      Increasing AKI severity in ICU patients was not only associated with increased mortality, AKI
      patients had also worse renal function at the time of hospital discharge. The individual
      condition leading to AKI in combination with increased susceptibility to AKI may
      significantly influence outcome. Indeed, current data from many studies show that mortality
      from AKI differs in various clinical settings.

      However, there are not enough data on different types of surgery and their effect on AKI yet.
      The aim of our epidemiological study is to investigate the occurrence and outcomes of AKI in
      different types of surgery in postoperative ICU patients at the Vienna General Hospital.
