  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial is a set of four independent experiments involving for each of them functional and
      structural MRI data acquisition. They aim at investigating decision making mechanisms in
      bulimia nervosa when participants have to make food or monetary choices under specific
      conditions that mimic binge eating episodes or kleptomania which are two major symptoms of
      bulimia nervosa. All experiments are cross sectional studies. Each experiment is subdivided
      into two parts: a first part without any MRI data acquisition and during which all the tasks
      are performed. This part aims at making sure that a behavioral effect is observed before
      starting MRI data acquisition. The second part aims at investigating the neural correlates
      observed in the first part and additionally, at reproducing the behavioral effects observed
      in the first part. Therefore the first part may be regarded as an independent study as
      compared to the second part.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Each part of each experiment is built of a main task, a set of secondary tasks and
      questionnaires. Only the main task changes from one experiment to another. Within each
      experiment, the only difference between the two parts is that the main task is performed
      while participants are being scanned in an MRI scanner. Details of the tasks are provided
      below. Each part of each experiment is performed over one visit only and is a cross sectional
      study. The visit is dedicated to the tasks. Questionnaires may be filled during the visit or
      at participant's home within the week following the visit for questionnaires which are not
      assessing participant's state. Questionnaires assessing participant's state are filled during
      the visit at appropriate time. The total number of participants mentioned below is the sum of
      the planned number of participants within each group, i.e. patients and healthy participants,
      within each part of each experiment.

    <description>The EDE is a semi-structured interview conducted by a trained clinician to assess the psychopathology associated with the diagnosis of an eating disorder. The EDE is rated through the use of four subscales (restraint, eating concern, weight concern, shape concern) and global score.</description>
