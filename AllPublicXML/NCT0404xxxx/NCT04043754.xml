  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently, the most positive documented outcomes of periodontal regenerative therapy (PRT) in
      intrabony defects (IBDs) have been achieved with a combination of bone grafts ( BGs) and a
      regeneration material like membranes in guided tissue regeneration ( GTR) technique. Among
      the graft materials only autogenous bone grafts ( ABGs).and demineralized freeze-dried bone
      allografts (DFDBA), are considered regenerative materials.

      Polypeptide growth factors revealed a potential application in PRT periodontal because are
      the biological mediators during wound healing and regeneration and autologous platelet
      concentrates ( PC) constitute a safe and convenient approach to deliver them.

      Among PC, platelet-rich fibrin ( PRF) belongs to a group of second-generation blood
      autologous products prepared by peripheral blood centrifugation without any nonclotting
      agent, so to obtain a dense three-dimensional clot architecture that concentrates platelets,
      fibrin, leukocytes, cytokines, and sustain cellular migration. This clot is then compressed
      to obtain elastic and very strong membranes that can be used directly as membranes or as an
      agent, after chopping, alone or in combination with BGs.

      Several studies demonstrate that PRF is effective in promoting bone regeneration (BR) when
      used alone or in combination with BG during oral/ periodontal surgery.

      To date, there are very few published clinical controlled trials that compare the results of
      PRF + BGs to the outcomes of PRF / BG alone in the treatment of IBDs and no study about PRF +
      ABG in the same defects. Only one case report tested the use of PRF + ABG mixed with bovine
      hydroxyapatite in the treatment of insufficient alveolar ridge width in aesthetic area. The
      aim of the present study is to verify if the combined use of PRF + ABG in the management of
      IBDs may be a treatment modality clinically &quot;not inferior&quot; to that with Membrane + ABG.

      This is a prospective, randomized and controlled clinical trial designed to evaluate the
      clinical and radiographic outcomes 12 months after two treatment modalities of IBDs: PRF +
      ABG into defects in the test subjects( TS); membrane + ABG in the control subjects ( CS). The
      patients enrolled exhibit unfavourable IBDs and all experimental sites will be accessed with
      a simplified papilla preservation flap ( SPPF) procedure. The filling material (ABG) is
      common to both treatments: therefore, the investigation will focus on the addictive effect of
      PRF used in place of MEMBRANE. MEMBRANE is chosen as the active control ( AC) as it is
      currently considered as the biological &quot;gold standard&quot; agent for the treatment of IBDs.

      A non-inferiority trial ( NIT) is designed to prove that using PRF instead of MEMBRANE could
      achieve a similar result, reducing the treatment's cost and allowing the clinicians to use
      autogenous material only.

      An AC (comparator) is present, but the investigators do not include a third experimental arm,
      a group of IBDs treated using Open Flap Debridement ( OFD) alone, as it is widely accepted in
      NITs.

      The estimate of the AC effect vs. placebo is assumed from a recent meta-analysis, by the
      Lower Bound of a 95% Confidence Interval ( CI) of the mean of MEMBRANE + ABG, while an OFD
      estimate from the corresponding 95%.. The difference between estimates is set as the added
      benefit of the AC and as a ground for the assay sensitivity.

      44 patients affected by moderate-to-severe chronic periodontitis, will be selected for the
      study. Each patient will participate in the study with a single experimental site. The
      participants will receive verbal and written information and they will sign a consent form
      approved by the Ethical Committee of the G. DAnnunzio University of Chieti - medical faculty.
      The study protocol is in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki of 1975, revised in
      Tokyo in 2004. Four months before the surgical treatment, all 44 patients will undergo SRP by
      ultrasonic instruments and hand curettes and motivational instructions on oral home care.

      Non-inferiority margin. A reliable estimate of the expected clinical attachment level ( CAL)
      gain from an MEMBRANE+ ABG treatment is drawn from a recent meta-analysis, reporting on 548
      IBDs in 434 patients.

      By literature, CAL gain obtainable by OFD surgical treatments alone is 2.47 mm. The
      differential effect of using MEMBRANE amounts about 1 .

      Each defect will be assigned a defect number and will be randomly allocated to one of the two
      treatment regimens. Assignment will be performed by a custom made computer-generated table.
      To conceal allocation, opaque envelopes will be assigned to the specific experimental site
      and will be opened during surgery Preoperative and 3- 6- 12-months postoperative intraoral
      standardized radiographs will be taken by the paralleling technique using an individual
      film-holder device consisting of a bite block rigidly connected to an acrylic dental splint
      to achieve identical film placement at each evaluation. Pre- and postoperative radiographs
      will be evaluated by two experienced clinicians who will be masked with respect to the
      provenience of the radiographs and the clinical measurements. The positions of alveolar crest
      level and of the bottom of the defect distance and will be marked by a pencil on the
      radiographs and bottom of the defect will be measured by a millimeter grid. Linear distances
      between the most coronal interproximal alveolar crest level and the bottom of the defect will
      be obtained by counting the walls
