      This retrospective study was proposed by the investigators to analyze treatment status and
      outcome in patients with early relapsed follicular lymphoma. In patients with follicular
      lymphoma who experienced disease progression within 24 months after initiation of treatment,
      the second-line therapy, stem cell transplantation, tumor response, progression free
      survival, and overall survival will be analyzed.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Follicular lymphoma is the second most common non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in Western countries,
      but it is relatively less frequent in Asia. As a result, the prognosis and treatment status
      in Korean patients with follicular lymphoma have been rarely studied.

      With the recent addition of monoclonal antibodies targeting CD20 into existing cytotoxic
      chemotherapy, the overall life expectancy of patients with follicular lymphoma has improved a
      lot. However, nearly 20% of these patients experience early worsening of disease within the
      first 24 months of treatment, followed by poor prognosis. Since patients with early relapse
      within 24 months usually experience worsening of disease during treatment with rituximab
      combined with chemotherapy or during rituximab maintenance therapy, optimal treatment for
      such patients is unknown, but remission induction therapy followed by stem cell
      transplantation, bendamustine combined with obinutuzumab, PI3K inhibitors, and lenalidomide
      are possible options. However, most of these drugs are limited for use in Korea, and there is
      little information with regard to treatment guidelines for patients with early relapsed
      follicular lymphoma or their treatment outcome in Korea.

      This retrospective study was proposed by the investigators to analyze treatment status and
      outcome in patients with early relapsed follicular lymphoma. This study will provide basic
      data for follicular lymphoma study in Korea and for future clinical trial design.
