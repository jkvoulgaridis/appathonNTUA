  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lately, the inappropriate used of Meropenem in critically ill patient were increased.
      Therefore, increased development of drug resistance bacteria towards Meropenem.

      As known that Carbapenem-Resistance Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) is part of complication when
      Meropenem is widely used in the intensive care unit. CRE are very difficult to treat within
      Gram negative bacteria as it encodes Carbapenemase enzyme which breaks down Carbapenem
      anti-microbial such as Meropenem. The widespread carbapenemase production in the
      Enterobacteriaceae was unknown until the early 2000 until first reported in 2001. Despite
      that, most doctors and physician favourite, and still prescribe Meropenem as the antibiotic
      of choice for the critically ill patients empirically. This is because of its broad spectrum
      of coverage for bacteria. Thus, a number of Meropenem treatment failure were increased as
      resistance increase.This study will evaluate the appropriate use of Meropenem and determine
      the predictors of Meropenem treatment failure as well as the patient outcomes.As a result, it
      can be a guidance prior prescribing the Meropenem base on patient clinical condition and
      parameters while balancing the risk and benefits of its used.
