  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aimed to explore using an APP in post oral cancer surgery to affect patients'
      needs and quality of life.

      Methods Quasi-experimental Research Design used purposeful sampling from January 1 to
      December 31 of the Far Eastern Memorial Hospital oral maxillofacial surgery ward and the
      otolaryngology ward requirement met post-treatment oral cancer patients who agreed to
      participate. Self-administered structured questionnaires, including basic personal
      information, cancer needs table short version (CNQ-SF), head and neck cancer quality of life
      scale (EORTC QLQ-H&amp;N35), were used to collect information. Results were statistically
      analyzed to understand the distribution of variables and their relationships.

      Scientific or Clinical Implication of the Expected Results Using an APP intervention in
      post-operative patients with oral cancer may be the better way to promote health and enhance
      one's quality of life.

    <textblock>
      The malignant tumor has been consecutively ranked as number one of the top ten causes of
      death over the past 33 years, and the incidence of an increase in oral cancer year by year.
      The average age of death was 55-57. With this average age compared to other cancer patients
      under 10 years of early life, it's necessary to care about the burden of disease from oral
      cancer. The main treatment of oral cancer is surgery and a combination of radiotherapy and
      chemotherapy. Patients often got severe treatment complications with varying degrees of
      physical functions and uncertainty due to poor cognition or less clarification in a complex
      course of treatment that affects medical decisions in the illness process. Both domestic and
      foreign research show that the majority of oral cancer patients expressed the need for and
      attention to health information. &quot;Treatment information&quot; was the most needed and important.
      When information needs are met, it can effectively reduce the anxiety and unease of unknown
      events. Relevant domestic and foreign research do not provide accessibility and convenience
      of health education for post-operative patients with oral cancer.

    <description>The Quality of Life scale (European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire, Core Module [EORTC QLQ-C30] and Head and Neck Module [QLQ-H&amp;N35], or EORTC QLQ-H&amp;N35) was used to represent patients' satisfaction with quality of life. The EORTC QLQ-H&amp;N35 is a 30-item self-administered global health and quality of life questionnaire with 5 scales, including physical, role, cognitive, emotional and social functioning. In addition, the measuring items included the pain, swallowing, speech, taste/smell, eating, dry mouth, coughing, opening mouth and social contact and sexuality.</description>

    <description>Care Needs Scale (the short-form Cancer Needs Questionnaire, CNQ-SF) was used to measure baseline postoperative care needs, with score 0 meaning no care need and score 100 meaning highest care need. CNQ-SF is a 32-item self-administered questionnaire to evaluate five domains of patient needs, including psychological, health information, physical and daily living, patient care and support, and interpersonal communication needs.</description>

    <description>Science and Technology Acceptance Model scale was applied to evaluate patients' response to health IT. The scale measures subjects' intention, perceived usefulness, and perceived ease of use. Effectiveness is determined by a panel of experts, including nursing experts, nursing information experts and medical information experts.</description>
