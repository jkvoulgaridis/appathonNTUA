  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research is being done to study the safety of implanting and retrieving a microdevice
      that releases up to 19 drugs directly within a cancerous lesion as a possible tool to
      evaluate the effectiveness of several approved cancer drugs against cutaneous T cell lymphoma
      and peripheral T cell lymphoma
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a Pilot and Feasibility Study, which is the first time investigators
      are examining this study microdevice loaded with drugs in patients with cutaneous lesions of
      cutaneous T cell lymphoma (CTCL) or peripheral T cell lymphoma (PTCL) patients.

      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved the use of all the drugs
      contained in the microdevice as a treatment for cutaneous or peripheral T cell lymphoma. All
      drugs used in this study are FDA approved. Some drugs are for different cancer indications.
      Romidepsin, vorinostat, bexarotene, brentuximab vedotin, pralatrexate, and mogamulizumab have
      been FDA approved for CTCL. The FDA has not approved the use of the microdevice as a tool to
      identify what cancer treatment is best for any disease.

      In this research study, the investigators are investigating whether the microdevice loaded
      with 19 drugs can be safely inserted in and removed from cancerous skin lesion. The
      microdevice was developed as a tool with the ultimate goal to help screen several existing
      and investigational drugs directly within a patient's tumor to identify what drugs are the
      most effective for treating a patient's cancer.

      This microdevice was investigated in laboratory studies and shown to help identify what drugs
      could be effective in treating a specific cancer type. The microdevice was able to release
      drugs only to the immediately surrounding tumor tissue in concentrations of one millionth of
      what is normally needed for a therapeutic dose. The microdevice can be retrieved along with a
      few millimeters of surrounding treated tumor tissue for analysis of tumor response to drug.

    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>&quot;Failure&quot; will be considered any of the following:
Any grade 3 or 4 adverse events associated with device placement or retrieval
Any device resulting in &quot;major&quot; adverse events as listed below:
device unable to be found or unable to be retrieved
device invading into vessel or device embolism
infection or severe tissue damage or abnormal wound healing associated with device or procedure (as deemed by a neutral consultant e.g. dermatologist, ID specialist or surgeon)
severe allergic/hypersensitivity reaction
severe bleeding
Any device resulting in *two or more* &quot;minor&quot; adverse events as listed below:
device migration more than 10 mm
device fracture not causing a major adverse event
mild allergic/hypersensitivity reaction
manageable pain associated with biopsy procedure
minor bleeding For purposes of this endpoint, safety will be evaluated on a per-patient level, where an event is defined as any &quot;failure&quot; observed among all implanted devices.</description>

    <measure>To Retrieve The Device With Sufficient Tissue Of Sufficient Quality</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>For the feasibility endpoint, a &quot;successful&quot; procedure will be defined as the ability to retrieve the device (by either skin punch biopsy tool or surgical excision) without damaging tumor tissue surrounding the microdevice to allow for immunohistochemistry analysis.
For purposes of this endpoint, feasibility will be assessed on a per-device basis rather than a per-patient basis, with each device considered relatively independent in terms of placement, retrieval, and analysis.</description>

    <measure>To Identify Genomic And Transcriptomic Biomarkers of Drug Response by Whole Exome and RNA Sequencing and Subsequent Correlations To Microdevice Predicted Tumor Response</measure>
    <time_frame>5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Genetic alterations will be cataloged in terms of single nucleotide variants, insertions/deletions, and copy number changes and will be reported in a descriptive manner. Preliminary correlations between a specific genetic feature and specific clinical features will be tested using Fisher's exact test for categorical variables or the Wilcoxon Rank-Sum test for continuous variables. Analyses of correlations between genetic and clinical features in different specimen types and patient groups are exploratory, and will rely on descriptive statistics without formal hypothesis testing. For each genetic feature of interest (e.g. mutation, gene expression profile) we will divide patient samples into groups based on the presence or absence of the feature. We will then assess whether the presence of the feature is associated with clinical outcomes using odds ratios, or correlation between genetic feature and overall survival, using Kaplan Meier estimates, with 95% confidence intervals to each.</description>

             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.

          -  Patients who will receive standard of care systemic therapy are not allowed to start
             any new skin directed therapy (e.g. topical steroids, radiation, phototherapy)
             concurrent with first systemic therapy initiated after device implantation and
             retrieval. Should a patient clinically progress on first systemic therapy and require
             a change in treatment, skin directed therapies may be introduced.
