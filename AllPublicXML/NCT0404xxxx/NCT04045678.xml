    <description>The Unified Parkinson´s Disease Rating Scale Part Ⅱ measures &quot;Activities in Daily Living&quot;. The total score ranges from 0 (Best score possible) to 52 (Worst score possible).
The Unified Parkinson´s Disease Rating Scale Part Ⅲ is an accepted and validated scale for the assessment of motor function in Parkinson´s disease. Each of the 27 sub-items in the UPDRS III is measured on a scale of 0 to 4, where 0 is normal and 4 represents severe abnormalities. The total scores therefore ranges from 0 to 108.</description>
