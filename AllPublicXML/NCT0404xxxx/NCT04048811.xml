  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, randomized, open-label, positive-controlled (propofol) phase II
      clinical trial. The study plans to enroll approximately 46 eligible subjects. Among them, 40
      subjects will be randomly assigned to HSK3486 treatment group (30 cases) and propofol control
      group (10 cases) in a ratio of 3:1. The subjects will be enrolled competitively at all study
      sites. Upon enrollment of the 40 subjects, 6 more subjects will be enrolled by West China
      Hospital of Sichuan University. These 6 subjects will not be randomized, but will directly
      enter into propofol induction + HSK3486 maintenance group for study.

For the subsequent enrolled subjects, the investigator could adjust the subsequent initial maintenance dose according to the dose response of the first 6 subjects, so as to explore the optimal initial maintenance dose. The range of the initial maintenance dose is 1 (± 0.5) mg/kg/h, i.e. the minimum initial maintenance dose should not be less than 0.5 mg/kg/h, and the maximum should not be more than 1.5 mg/kg/h.</description>
