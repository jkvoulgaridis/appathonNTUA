  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The wound healing is a process occurring in response to dermal injury. The resulting scar may
      have various characteristics ranging from fine-line and asymptomatic to hypertrophic scars
      and keloids. Prevention or early treatment of pathological scars is the most appropriate
      approach. Among available remedies, gels and patches containing onion extract and allantoin
      have been demonstrated to be safe and effective in patients with scars of various origins and
      severity.

      One of the most used natural products is a patch containing allium cepa and allantoin
      licensed for treatment of the scars including keloids. However, up to date, no controlled
      studies have evaluated the effects of such a device in women who have undergone Cesarean
      delivery. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of this patch on
      Cesarean section (C-section) scars.

      This is an observational non-interventional study. Women who underwent C-section were
      consecutively recruited at University Hospital of Salerno. Taking into account the number of
      C-section the study population was divided into two groups: Group A included subjects without
      a prior history of C-section, group B subjects who had already undergone previous C-section.
      At baseline after stitches removal, scars assessment was made using digital photographs and
      the validate Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale (POSAS). After 4 weeks, during the
      outpatient visit, women from both group A and B were asked whether had applied some natural
      products on the scars or not. In this occasion, the C-section of the women who had applied a
      patch containing allium cepa and allantoin as well as those of women who had not used any
      products (who represented the control group) were re-evaluated as at baseline. The Observers
      were blinded. One of them performed the scars assessment at baseline, the other one after 4
      weeks. During the outpatient visit an informed consent for participation was obtained by all
      the subjects costituing the study population. The participation to the study was voluntary

        The study population was represented by adult women, subdivided in two groups, A and B on
        the basis of the number of Cesearean delivery. Group A included subjects without a prior
        history of Cesarean delivery, Group B subjects who had already undergone previous Cesarean
        delivery. All the women were enrolled at University Hospital of Salerno, were &gt;=18 years
        old without hypersensitivity to any constituent of the patch, who have not experienced
        pre-term birth, obesity, gestational diabetes, hypertension, infections, dermatologic
        diseases and use of both systemic and topic corticosteroids. All the partecipants were
