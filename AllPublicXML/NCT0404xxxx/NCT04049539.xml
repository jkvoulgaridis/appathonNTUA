  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the side effects and how well Vyxeos works in treating patients
      with intermediate and high-risk acute myeloid leukemia who have failed an initial cycle of
      standard cytarabine and daunorubicin chemotherapy. Vyxeos is a combination of both
      chemotherapy drugs cytarabine and daunorubicin contained in a liposome. Drugs used in
      chemotherapy, such as cytarabine and daunorubicin, work in different ways to stop the growth
      of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping
      them from spreading. Cytarabine and daunorubicin given together in liposomes may have fewer
      side effects and work better than cytarabine and daunorubicin given alone in patients with
      acute myeloid leukemia.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To demonstrate the safety and estimate the efficacy of liposome-encapsulated
      daunorubicin-cytarabine (Vyxeos) in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients who have failed to
      achieve a hypocellular marrow after an initial course of 7+3.

      SECONDARY AND/OR EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determination of rate of morphologic leukemia-free state (MLFS). II. Determination of
      progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) at 2 years.

      III. Mass cytometric measurement relative clearance of quiescent leukemia stem/repopulating
      cells (LSCs) and blasts as compared to the same patient's preceding cycle of 7+3 and to a
      separate control population receiving re-induction with traditional 7+3.

      IIIa. Measurement of blast cell cycle fraction before and after Vyxeos treatment.

      IIIb. Relative clearance immunophenotypically abnormal blast and stem cells after Vyxeos.

      IIIc. Comparison of efficacy of blast cell and LSC elimination in patients receiving Vyxeos
      re-induction compared to similar blast cells and LSCs in patients receiving standard 7+3 or
      5+2 re-induction.

      OUTLINE:

      Within 14-26 days after the start of previous cycle of chemotherapy, patients receive
      liposome-encapsulated daunorubicin-cytarabine intravenously (IV) over 90 minutes on days 1,
      3, and 5 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up weekly for 60 days, then at
      least monthly for 2 years.

             mg/m^2 on days 1-3) within the 14-26 days prior to starting trial treatment and have
             documented persistent disease (13-22 days from the start of 7+3 treatment). Patients
             who have received a 7+3 regimen utilizing idarubicin (12 mg/m^2 on days 1-3) in place
             of daunorubicin may enroll. Persistent disease will be defined as bone marrow

             of immunophenotypically aberrant leukemia cells in the bone marrow. The final
             determination of persistent AML will be made by the treating physician, but must meet
             National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) criteria for persistent disease.
             Enrollment of patients with less than 20% cellularity or less than 10% blasts will
             require approval of the principal investigator. Patients who received concomitant
             treatment with another targeted therapy for AML (e.g. midostaurin) during initial
             induction may enroll, but will not continue to receive this treatment during Vyxeos
             treatment

          -  Total bilirubin &lt; 1.5 x ULN (except for patients with known Gilbert?s syndrome) for
             the local laboratory

          -  Calculated creatinine clearance (according to the Cockcroft-Gault equation) &gt; 40
             mL/min OR serum creatinine &lt; 1.5 x the ULN for the local laboratory

          -  Female patients of childbearing potential must agree to use two forms of contraception
             from screening visit until 6 months following the last dose of study treatment. Female
             patients must have a documented negative pregnancy test

          -  Male patients of childbearing potential having intercourse with females of
             childbearing potential must agree to abstain from heterosexual intercourse or have
             their partner use two forms of contraception from screening visit until 90 days until
             the last dose of study treatment. They must also refrain from sperm donation from
             screening visit until 90 days following the last dose of study treatment

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Acute promyelocytic leukemia (or M3 AML)

          -  Patients known to have core binding factor AML (defined as presence of t(8;21),

             after the last dose Vyxeos

          -  Patients with uncontrolled infection shall not be enrolled until infection is treated
             and brought under control. As infection is a common feature of AML, patients with
             active infections are permitted to enroll provided that the infection is under control

          -  Patients who have received an investigational agent (for any indication) within 5
             half-lives of the agent and until toxicity from this has resolved to grade 1 or less;
             if the half-life of the agent is unknown, patients must wait 4 weeks prior to first
             dose of study treatment. An investigational agent is one for which there is no

             hamper compliance with study treatment and follow-up

          -  Any other significant medical condition, including psychiatric illness or laboratory
             abnormality, that would preclude the patient participating in the trial or would
             confound the interpretation of the results of the trial

             including, but not limited to, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina
             pectoris, serious cardiac arrhythmia, myocardial infarction within 6 months prior to
             enrollment, New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III or IV heart failure, severe
             uncontrolled ventricular arrhythmias, or electrocardiographic evidence of acute
             ischemia or active conduction system abnormalities

          -  Other malignancy currently requiring active therapy (except minor surgery for
             non-melanoma skin cancer and for hormonal/anti-hormonal treatment, e.g. in prostate or
