    <textblock>
      The study is a follow-up of a randomized controlled study performed in 2011-2012 with
      medication reviews in elderly patients in Sweden. Additional data about mortality and
      hospital admissions have been collected.

      Background Drug-related problems among the elderly population are common and increasing.
      Multi-professional medication reviews (MR) have arisen as a method to optimize drug therapy
      for frail elderly patients. Research has not yet been able to show conclusive evidence of the
      effect of MRs on mortality or hospital admissions. Aim The aim of this study was to assess
      the impact of MRs' on hospital admissions and mortality after six and 12 months in a frail
      population of 369 patients in primary care in a randomized controlled study. Methods Patients
      were blindly randomized to an intervention group (receiving MRs) and a control group
      (receiving usual care). Descriptive data on mortality and hospital admissions at six and 12
      months were collected. Survival analysis was performed for time to death and time to the
      first hospital admission within 12 months.
