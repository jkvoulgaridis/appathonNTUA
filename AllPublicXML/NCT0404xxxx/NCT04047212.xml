  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Periodontitis is a widely prevalent disease worldwide that has serious public health
      consequences. Its prognosis includes tooth loss and edentulism, a condition that negatively
      affects chewing causing functional disability; and esthetics causing social impairment.
      Consequently, periodontitis may end up causing marked impairment of the quality of life of
      the affected patients, impairment of general health and increasing the dental care costs
      significantly.

      Dysbiotic changes in the oral microbiome arise after some microbial species are enriched by
      primary products resulting from tissue breakdown due to gingivitis. It then triggers the host
      cells to produce proteinases that mediate loss of marginal periodontal ligaments, apical
      migration of the junctional epithelium and apical spread of bacterial biofilm.

      However, the dysbiotic changes may be more likely to occur in some patients rather than
      others due to certain risk factors including smoking and immune-inflammatory responses. Thus,
      the severity of periodontal disease in these patients would be higher. Tobacco smoking is no
      longer considered to be a habit, but a dependence to nicotine and a chronic relapsing medical
      disorder. Among its detrimental effects on general health, tobacco smoking increases the risk
      of periodontitis by 2 to 5 folds. This takes place by increasing the dysbiotic changes in the
      oral microbiome and so, increasing the severity and extent of the periodontal disease at a
      younger age. Therefore, smoking has been considered as a modifying factor of periodontitis
      that should be considered upon periodontitis case grading definition.

      Therefore, this research aims to identify the difference in dysbiosis between the three
      categories of periodontitis, trying to understand the cause of the resistance of each
      category to treatment compared to the milder category.
