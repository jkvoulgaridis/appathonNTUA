      The primary objective is to evaluate the efficacy of monthly 225 mg sc fremanezumab in adult
      patients with migraine and major depressive disorder (MDD)

      The secondary objectives are to evaluate the efficacy of monthly 225 mg sc of fremanezumab in
      adult patients with migraine and MDD on the reduction of MDD symptoms, responder rates in
      monthly migraine days, improving quality of life, improving disability, and the safety and
      tolerability of monthly 225 mg sc and quarterly 675 mg sc fremanezumab in adult patients with
      migraine and MDD.

      The total duration of patient participation in the study is planned to be approximately 28
      weeks.

             for the treatment of migraine.

          -  The participant has a history of major depressive disorder (MDD) at least 12 months
             prior to the screening visit. Participants may take a single medication prescribed for
             the treatment of depression as long as the dose of that medication has been stable for
             at least 8 weeks prior to the screening visit and expects to remain at the stable dose
             throughout the study.

          -  The participant has a body weight ≥ 45 kg and a body mass index within the range of
