  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Non-encapsulated (free) heme, a breakdown component of hemoglobin, is associated with
      oxidative stress and inflammation with consequent cellular and tissue injury (Ryter &amp;
      Tyrrell, 2000) (D T G Wagener, et al., 2001). Cardiopulmonary bypass is known to cause trauma
      to cellular components of the blood, to trigger an inflammatory response, and alter the
      rheology of the circulation. Prior research has demonstrated an increase in levels of free
      heme with cardiopulmonary bypass (Wetz, Richardt, Schotola, Bauer, &amp; Br√§uer, 2017) (Kubota,
      Egi, &amp; Mizobuchi, 2017). The stress response to cardiac surgery and utilization of blood
      salvage techniques independent of cardiopulmonary bypass may affect plasma free heme levels
      as well as regulation of heme metabolism pathways. It is unclear whether and to what degree
      plasma levels of free heme may vary at discreet time points in the perioperative period
      during cardiac surgery involving both cardiopulmonary bypass and &quot;off-pump&quot; techniques.

      This is an observational, prospective cohort study in which we will assess for red blood cell
      trauma, free heme levels, and biomarkers for acute kidney injury at various time points
      throughout cardiac surgery. Urine and arterial blood samples will be collected at our
      routine, standard of care time points pre-, intra-, and post-operatively and in addition to
      the standard clinical tests that will be performed (arterial blood gas analysis and activated
      clotting time) several additional serum biomarkers will be analyzed. Clinical correlation
      will be performed with levels. Sub-analysis will be performed on the basis of off vs. on pump
      CABG cases and also in patient that do/not develop AKI post-operatively.

    <textblock>
      Previous investigations have demonstrated increased levels of free heme in patients
      undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting utilizing cardiopulmonary bypass. There is
      evidence of an association between elevations in free heme levels and risk of developing
      acute kidney injury. The degree of alterations in free heme levels and the heme metabolism
      pathway in patients undergoing valvular repair or replacement, durable mechanical ventricular
      assist device placement, or aortic aneurysm repair has not been well characterized.
      Furthermore, free heme levels after coronary artery bypass grafting without utilization of
      cardiopulmonary bypass have not been described previously. Cell salvage techniques
      independent of cardiopulmonary bypass are known to be potentially traumatic to the cellular
      components of blood and this relationship has not been thoroughly explored in the cardiac
      surgery population. Lastly, there is scarce prior work attempting to assess the interplay
      between free heme levels and novel biomarkers of acute kidney injury.

    <measure>Red Blood Cell Stability</measure>
    <time_frame>This outcome will be measured by analyzing the difference in heme levels after surgery to the levels of heme before the surgery. Generally, this time frame would be no greater than from one hour prior to induction to one hour post operation.</time_frame>
    <description>We will be looking at the level of red blood cell damage that occurs during cardiac surgery. This will be examined by measuring the level of non-encapsulated heme levels in enrolled patients. The concept is that the body can respond to a certain amount of heme, which is a component of hemoglobin that rises as red blood cells are damaged in vivo.</description>
