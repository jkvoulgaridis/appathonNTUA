  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), one of the most common liver dysfunctions, affects
      about one-fourth of the global adult population and has a significant mortality rate between
      6.3% and 33%.NAFLD can lead to other serious illnesses. The disease is associated with a
      group of metabolic comorbid conditions, including type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), obesity,
      hypertension, and hyper-cholesterolemia, which are potential risk factors for progressive
      liver disease.This study sought to evaluate the therapeutic effect of berberine on the liver
      function and metabolic profiles of patients with NAFLD. In this context,A six week,
      open-label randomized controlled trial was conducted in a single medical center at Takestan
      Hospital, Iran. A total of 281 patients with NAFLD were enrolled and randomly assigned to
      treatment arm with (n=24) or without (n=24) berberine. All patients had received
      pre-randomization lifestyle training including recommendations on low-fat diet. Blood
      examinations were performed to evaluate glucose, lipid profile, and liver enzymes both at the
      beginning of the study and upon the completion of the trial (day 45). To assess tolerability
      of the study intervention and any possible adverse events, patients in both groups were
      required to attend weekly follow-up visits.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A seven-week (45-day), open-label, randomized controlled trial was conducted in a medical
      center affiliated with the Ministry of Welfare and Social Security in Iran to study the
      impact of berberine on liver function and metabolic profiles of patients with NAFLD. Hospital
      employees who met the enrollment criteria were identified through electronic health records
      (EHRs) available in a human resource database of employee routine annual examinations. Using
      a computer-generated random-allocation sequence, eligible employees were equally assigned
      (1:1) to berberine 6.25 g per day (arm A) or no intervention (Arm B). Berberine was
      administered orally (100 g dried berberine in 5 Liter water boiled at 167°F until 4Liter).).
      To control the potential impact of confounders on outcome measures, and to balance the daily
      dietary and physical activity among the study groups, all participants were trained by
      skilled experts on lifestyle and behavior improvement.
