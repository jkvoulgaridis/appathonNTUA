  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cochlear Implantation is a system developed to restore hearing in people with profound
      sensorineural hearing loss, whose classical hearing aids are ineffective. Surgery is
      necessary to insert the internal part into the cochlea and requires milling the mastoid to
      access the round window. This approach is technically difficult, and is performed under a
      microscope by an experienced surgeon. The development of a surgical technique that is both
      safer and less invasive is currently possible thanks to robotics.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The ROSA robot coupled to the O-Arm scanner will guide the milling to the round window, whose
      path has been previously modeled, with the identification of the facial nerve. Milling will
      be done in 2 stages with a CT (computerised tomography scan) and electromyographic
      verification of the facial nerve. The insertion of the implant will be performed manually
      under endoscopic control. The preoperative and postoperative course of the patient will be
      identical.
