  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To provide preliminary evidence about feasibility and acceptability of delivering PrEP to
      AGYW identified as potentially at high risk of HIV infection in Lilongwe city communities and
      two public facilities in Lilongwe, Malawi. The primary objective of the study is to assess
      the feasibility, acceptability, tolerability and cost of delivering PrEP among high-risk AGYW
      aged 18-24 years and healthcare providers in urban Lilongwe. Secondary objectives are (i) to
      assess the program's ability to enroll and retain a PrEP cohort for one year and (ii) measure
      the incidence of HIV infection among high risk AGYW in urban Lilongwe among women who decline
      to enroll in the PrEP study (these will be offered enrollment in the HIV incidence study).

      The main goal of the study is to provide preliminary evidence about feasibility and
      acceptability of delivering PrEP to AGYW identified as potentially at high risk of HIV
      infection in Lilongwe city communities and two public facilities in Lilongwe, Malawi. The
      primary objectives are to; determine HIV prevalence among all AGYW identified as potentially
      at high risk of HIV infection in urban Lilongwe; assess the HIV program's ability to enroll
      and retain the PrEP cohort for one year; assess participants' and providers' perceptions of
      the barriers and facilitators for providing PrEP to inform implementation of PrEP study and
      future interventions and assess the cost of PrEP delivery in the routine HIV program.

      Secondary Objectives:

        1. To measure annual HIV incidence in a prospective cohort of HIV-negative AGYW identified
           as potentially at high risk of HIV infection but declined to enroll in PrEP cohort study
           in urban Lilongwe.

        2. To measure annual HIV incidence among HIV-negative AGYW who enrolled in PrEP cohort
           study in urban Lilongwe.

        3. To determine risk factors for HIV in a cohort of AGYW recruited in the prospective
           cohort study

    <intervention_model_description>A non- randomized study design being implemented in 2 facilities in Lilongwe Urban. The first component is a cross-sectional study of AGYW in which HIV testing counselors will offer HIV tests and assess HIV risk. A sample of AGYW testing HIV-negative and established to be at high risk will be consented to enroll in the PrEP study. In the second component, AGYW who refuse PrEP will be consented to enroll in an HIV incidence cohort study and will be followed every 3 months for 12 months to determine HIV incidence. In the third component, AGYW who consent will be enrolled in a PrEP study. The PrEP study has two phases, which are, (i) a formative qualitative study involving AGYW and PrEP providers to understand factors and barriers to delivering PrEP to AGYW and (ii) a feasibility study of delivering PrEP to HIV negative AGYW. AGYW will be followed every 3 months for 12 months to determine incidence, assess factors and costs of delivering PrEP to AGYW.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>AGYW who are eligible for PrEP will be educated about the risk and benefits. For AGYW (aged 18-24 years) who consent to PrEP, an ART provider (nurse or clinician) certified by the MOH will provide PrEP (package of disoproxil fumarate/emtricitabine (Truvada)) on the same day that the client is determined eligible. Peer navigators will ensure linkage to facilities for follow-up care. The initial follow-up visit will occur one month from PrEP initiation to ensure that the client is tolerating the regimen and to answer any questions, with three-month follow-up visits thereafter.</description>
