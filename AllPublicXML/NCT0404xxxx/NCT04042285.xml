  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetic wounds post digital amputation have poor healing in 30-45% of cases, resulting in
      75% of patients undergoing a further amputation within the year, despite best wound
      management.

      Extracorporeal shockwave therapy is a promising safe and non invasive treatment that has been
      shown to improve healing in chronic ulcers and burns by promoting healing and decreasing risk
      of infection.

      The study will recruit patients on a hospital ward who have undergone a toe amputation for a
      infected non healing diabetic foot ulcer. Participants will be informed about the study,
      given an patient information sheet and invited to give informed consent.

      Consenting participants will undergo shockwave therapy three times in the seven days after
      their operation, in addition to standard wound care.

      Wound measurements, blood perfusion, tissue integrity, quality of life and pain scores will
      be recorded at baseline, after the third treatment, 4 weeks, 8 weeks and 12 weeks after
      recruitment to the study.

      The study aims to recruit 25 patients.

      The results will be compared to a matched retrospective cohort group who received standard
      wound care.
