      The study investigates non-alcoholic fatty liver disease from serial liver biopsies collected
      from participants referred for assessment of bariatric surgery, RYGB or SG.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is an increasing health care problem closely
      related to obesity and has become the most common cause of chronic liver disease in developed
      countries. Today, bariatric surgery is the most efficient treatment of morbid obesity in
      terms of a rapid and sustained loss of weight. In addition, bariatric surgery is accompanied
      by improvement of weight-related comorbidities including features of the metabolic syndrome
      and possibly regression of the entire NAFLD spectrum.

      The study is designed as an observational study including 40 patients referred to
      laparoscopic bariatric surgery (either RYGB or SG). The primary endpoint is change in NAFLD
      activity score (NAS) in serial liver biopsies collected from participants. Additional tests
      include blood samples, anthropometry measurements, Fibroscan and full body dual-energy X-ray
      absorptiometry (DEXA) scan performed together with each biopsy.

      This unique model of serial liver biopsies in morbidly obese patients referred to bariatric
      surgery (RYGB or SG), combined with state-of-the-art technologies and bioinformatics, will
      provide important information about the effects of weight loss on NASH. The results will
      improve our understanding of the underlying mechanisms with the potential of identifying new
      potential NASH targets or diagnostic biomarkers.

    <description>Change in NAFLD activity score (NAS). Assessment of NAS, a standardized tool for assessment of liver histology, is often used for quantification of disease activity, allowing comparison of biopsies in clinical studies and improved reproducibility. The NAS is defined as the sum of scores for steatosis (0-3), lobular inflammation (0-3) and ballooning degeneration (0-2)</description>
