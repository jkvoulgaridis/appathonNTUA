  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is two-fold: 1) to examine the feasibility of the Drop-In model of
      Family Nurture Intervention (FNI); and 2) to collect pilot data concerning the mother's
      response to the Drop-In model of FNI and short term effects of participation. Feasibility of
      the Program will be measured through costs, staffing, space availability, and uptake.
      Participation in the Drop-In entails weekly visits for FNI. The investigators hypothesize
      that the Family Nurture Intervention will show feasibility through attendance and positive
      response to the Drop-In format. The investigators also expect the Family Nurture Intervention
      to improve mother's perceived well-being and mother-child emotional connection.

    <textblock>
      Family Nurture Intervention (FNI) is a novel family-based program that facilitates
      mother-child emotional connection and co-regulation. Many current interventions aim at
      helping the child to self-regulate with or without the mother's help. However, the ability of
      the mother-child dyad to promote optimal development is dependent on their ability to
      co-regulate. The interactive co-regulation between the mother and the child shapes the
      behavior of both the mother and the child.

      This study aims to investigate the feasibility and short term effects of participation in the
      Family Nurture Intervention for preschool aged children with developmental and behavior
      problems. Mothers and children will be engaged by Nurture Specialists in comforting and
      calming interactions to co-regulate with each other during weekly group sessions with the
      support of study staff. Intervention sessions will occur over the course of eight weeks, and
      each mother will decide how many sessions to attend.

    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Mother-child 5-minute videotaped interactions, recorded weekly after each session, will be assessed for social engagement and emotional connection via the Welch Emotional Connection Screen (WECS).
The Welch Emotional Connection Scale (WECS) construct is emotional connection between mother and child, which the investigators hypothesize predicts optimal development. There are four items on the WECS: Mutual Attraction, Mutual Vocal Exchange, Mutual Facial Engagement, and Mutual Sensitivity/Reciprocity. Each item is rated on a scale from 1 to 3 in 0.25 increments with a score of 3 considered optimal. There is also a binary question to the rater asking if the pair is emotionally connected - yes or no. The mother and child are scored as a pair, not individually.</description>

    <description>The mother-child pair will be asked to talk and play with each other as the pair customarily does. If the child becomes restless and dysregulated, the mother will be coached by the Nurture Specialist to bring the child back into a calm state through sustained physical contact, comforting touch, soothing words and eye contact. Each dyad will be offered eight group FNI sessions.</description>
