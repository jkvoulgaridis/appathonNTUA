  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with critical limb ischaemia (CLI) are at risk of losing their limb and/or life and
      therefore have no option but to undergo bypass or amputation surgery. This presents a major
      physical challenge to the body and patients with low fitness will struggle to overcome the
      effects of the surgical trauma. Currently there is a high risk of a poorer outcome for CLI
      patients than with most other surgical procedures, as demonstrated by high rates of
      complications (20-46%) and 30 day mortality (7.5-13.5%). Up to 30% of people will die within
      the first year. Exercise and respiratory muscle training, before surgery, has shown a
      reduction in complications in other surgical specialties.

      Around 50% of CLI patients present as an emergency, meaning training before admission is not
      feasible, so the Investigator proposes to see if training during the hospital stay will aid a
      better recovery. However, as this has not been done in vascular surgical patients the
      investigator needs to initially test if this intervention is possible in this patient group
      in an acute hospital setting.The aim of this proof of concept single cohort study is to
      assess whether an exercise intervention, started on hospital admission and continued
      post-surgery, for the duration of the hospital admission, is safe, acceptable, well tolerated
      and feasible to run in an acute ward setting.

      The exercise regime will include daily upper limb aerobic (hand bike) and inspiratory muscle
      training (POWERbreathe) and upper body strength training every second day until discharge.
      The Investigator will assess safety by recording adverse events and acceptability by
      adherence to exercise programme and qualitative interviews. The Investigator will evaluate
      processes and completeness of data collection and describe before and after measures of
      physical fitness.
