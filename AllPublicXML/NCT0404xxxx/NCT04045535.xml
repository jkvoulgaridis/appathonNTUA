  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this investigation is to evaluate the effectiveness of a multicomponent
      structured physical exercise program for adults aged 65 years or more, classified as
      pre-frail and with chronic pain to improve the Perceived Health Related Quality of Life,
      compared with usual care.

    <textblock>
      Design: Randomized controlled, pragmatic clinical trial with two groups and 3 months
      follow-up.

      Unit of randomization: Patient. Unit of analysis: Patient. Setting: A Primary Health Care
      Center in the Spanish Autonomous Community of Madrid.

      Population: Pre-frail patients aged 65 years or more with chronic pain. Intervention:
      Multicomponent structured physical exercise program. Control group: Usual care. Variables:
      Perceived Health Related Quality of Life (EuroQol 5D-5L), Pain Intensity (Visual Analogue
      Scale), Frailty (SHARE-Frailty Index), Physical Performance (Short Physical Performance
      Battery, SPPB), Depression (Yesavage).

      Analysis: Mean change differences after 3 months in EQ5D dimensions between groups with CI
      95%. Mean differences or proportion differences will be calculated according to variable
      characteristics between groups with appropriate statistical test.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Perceived Health Related Quality of Life</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline at 2 and 5 months</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of life assessed by EuroQol 5 Dimen (EQ5D-5L) Scale. It consist on a Quality Index (Range 0-1) calculated from scores of 5 dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression) with value for Spain set and a Visual Analog Scale (Range 0: Worst possible health-100: Best possible health).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain Intensity</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline at 2 and 5 months</time_frame>
    <description>Pain Intensity was assessed by McGill Pain Questionnaire's Visual Analog Scale (VAS). It consists on a 100mm horizontal line in which patient points the intensity of his pain. It is measured from left to right. Left side of the line (0 millimeters, mm) means &quot;no pain&quot; and it is the minimum score and right side of the line (100mm) means &quot;pain as worst as you can imagine&quot; and it is maximum score. Lower punctuation meana better outcomes.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Frailty Status</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline at 2 and 5 months</time_frame>
    <description>Frailty Status assessed by SHARE-FI (Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement Frailty Index). It consists on summarizing the response to 5 criteria (exhaustion, weight loss, weakness, slowness and low active) in a discreet factor (DFS). Scores are different for men and women.
Women: If predicted DFS &lt; 0.31, NON-FRAIL; If predicted DFS &lt; 2.13, PRE-FRAIL; If predicted DFS &lt; 6, FRAIL Men: If predicted DFS &lt; 1.21, NON-FRAIL; If predicted DFS &lt; 3.00, PRE-FRAIL; If predicted DFS &lt; 7, FRAIL</description>

    <measure>Physical Performance</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline at 2 and 5 months</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed by Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB). It evaluates balance, walk speed and sitting and standing in a chair. Each Item is scored 0-4 points. Yielding a total between 0 (worst physical performance ) and 12 (best physical performance).</description>

    <measure>Depression</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline at 2 and 5 months</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed by ultra-short Yesavage Scale (Geriatric Depression Scale, GDS-5). It consist on 5 questions of the GDS-15 questionnaire (Range:0-5. Cutpoint for depression: 2).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Basic Activities of Daily Living (bADL)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline at 2 and 5 months</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed by Barthel Scale. It assesses the help needed with ten variables: feeding, bathing, grooming, dressing, urinary incontinence, faecal incontinence, toilet use, transfers bed to chair, mobility and climbing stairs. (Range: 0: Full Dependence - 100: Independence for bADL).</description>

    <measure>Satisfaction with the intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>At 2 months</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed with Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ-8). It consist on 8 questions (four ranged 4: most satisfaction-1: least satisfaction and four ranged 1: most satisfaction -4 least satisfaction)</description>
