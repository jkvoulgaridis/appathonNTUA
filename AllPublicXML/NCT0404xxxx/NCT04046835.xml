  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pectus excavatum is the most common anterior chest wall deformity, affecting up to 1:400 of
      newborns. The current gold standard to quantify the extent of deformity is by calculating the
      Haller Index based on a Computed Tomography (CT)-scan. However, as such scans inescapably
      imply exposure to ionizing radiation, novel imaging techniques have been investigated.
      Three-dimensional optical surface scanning is a promising new technique to acquire the
      trunks' three-dimensional (3D) surface topography. Based on this 3D scan, one is able to
      calculate the external Haller Index that is known to highly correlate with the conventional
      gold standard Haller Index that is based on internal measures. Both the conventional and
      external Haller Index are known to be affected by the respiratory phase in which the scan is
      acquired, however, what is the effect of patient position on the external Haller Index, and
      if affected, how should one correct for this phenomenon? To investigate this, a retrospective
      single-centre pilot study will be conducted.
