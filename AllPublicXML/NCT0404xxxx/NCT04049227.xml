  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This early phase I trial studies how well abemaciclib and letrozole work in treating patients
      with endometrial cancer and determines whether there are changes in patients' cancer cell
      biomarkers (a genetic feature or specific protein) for cell growth before and after
      treatment. Antihormone therapy with aromatase inhibitors, such as letrozole, may lessen the
      amount of estrogen made by the body. Abemaciclib blocks the activities of a class of proteins
      called cyclin-dependent kinase, which are involved in cell duplication. Giving letrozole and
      abemaciclib together may slow down cancer cell growth in patients with endometrial cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine whether there are changes in Ki-67 expression from the pretreatment specimen
      (e.g. biopsy or dilation and curettage [D&amp;C]) to the post-treatment hysterectomy specimen
      following treatment with letrozole and abemaciclib.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the proportion of tumors with complete cell cycle arrest (CCCA) response as
      measured by Ki-67 expression between the pre-treatment tumor and the posttreatment tumor.

      II. To identify biological characteristics of tumors (e.g. mismatch repair [MMR] status, PTEN
      mutational status, etc.) correlating with decreased Ki-67 expression induced by the letrozole
      and abemaciclib combination.

      III. To determine the frequency of adverse events associated with use of abemaciclib and
      letrozole.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the correlation of the expression of Ki-67 with that of cyclin D1, p16, pRB,
      and PTEN as well as with MMR deficiency.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive letrozole orally (PO) once daily (QD) and abemaciclib PO twice daily (BID)
      on days 1-14. Patients then undergo standard of care hysterectomy on day 15.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and at 2 and 6 weeks
      after surgery.
