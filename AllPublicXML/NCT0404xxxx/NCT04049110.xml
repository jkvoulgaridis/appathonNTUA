  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inhibitors of sodium-dependent glucose-transporter 2 (SGLT-2 inhibitors, including
      dapagliflozin) inhibit glucose reabsorption in renal tubular cells, hereby increasing
      glycosuria in the hyperglycemic state. Its mechanisms of action are independent of insulin,
      which makes SGLT-2 inhibitors a potential adjunct to insulin in type 1 diabetes mellitus
      (T1DM).

      However, a higher risk for diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) was reported in patients with T1DM
      taking SGLT-2 inhibitors. DKA depends on an accumulation of ketone bodies in the blood
      stream, which equals an accumulation of acids that lead to acidosis. The underlying
      mechanisms of this observation are unknown. Ketone body production depends on the molar ratio
      of glucagon to insulin, with insulin suppressing but glucagon stimulating ketone body
      production. This translates into higher production during relative insulin deficiency,
      carbohydrate deficiency, and prolonged fasting, which occurs during sickness but also
      physical exercise. Physical exercise is a recommended cornerstone in the treatment of T1DM
      and current treatment guidelines recommend both, reductions of insulin doses and ingestion of
      additional carbohydrates to avoid hypoglycemic events. These adaptions might increase
      relative insulin deficiency, hyperglycemia and glycaemic variability, which might in turn
      promote ketone body production. The addition of SGLT-2 inhibitors further may promote
      ketogenesis even though there are reports of SGLT-2 inhibitors increase
      Glucagon-like-peptide-1 (GLP-1) in patients with T1DM. GLP-1 is a suppressor of glucagon
      secretion. In summary, knowledge about the effects of SGLT-2 inhibition on ketone body
      production is scarce, especially during exercise in patients with T1DM.

      The study seeks to illustrate the effect of SGLT-2 inhibition on glycemic variability and
      ketone body production during and after recreational exercise in patients with T1DM. The
      results of study 2 will provide the basis for future studies investigating the underlying
      mechanisms of potentially modified ketone body production during and after exercise under
      SGLT-2 inhibition.
