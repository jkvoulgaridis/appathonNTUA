  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The degree at which cataract surgery improves visual function in patients with advanced
      age-related macular degeneration (Advanced AMD) has been an on-going topic of discussion. Our
      objective in this study is to determine if patients with Advanced AMD and concurrent
      cataracts will experience greater improvement in their quality of life from having cataract
      surgery on one or both eyes. The findings from this project will provide evidence for
      clinical decision making on whether performing bilateral cataract surgery on Advanced AMD
      patients is cost-effective and worth the second surgical intervention.

    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Our primary outcome will be a life style questionnaire (qualitative) to determine the change in visual function from baseline to after surgery.
This questionnaire includes 25 close-ended questions that are graded on a 5 point grading scale from 1 (great difficulty due to vision) and 5 (no problem due to vision). The questions can also be graded as not applicable to an individuals life, or 0 being something there are no longer possible to do, due to vision.
The 25 close-ended questions are divided into 4 sub-scales:
Distance Vision, Mobility, and Lighting (Q: 1-12)
Adjustment (Q:13-16)
Reading and Fine Work (Q: 17-21)
Activities of Daily Living (Q: 22-25)
A total score can range from a 125 indicating best visual function to 0 indicating complete loss of visual function.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patients above the age of fifty with both Advanced AMD and Cataracts bilaterally from the
        Okanagan Valley will be selected for this study.

        Patients who chose to have bilateral cataract surgery, were able to understand the research
        parameters, and had no other severe eye disease that may distort the studies results.

        Patients will be selected for the study according to the National Eye Institute definition
        of Advanced AMD.

        &quot;Advanced AMD (AREDS category 4) is characterized by one or more of the following (in the
        absence of other causes) in one eye:

        Geographic atrophy of the RPE involving the foveal center.

        Neovascular maculopathy that includes the following:

          -  Choroidal neovascularization (CNV) defined as pathologic angiogenesis originating from
             the choroidal vasculature that extends through a defect in Bruch's membrane

          -  Serous and/or hemorrhagic detachment of the neurosensory retina or RPE

          -  Retinal hard exudates (a secondary phenomenon resulting from chronic intravascular
             leakage)

          -  Subretinal and sub-RPE fibrovascular proliferation

          -  Disciform scar (subretinal fibrosis)&quot;

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Severe intraoperative or postoperative complications such as retinal detachments, and
             capsule ruptures

          -  Inability to complete the required testing (auto-refractive and visual acuity)

          -  Inability to attend appointments

          -  Inability to complete the questionnaire with Co-I assistance

          -  Severe eye disease that may distort the studies results such as but not limited to
             Epithelial Basement Membrane Dystrophy (EBMD) and retinal detachments.
