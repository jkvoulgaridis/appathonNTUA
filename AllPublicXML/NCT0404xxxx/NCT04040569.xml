    <textblock>
      The purpose of this phase I trial is to evaluate dose-limiting toxicity while dose escalating
      single-fraction preoperative S-PBI to a presumed radioablative dose over 3 cohorts, starting
      with 30Gy in 1 fraction and advancing to 34Gy and 38Gy in 1 fraction.

      Preoperative stereotactic breast radiation may be beneficial as it offers the ability to
      target smaller treatment volumes than what has been achievable with adjuvant PBI (Nichols
      IJROBP 2010), track radiobiological response to radiation at time of surgical pathology, and
      allow the removal of all irradiated tissue to potentially minimize late effects.The purpose
      of this phase I trial is to evaluate dose-limiting toxicity while dose escalating
      single-fraction preoperative S-PBI to a presumed radioablative dose over 3 cohorts, starting
      with 30Gy in 1 fraction and advancing to 34Gy and 38Gy in 1 fraction. This would be
      accomplished on the CyberKnife or GammaPod. The GammaPod is a novel device dedicated to S-PBI
      utilizing a Cobalt-60 source (Yu Med Phys 2013), which offers a highly reproducible prone
      setup with a mean of 1.8mm of mismatch reported in 15 patients at the University of Maryland
      on consecutive scans (Yu JCO 2011). Implications of this research are far reaching, including
      determination of the maximally tolerated dose for preoperative S-PBI, pathologic complete
      response rates of early stage breast cancer to a predicted radioablative dose, radiographic
      markers of treatment response (radiomics), and translational research assessing mechanisms of
      immune and radiation response.

    <description>Done by escalating the dose of SBRT toward the tumorcidal dose of 38 Gy in fraction. Doses will be escalated an additional 3.5-4 Gy per treatment. The phase I portion of the study will be completed when either of the following events occur: 1) the MTD for a cohort is reached or 2) when delivery of a pre-determined highest dose of radiation (38 Gy) that has been deemed likely to be efficacious for treatment of early stage breast cancer is attained.Toxicity will be assessed according to the NCI Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 5.0.</description>

    <measure>Cosmesis outcome</measure>

    <description>Photographs of both breasts will be taken and cosmesis form will be graded by the patient, and the radiation oncologist, at twelve months from the start of therapy and at yearly intervals thereafter for up to 5 years after treatment. In addition, an independent panel established at University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center will evaluate cosmesis at the end of study based on photography.</description>

    <intervention_name>Radiomics on MRI</intervention_name>
    <description>Through extracting and analyzing a large number of features from medical imaging, radiomics has shown promising results in treatment outcome prediction for many diseases including breast cancer (45-50). UTSW physics group has developed several new radiomic approaches and radiomic features, such as a multi-objective radiomics model(51) and a new radiomic &quot;Shell&quot; feature(52). As an exploratory end point for this trial, the investigators will explore the application radiomics using pre-treatment MRI, treatment parameters and clinical characteristics as input to predict pathological response of radiation therapy (XRT) based on pathology report of surgical tissues and local recurrence.</description>
