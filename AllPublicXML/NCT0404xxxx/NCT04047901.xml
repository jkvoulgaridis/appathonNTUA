  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      New therapies for cancer increased patient survival, but led to the recognition of adverse
      effects associated with cancer treatment, such as the use of chemotherapy. Cardiotoxicity is
      the most significant adverse effect, which affect the functional capacity and quality of life
      and is associated with high morbidity and mortality, regardless of the oncological prognosis.
      One of the manifestations of cardiotoxicity is ventricular dysfunction that can lead to heart
      failure. Neuro humoral hyperactivation with increased sympathetic nerve activity is a typical
      manifestation of heart failure and is associated with worse prognosis. Studies have shown
      that physical training significantly reduces sympathetic nerve activity in addition to
      improving muscle blood flow, reversing effects on skeletal muscle and improving quality of
      life. The hypothesis is that physical training may reduce sympathetic nerve activity and
      vasoconstrictor status in patients with heart failure caused by anthracyclines, as well as
      improving baroreflex and chemoreflex sensibility, mechanoreflex and metaborreflex control and
      skeletal myopathy.

      The investigators included patients&gt; 18 years, left ventricular ejection fraction &lt;= 0.55,
      functional class (NYHA) I-III, under medical treatment for heart failure. Patients with
      coronary artery disease, moderate to severe valve disease, positive Chagas serology,
      inability to participate in an exercise program are excluded.

      Primary outcome: Muscle sympathetic nerve activity Secondary outcome: arterial baroreflex
      sensitivity, peripheral chemorreflex sensitivity, mecanic and muscuclar metaborreflex
      control, ubiquitin proteasome system activity.

      Patients were divided into 2 groups-trained (n = 10) and non-trained (n = 10). Patients in
      the trained group will complete 16 weeks of aerobic training. Evaluation of cardiac function,
      functional capacity, quality of life and biochemical evaluation (troponin, hs-CRP and BNP).
      For muscle evaluation will be performed biopsy of the vastus lateralis muscle
