  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the rate of radiation necrosis following treatment with immune
      checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) treatment and radiation therapy in subjects with metastatic brain
      cancer. Subjects will be treated with the standard of care immunotherapy followed by
      radiation therapy via stereotactic radiosurgery at a reduced dose.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, single arm, pilot study to determine the symptomatic radiation
      necrosis rate at 6 months utilizing dose-reduced stereotactic radiosurgery with immunotherapy
      for subjects with a diagnosis of 1-10 brain metastases from MRI and tissue diagnosis of
      primary malignancy.

      Primary end-point is 6 month symptomatic radiation necrosis, defined as a 6-month rate of
      clinical symptomatology requiring steroid administration (i.e. Decadron) and/or operative
      intervention concomitant with advanced and routine brain imaging findings consistent with
      radiation necrosis. Follow-up MRIs will be fused with the planning scan for this assessment.
