  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are four species of intestinal worms collectively known as soil-transmitted
      helminthiasis (STH): Ancylostoma duodenale and Necator americanus (hookworms), Ascaris
      lumbricoides (roundworms), and Trichuris trichiura (whipworms). These parasites affect over
      two billion people and contribute to significant morbidity and disability, especially in high
      risk groups, for example children, agricultural workers and pregnant women. In children, STH
      are associated with impaired nutritional status evidenced by stunting, thinness and
      underweight.

      As is the case in most Latin America, STH are a public health problem in Honduras. The World
      Health Organization (WHO) informs that more than 2.5 million children (under 15 years of age)
      in the country are at risk of infection. To control these infections Honduras has established
      a national deworming program that operates since 2001 but despite these efforts, the
      prevalence of STH infections remains unacceptably high. This is especially true in rural
      communities where prevalence can be as high as 70% of the children population.

      Reasons behind the existence of persistently high-prevalence areas have not been investigated
      in Honduras but they can range from structural and social drivers to host-related
      characteristics to parasite-specific factors. The present study aims to specifically look
      into the latter and therefore proposes:

        1. To determine whether zoonotic transmission of intestinal helminth parasites is occurring
           between humans and domestic animals (Ascaris spp and N. americanus in pigs and dogs,
           respectively)

        2. To establish if strains of T. trichiura and Ascaris lumbricoides circulating in humans
           carry genetic polymorphisms for drug resistance to benzimidazoles

        3. Conduct a preliminary analysis of epidemiological factors that might be related to the
           presence or absence of benzimidazole resistance and zoonotic infections

      While waiting for their medical appointment, persons willing to enroll in the study will
      listen to a presentation about intestinal parasites (what are they, what they do to our
      health, and how to prevent them), and about the study, detailing benefits and risks.
      Depending on attendance and number of people volunteering to participate, this could be a
      small-group or individual activity lasting about 10 minutes.

      Objective 1. To determine whether zoonotic transmission of intestinal helminth parasites is
      occurring between humans and domestic animals

        -  A self-collected stool specimen will be requested from each participant (or their
           guardian) to be examined for STH eggs and other parasites (please note that as it is
           standard practice for medical brigades, Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU) brigade
           provides deworming treatment to all outpatients without laboratory tests, so our
           parasitological diagnosis will not affect the treatment decision (unless an unusual
           parasite for which the standard treatment provided by the brigade is not effective, the
           investigators will inform the health care providers so they can provide specific
           treatment (e.g., tapeworms)*

        -  Participants who own or live in household owning dogs and / or pigs will be requested to
           provide a stool sample from at least one of these animals. In case of participant &lt;18
           years of age, the investigators would ask the parent/guardian to do this for their
           child.* Objective 2. To establish if circulating strains of T. trichiura carry genetic
           polymorphisms for drug resistance to benzimidazoles

        -  &quot;If according to the stool parasitological exam, a child is found heavily parasitized,
           the nurse at the health centre or the medical doctors from VCU medical brigade
           authorized by her will provide appropriate treatment. The child and their parents will
           be asked by researchers if they would like to collaborate by bringing 24-hr stool
           samples (entire evacuation of the day) during several days up to 7 days after medical
           treatment with the purpose of recovering the worms expelled. Worms and eggs found in the
           samples will be preserved for later analysis using molecular biology techniques.&quot;
           Objective 3

        -  Responding to a short (5-7 minute) face-to-face questionnaire to collect demographic and
           household information (i.e., name, sex, address, age, level of education, and some
           epidemiological data such as history of infection with parasites and history of
           deworming, access to latrine or indoor toilet at home, owning dogs and owning pigs)
           *Stool sample collection instructions: briefly, participants will be provided with a
           clean unbreakable container labelled with the participant's code and the date of
           collection. They will also be provided with a disposable plastic &quot;chamber pot&quot; to take
           home and given instructions as to how to collect the sample into the pot and transfer a
           portion into the labelled container which they will place into a brown paper bag
           (provided) for privacy. The sample will be analyzed for the presence of intestinal
           helminth parasites by the formol-ether concentration technique. This technique allows
           preserving samples for transportation and later analysis the same day (since there is no
           electricity in the community, immediate examination of samples will not be possible).

      For the 24-hr samples, special wide-mouth 2 L plastic containers with lid will be provided so
      the children can use them as chamber pots directly during the day.

      In the case of animal samples, appropriate materials and instructions will be provided to the
      participants
