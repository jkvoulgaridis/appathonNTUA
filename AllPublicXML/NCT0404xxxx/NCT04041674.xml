      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of a prime-boost
      vaccine regimen of GEO-D02 DNA and MVA/HIV62B with and without B63521^11 gp120 and IHV01
      gp120 Env proteins in healthy, HIV-uninfected adult participants.

    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of a prime-boost vaccine regimen of
      GEO-D02 DNA and MVA/HIV62B with and without B63521^11 gp120 and IHV01 gp120 Env proteins in
      healthy, HIV-uninfected adult participants.

      Participants will be randomly assigned to one of five groups. Participants in all five groups
      will receive GEO-D02 DNA by intramuscular (IM) injection at Months 0 and 2. Then, at Months
      4, 6, and 10, participants will receive three additional injections according to their
      assigned group:

        -  Group 1: MVA/HIV62B, placebo for B63521^11 gp120, and placebo for IHV01, all by IM
           injection

        -  Group 2: MVA/HIV62B by IM injection and placebo for B63521^11 gp120 and for IHV01, both
           by subcutaneous (SC) injection

        -  Group 3: MVA/HIV62B, B63521^11 gp120, and IHV01, all by IM injection

        -  Group 4: MVA/HIV62B, placebo for B63521^11 gp120, and IHV01, all by IM injection

        -  Group 5: MVA/HIV62B by IM injection and IHV01 and B63521^11 gp120, both by SC injection

      Participants will attend several study visits through Month 16. Visits may include physical
      examinations, blood and urine collection, electrocardiogram, HIV testing, risk reduction
      counseling, and questionnaires. Study staff will contact participants at Month 24 for
      follow-up health monitoring.

             which they identify (ie, a transgender female who has been on hormone therapy for more
             than 6 consecutive months should be assessed for eligibility using the hemoglobin
             parameters for persons assigned female sex at birth).

               -  Negative or trace urine protein, and

               -  Negative, trace, or 1+ blood urine hemoglobin (if +1 hemoglobin is present on

                       of azoospermia by microscopy, or [2] a vasectomy more than 2 years ago with
                       no resultant pregnancy despite sexual activity postvasectomy);

               -  Or be sexually abstinent.

          -  Volunteers who were assigned female sex at birth must also agree not to seek pregnancy
             through alternative methods, such as artificial insemination or in vitro fertilization

          -  Smallpox vaccine received within the last 5 years.

          -  HIV vaccine(s) received in a prior HIV vaccine trial. For volunteers who have received
             control/placebo in an HIV vaccine trial, the HVTN 132 PSRT will determine eligibility

             period of the study.)

          -  Seizure disorder: History of seizure(s) within past three years. Also exclude if
             volunteer has used medications in order to prevent or treat seizure(s) at any time
