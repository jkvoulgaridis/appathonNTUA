  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained arrhythmia with a reported incidence of
      2.1% in Turkish population aged 60 and above. Although a minority of patients have minimal or
      no symptoms, palpitations, dyspnea and fatigue are frequently reported by AF patients. It is
      well documented that AF patients, including those with no symptoms, have poorer quality of
      life (QoL) compared to healthy population. Worrying about their condition, side effects of
      treatments and worsening health are the other factors that have an impact on QoL, beside
      symptoms. Management of QoL is a key therapeutic goal in AF treatment and guidelines
      recommend that QoL in these patients should be measured regularly. There is a concern in the
      literature that generic QoL measures may not be sufficiently sensitive or specific to measure
      AF related QoL, thus using disease specific QoL measures are recommended for AF patients. An
      AF-specific quality of life measure is lacking in Turkish language, thus our aim in this
      study is to validate the Turkish version of 'Atrial Fibrillation Impact Questionnaire
      (AFImpact)' in Turkish AF patients.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Atrial Fibrillation Impact Questionnaire (AFImpact)</measure>
    <time_frame>5 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>AFImpact is a 18-item disease specific questionnaire that enables respondents to recall how often their atrial fibrillation affected their lives over the past seven days. Each item is scored on a seven-point likert scale (between 0 and 6 point, 6 point is being the most frequent). Higher scores indicate poorer quality of life.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Short-form 36 (SF-36)</measure>
    <time_frame>10 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>SF-36 is a generic quality of life questionnaire that is widely used in clinical research. It consists of 36 items and yields an 8-scale profile of functional health and well-being scores as well as two summary scores of physical and mental health. A higher score on a 0-100 scale indicates a better quality of life.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index</measure>
    <time_frame>5 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index is a 24-item questionnaire that assess subjective sleep quality over the past month. It consists of seven clinical domains which are also pooled linearly to get a global score.Each item is scored on a 0-3 likert scale and higher scores indicate worse sleep quality.</description>
