  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Phase 1/2 study will be a dose escalation study in adults in 5 cohorts, with the main
      purpose to assess the safety of subcutaneous injection of OCTA101 (a human-cl rhFVIII and
      recombinant human von Willebrand Factor fragment dimer) in previously treated adult patients
      with severe hemophilia A. The study also aims to assess the pharmacokinetics (PK)
      characteristics, dose proportionality, and subcutaneous bioavailability of OCTA101 compared
      with intravenous administration of Nuwiq (Human-cl rh FVIII), in order to define the
      prophylactic treatment (dose and injection interval) that would result in protective trough
      levels of FVIII:C for future Phase 3 studies. By Data Monitoring Committee recommendation,
      patients enrolled in cohorts 1, 2 and 3 will proceed to 3-month prophylactic treatment to
      receive daily dosing of OCTA101 for 3 months.
