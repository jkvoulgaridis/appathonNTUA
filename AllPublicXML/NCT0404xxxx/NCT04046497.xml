      The aims of this project is to use an artificial intelligence (AI) smartphone app to provide
      support for medication adherence by patients with first episode psychosis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The challenge of oral medication adherence in first-episode psychosis (as in any potentially
      chronic illness) is enormous, and numerous studies have linked non-adherence to increased
      rates of relapse/ hospitalization. Determining whether a patient is adhering to medication is
      a challenge. Pill counts, pharmacy records, technology-assisted monitoring, biological
      assays, and a range of self-report and interviewer-rated scales have been employed. In other
      areas of medicine such as antiretroviral treatment Direct Observation of Treatment (DOT) has
      been employed with excellent success both in monitoring and demonstrated improvement of
      important clinical outcomes. DOT is clearly not feasible in community settings. An artificial
      Intelligence (AI) platform that can be downloaded as an application onto a smart phone app
      represents a novel approach to offering DOT to support participant oral medication adherence
      and thereby improve outcomes. Aims of the project are: 1) to document acceptability to
      patients of the AI smartphone app based upon participation in the study and 2) to compare
      rates of hospitalization and emergency room visits between participants who receive the AI
      smartphone app with participants who receive standard care.
