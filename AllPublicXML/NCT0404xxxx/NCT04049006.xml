  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fibromyalgia (FM) is a chronic disease characterized by chronic pain, fatigue and loss of
      function that leads to a significant deterioration in the quality of life. Despite
      controversies about the most appropriate treatment, studies indicate that a multidisciplinary
      treatment would be effective. This study aims to analyze the effectiveness and cost-utility
      of a complex intervention in the quality of life (main variable), the functional impact, the
      mood and the pain of people with FM treated in the Primary Care Teams (PCTs) of the Catalan
      Institute of Health (CIH).

      Methods and analysis: Mixed methodology study following the recommendations of the Medical
      Research Council, with two phases. Phase 1: Randomized pragmatic clinical trial with patients
      diagnosed with FM and assigned to one of the 11 PCTs of the CIH (Territorial management of
      &quot;Terras del Ebro&quot;). A total sample of 336 patients is estimated.

      The usual clinical practice will be carried out in the control group and the usual practice
      and the complex treatment, in the intervention group. The complex treatment will be based on
      health education, aerobic physical exercise and cognitive-behavioral therapy, during 12 weeks
      in sessions of 2 hours/week. Statistical analysis: Assessment of the standardized mean
      response and of the size of the standardized effect and multivariate logistic regression
      analysis will be performed. The economic analysis will be based on useful measures. Phase 2:
      Qualitative socio-constructivist study to identify the improvement aspects of the
      intervention according to the results obtained and the opinions and experiences of the
      participants (patients and professionals). The sampling will be theoretical with 2 discussion
      groups composed of participants in the intervention and 2 discussion groups of professionals
      from different PCTs.
