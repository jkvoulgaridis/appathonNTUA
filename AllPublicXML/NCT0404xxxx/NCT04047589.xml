    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to understand the preferences and barriers surrounding exercise
      of both the patients and oncologists within Indiana University Simon Cancer Center. This
      information will establish gaps in our current care and provide important information to
      guide future pilot interventions.

      This descriptive, cross-sectional study will survey patients with a current or previous
      diagnosis of non-metastatic solid tumor malignancy who are being seen at the Indiana
      University Simon Cancer in Indianapolis, Indiana. Patients with active, incurable disease are
      excluded. Willing and eligible patients will complete a brief, 14 question survey while seen
      in the waiting room of the women's or multi-disciplinary clinics. We aim to survey 350
      patients over a 6 month period. Patients will fill out the survey at only one point in time
      and no patient identifiers will be kept.

      The physician survey will be emailed to oncologist/hematologists practicing within IUSCC who
      see patients at least once per week. Physicians will receive a survey at only one point in
      time. The survey will be anonymous and no physician identifiers will be kept.

      Primary objective Estimate the proportion of patients with curable solid tumor malignancies
      seen at the Indiana University Simon Cancer Center who are meeting exercise recommendations
      for cancer survivors (more than 150 minutes per week of moderate or 75 minutes per week of
      vigorous activity).

      Secondary objectives

        -  Assess patients' perceived barriers to exercise during cancer survivorship

        -  Assess patients' preferences for receiving exercise recommendations

        -  Assess oncologists' perceived barriers to making exercise recommendations

        -  Assess oncologists' preferences for exercise and physical activity resources that could
           be provided by the cancer center

        Potential patients will be identified in the outpatient clinics (women's and
        multi-disciplinary) at the IU Simon Cancer Center. Physicians will be given the option of
        requesting that their patients not participate in the survey. When patients check in or are
        placed in an exam room, a trained member of the clinic staff will approach patients about
        possible participation in the survey study.

        Physicians seeing patients more than once per week in the outpatient clinics at the IU
        Simon Cancer Center will receive email invitation to participate in the survey. An online
        survey will be administered via Survey Monkey. This does not require an informed consent
        process. The survey has 14 questions and will take approximately 5 minutes to complete.
