  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Older adults are a growing population, with projections to reach 83.7 million by 2050.
      Furthermore, older adults are the most sedentary and least physically active adult
      population. It is estimated that nearly 90% of older adults 65 years of age or older do not
      meet the recommended levels of physical activity. Evidence suggests great health benefits can
      be achieved for older adults who are the most sedentary, and that replacing sitting with even
      light intensity walking can be beneficial.

      The overarching goal of the project is to develop an inexpensive and scalable tool to
      increase volume of physical activity in our target population, older adults living in a
      residential facility. MapTrek is a web-based application that allows participants to take a
      virtual walk in interesting locations around the world while tracking their progress against
      the progress of other older adults living in a retirement community. Steps are counted using
      a commercially available accelerometer (e.g., Fitbit), and participants see their progress
      overlaid on Google Maps.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All participants will be provided with a Fitbit activity monitor and instructed to wear it 24
      hours/day (except for bathing/swimming time) on their wrist for 12 weeks. Participants will
      participate in four team-based walking races, each two weeks long. Participants will view
      their team progress on TV monitors placed in various locations at the Oaknoll facility. The
      Oaknoll leadership has given the research team approval to do this at their facility. The
      monitors will present aggregated team data and will not report any individual data that could
      link back to the individual participant.

      At the end of the 8 week active intervention, research team members will meet with
      participants at Oaknoll to administer an exit/process evaluation survey. The exit survey will
      ask about psychosocial predictors of physical activity as well as participants thoughts and
      opinions of the MapTrek game. This survey should take approximate 10-15 minutes to complete.
      The participants will then be asked to wear the Fitbit for four more weeks without playing
      MapTrek, which will act as a control condition since this is a single-arm study.

      The specific aims of the study are:

        1. To determine the efficacy of MapTrek for improving physical activity levels of older
           adults living in a residential facility.

        2. To determine the efficacy of MapTrek for improving psychosocial outcomes(e.g.,
           self-efficacy, social support, outcome expectations) among older adults living in a
           residential facility.

        3. To determine the acceptability of MapTrek among older adults living in a residential
           facility.
