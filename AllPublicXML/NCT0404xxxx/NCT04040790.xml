  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Data from 15 healthy subjects will be recorded in two testing sessions spread on two days,
      using three lens designs (A, B and C). Before the measuring days, each subject will undergo
      an extra fitting session of a large-diameter scleral contact lens on the dominant eye,
      assessed by an experienced practitioner. The fitting data will be used to custom-make the
      three lens designs for each subject, thus ensuring their comfort and safety during the days
      of the experiments. During the experiment days baseline measurements will be obtained before
      and after pupil dilation and contact lens wear. During the first testing session data from
      the lens design A (reference lens without artificial iris) will be recorded. During the
      second testing session data from the lens designs B and C (lenses with artificial iris with
      different transmittances) will be recorded. In each testing session, contrast sensitivity and
      visual acuity will be evaluated and non-invasive imaging measurements will be undertaken
      (optical coherence tomography and slit lamp). A specific questionnaire will be given to the
      subject to assess comfort, light sensitivity, the horizontal visual angle and overall
      experience of the scleral lens and in combination with a pair of sunglasses category 3-4.

      First, the participant will be subjected to an RGP scleral contact lens fitting session, then
      during the second and third visits the participant will be subjected to several non-invasive
      procedures specific to the study in order to assess contrast sensitivity and visual acuity
      using the fitted and uniquely fabricated investigational medical devices. The tests will be
      performed after eye drops are supplied to dilate the pupil of the subjects (eye drops:
      tropicamide and phenylephrine). Besides the clinical experiments, the participant will be
      given a specific questionnaire in order to assess comfort, light sensitivity, horizontal
      visual angle and overall experience of the investigational medical device and in combination
      with a pair of sunglasses category 3-4. The investigators will document the occurrence of any
      adverse events and specific side effects during Day 2 and 3 (testing sessions with the
      investigational devices) in order to effectively assess their safety.
