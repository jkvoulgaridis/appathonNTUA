      This is a double-blind, saline-controlled, and randomized study with blinded assessments
      using a single dose. Subjects that have a current diagnosis of chronic lumbar disc disease
      and meet eligibility criteria will be enrolled.

      Subjects randomized to active treatment will undergo bone marrow harvest for processing into
      BRTX-100 for intradiscal injection. Subjects randomized to control will undergo sham bone
      marrow harvest and intradiscal injection procedures. Subjects will return to the study site
      for a visit at Week 2, Week 12, Week 26, Week 52 and Week 104/Early Termination.

      An independent, chartered, Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will review all unblinded
      safety data for the first 10 subjects through Study visit 4 (day 14 post dosing) and prior to
      dosing of the 11th subject. All subjects will be randomized (2:1) to receive either
      intradiscal BRTX-100 or saline. A central randomization will be used.
