      The Psychedelics and Wellness Study (PAWS), is an anonymous online survey investigating the
      interrelationship between psychedelics and wellness. The study population is adults ages 18
      and older that have taken a psychedelic at least once. The maximum sample size is 5,000
      survey respondents. It is expected that this anonymous online survey will support the
      hypothesis that there is a robust interrelationship between past psychedelic use and its
      impact on wellness.

      Following a four-decade moratorium, the therapeutic use of psychedelics has once more
      captured the collective attention of the medical community and the public at large. Now, at
      the forefront of a renaissance in psychedelic research, this study is investigating the
      interrelationship of psychedelics and mental wellness - a state of well-being in which the
      individual realizes his or her own abilities, can cope with the normal stresses of life, can
      work productively and fruitfully, and is able to make a contribution to his or her community.
      This work will be unique in that it will collect both objective and subjective data to assess
      the interrelationship between psychedelic and wellness. It will lend support to the growing
      body of research in the use of psychedelics for both mental health conditions and the pursuit
      of overall mental wellness.
