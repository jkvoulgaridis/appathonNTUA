      The purpose of the study is to better understand how the immune system responds to the new
      herpes zoster (shingles) vaccine (Shingrix®). The study will be looking at certain markers in
      the blood after vaccination with Shingrix®.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Varicella zoster virus (VZV) can cause two distinct diseases: chicken pox (varicella) and
      herpes zoster (shingles). The primary infection with VZV causes chicken pox, a widespread
      rash occurring with fever, mostly in childhood. The virus can then remain dormant in a
      person's body and has the ability to reactivate later in life causing shingles. Shingles is a
      painful rash, occurring mostly in older individuals or those who have a weakened immune
      system. After resolution of the rash, individuals may experience persistent pain in the same
      area, called post-herpetic neuralgia.

      The purpose of the study is to better understand how the immune system responds to the new
      herpes zoster (shingles) vaccine (Shingrix®). In particular, looking at certain markers in
      the blood after vaccination with Shingrix®.

      The study will be an open label randomized clinical trial in healthy older adults. There will
      be two groups of participants: those aged 50 to 60 years or those who are 70 years old and
      above, both groups will receive the vaccine. This will help compare the immune response to
      the herpes zoster vaccine in different age cohorts of older adults.

      Subjects will be recruited by flyer advertisements. Interested individuals will be screened
      for the study and if they qualify they will be consented and enrolled in the study. Blood
      samples will be collected and banked. There are optional storage of data/specimens for future
      research including: being contacted for future studies, having contact information and
      limited medical information entered into a clinic database, and storage of Protected Health
      Information and samples for future research (yes, no, and de-identified)
