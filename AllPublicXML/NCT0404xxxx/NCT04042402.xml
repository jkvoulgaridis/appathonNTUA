    <measure>The incidence and severity of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAE) and SAEs associated with abnormal 12 lead electrocardiogram (ECG) readings</measure>
    <time_frame>TEAEs and SAEs are evaluated monthly for 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>To evaluate the safety and tolerability of DCR PHXC when administered monthly to patients with primary hyperoxaluria (PH) via change from baseline and abnormal ECG findings.
Standard 12-lead ECGs will be performed in the supine position after the subject has rested comfortably for 10 minutes. The parameters assessed will be rhythm, ventricular rate, PR interval, QRS duration, QT interval, and corrected QT interval (QTcF, Fridericia correction). The Investigator or designee is responsible for reviewing the ECG(s) to assess whether the results are within normal limits and to determine the clinical significance of the results.
Standardized ECG acquisition equipment will be provided to all clinical trial sites at the start of the trial, to ensure parity across all sites.</description>

    <measure>The incidence and severity of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAE) and SAEs associated with abnormal physical examination findings</measure>
    <time_frame>TEAEs and SAEs are evaluated monthly for 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>To evaluate the safety and tolerability of DCR PHXC when administered monthly to patients with primary hyperoxaluria (PH) via change from baseline and incidence of abnormal physical exam findings.
A full physical examination will include a complete review of body systems: eyes, ears, nose, and throat, chest/respiratory, heart/cardiovascular, gastrointestinal/liver, musculoskeletal/extremities, dermatological/skin, thyroid/neck, lymph nodes, and neurological. A full physical exam is done at Screening, Day 180 and if a participant ends the study early.
A brief physical examination will minimally include chest/respiratory, heart/cardiovascular, dermatological/skin, and gastrointestinal/liver. A brief physical examination will be performed may be performed at the Investigator's discretion at all other visits.</description>

    <measure>The incidence and severity of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAE) and SAEs associated with abnormal vital signs</measure>
    <time_frame>TEAEs and SAEs are evaluated monthly for 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>To evaluate the safety and tolerability of DCR PHXC when administered monthly to patients with primary hyperoxaluria (PH) via the change from baseline and incidence of abnormal vital signs.
Vital signs include blood pressure, pulse/heart rate, oral body temperature, and respiratory rate.
Parameters will be measured in the supine position, using an automated instrument or manually, after the participant has rested comfortably for 10 minutes. In the pediatric population, an age-appropriate cuff size should be used for blood pressure measurements.
Temperature will be obtained in degrees Celsius (°C), pulse rate will be counted for a full minute and recorded in beats per minute, and respirations will be counted for a full minute and recorded in breaths per minute.</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline in the Short Form (36) Health Survey (SF-36®) in adults</measure>
    <time_frame>Surveys are administered at screening, 6 months and then yearly 2.5 years</time_frame>
    <description>To evaluate the effect of DCR-PHXC on Quality of Life (QoL) assessments in patients with PH.
The SF 36 is a set of generic, coherent, and easily administered quality-of-life measures that taps 8 health concepts: physical functioning, bodily pain, role limitations due to physical health problems, role limitations due to personal or emotional problems, emotional well-being, social functioning, energy/fatigue, and general health perceptions. It also includes a single item that provides an indication of perceived change in health. The 36 items are identical to the MOS SF 36 described in Ware and Sherbourne (1992). Participants respond to each item on a categorical scale. Categorical answers are transformed to a 0 to 100 range so that the lowest and highest possible scores are 0 and 100, respectively. All items are scored so that a high score defines a more favorable health state.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in the EQ-5D-5L™ in adults.</measure>
    <time_frame>Surveys are administered at screening, 6 months and then yearly 2.5 years</time_frame>
    <description>To evaluate the effect of DCR-PHXC on Quality of Life (QoL) assessments in patients with PH.
The EQ-5D-5L consists of the EQ 5D descriptive system and the EQ visual analogue scale (EQ VAS).
The descriptive system has 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems and extreme problems. The digits for the 5 dimensions can be combined into a 5-digit number that describes the participant's health state.
The EQ VAS records the participant's self-rated health on a 20-cm vertical VAS, where the endpoints are labelled 'The best health you can imagine' and 'The worst health you can imagine.' Participants are asked to place an &quot;X&quot; on the line that represents their health on that day.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL™) in children</measure>
    <time_frame>Surveys are administered at screening, 6 months and then yearly 2.5 years</time_frame>
    <description>To evaluate the effect of DCR-PHXC on Quality of Life (QoL) assessments in patients with PH.
The 23-item PedsQL is comprised of 5 items in the Emotional, Social, and School Functioning dimensions (Psychosocial Health) and 8 items in the Physical Functioning (Physical Health) dimension. Items are reverse-scored on a 0 to 4 Likert scale and linearly transformed to a 0 to 100 scale, so that higher scores indicate better functioning and HRQOL. Scale Scores are the sum of the items in each dimension, divided by the number of items answered.</description>
