      Title: A single-center, retrospective randomized controlled trial of artificial intelligence
      (AI) versus expert endoscopists for diagnosis of gastric cancer in patients who underwent
      upper gastrointestinal endoscopy.

      Précis: this single-center, retrospective randomized controlled trial will include 500
      outpatients who underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy for gastric cancer screening and
      will compare the diagnostic detection rate for gastric cancer of AI and expert endoscopists.

      Objectives Primary Objective: to evaluate the diagnostic detection rate for gastric cancer of
      AI and expert endoscopists.

      Secondary Objectives: to determine whether AI is not inferior to expert endoscopists in terms
      of the number of images analyzed for diagnosis of gastric cancer and intersection over union
      (IOU), and the detection rate of diagnosis of early and advanced gastric cancer.

      Endpoints Primary Endpoint: diagnosis of gastric cancer. Secondary Endpoints: image based
      diagnosis of gastric cancer and IOU. Population: in total, 500 males and females aged ≥ 20
      years who underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy for screening of gastric cancer at a
      single hospital in Japan.

      Describe the Intervention: AI-based diagnosis of gastric cancer based on upper
      gastrointestinal endoscopy images.

      Study Duration: 3 months.

      Prior to Study: Total 500: Screen potential subjects by inclusion and exclusion criteria;
      obtain endoscopy images.

      Randomization was performed.

      Intervention: AI diagnosis was performed for 250 patients using upper gastrointestinal
      endoscopy images, and Expert endoscopists diagnosis was performed for 250 patients by same
      methods.

      Primary analysis: Perform primary analysis of primary and secondary endpoints for 250
      patients in each group

      Cross over diagnosis between AI and expert endoscopists was performed.

      Perform secondary analysis of agreement of gastric cancer diagnosis per images and IOU
      between AI and expert endoscopists for 500 patients.

    <description>• AI-based diagnosis will be performed based on analysis of endoscopic images (Olympus Optical, Tokyo, Japan). The investigators will use the Single Shot MultiBox Detector (SSD), a deep neural network architecture (https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.02325), and an optimal diagnostic cutoff from a prior report2. The AI system reviewed endoscopy images and reported those in which gastric cancer was detected, together with the coordinates (X, Y) of the lesions.</description>

    <description>The expert endoscopists are two physicians with experience of more than 20,000 endoscopies. The expert endoscopists will review the endoscopy images of each patient for 5 min.
