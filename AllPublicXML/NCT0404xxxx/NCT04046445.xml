    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, non-randomised Phase 1b study to evaluate the safety and tolerability
      of ATP128 alone or in combination with BI 754091.

      ATP128 is a self-adjuvanted chimeric recombinant protein vaccine being developed in
      combination with programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) blockade for the treatment of microsatellite
      stable (MSS) patients not responding to PD-1 blockade. The PD-1 inhibitor being tested with
      ATP128 is the BI 754091 compound which belongs to the human immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) subclass
      of antibodies.

      The Sponsor plans to enrol 32 patients with histologically or cytologically confirmed stage
      IV colorectal cancer coming form three different patient populations:

        -  Cohort 1a: 6 patients with stage IV colorectal cancer (CRC) having failed standard of
           care (SoC) therapies

        -  Cohorts 1b, 2a: 11 patients with stage IV microsatellite stable/mismatch
           repair-proficient (MSS/MMRp) CRC being in stable disease (SD) or partial response (PR)
           after first line of SoC (6 months duration at minimum)

        -  Cohort 2b: 15 patients with stage IV MSS/MMRp hepatic-limited metastatic CRC

      Patients eligible for this study will be enrolled in one of the 4 cohorts depending on their
      disease:

        -  Patients in Cohort 1a will receive ATP128 as single agent

        -  Patients in Cohorts 1b, 2a will receive ATP128 in combination with BI 754091

        -  Patients in Cohorts 2b will receive ATP128 in combination with BI 754091 before and
           after the liver surgery

             antifungal, or antiviral treatment.

         16. Known medical history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection or known medical
             history of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). HIV testing is not required
             unless mandated by the local health authority.

         17. Has known history of or is positive for hepatitis B (hepatitis B virus surface antigen
             [HBsAg] reactive) or hepatitis C (HCV RNA).

             Note: Testing must be performed to determine eligibility. - Hepatitis B virus DNA must
             be undetectable and HBsAg negative at screening visit. - Hepatitis C antibody testing
             is allowed for screening purposes in countries where HCV RNA is not part of standard
             of care. In these cases, HCV antibody positive patients will be excluded. - Patients
             who have had definitive treatment for HCV are permitted if HCV RNA is undetectable at
             screening visit.

         18. Known active CNS metastasis and/or carcinomatous meningitis.

         19. Known cerebral oedema.

         20. Live vaccine received within 30 days before initiation of study treatment. Examples of
             live vaccines include, but are not limited to, the following: measles, mumps, rubella,
             chicken pox, yellow fever, rabies, Bacillus Calmette-Guérin, and typhoid vaccine.
             Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally killed virus vaccines and are
             allowed. however, intranasal influenza vaccines (FluMist®) are live attenuated
             vaccines and are not allowed.

         21. History of allergy or hypersensitivity to any of the study drugs or study drug
             components.

         22. Any condition in the judgment of the Investigator which makes the patient unsuitable
             for trial participation.

             Cohorts 1b, 2a, 2b:

         23. Has received more than 1 line of therapy for stage IV disease (neoadjuvant therapy in
             Cohort 2b counts as 1 line).

         24. History of pneumonitis within the last 5 years.

         25. Active interstitial lung disease (ILD)/pneumonitis or a history of ILD/pneumonitis
             requiring treatment with systemic steroids and/or whose pulse oximetry is less than
             92% &quot;on room air&quot;.

         26. Any of the following cardiac criteria:

               -  Mean resting corrected QT interval (QTc) &gt; 470 msec.

               -  Any clinically important abnormalities (as assessed by the Investigator) in
                  rhythm, conduction, or morphology of resting ECGs, e.g., complete left bundle
                  branch block, third degree heart block.

               -  Any factors that increase the risk of QTc prolongation or risk of arrhythmic
                  events such as heart failure, hypokalemia, congenital long QT syndrome, family
                  history of long QT syndrome or unexplained sudden death under 40 years old, or
                  any concomitant medication known to prolong the QT interval (according to
                  institutional guidelines).

               -  Ejection fraction (EF) &lt; 55% or the lower limit of normal of the institutional
                  standard will be excluded. Only in cases where the Investigator (or the treating
                  physician or both) suspects cardiac disease with negative effect on the EF will
                  the EF be measured during screening using an appropriate method according to
                  local standards to confirm eligibility (e.g. echocardiogram [ECHO], multi-gated
                  acquisition scan [MUGA]. A historic measurement of EF no older than 6 months
                  prior to first study treatment administration can be accepted provided that there
                  is clinical evidence that the EF value has not worsened since this measurement in
                  the opinion of the Investigator or the treating physician or both.
