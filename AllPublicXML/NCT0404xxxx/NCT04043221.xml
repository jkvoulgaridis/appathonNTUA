    <textblock>
      The investigators analyzed collection data of 10 years for the efficacy of metformin on body
      mass, menstrual frequencies, metabolic and hormonal outcomes in women with polycystic ovary
      syndrome (PCOS) and BMI ≥ 25kg/m2.

      Each patient's age and height were recorded at baseline. In addition each patient weight,
      waist circumference, menstrual regularity, fasting glucose, glucose after 120 minute oral
      glucose tolerance test, luteinizing hormone, follicle stimulating hormone , free and direct
      testosterone, androstenedione, sex hormone binding globulin, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate
      were identified at baseline and at the every follow up visit where available.
