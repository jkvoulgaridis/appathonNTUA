  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to compare performance of nurses, midwives, and
      physicians working as individuals versus working as teams in electronic fetal monitoring (as
      assessed by differences in knowledge and judgment scores).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Electronic fetal monitoring (EFM) has been used as a tool to evaluate fetal wellbeing in
      obstetrics for decades, with limited results with regard to improve fetal outcomes. There
      remains wide variation in the interpretation of fetal heart rate (FHR) tracings between
      different practitioners, which may explain the limited impact of this ubiquitous tool. The
      Perinatal Quality Foundation Fetal Monitoring Credentialing (PQF/FMC) exam was established to
      improve patient safety in obstetrical care by optimizing and standardizing the credentialing
      process for EFM.

      The Fetal Monitoring Credentialing (FMC) test is a validated tool to assess the knowledge and
      judgment of test-takers based on script concordance theory, an approach to testing that
      allows assessment on real-life situations by comparing to the clinical reasoning of a panel
      of reference experts.

      It is known that in clinical practice patients are cared for by teams of individuals (RN's,
      CNM, resident physicians and attendings). These individuals are all trained to approach a
      laboring patient from their own unique training. Even amongst experts in the field there is
      only moderate agreement on the interpretation of tracings with poor agreement on what
      constitutes a category III tracing. The absence of complete agreement in clinical practice
      creates differences in opinions of interpretation and agreement regarding next step in
      management for obstetric patients.

      It is hypothesized that a team-based participation in the Perinatal Quality Foundation Fetal
      Monitoring Credentialing (PQF/FMC) exam will improve knowledge and judgment scores.

    <description>The Perinatal Quality Foundation Fetal Monitoring Credentialing (PQF/FMC) exam measures judgement. The is exam is a 72 question computer based exam. There are 35 knowledge questions and 37 judgement questions. The scores for each section are reported as a percentage (maximum score = 100%). Knowledge and judgement questions have scores that are weighted based on exam key.</description>
