  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have improved the survival of patients with metastatic
      renal cell carcinoma, and are commonly used as first-line option for this condition, but
      their use is encumbered by side effects, mainly diarrhea, for which there are no standardized
      strategies. Increasing evidence suggests that gut microbiota could influence the development
      of TKIs-induced diarrhea. In theory, the therapeutic modulation of gut microbiota could be an
      approach to alleviate TKI-induced diarrhea. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is the
      infusion of fecal microbiota from a healthy donor in the gut of a recipient with the aim of
      curing a specific disease. It has been increasingly recognized as a highly effective
      treatment against recurrent Clostridium difficile infection.To date, the effects of FMT on
      chemotherapy-related diarrhea are unknown. This study will evaluate, through a randomized
      controlled design, the efficacy of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), compared with sham
      FMT, in treating TKI-induced diarrhea in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite the improvement in diagnosis and management, renal cell carcinoma (RCC) remains one
      of the most burdensome urological cancers, being the sixth most common malignancy in men and
      the 10th in women, accounting, respectively, for 5% and 3% of all cancers. Moreover, the
      incidence of RCC is increasing, especially in Western countries, accounting for nearly 60000
      new cases per year in the United States. A considerable proportion of patients present with
      metastatic disease at diagnosis, and there are more than 140000 RCC-dependent deaths per year
      worldwide according to the World Health Organization.

      Sunitinib and pazopanib are oral multi-targeted receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs)
      that have dramatically improved the survival of patients with metastatic RCC, and are
      commonly used as first-line option for this condition.

      However, long-term use of these drugs is prevented by the development of toxicity. Diarrhea
      is one of the most common side effects of TKIs, occurring in nearly 50% of patients. It
      decreases the quality of life of these patients, and often requires dose reduction and drug
      discontinuation, potentially decreasing the efficacy of TKIs.

      To date there are no standardized strategies for TKIs-related diarrhea, and current
      recommendations are supported by few evidence or real-life experience. Recommended treatment
      options include anti-motility agents, which are not targeted to act on the pathogenic
      pathways of diarrhea.

      Increasing evidence suggests that gut microbiota could influence the development of
      TKIs-induced diarrhea. Overall, chemotherapy is known to drive, through the development of
      mucositis, deep compositional and functional alterations of gut microbiota. Mucositis occurs
      commonly after treatment with TKIs, and a specific dysbiotic profile has been found in
      patients with TKIs-induced diarrhea.

      In theory, the therapeutic modulation of gut microbiota could be an approach to alleviate
      TKI-induced diarrhea. Although probiotics have been suggested as a possible treatment option
      for this condition, few evidence supports this indication.

      Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is the infusion of fecal microbiota from a healthy
      donor in the gut of a recipient with the aim of curing a specific disease. It has been
      increasingly recognized as a highly effective treatment against recurrent Clostridium
      difficile infection.

      FMT has been also examined as a potential approach for other disorders associated with a
      disruption of gut microbiota, including ulcerative colitis or metabolic syndrome.

      To date, the effects of FMT on chemotherapy-related diarrhea are unknown. The aim of this
      study is to investigate the efficacy of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), compared with
      sham FMT, in treating TKI-induced diarrhea in patients with metastatic RCC
