  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study describes how to perform a correct prostatic apex and membranous urethra in order
      to preserve all anatomical elements that are necessary to achieve a very fast urinary
      continence after open/laparoscopic/robotic radical prostatectomy, avoiding positive surgical
      margins at this level.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study describes a simple technical variation, aimed at the sparing of the muscle systems
      and neurovascular bundles in order to achieve high rates of urinary continence in the early
      postoperative period ( the first two months after surgery) in prostate cancer patients
      undergoing radical prostatectomy.
