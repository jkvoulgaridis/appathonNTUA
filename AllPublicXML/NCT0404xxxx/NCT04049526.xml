      AIM: to investigate the influence of different music genres on Heart Rate Variability (HRV)
      of preterm infants.

      Neonates undergo a daily randomized music listening program. An electrocardiogram is
      performed to evaluate HRV parameters in each neonate with and without music exposure.

      AIM: to investigate the influence of different music genres on Heart Rate Variability (HRV)
      of preterm infants.

      HRV has been previously used to evaluate autonomic nervous system fluctuations in heart rate
      related to maturation in healthy neonates and in neonates with pathological conditions. This
      parameter has been used to show how music could improve well-being and the development of the
      autonomic nervous system in infants.

      In this study, neonates (see also inclusion/exclusion criteria), recruited on the basis of
      birth order, undergo a daily randomized music listening program (25 minutes, every day, for 3
      days) based on different music genres listening (soft pop-rap, pop-rock and classical music).
      Music programs is followed by 1 day of no music monitoring (25 minutes). An electrocardiogram
      is performed to evaluate HRV parameters in each neonate with and without music exposure.
