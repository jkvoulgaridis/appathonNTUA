  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To study the pharmacokinetic characteristics and safety of the ALA in patients with moderate
      and severe acne vulgaris after different dosages and single dose, and to understand the
      pharmacokinetic behavior of the drug and its active metabolite PpIX in human body, so as to
      provide a reference for the formulation of treatment plans in subsequent clinical trials.
