  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients will receive methotrexate at a dose of 45 mg/m2 administered weekly for 4
      consecutive weeks as an iv infusion along with a nutritional supplement administered two
      hours before the methotrexate. One hour before the methotrexate treatment the patients will
      be administered the first infusion of the day of either TK112690 or placebo depending on
      randomization. Five hours after the methotrexate treatment the patients will be administered
      the second treatment of either TK112690 or placebo depending on randomization. The TK112690
      dose will be 45 mg/kg.

      Patients will receive methotrexate at a dose of 45 mg/m2 administered weekly for 4

      administered the second treatment of either TK112690 or placebo depending on randomization.
      The TK112690 dose will be 45 mg/kg.

        -  A total of 22 patients will be enrolled into one of 2 different dose groups: TK-112690
           treated or placebo treated.

        -  Screening must be within 15 days of subject enrollment.

        -  Patients will remain for observation at the clinical site for a minimum of 25 hours post
           initial TK112690 or placebo dose.

        -  Study follow-up will occur on Week 6, two weeks after the last dosing of methotrexate.

        -  Blinding: The study will be partially blinded. The patient and investigator will be
           blinded as to whether TK112690 or placebo is administered. The CRO, sponsor, and site
           pharmacist will know whether the patient was administered active drug or placebo.
