  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm open label exploratory clinical trial to evaluate dichloroacetate (DCA)
      as a possible treatment for treatment of endometriosis-associated pain
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Endometriosis is a chronic condition usually affecting women throughout their reproductive
      lives. It is defined as a growth of endometrial-like tissue (womb lining) outside the uterus
      (womb) and is associated with chronic pelvic pain that can be frequent and severe, resulting
      in tiredness, lower quality of life and difficulties in getting pregnant. Current treatments
      are unsatisfactory and there is an unmet need for new medical treatment for endometriosis.
      Research findings from our laboratory have shown that women with endometriosis have more
      lactate in their pelvis. In laboratory models of endometriosis, we have tested
      dichloroacetate (DCA), a compound used to treat metabolic disorders in children. Our results
      showed that DCA could stop the growth and survival of endometriosis cells and reduce lactate
      production. In our study we plan to investigate if we can we can recruit and retain women
      into a trial using this treatment. We will recruit 30 women aged 18 or over, with pelvic pain
      and a diagnosis of endometriosis within the last three years. Participants will complete
      informed consent, be willing to comply with the treatment and use contraception throughout
      the trial. We will recruit patients over six months at Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh. Women
      who consent will take a daily dose of DCA capsules for 12 weeks.
