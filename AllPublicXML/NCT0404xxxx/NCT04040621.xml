    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, multinational, open label single dose pharmacokinetic (PK) study
      enrolling at least 32 subjects. The study aims to characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) of a
      single intravenous dose of CAZ AVI in pediatric subjects aged 3 months to less than 18 years
      who are receiving systemic antibiotic therapy for suspected or confirmed nosocomial
      pneumonia, including ventilator associated pneumonia.

      This is a multicenter, multinational, open label single dose pharmacokinetic (PK) study
      enrolling at least 32 subjects. The study aims to characterize the PK of CAZ AVI and assess
      its safety and tolerability following a single intravenous (IV) infusion. Subjects will be
      hospitalized pediatric patients who are receiving systemic antibiotic therapy for suspected
      or confirmed nosocomial pneumonia (NP), including ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP). The
      study will consist of a Screening visit (Visit 1, Day 1), during which consent will be
      obtained and subject eligibility will be confirmed, a Baseline/Treatment visit (Visit 2, Day
      1) during which subjects will receive a single IV infusion of CAZ AVI, and then two follow up
      assessment visits at 24 hours (Visit 3, Day 2) and 48 hours (Visit 4, Day 3). Blood samples
      for PK analyses (0.5 mL per sample) will be obtained over 22 hours for Cohort 1 (7 samples),
      over 13 hours for Cohort 2 (6 samples), and over 6 hours for Cohorts 3 and 4 (4 samples).
      Additionally, for subjects who are undergoing bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) for clinical
      purposes and for whom informed consent is obtained specifically for BAL, an epithelial lining
      fluid (ELF) sample will be collected for estimation of CAZ AVI concentrations.

          1. Investigator site staff members directly involved in the conduct of the study and
             their family members, site staff members otherwise supervised by the Investigator, or
             subjects who are Pfizer employees, including their family members, directly involved

          2. Participation in other studies involving investigational drug(s) within 30 days prior
             to study entry and/or during study participation.

          3. Other acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition including recent (within the
             past year) or active suicidal ideation or behavior or laboratory abnormality that may
             increase the risk associated with study participation or investigational product
             administration or may interfere with the interpretation of study results and, in the
             judgment of the Investigator, would make the subject inappropriate for entry into this
             study.

          4. Past or current history of epilepsy or seizure disorder (excluding childhood febrile
             seizures.

          5. Severe renal impairment defined as creatinine clearance (CrCL) ≤30 mL/min/1.73 m2
             calculated using the child's measured height (length) and serum creatinine with the
             Bedside Schwartz equation (Schwartz, Munoz, et al., 2009):3 CrCL (mL/min/1.73 m2) =

          6. Documented history of any hypersensitivity or allergic reaction to any β lactam
             antibiotic.

          7. Pregnant female subjects; breastfeeding female subjects; fertile male subjects and
             female subjects of childbearing potential who are unwilling or unable to use a highly
             effective method of contraception as outlined in this protocol for the duration of the
             study and for at least 28 days after the last dose of CAZ AVI.

          8. Acute hepatitis in the prior 6 months, a prior history of cirrhosis, acute hepatic
             failure, or acute decompensation of chronic hepatic failure; and/or any of the
             following blood test results, for any individual, when assessed for eligibility:

               1. Bilirubin &gt;3 × upper limit of normal (ULN), unless isolated hyperbilirubinemia is
                  directly related to the acute infection or due to known Gilbert's disease;

               2. ALT or AST &gt;3 × ULN values used by the laboratory performing the test. Subjects
                  with values &gt;3 × ULN and &lt;5 × ULN are eligible if this value is acute and
                  directly related to the infectious process being treated. This must be
                  documented;

               3. ALP &gt;3 × ULN. Subjects with values &gt;3 × ULN and &lt;5 × ULN are eligible if this
                  value is acute and directly related to the infectious process being treated. This
                  must be documented.

          9. Any condition (eg, septic shock, burns, cystic fibrosis, acute hemodynamic
             instability, including those conditions not responding to pressor support) that would
             make the patient, in the opinion of the Investigator, unsuitable for the study (eg,
             would place a patient at risk; compromise the quality of the data; or interfere with
             the absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion of CAZ AVI).

         10. Receipt of a blood or blood component or scheduled for transfusion within the PK
             sampling period (eg, red blood cells, fresh frozen plasma, platelets) transfusion
             during the 24 hour period before enrollment.

         11. Body mass index (BMI) below the 5th percentile or above the 95th percentile for
             height, age, and weight except for children &lt;2 years of age as BMI is not considered a
             screening tool for healthy weight in children under 2 years of age.

         12. Treatment with ceftazidime within 12 hours of CAZ AVI administration or treatment with
             ceftazidime within 24 hours of CAZ AVI administration in subjects with renal
             impairment (CrCL ≤50 mL/min/1.73 m2).

         13. Treatment with potent inhibitors of OAT1 and/or OAT3 (eg, probenecid, p aminohippuric
             acid (PAH), or teriflunomide).
