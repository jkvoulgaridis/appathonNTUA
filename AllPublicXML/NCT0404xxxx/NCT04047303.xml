    <textblock>
      CC-90010-GBM-001 is a multi-center, open-label study to assess the pharmacokinetics (PK),
      pharmacodynamics (PD) and CNS penetration of CC-90010 following short-term interval therapy
      (4 daily doses ) prior to surgery, in subjects with progressive or recurrent WHO Grade II
      Diffuse Astrocytoma, Grade III Anaplastic Astrocytoma and recurrent Glioblastoma who have
      failed radiation and chemotherapy, and who are candidates for surgical tumor resection as
      part of their salvage regimen (planned salvage resection).
