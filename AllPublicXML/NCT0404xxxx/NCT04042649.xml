      The implementation of environmental intervention program reduced the duration of delirium and
      length of stay at the ICU in critically-ill surgical patients.

      Purpose: Delirium occurs among patients in intensive care unit at high rates and increases
      the risk for morbidity and mortality. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects
      of environmental interventions for the prevention of delirium.

      Methods: A total of 192 patients who had been admitted to the surgical intensive care unit
      (SICU) in Asan Medical Center during the pre-intervention period (Jun 2013 to Oct 2013) and
      the post-intervention period (Jun 2014 to Oct 2014) was enrolled and prospective cohort study
      was done. The environmental intervention included cognitive assessment, providing orientation
      and comfortable environment, and a proper sleeping environment. The primary outcomes were the
      incidence rate of delirium, time of delirium onset, and the duration of delirium.
