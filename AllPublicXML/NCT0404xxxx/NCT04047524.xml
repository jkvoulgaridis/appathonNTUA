  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prehabilitation programmes have the potential to reduce post-operative complications
      following abdominal cancer surgery by improving pre-operative fitness levels. Home-based
      prehabilitation programmes may be more cost effective than hospital-based programmes, but
      have issues with low compliance. The aims of our study are to assess whether mobile
      technologies such as smart watches and smartphone applications improve compliance with
      home-based prehabilitation programmes and to assess the effects of prehabilitation on
      pre-operative fitness levels in patients due to undergo major abdominal cancer surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      30 patients due to undergo major abdominal cancer surgery at The Christie NHS Foundation
      Trust will be enrolled to a pilot randomised controlled trial. They will randomised to either
      a home-based trimodal prehabilitation programme, delivered by the use of FitBit Smart Watches
      and Smartphone applications, or a control group who will receive a FitBit for physical
      activity monitoring only, for a period of 2-6 weeks prior to surgery. The prehabilitation
      programme will include exercise, nutritional, and psychological components. Study outcomes
      will include 6MWT (6-minute walk test), HADS (hospital anxiety and depression score), steps
      per day, length of stay post-operatively, and post-operative complications.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  be aged 18 years or over

          -  be able to consent to participate in the prehabilitation programme

          -  be undergoing major abdominal cancer surgery (including, but not limited to,
             cytoreductive surgery with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy)

          -  have at least 2 weeks to their operation date

          -  be able to understand written and spoken English

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  patients have any health conditions which will prevent them from safely taking part in
             a home-based exercise programme. For example, but not limited to, patients who have
             recently (within the past 3 months) had a myocardial infarction or a stroke or
             patients who have end-stage renal disease but are not on dialysis. We will use the
             &quot;Safety Reference Guide to support exercise services in people with cancer&quot; in The
             Lancet published paper &quot;Exercise as part of routine cancer care&quot;(5) to aid the
             screening of patients suitability.

          -  they have any bone metastasis

          -  are already active users of a FitBit device
