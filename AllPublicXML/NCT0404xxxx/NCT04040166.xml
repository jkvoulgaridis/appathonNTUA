  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The improvement of comprehensive multi-modality treatment and radiotherapy (RT) technology
      has resulted in an improved survival rate of head and neck malignancies within recent
      decades. As survival increases, late toxicity from cancer therapy becomes a larger burden.
      Radiation induced vascular injury following RT is a recognized complication of radiotherapy.
      Diagnosis of vascular changes predominately relies on non-invasive imaging techniques.
      Doppler ultrasound assessment has been proven as a good indicator of diffuse atherosclerotic
      disease and a significant predictor of future vascular events. New opportunities are provided
      by the recent introduction of the hybrid PET/MRI scanners for investigating the synergistic
      effect of these two modalities without the challenge of image co-registration. It has been
      shown that the PET system integrated with the MRI scanner performs the same as the PET
      portion of a PET/CT for various cancers and cardiovascular indications. MRI allows better
      delineation of the carotid artery and atherosclerotic plaque when compared with CT due to the
      superior soft tissue contrast. The PET/MRI system acquires the PET and MRI simultaneously
      allowing for perfect alignment between the 2 sets of images, when compared with the
      sequential acquisition in PET/CT where minor head movements can cause misalignment. There is
      evidence in the literature that 68-Ga DOTA-TATE PET-imaging can serve as a surrogate marker
      for evidence of invasion into the vessel wall and thereby possibly detects early, developing
      atherosclerotic plaque. Thus, combined PET and MR with 68-Ga DOTA-TATE should be a promising
      imaging tool to screen and characterize patients at risk for radiation induced carotid
      injury.

      In this study, DOTATATE-PET/MR will be performed in up to 60 patients with a history of
      radiation therapy for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma over 2 years.
