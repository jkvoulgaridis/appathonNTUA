  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label study of patients with relapsing forms of MS is designed to assess the
      biochemical, immunological, and kinetic profiles of natalizumab being used with specific
      brief dosing interruption. The study will be conducted at one site in the US. Ten subjects
      currently treated with natalizumab will be enrolled and will be evaluated for both PK/PD and
      cell trafficking in blood and/or CSF during standard dosing of natalizumab and at the end of
      a planned 12-week dosing interruption. MS disease activity will be carefully monitored
      clinically and by MRI and NfL.

      Study Title:

      The impact of a planned 12-week dosing interruption of natalizumab on immune cell
      trafficking, PK/PD parameters, and MS disease stability.

      Objectives:

      Hypothesis: An interruption in the dosing of natalizumab results in a lower risk of
      progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) while maintaining MS disease control by
      selective immune surveillance.

      Primary endpoints: To measure the re-establishment of immune surveillance by measuring
      leukocyte cell binding to the blood brain barrier and trafficking into the central nervous
      system (CNS) during a planned 12-week dosing interruption of natalizumab. This will be done
      by measuring leukocytes in the CSF. Concurrently, MS disease activity will be monitoring with
      MRI.

      Secondary endpoints:

        -  To characterize the difference in PK/PD parameters in patients during standard 28-day
           dosing intervals vs. at the end of a planned 12-week dosing interruption

        -  To measure natalizumab drug concentrations, Soluble Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule
           (sVCAM), Soluble Mucosal Vascular Addressin Cell Adhesion Molecule (sMAdCAM), Very Late
           Antigen-4 (VLA4) expression, and receptor occupancy measured in blood.

        -  To measure neurofilament light (NfL) in CSF and serum as a sensitive measure of MS
           disease stability.

        -  Using MRI and clinical parameters, to determine impact of a planned 12-week dosing
           interruption of natalizumab on MS disease stability.

        -  MRI's will be obtained for each patient at the end of the dose interruption and 3 months
           after the re-initiation of natalizumab dosing.

      Design:

      Single site, open-label, consenting patients with relapsing forms of Multiple Sclerosis who
      are scheduled for a dose interruption of natalizumab. Patients will provide biological
      samples (blood and CSF) and have MRIs post-dose interruption.

      Patient Population:

      Patients with relapsing forms of Multiple Sclerosis who are currently on natalizumab therapy
      with stable MS disease and who are scheduled for a planned 12-week dosing interruption.

      Treatment Groups:

      Duration of Study Participation: Up to 9 months Study Location: 8727 Beverly Blvd, West
      Hollywood, California (CA) 90048 United States (US) Study Phase: Pilot exploratory study.
      Number of Planned Subjects: 10 Sample Size Determination: This is an exploratory study. No
      formal sample size calculation was performed.
