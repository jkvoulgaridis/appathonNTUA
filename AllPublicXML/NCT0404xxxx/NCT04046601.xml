  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Detection of early esophageal cancer in surrounding normal tissue can be challenging even for
      experienced examiners. The early detection is essential to determine the following treatment.
      Early stages of esophageal cancers can be treated by endoscopic resection whereas advanced
      neoplasia might lead to an Operation of the esophagus. Diagnosis is made usually by biopsies
      of suspicious lesions or untargeted quadrant biopsies. The electrical properties in
      inflammatory tissue and cancer can be sensed by electrical bioimpedance technique.

      The aim of this study is to compare the impedance probe with the histological result and to
      investigate the feasibility of the new technique in detection of esophageal cancer.

      Detection of early esophageal cancer in surrounding normal tissue can be challenging even for
      experienced examiners. The early detection is essential to determine the following treatment.
      Early stages of esophageal cancers can be treated by endoscopic resection (ER) whereas
      advanced neoplasia might lead to esophagectomy. Diagnosis is made usually by biopsies of
      suspicious lesions or untargeted quadrant biopsies. The electrical properties in inflammatory
      tissue and dysplasia can be sensed by electrical bioimpedance technique. The aim of this
      study is to compare the impedance probe with the histological result and to investigate the
      feasibility of the new technique in detection of esophageal cancer.

    <description>After endoscopic resection of early esophageal cancer, the tissue will be measured by an impedance probe between 10Hz-1000000Hz, 20mV. 8 gold electrodes have been integrated to the probe. The impedance will be measured in different ways between the elctrodes. There will be 10 measurements in total for each specimen.</description>
