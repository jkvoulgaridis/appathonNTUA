  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endoscopic characterization is now essential in front of a colorectal lesion to predict its
      histology and choose the best therapeutic strategy. Different classifications have been
      proposed to predict histology depending on the endoscopic aspect. Thus, the aspect of the
      shape of the lesion is described in the Paris classification, the aspect of the mucosal
      pattern in Kudo's classification and the vascular pattern in Sano's one. Recently,
      classifications combining several color and mucosal and vascular pattern criteria have been
      described as the NICE classification or even more recently the Japanese JNET classification.
      However, although the interest in combining the Paris, Sano and Kudo criteria has recently
      shown its interest, there was not yet an overall classification covering all the published
      criteria. We have created a synthetic classification called CONECCT grouping the different
      criteria for an initial educational purpose. We have demonstrated that this tool allows
      interns and gastroenterologists to progress in the histological prediction of colorectal
      lesions presented in the form of photo files. Nevertheless, comparative data of the
      performances of those different classifications to predict the histology and the concordance
      intra and inter-observer have never been published. To validate this CONECCT classification,
      we created this comparative study evaluating the endoscopic characterization performances of
      these different classifications in terms of histological prediction and intra- and
      interobserver concordance in a group of gastroenterologists with varying levels of expertise
      in front of colorectal lesions presented in the form of photographic records.
