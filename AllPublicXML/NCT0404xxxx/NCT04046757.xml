      A mono-centre observational study with the aim of compare clinical outcome at 3 month on
      patients admitted with recent cerebral infarct and intracranial large vessel occlusion in the
      anterior circulation who are eligible for mechanical thrombectomy in three different position
      : Patients admitted first in the Comprehensive Stroke Center of Montpellier, those
      transferred after Proximity Stroke Unit or prehospital bypass for patients with high
      suspicion of large vessel occlusion.to the Comprehensive Stroke Center of Montpellier

      Multiple RCT has recently proved the superiority of mechanical thrombectomy compared to the
      best medical therapy (BMT) on patients with recent cerebral infarct and anterior circulation
      intracranial large vessel occlusion.

      In the Occitanie-Est region (ex Languedoc Roussillon), comprising 6 Stroke Unit, only the
      Comprehensive Stroke Unit of the CHU de Montpellier has a centre of interventional
      neuroradiology (NRI) that can perform mechanical thrombectomy.

      Patients suspected of stroke are referred to the nearest SU, then the candidates for
      thrombectomy, are transferred secondarily to the Stroke Center in Montpellier.

      Currently, there is no evidence that an initial management in a proximity stroke unit and a
      secondary transfer for a mechanical thrombectomy is associated with a loss of chance for
      patients, compared to patients initially treated at the Stroke Center regional reference.

      The objective of the study is to compare clinical outcome on patients admitted first in the
      Comprehensive Stroke Center of Montpellier those transferred after Proximity Stroke Unit or
      directly admitted when high suspicion of large vessel occlusion.
