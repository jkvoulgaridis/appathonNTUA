  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute pulmonary embolism (PE) in critically ill patients is common and often life
      threatening. The diagnosis of acute PE is often entertained in intensive care unit patients
      who develop unexplained hypotension or hypoxemia. Obtaining diagnostic confirmation of acute
      PE with a contrast-enhanced computed tomography of the chest (CT angiogram) may be difficult
      as patients are often too unstable for transport to the CT scanner or have renal
      insufficiency limiting the ability to receive intravenous contrast agents. Making or
      excluding the diagnosis of acute PE in these patients is critically important, as hemodynamic
      instability or right heart dysfunction, if due to PE, puts patients in the massive or
      submassive category and increased mortality risk. More aggressive therapies such as
      thrombolysis, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation or surgical embolectomy are often
      entertained. The investigators have previously described a case where endobronchial
      ultrasound (EBUS) was employed in the diagnostic algorithm of suspected acute PE and
      significantly affected treatment recommendations. The investigators believe that, in these
      patients, use of EBUS to assess for thrombotic occlusion of the central pulmonary vasculature
      can fill a critical gap in the decision tree for management of these patients.

      EBUS has become part of the diagnostic approach in a number of clinical situations, including
      the workup and staging of suspected malignancy, unexplained lymphadenopathy, and diagnosis of
      mediastinal and parabronchial masses. There is strong evidence that EBUS is equivalent to
      mediastinoscopy in the mediastinal staging of lung cancer. The number of physicians skilled
      and experienced in performance of EBUS has increased dramatically, and training in the
      procedure is frequently obtained in a pulmonary fellowship.

      To our knowledge, there have been no prospective studies that investigate the use of EBUS as
      a tool for the diagnosis of acute central pulmonary embolism in critically ill patients where
      obtaining diagnostic confirmation of this diagnosis with a contrast-enhanced computed
      tomography of the chest is not safe or feasible.

      This is a single center, pilot study to evaluate critically ill patients diagnosed with acute
      pulmonary embolism using endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS). The investigators anticipate to
      enroll 20 subjects at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center and UCLA Medical Center, Santa
      Monica. The enrolled subjects will be imaged using the flexible bronchoscopy with EBUS.

      After informed consent is obtained, the following procedure will be performed:

      An Olympus EBUS bronchoscope will be used for all endobronchial ultrasound examinations. This
      scope has a 6.9 mm outer diameter, a 2.7 mm working channel and 30-degree oblique
      forward-viewing optics. A 12 MHz linear ultrasound transducer with a maximum penetration of
      50 mm will be linked to a processor (Olympus EU-ME2) that allows an integrated power Doppler
      mode to visualize the vascular blood flow.

      Bronchoscopy will be introduced through the adaptor connected to the endotracheal tube, in
      patients who are already under general anesthesia and on mechanical ventilation. The
      bronchoscope will be advanced into the airways and endobronchial ultrasound of the main
      pulmonary artery (PA) and lobar branches will be performed in a standardized fashion as
      follow:

      Advance the bronchoscopy into the right main bronchus distally to the level of the right
      lower lobe, between 12 and 3 o'clock position where the interlobar artery of the PA is seen.
      Then the scope will be pulled back slowly, turning counterclockwise, following the course of
      the PA on the medial wall of the right bronchial tree until the level of the carina, where
      the right main PA and the PA trunk are seen. The scope is then turned to the right again,
      towards 3 o'clock following the right upper lobe bronchus to examine the upper lobar artery.
      The scope is then advanced into the left main bronchus, towards 9 o'clock to examine the
      upper lobar artery, then advanced distally to the left lower lobe bronchus to examine the
      interlobar artery. At the completion of the imaging the EBUS bronchoscope will be withdrawn.

      Ultrasound images and video will be stored to the machine and visualized thrombi will be
      marked.

      For patients who have had a chest CT for suspected PE, the investigators will assess
      sensitivity and specificity of EBUS to visualize or exclude PE. For patients who are unable
      to have a CT, the investigators will not be able to determine true efficacy, but will report
      the number of positive and negative studies and follow these patients for outcome and
      subsequent definitive diagnosis of venous thromboembolism.

      As this is a pilot study looking at the feasibility of EBUS for diagnosing acute pulmonary
      embolism, study personnel performing the EBUS will not be blinded to the clinical diagnosis
      and the management of the subject. A brief report of the procedure results will be uploaded
      in the patient's medical record. Any clinically relevant findings from the EBUS will be
      communicated to the subject's treating team. Regardless of the findings, a note stating that
      the EBUS technique is not yet established for evaluating acute pulmonary embolism in
      critically ill patients will be emphasized in order to prevent any bias in the patient's
      clinical care.
