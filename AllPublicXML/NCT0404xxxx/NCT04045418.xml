  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although some important progresses were made in the field of the meridian research, no
      breakthroughs have been achieved. Besides,there are some problems in meridian researches.
      Particularly, previous research of meridian phenomenon involved lots of subjective elements
      and outcomes.Researches that use modern scientific techniques to investigate the biological
      characteristics of meridian phenomenon are urgently needed. Therefore, this study is designed
      to assess the microcirculatory characteristics of meridian phenomenon for the Heart and Lung
      meridians by using laser doppler. Thus, the biological characteristics of meridian phenomenon
      could be presented objectively in a scientific methodology

  <detailed_description>

      This study will include 40 patients diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
      (COPD) and 80 healthy volunteers. Laser doppler examination will be adopted to assess the
      microcirculatory characteristics of meridian phenomenon for Heart and Lung meridians in the
      physiology/pathological state. Moreover, the site specificity for the meridian-visceral
      association and surface-surface association between the Heart and Lung meridians will be
      investigated.Primary outcomes will be blood flow curve and blood perfusion
      units(PU).Furthermore, this study will build standardized techniques and schemes for
      detecting the microcirculatory characteristics of meridian phenomenon for Heart and Lung
      meridians. The results of this study could also provide scientific foundation for traditional
      meridian theories.
