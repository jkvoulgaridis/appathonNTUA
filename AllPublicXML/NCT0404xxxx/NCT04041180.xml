  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this prospective observational study among sickle cell children aged 7 to 17 years, who
      face many experience of pain, pain will be assessed during incentive spirometry sessions.
      Then a relation between, inspiratory volume, pain and the length of hospital stay will be
      identified .

      Currently, there is no scientific data regarding the correlation between acute pain during
      vaso-occlusive crisis, incentive spirometry and the impact on length of hospital stay. In
      fact, physiotherapist experience's in the pediatric department suggests that the pain
      expressed by the child is not always correlated with inspiratory capacity.

      The absence of pain is one of the reasons for hospital discharge after decompensation in
      patients with sickle cell disease. However, no scientific study has linked incentive
      spirometry, pain and length of hospital stay.

      Investigator assume that these children underestimate the real pain and its impact on
      breathing pattern, and presume that the maximal inspiratory volume during spirometry sessions
      will be a better reflect of pain than standard pain scale.

      The aim of this study is to show that inspiratory volume would be a better indicator of
      discharge from hospitalization than actual pain scales.
