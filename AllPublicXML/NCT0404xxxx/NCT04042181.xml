  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity levels worldwide have tripled since the mid 1070's. Obesity and its co-morbidities,
      metabolic syndrome, type II diabetes, and cardiovascular disease, are serious widespread
      health concerns which urgently need to be addressed. G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs),
      such as the ghrelin receptor (GHS-R1a), are well known for their key role in the homeostatic
      control of food intake and energy balance. Ghrelin is the major hunger hormone in the body
      and ghrelin-receptor antagonists have been advanced as potential anti-obesity agents. This
      receptor is therefore an ideal target for orally delivered probiotic-derived bioactives with
      excellent bioavailability. Bacterial strains with the ability to modulate these receptors may
      have high potential as probiotics with the ability to induce appetite modulation effects.

      Due to promising pre-clinical results, the investigators aim to trial a Bif Longum probiotic,
      which can target these receptors, in an obese human population. We hypothesise that the
      probiotic will positively alter the gut-brain axis, improving control of hunger and satiety
      signalling adults with high BMI, leading to decreased BMI and waist-hip ratio scores.
      Furthermore, the investigators expect that the mechanism through which the probiotic is
      having a positive impact can be determined via investigation of the microbiota composition,
      gut hormone levels and circulating immune profiles.

          5. Is in general good health, as determined by the investigator;

          6. Willing to consume the investigational product daily for the duration of the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Females are pregnant, lactating or wish to become pregnant during the study. Female
             subject is currently either of:

               -  non-childbearing potential (i.e., physiologically incapable of becoming pregnant,
                  including any female who is post-menopausal or any female who is surgically
                  sterilized (via documented hysterectomy or bilateral tubal ligation). (For
                  purposes of this study, postmenopausal is defined as one year without menses), OR

               -  child bearing potential, the subject is eligible to enter and participate in this
                  study if she is not lactating and has a negative urine pregnancy test at the
                  screening visit, visit 2 and upon completion of the study at visit 7. The subject
                  must also agree to one of the following methods of contraception: i. Complete
                  abstinence from intercourse two weeks prior to administration of study drug,
                  throughout the clinical trial, until the completion of follow-up procedures or
                  for two weeks following discontinuation of the study medication in cases where
                  subject discontinues the study prematurely. (Subjects utilizing this method must
                  agree to use an alternate method of contraception if they should become sexually
                  active and will be queried on whether they have been abstinent in the preceding 2
                  weeks when they present to the clinic for the Final Visit.) or, ii. has a male
                  sexual partner who is surgically sterilized prior to the Screen Visit and is the
                  only male sexual partner for that subject or, iii. sexual partner(s) is/are
                  exclusively female or, iv. Oral contraceptives (either combined or progestogen
                  only) with double-barrier method of contraception consisting of spermicide with
                  either condom or diaphragm. (Women of child-bearing potential using an oral
                  contraceptive in combination with a double-barrier method of contraception are
                  required to continue to use this form of contraception for 1 week following
                  discontinuation of study medication).

                  v. Use of double-barrier contraception, specifically, a spermicide plus a
                  mechanical barrier (e.g. male condom, female diaphragm). The subject must be
                  using this method for at least 1 week following the end of the study or, vi. Use
                  of any intrauterine device (IUD) or contraceptive implant with published data
                  showing that the highest expected failure rate is less than 1% per year. The
                  subject must have the device inserted at least 2 weeks prior to the first Screen
                  Visit, throughout the study, and 2 weeks following the end of the study.

             statin or any other medication that the investigator determines could impact the
             results of the study.

         11. Subject has a history of co-existing gastrointestinal, and/or gynecological, and/or
             urologic pathology (e.g. colon cancer, colitis, Crohn's Disease, Celiac,
             Endometriosis, prostate cancer) or lactose intolerance;

         12. Subject has a history of drug and/or alcohol abuse at the time of enrolment
