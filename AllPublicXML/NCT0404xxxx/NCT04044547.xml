    <description>The Unified Parkinson´s Disease Rating Scale Part Ⅲ is an accepted and validated scale for the assessment of motor function in Parkinson´s disease. Each of the 27 sub-items in the UPDRS III is measured on a scale of 0 to 4, where 0 is normal and 4 represents severe abnormalities. The total scores therefore ranges from 0 (Best score possible) to 108 (Worst score possible).</description>

    <description>Four stable dose levels of LY03003 at 14, 28, 42 and 56 mg will be evaluated. For each dose level, the stable dose will be administered once a week for consecutive 5 weeks. To improve patient's tolerability, dose upward titration will be applied to 28, 42 and 56 mg dose groups according to the following schedule:
Patients to be enrolled to 14 mg dose group will receive 14 mg for 5 consecutive weeks.
Patients to be enrolled to 28 mg dose group will receive 14 mg in the first week and then 28 mg in the next 5 weeks.
Patients to be enrolled to 42 mg dose group will receive 14 mg in the first week, 28 mg in the second week and then 42 mg in the next 5 weeks.
Patients to be enrolled to 56 mg dose group will receive 14 mg in the first week, 28 mg in the second week, 42 mg in the third week and then 56 mg in the next 5 weeks.</description>

             depression;

          -  Patient had received therapy with a dopamine (DA) agonist either concurrently or had
             done so within 28 days prior to the Screening;

          -  Patient had received therapy with 1 of the following drugs either concurrently or
             within 28 days prior to Screening: monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) inhibitors (e.g.,
             pargyline, selegiline), DA releasing agents (e.g., amphetamine), reserpine,
             DA-antagonists (e.g., metoclopramide), neuroleptics, or other medications that may
             interact with DA function;

          -  Patient was currently (at the time of Screening) receiving central nervous system
             active therapy (e.g., sedatives, hypnotics, antidepressants, anxiolytics), unless the
             dose had been stable for at least 28 days prior to Screening Visit and was likely to
