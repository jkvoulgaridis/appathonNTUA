  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neuro-degenerative disease in older
      people. Falls are common among people PD with the incidence rate up to 70% and have strong
      associations with the severity of the disease, balance impairment, and freezing of gait.The
      abnormal gait characteristics include reduction in stride length, gait speed and arm swing,
      and increase in cadence. Gait training, balance training, aerobic training, Tai chi and dance
      training are common types of physical rehabilitation for PD. Brisk walking is a way of
      walking with a pace faster than normal, and it can improve dynamic balance for senior men and
      balance function for chronic stroke clients.

      Brisk walking also promotes cardiopulmonary fitness and walking endurance in elderly women,
      healthy middle-age and older adults, active elderly men and chronic stroke clients. Our
      previous pilot randomized controlled trial on the effects of a 6-week home-based brisk
      walking program indicates that it is feasible and safe for the early PD population with
      improved walking capacity measured by 6-minute walk distance. The positive effects could
      carry over to 6 weeks after treatment completion. Up-to-date, the short- and long-term
      effects of brisk walking in improving balance and gait performance, and functional capacity
      in people with PD have not yet been well investigated. In order to promote their balance and
      functional capacity in longer term, more sustained training and better exercise adherence may
      be necessary.

    <measure>Movement Disorder Society Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale Part I (MDS-UPDRS-I) score</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>This score assesses the non-motor aspects of experiences of daily living in people with Parkinson's disease with a total of 13 questions. The score will be administered by assessor asking participants about their behaviors and non-motor symptoms such as cognitive impairment, hallucination, depressive and anxious mood, sleep, pain, urinary and constipation problems, and fatigue etc. Each question will be rated from 0 (normal) to 4 (severe). The MDS-UPDRS-I score ranges from 0 to 52, with higher scores indicating more severe non-motor impairment.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Activities-specific Balance Confidence (ABC) Scale score</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The ABC score will be used to measure the participants' perceived level of balance confidence in 16 indoor and outdoor activities. Each activity is rated from 0-100 (0 indicates no confidence and 100 indicates full confidence, total score=1600). The total score is converted into percentage score ranging from 0 to 100%, with a higher ABC score indicating a higher level of balance confidence.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Parkinson Disease Questionnaire-39 (PDQ-39) summary index score</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>It is a health-related quality-of-life outcome measure that contains 39 self-reported items on eight domains, i.e.: mobility [#1-10], activities of daily living [#11-16], emotional well-being [#17-22], stigma [#23-26], social support [#27-29], cognition [#30-33], communication [#34-36], and body discomfort [#37-39]. The PDQ-39 has been translated into Chinese and validated for local use. Each item is scored on 5-point Likert-type scales ranging from 0 (never), 1 (occasionally), 2 (sometimes), and 3 (often) to 4 (always) based on their perception on the item over the past month. The PDQ-39 total score is 156 and the PDQ-39 summary index is created by summing all eight of the PDQ-39 domains and standardizing the score on a scale of 0-100%. A lower PDQ-39 summary index score reflects a better health-related quality-of-life.</description>
