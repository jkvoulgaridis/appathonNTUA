  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of radical colectomy with hybrid
      transvaginal natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (hvNOTES). This is a
      prospective, single-arm, multicenter, uncontrolled, open-label phase II study in 100 eligible
      subjects with resectable colon cancer. After informed consent, patients will be sent to have
      hvNOTES radical colectomy by surgeons with good experience in laparoscopic colorectal
      surgery. Patients' demographic, operative detail and postoperative outcomes including
      conversion to open surgery, operating time, blood loss, pain score, resumption of
      gastrointestinal function, postoperative complications, length of hospital stay, sexual
      function, quality of recovery, recurrence rate, recurrence patterns, relapse-free survival,
      and overall survival will be recorded prospectively. The results of the patients will be
      assessed to validate safety, functional outcomes or oncologic outcomes of hvNOTES colectomy.

    <description>Postoperative complications used to calculate the Comprehensive Complication Index (CCI) will be recorded during and following each patient's hospital stay up to 90 days from surgery.

The overall morbidity is reflected on a scale from 0 (no complication) to 100 (death). Lower values represent better outcomes. These complications are defined and categorized by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0.</description>

    <description>With the patient under general anesthesia, pneumoperitoneum is achieved. Three trocars are inserted, one 12 mm or 5 mm in the umbilicus and two 5 mm in the right and/or left flanks. Mobilization of the splenic flexure or the hepatic flexure is performed with an initial traditional laparoscopic approach. A single-port is inserted into the abdominal cavity transvaginally through the colpotomy. Then most of the procedures are performed transvaginally with conventional rigid laparoscopic instruments. The corresponding arteries and veins are divided. The mesocolon is mobilized. The small intestine/colon/rectum are then divided with stapler. The specimen is removed transvaginally. Intracorporeal anastomosis is performed as per the surgeon's standard of care. For sigmoidectomy, the colon is then exteriorized and the anvil is fixed in the colon. An end-to-end anastomosis is performed using a circular stapler. Drainage tubes may be used.</description>
