  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is an open-label, randomized, single-dose, 4-period, 4-sequence, crossover study
      in a single cohort of approximately 12 healthy adult participants. The purpose of this study
      is to evaluate the relative bioavailability of a newly developed modified release (MR) tablet
      formulation of PF-06865571 relative to an immediate release (IR) tablet formulation of
      PF-06865571 under fed conditions. In addition, this study will also assess the relative
      bioavailability of the MR formulation under fasted conditions relative to fed conditions, in
      healthy adult participants. Study results will be used to determine if the new MR formulation
      may be suitable for use in future clinical studies with PF-06865571. Healthy adult Japanese
      participants will also be enrolled in this study to support inclusion of Japanese
      participants in future clinical studies.

Serious adverse event (SAE) was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. Treatment-emergent are events between first dose of study drug and up to Y days after last dose that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pretreatment state.
