  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Up to 50% of children experience nightmares annually. Nightmares interfere with sleep quality
      and quantity resulting in sleep deficiency, and are associated with negative mental health
      consequences. Previous research has shown efficacy of manualized CBT treatment for reducing
      trauma related nightmares in adults, and preliminary evidence has shown efficacy in children.
      This study is the first randomized clinical trial to evaluate the effectiveness of the
      treatment for idiopathic, as well as trauma related nightmares in children. The treatment in
      a manualized CBT protocol (5 sessions) that teaches sleep hygiene, relaxation strategies, and
      addresses nightmares therapeutically through exposure and rescripting.
