  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the feasibility of a larger randomized controlled trial to examine the
      effect of reminiscence aided physical activity on the balance and mobility of older adults
      living in long term care. The study uses the jDome BikeAround system, which is a stationary
      bicycle with a projector screen that runs google earth, as the user bicycles, the map
      progresses giving the appearance that the user is bicycling through the environment chosen.
      Half of the participants will use the system during the first 6 week campaign, there will
      then be a 6 week washout period. Following the washout period, there will be a second 6 week
      campaign when the other half of the participants will use the jDome BikeAround system.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Physical activity has been shown to have numerous benefits for physical well-being and
      function. Stationary cycling is one example of physical activity that can provide
      opportunities for residents who are inactive, living in long term care and are at high risk
      for falls.

      The use of jDome BikeAround provides older adults in long term care an opportunity to engage
      in a motivating reminiscence activity that is coupled with physical activity. Participants
      will be divided into two groups, one group will take part in jDome BikeAround sessions 3x per
      week for 6 weeks in addition to The Glebe Centre's Fall Prevention program, while the second
      group will just participant in Fall Prevention program. There will be a 6 week wash out, then
      the second cohort will participant in the jDome Bike Around sessions 3x a week in addition to
      the Fall Prevention program while the first cohort will just participate in the Fall
      Prevention Program.

      Participants will have their balance, mobility, leg strength, endurance tested as well as a
      tracking of fall risks at the beginning and end of each of the jDome BikeAround sessions (4
      measurement points). Feasibility will be determined by the ability to enroll an adequate
      number of participants, protocol completion by participants, and the number of adverse
      events.

During the first campaign half of the participants will use the motivating reminiscence technology while receiving the standard fall prevention programming, while the second half will receive just the standard fall prevention programming. During the 6 week washout period all participants will just receive the standard fall prevention programming. After the washout period, there will be the second campaign where the other half of the participants will use the motivating reminiscence technology while receiving the standard fall prevention programming, whereas the remaining participants will just receive the standard fall prevention programming.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The Performance Oriented Mobility Assessment Tool is a simple, easily administered test that measures a resident's gait and balance. The test is scored on the resident's ability to perform specific tasks as either 0, 1 or 2 where a score of 0 represents the most impaired while a score of 2 represents independence. The total is calculated by adding the score for each individual activity, the lowest possible score is 0 and the highest possible score is 28. The higher the score the better the more mobile the participant is. This will give us a baseline value for the participants.</description>

          <title>Scott Fall Risk</title>
          <description>Scott Fall Risk is an assessment tool that measures the risk of falls for a resident in long term care. The higher the value on the assessment indicates a higher risk of falls and the range is -5 - 19. A score below 7 indicates that universal fall precautions with a plan for individual risks need to be in place for that individual, a score equal to or greater than 7 but equal to or less than 12 indicates the individual is at high risk for a fall and a score above 12 indicates the individual is at a high risk for a fall and has unsafe ambulation.</description>

        <description>The Performance Oriented Mobility Assessment Tool is a simple, easily administered test that measures a resident's gait and balance. The test is scored on the resident's ability to perform specific tasks as either 0, 1 or 2 where a score of 0 represents the most impaired while a score of 2 represents independence. The total is calculated by adding the score for each individual activity, the lowest possible score is 0 and the highest possible score is 28. The higher the score the better the more mobile the participant is. This will give us a baseline value for the participants.</description>
