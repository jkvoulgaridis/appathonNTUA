    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well F-18 fluoroethyltyrosine (fluoroethyltyrosine) works in
      detecting tumors in participants with intracranial tumors that have come back. Imaging
      agents, such as fluoroethyltyrosine, may help doctors see the tumor better during a positron
      emission tomography (PET) scan.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine if F-18 fluoroethyltyrosine (FET) PET can differentiate between benign
      treatment-related changes and recurrence in comparison to pathology alone in population 1.

      II. To determine if FET PET can accurately differentiate between low-grade and high-grade
      glial neoplasms in population 2.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine if FET PET can differentiate between benign treatment-related changes and
      recurrence in comparison to pathology or imaging follow-up in population 1.

      II. To determine if FET PET can differentiate between benign treatment-related changes and
      recurrence in comparison to pathology alone in population 1 patients with recurrent low-grade
      gliomas (grades 1 and 2).

      OUTLINE:

      Participants receive F-18 fluoroethyltyrosine intravenously (IV) over approximately 1 minute
      and undergo PET over 40 minutes.

      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up periodically.

    <measure>Binary characterization of study as positive/negative for recurrence disease in three groups of patients with intracranial neoplasms with concern for recurrence or progression on conventional imaging (Population 1)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>Patients in population 1 will be grouped into high-grade gliomas, low-grade gliomas, or metastatic disease. Radiological readers will have access only to FET PET images during evaluation and will grade the lesions in a binary fashion as having recurrent disease or not having recurrent disease. Misclassification rate, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and accuracy will be calculated for the detection of recurrent disease. 95% percent confidence intervals will be created.</description>

    <measure>Binary characterization of study as positive/negative for high grade glial neoplasms in patients prior to primary treatment with planned biopsy or surgical resection (Population 2)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>Low-grade glioma is defined by low uptake of FET on all time-points, or progressive increase in SUVs of the lesion at each of the three imaging time points during the dynamic PET acquisition. Misclassification rate, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and accuracy will be calculated for the detection of Grade III/IV neoplasm in population 2. 95% percent confidence intervals will be created.</description>

  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Binary characterization of follow-up imaging as positive/negative for tumor recurrence</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to six months</time_frame>
    <description>Positive for tumor recurrence on follow-up imaging as correlate endpoint will be defined as a greater than 50% increase in the enhancing component of the lesion. If there is less than 50% increase in the enhancing component of the lesion, then it will be considered negative for tumor recurrence on follow-up. Follow-up imaging has to be performed within six months of the FET PET imaging study.</description>
