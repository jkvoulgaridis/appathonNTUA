  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although some important progresses were made in the field of the meridian research, no
      breakthroughs have been achieved. Besides,there are some problems in meridian researches.
      Particularly, previous research of meridian phenomenon involved lots of subjective elements
      and outcomes.Researches that use modern scientific techniques to investigate the biological
      characteristics of meridian phenomenon are urgently needed. Therefore, this study is designed
      to assess the heat transport characteristics of meridian phenomenon for the Heart and Lung
      meridians by using infrared thermal imaging. Thus, the biological characteristics of meridian
      phenomenon could be presented objectively in a scientific methodology.

      This study will include 40 patients diagnosed with chronic stable angina pectoris (CSAP) and
      40 healthy volunteers. Infrared thermal imaging will be adopted to assess the heat transport
      characteristics of meridian phenomenon for Heart and Lung meridians in the
      physiology/pathological state. In addition, by comparing the heat transport characteristics
      in the acupoints along the Heart and Lung meridians, the relative specificity of the two
      meridians will also be investigated.

      Primary outcomes will be infrared thermal images and acupoint temperature. Furthermore, this
      study will build standardized techniques and schemes for detecting the heat transport
      characteristics of meridian phenomenon for Heart and Lung. The results of this study could
      also provide scientific foundation for traditional meridian theories.

    <description>Infrared thermal imaging will be adopted to assess the heat transport characteristics of meridian phenomenon for participants in the two groups.
Experimental device: a NEC InfRec R450 infrared thermal imaging camera
Experimental process: The participants will be allowed to stabilize for 15 minutes in a supine position in the experimental room before formal examination They are asked to keep silent, breathe normally and avoid movement of limbs during the whole measuring period. The height and angle of the infrared thermal imaging camera is adjusted so that the measurement sites of the participant's arm is located in the center of the camera screen. The infrared thermal imaging and acupoint temperature will be recorded for 5 minutes.
Measurement sites: Shenmen (HT7) and Shaohai (HT3) of the Heart meridian, Taiyuan(LU9) and Chize (LU5) of the Lung meridian.</description>
