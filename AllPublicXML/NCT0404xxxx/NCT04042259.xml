    <textblock>
      Surgical site infection rates for contaminated or dirty laparotomy wounds can be as high as
      45%. Surgical management of dirty and contaminated wounds has been controversial in the
      literature and between surgeons. Primary closure (PC) of these wounds can lead to multiple
      complications including surgical site infection (SSI), necrotizing soft tissue infection,
      wound and fascial dehiscence, evisceration, sepsis and hernia development. However, an
      alternative technique of utilizing secondary intention results in prolonged healing time and
      increased cost and healthcare resource utilization. Delayed primary closure (DPC) was
      developed to address many of these issues. Bhangu completed a systematic review and
      meta-analysis comparing primary versus delayed primary skin closure in contaminated and dirty
      abdominal wounds. They included 8 studies randomizing 623 patients with contaminated or dirty
      abdominal wounds to either DPC or PC. The most common diagnosis was appendicitis (77.4%),
      followed by perforated abdominal viscus (11.5%), ileostomy closure (6.5%), trauma (2.7%), and
      intra-abdominal abscess/other peritonitis (1.9%). The time to first assessment for DPC was
      between 2 and 5 days postoperatively. In all studies, the DPC group had significantly less
      SSIs using a fixed-effect model (odds ratio, 0.65; 95%CI, 0.40-0.93; P = .02). However,
      heterogeneity was high (72%), and using a random-effects model, the effect was no longer
      significant (odds ratio, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.25-1.64; P = .36). Additionally, all of the studies
      were found to be at high risk of bias, with marked deficiencies in study design and outcome
      assessment.

      A recent systematic review showed improved fascial closure rates with negative pressure wound
      therapy (NPWT) Yet, a large national study using NPWT to perform a DPC has been shown to
      actually decrease the rate of closure. Access to NPWT has increased over the years and
      innovative wound management techniques including incisional application of negative pressure
      therapy have allowed clinicians to apply this method to dirty wounds following the principles
      of delayed primary closure. There are currently no studies available to help determine the
      safety and efficacy of advanced NPWT techniques to optimize surgical wound management from
      the open abdomen to skin closure. Within our Division, we have decided to make a practice
      change and develop a standard closure plan for open abdomens using the negative pressure
      devices available within our institution.
