  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind, sham-controlled, crossover study in which subjects with the
      non-fluent/agrammatic and logopenic variants of primary progressive aphasia (naPPA and lvPPA,
      respectively) will undergo language testing and structural and functional brain imaging
      before and after receiving 10 semi-consecutive daily sessions of real or sham high-definition
      transcranial direct current stimulation (HD-tDCS) paired with modified constraint-induced
      language therapy (mCILT). Language testing and brain imaging will be repeated immediately
      after completion of and 3 months following completion of treatment. The 3-month follow-up
      will be the primary endpoint. The investigators will examine changes in language performance
      induced by HD-tDCS + mCILT compared to sham HD-tDCS + mCILT. The investigators will also use
      network science to analyze brain imaging (fMRI) data to identify network properties
      associated with baseline PPA severity and tDCS-induced changes in performance. This study
      will combine knowledge gained from our behavioral, imaging, and network data in order to
      determine the relative degrees to which these properties predict whether persons with PPA
      will respond to intervention.

      The central framework for the project is a double-blind, sham-controlled, crossover study in
      which subjects with the non-fluent/agrammatic and logopenic variants of primary progressive
      aphasia (naPPA and lvPPA, respectively) will undergo language testing and structural and
      functional brain imaging before and after receiving 10 semi-consecutive daily sessions of
      real or sham high definition transcranial direct current stimulation (HD-tDCS) paired with
      modified constraint-induced language therapy (mCILT). Language testing and brain imaging will
      be repeated immediately after completion of and 3 months following completion of treatment.

      Subjects with naPPA and lvPPA will be randomized to one of two study arms: HD-tDCS+mCILT or
      sham stimulation+mCILT paired with pre- and post-stimulation imaging and behavioral measures.
      Equal numbers of subjects with naPPA and lvPPA will be randomized to the HD-tDCS + mCILT and
      sham + mCILT study arms. The study is double-blinded, in that neither the subject nor the
      study personnel administering HD-tDCS or sham stimulation will know which arm of the study
      the subject has been randomized into. Study coordinators will administer HD-tDCS by entering
      a pre-determined code that has been programmed into the device by another member of the study
      team. Data will be digitally audio-recorded and analyzed off-line, such that study team
      members performing data coding and analysis will likewise be blinded to the treatment
      condition of each subject.

      approximately 8 months. The events of the study visits are described below:

    <description>The primary outcome measure will be the change in score on the WAB-AQ, a score assessing overall aphasia recovery. Scores can range from 0-100. 0-25 is very severe, 26-50 is severe, 51-75 is moderate, and 76-above is mild. A score of 93 or higher is considered recovered.</description>

    <intervention_name>high-definition transcranial direct current stimulation</intervention_name>
    <description>High definition transcranial direct current stimulation (HD-tDCS) involves the application of low-intensity current through electrodes placed on the scalp. It is believed to elicit brain effects by producing incremental shifts in the resting membrane potential of large numbers of neurons, which alters neuronal firing rates and thus modulates patterns of brain activity in potentially behaviorally-relevant ways. HD-tDCS differs from conventional transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) because it employed smaller electrodes configured in such a way as to deliver more focal stimulation of the brain.</description>

    <intervention_type>Behavioral</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>modified constraint-induced language therapy</intervention_name>
    <description>Modified constraint-induced language therapy (mCILT) is a behavioral language therapy that invokes use-dependent learning in communicative interactions by requiring spoken output and restricting use of alternative forms of communication, such as gestures, as a substitute for spoken output. Other key elements of CILT include massed practice of goal-directed speech and shaping of desired responses by increasing response demands as participants improve. MCILT differs from traditional constraint-induced language therapy (CILT) in three ways: 1) it will be done as an individual therapy with the examiner in the role of a communication partner; 2) treatment will be delivered in short sessions (1 hour rather than a more typical 3-4 hour session); 3) targeting nouns + semantically related verbs to generate noun + verb phrases in treatment, a modification that may be better suited to addressing syntactic structure.</description>
