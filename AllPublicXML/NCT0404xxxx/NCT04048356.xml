      This is a randomized controlled trial to determine if there is a difference between
      chlorhexidine gluconate and povidone iodine vaginal preparations for urogynecological surgery
      post operative infections.

    <textblock>
      The purpose of this randomized controlled trial is to determine whether there is a difference
      in efficacy of two of the most common commercially available vaginal surgical preparations.
      The first objective is to determine whether chlorhexidine gluconate is non-inferior to
      povidone iodine with respect to post-operative infections including urinary tract infections
      (both culture proven and empirically treated) and surgical site infections (as defined by the
      Centers for Disease Control). The second objective is to determine whether chlorhexidine
      gluconate is non-inferior to povidone iodine with respect to vulvar and vaginal irritation.

          -  Undergoing urogynecologic procedures or surgery

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnant - all patients are verified regarding pregnancy status prior to gynecologic
             surgical intervention at all sites of surgery - for patients who are premenopausal and
