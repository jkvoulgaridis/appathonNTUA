               -  Negative urinary strip: absence of leukocyturia, hematuria, and proteinuria
                  (urine strip made a second time in case of positivity, for confirmation)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participation in any study other than purely observational, in the 4 weeks preceding
             this study (determined by the theoretical date of administration of MOX-2 mg or IVM).

          -  Person who has taken IVM in the last 6 months

          -  Any vaccination in the 4 weeks preceding this study

          -  Acute infection requiring a treatment in the 10 days preceding this study, determined
             by the anamnesis during the medical interview (example: pulmonary infection, ENT,
             digestive, cutaneous, with implementation of an antibiotic treatment or not)

          -  Long-term antiretroviral therapy (protease inhibitor, non-nucleoside reverse
             transcriptase inhibitor), or treatment with ampicillin or chloramphenicol within 10
             days prior to administration of the test drug

          -  History or presence of neurological (including epilepsy) or neuropsychiatric disease

          -  Excessive consumption of alcohol or other drug abuse within 72 hours prior to the
             administration of the test treatment determined by the medical history during the
             medical interview.

          -  Any condition, in the opinion of the investigator, which exposes the subject to an
             undue risk

          -  Subjects who donated blood in the 8 weeks prior to study entry, with a standard volume
             (&gt; 500 mL)

          -  Known intolerance to IVM, MOX or any of the excipients (including placebo)

          -  During the clinical examination: symptoms, physical signs or biological constants
             suggestive of systemic disorders, including renal, hepatic, cardiovascular, pulmonary,
             cutaneous, immunodeficiency, psychiatric disorders and other abnormalities likely to
             interfere with the interpretation results of the test. The doctor may then give a
             favorable or unfavorable opinion for the inclusion of the participant
