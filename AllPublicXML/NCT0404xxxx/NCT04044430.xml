      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and how well encorafenib, binimetinib, and
      nivolumab work in treating patients with microsatellite stable, BRAFV600E gene-mutated
      colorectal cancer that has spread to other places in the body (metastatic). Encorafenib and
      binimetinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for
      cell growth. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab, may help the body's
      immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow
      and spread. Giving encorafenib, binimetinib, and nivolumab may work better in treating
      patients with colorectal cancer compared to standard treatments.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe overall response rate (ORR) upon treatment with encorafenib, binimetinib, and
      nivolumab in patients with BRAFV600E, microsatellite stable (MSS) metastatic colorectal
      cancer (mCRC).

      II. To determine the safety and tolerability of nivolumab, encorafenib, and binimetinib in
      patients with BRAFV600E, MSS mCRC.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate median progression-free survival (PFS) upon treatment with encorafenib,
      binimetinib, and nivolumab.

      II. To estimate median overall survival (OS) upon treatment with encorafenib, binimetinib,
      and nivolumab.

      III. To estimate median time to response (TTR) upon treatment with encorafenib, binimetinib,
      and nivolumab.

      IV. To estimate median duration of response (DoR) upon treatment with encorafenib,
      binimetinib, and nivolumab.

      V. To estimate disease control rate (DCR) upon treatment with encorafenib, binimetinib, and
      nivolumab.

      EXPLORATORY (CORRELATIVE) OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess genomic and immune changes upon treatment with encorafenib, binimetinib, and
      nivolumab in tumor tissue, blood and stool.

      II. To correlate genomic and immune changes upon treatment with encorafenib, binimetinib, and
      nivolumab in tumor tissue, blood and stool with radiographic response.

      III. To evaluate contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) imaging for disease burden that
      is not measurable by immune-related Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (irRECIST)
      and to correlate location and patterns of metastatic disease with clinical outcomes.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive encorafenib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28, binimetinib PO twice
      daily (BID) on days 1-28, and nivolumab intravenously (IV) on day 1. Cycles repeat every 28
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 and 100 days, then every
      3 months thereafter.

             accidents, hemodynamically significant (i.e. massive or sub-massive) deep vein
             thrombosis or pulmonary emboli

               -  Note: Patients with either deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary emboli that does not
                  result in hemodynamic instability are allowed to enroll as long as they are on a
                  stable dose of anticoagulants for at least 4 weeks

               -  Note: Patients with thromboembolic events related to indwelling catheters or
                  other procedures may be enrolled

          -  Any other condition that would, in the investigator?s judgment, contraindicate the
             patient?s participation in the clinical study due to safety concerns or compliance
             with clinical study procedures

          -  Major surgery =&lt; 6 weeks prior to starting study drug or failure to recover from side
             effects of such procedure at the discretion of the treating investigator

          -  Pregnant or nursing (lactating) females, where pregnancy is defined as the state of a
             female after conception and until the termination of gestation, confirmed by a
             positive human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) laboratory test

          -  Prisoners or persons who are involuntarily incarcerated

          -  Medical, psychiatric, cognitive or other conditions that may compromise the patient's
             ability to understand the patient information, give informed consent, comply with the
             study protocol or complete the study
