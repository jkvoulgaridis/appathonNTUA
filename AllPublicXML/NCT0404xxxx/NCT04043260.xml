  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A multi center, open label, prospective study that will include up to 100 subjects with Type
      1 Diabetes treated with Multiple Daily Injections (MDI) of insulin according to a predefined
      sliding scale plan or carbohydrate ratio (CR) and correction factor (CF) plan, and
      Self-Monitoring of Blood Glucose (SMBG) or Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM).

      The study will include screening, a 3-4 weeks run-in period and a 6 weeks intervention
      period. Subjects will be asked to record their insulin delivery during basal/bolus insulin
      treatment (using dedicated apps and/or connected pens) and their daily activities (meals,
      physical activity etc.) using electronic log (implemented on Dedicated Apps), for a total
      period of 9-10 weeks.

    <description>Subject's glucose and insulin data will be transferred to the DreaMed Advisor Pro system. Optimization of insulin treatment plan will be done using the DreaMed Advisor Pro algorithm. After approval by the study physician (may override the suggestions for safety reasons), the treatment plan will be sent to the subject to be followed for the following 3 weeks. The study team will follow-up with a phone call to the subject to verify the subject received the updated treatment plan.</description>

    <description>The DreaMed Advisor Pro software is a proprietary algorithm, designed to provide a comprehensive analysis of individual diabetes data which consists of glucose levels and insulin delivery history. the Advisor Pro algorithm identifies glucose patterns and their possible causes, which may hamper the patient's glucose control, and recommend on adjustment to the patient‐specific insulin treatment profiles as well as suggestions for personalized diabetes management tips (such as timing of meal boluses, bolus delivery compliance and personalized glucose targets).</description>
