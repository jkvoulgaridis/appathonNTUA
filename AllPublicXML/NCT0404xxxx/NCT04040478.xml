    <textblock>
      The study will investigate if non-invasive continuous transcutaneous blood gas monitoring can
      detect tissue perfusion and hypoxemia and the relation to other circulatory parameters such
      as pulse, blood pressure, cardiac output and arterial saturation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Macro circulatory parameters such as cardiac output, mean arterial pressure and arterial
      oxygen saturation are used to monitor the hemodynamic function and tissue perfusion in
      surgical patients. Though none of the methods are directly monitoring changes in the
      metabolism of the tissue. Arterial blood gas analysis is used as the golden standard for the
      detection of metabolic disturbances before, during and after surgery. Disadvantages of the
      method are 1) the fact that the technique is invasive to the patient, 2) that the method
      measures the &quot;total gas&quot; (each tissue's contribution to the blood gas in the total
      circulating blood) and 3) that the methods only provide a snapshot of the patient's blood gas
      status. Transcutaneous monitoring can be used as a continuous monitoring of the underlying
      tissue's carbon dioxide and oxygen levels in patients. The method is already used in neonates
      as a surrogate for the arterial blood gas analysis. Reduced tissue oxygenation due to
      inadequate perfusion, will initiate an anaerobic tissue metabolism resulting in low oxygen
      levels and high carbon dioxide levels. The transcutaneous monitoring can therefore
      potentially be used to detect tissue hypoxia and become a direct measurement of the
      underlying tissue metabolism.

Abdominal patients are monitored for 4 hours during surgery and for 2 hours in the Post-Anesthesia Care Unit. Arterial blood gasses are drawn from the arterial line 4 times during surgery and 4 times after surgery.
Patients undergoing vascular surgery are monitored for up to 4 hours during surgery.</description>
