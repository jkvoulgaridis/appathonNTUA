  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nova Scotia has among the lowest breastfeeding rates in Canada, with less than one quarter of
      infants receiving Health Canada's recommended 6 months of exclusive breastfeeding. Compared
      with feeding formula, breastfeeding has been linked with a number of health advantages,
      including fewer infections, higher IQ, and a lowered risk of obesity later in life.

      How infants consume human milk is changing. Pumping milk has grown in popularity in recent
      years because some mothers may feel stigmatized breastfeeding, especially in public, but also
      because it allows other caregivers to help with feeding. Although pumped human milk is
      considered equal to breastfeeding, there is very little research in this area, especially
      around responsive feeding and later health outcomes. Since pumped milk is fed from a bottle,
      the health benefits may be lost (for instance, this may impact a baby's ability to understand
      if s/he is hungry or full).

      The primary aim of this study is to determine if the volume of human milk an infant consumes
      differs if they consume milk from a bottle versus the breast. The investigators will conduct
      a cross-over trial in which 62 mother-infant pairs will be randomized to feed at the breast
      or from a bottle for 24 hours, have a 24 hour wash-out period, and then 'cross-over' to
      another 24 hour session with the opposite 'treatment.' The volume of milk consumed at each
      feed within the 24 hour window (via indirect weighing, or weighing the baby before and after
      eating) will be recorded to determine if there are differences in milk consumption.
      Mother-infant pairs will complete this 3-day study three times, at 6 weeks, 4 months, and 6
      months.

      Information from this study will help to better understand current infant feeding practices
      in Nova Scotia, and the potential role this plays in future health outcomes. Evidence from
      this study may help to identify means of improving feeding practices and promoting human milk
      as the main food for Nova Scotian infants, setting them on a path for the best start in life.

    <intervention_model_description>This is a modified, randomized cross-over study. The 'intervention' in this study is simply feeding infants using one of two modalities that are already familiar to the mother and infant: feeding mother's milk from the breast and from a bottle.
At each timepoint (6 weeks, 4 months, 6 months) infants will: be randomized using a balanced design (to control for order effect) to consume human milk from a bottle or from the breast for 24 hours; will then undergo a wash-out period in which they will be fed human milk as they usually would for 24 hours; then will complete the second 'treatment' (bottle or breast) for 24 hours. Due to the nature of the intervention, this study will not be blinded.
We aim to recruit 62 mother-infant pairs (= 124 participants in total).</intervention_model_description>
