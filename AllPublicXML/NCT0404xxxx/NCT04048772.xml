  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators have designed a psychoeducational group curriculum specifically for new in
      vitro fertilization (IVF) patients (both male and female) to improve their treatment
      knowledge, to allow them to engage more in their care, to offer a support network, to improve
      satisfaction, and to provide them with tools to help reduce their stress and anxiety while
      undergoing the IVF process. The investigators plan to have four to eight infertility patients
      and their partners participate in a group at a time, for which they will attend three 1-1.5
      hour interactive sessions that are scheduled throughout their first IVF cycle. These sessions
      will provide additional time for discussion about treatment with providers, learning
      opportunities on topics of interest to fertility patients, and stress reduction techniques.
      They will do several surveys before and after the intervention for comparison, including
      assessment of quality of life, depression, anxiety, resilience, and a knowledge assessment.
      The investigators will also track the patients to see if they pursue additional treatment in
      the instance of a negative pregnancy test compared to patients undergoing the standard
      treatment. The investigators plan to recruit a control group that receives the standard of
      care treatment here at the University of Iowa.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients and their partners will be randomized in a 2:1 fashion to two different treatment
      arms: A) standard of care in vitro fertilization (IVF) at the investigational institution as
      well as participating in an additional psychoeducational group or B) standard of care IVF at
      the investigational institution. The intervention group will consist of three additional
      evening visits for 1-1.5 hours per session. The sessions will include an interactive
      educational component addressing usual questions and concerns of IVF patients, such as
      reviewing common IVF myths, and also more information regarding treatment and technologies.
      Each session will also include teaching of coping strategies (such as awaiting the pregnancy
      test, how to cope with insensitive remarks from friends and family) as well as relaxation
      exercises, such as progressive muscle relaxation and deep breathing.

      The patients will be consented at their new IVF visit and will take their initial assessments
      (FertiQoL, GAD-7, PHQ-9, the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale, and a knowledge assessment)
      within 24 hours of the new visit. The patients will be assigned into groups based on when
      they are going through their IVF stimulations, so they will have similar experiences at
      similar times. Patients will take their final assessments on the third day after egg
      retrieval, regardless of group assignment.
