  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this clinical study is to evaluate the safety of an intraarticular injection
      of an investigational biologic product (IBP), PSC-01, the patient's own adipose-derived
      stromal vascular fraction cells (SVF) extracted from a lipoaspirate sample, to treat the pain
      of osteoarthritis in a single knee. The secondary objective is to get initial data on
      efficacy of the PSC-01.

    <description>The primary outcome measure of this study is to evaluate the safety of the investigational biological product, PSC-01.Safety will be assessed as the number of treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v5.0. Adverse events will be assessed by physical examination, patient-reported health status, clinical pathology evaluations (cbc, chemistry, and urinalysis), and post-procedure clinical observations through the 84-day study period with post-treatment follow-up at 6 and 12 months.</description>

    <time_frame>3-4 months</time_frame>
    <description>The secondary outcome measure of this study is to obtain initial data on the efficacy of PSC-01 on treating knee osteoarthritis. The efficacy primary outcome will be assessed using the KOOS knee survey with the five relevant subcategories of pain, symptoms, average daily living, sport/recreation, and quality of life measured at baseline, day 42 and day 84.</description>
