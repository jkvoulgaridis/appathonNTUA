  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall purpose of the proposed pilot study is to establish the feasibility of conducting
      a clinical trial by evaluating the preliminary effects of 8 weeks of knee bracing on
      physiological measures of self-reported pain and disability, physical performance, physical
      activity, as well as femoral cartilage deformation in individuals with medial compartment
      knee osteoarthritis (OA). The investigators will recruit 36 symptomatic knee OA patients for
      the pilot study. The investigators will evaluate a class of braces (two different models will
      be used) designed to correct genu varum. The purpose of the study is to evaluate changes in
      these novel outcomes following the use of a class of braces used to reduce medial
      tibiofemoral compartment compression used for 8 weeks. This pilot study will inform a larger
      future trial to determine the efficacy of bracing on decreasing disability and disease
      progression in patients with knee osteoarthritis.

    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 8 (Followup)</time_frame>
    <description>The Western Ontario and McMasters Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) is a self-reported measure of disability. The physical function consists of 17 items and asks about the magnitude of difficulty when ascending and descending stairs, rising from sitting, standing, bending, walking, getting in/out of a car, shopping, putting on and taking off socks, rising from bed, lying in bed, getting in and out of the bath, sitting, getting on and off the toilet, completing heavy household duties, and completing light household duties. Each item is presented in a 5 point Likert-type format and uses the following descriptors for possible answer choices none, mild moderate, severe, and extreme. Each descriptor corresponds to an ordinal scale of 0-4. The scores are summed for the items in each subscale, with a total possible range from 0-68. Higher scores indicate greater amounts of functional limitations.</description>

    <measure>Percentage Change in Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly from Baseline to 8 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 8 (Followup)</time_frame>
    <description>Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly (PASE) scores are calculated from weights and frequency values for each of 12 types of activity. Responses to the first question about sitting activities are not scored. The scale is continuous with higher scores indicating greater physical activity</description>

    <measure>Percentage Change in 30-s chair-stand test from Baseline to 8 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 8 (Followup)</time_frame>

    <measure>Percentage Change in 20 meter fast-paced walk test from Baseline to 8 weeks</measure>

    <measure>Percentage Change in Stair-climb test from Baseline to 8 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 8 (Followup)</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will time the amount of seconds it takes to walk up and down a flight of stairs.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage Change in Femoral Cartilage Cross-sectional area from Baseline to 8 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 8 (Followup)</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will measure the amount of cartilage cross-sectional area on the anterior femur before and after 3000 steps of walking. A greater change in cross-sectional area is determined to be more more cartilage deformation.</description>
