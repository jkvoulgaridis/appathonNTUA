  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that the Systolic Foot-to-Apex Time Interval (SFATI) method
      will be accurate for measurement of systolic blood pressure with marked arterial stiffness as
      seen in patients with severe renal impairment. Also that the presence of arterial
      calcifications only changes the agreement between the SFATI method and the reference method
      (auscultatory method) if the calcifications are very severe.

        The study population consists of patients with severe renal impairment (defined by a
        glomerular filtration rate &lt;30 mL / min, assessment within previous 3 months), stage 4 or
        stage 5.

        Patients will be selected during consultations in the Nephrology department or during
        dialysis sessions at the University Hospital of Nîmes.
