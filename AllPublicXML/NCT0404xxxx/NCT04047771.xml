  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the safety and tolerability of SCB-313 in patients with peritoneal
      carcinomatosisa, to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or extended study
      recommended dose (RDE) for SCB-313 intraperitoneal injection, providing a basis for dosing
      regimen and dose choosing in clinical trial subsequently.
