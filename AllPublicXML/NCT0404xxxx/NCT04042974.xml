    <textblock>
      To compare the effectiveness of vaginal dinoprostone with placebo in minimizing the pain
      experienced by primarily infertile patients during diagnostic ofﬁce hysteroscopy and to
      assess the ease of insertion of hysteroscope as reported by the hysteroscopist.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      hysteroscopy is commonly used in the diagnosis and treatment of intrauterine lesions such as
      polyps, ﬁbroids, septa, and adhesions, and in the presence of abnormal bleeding and during
      the removal of an intrauterine device or foreign body. Cervical ripening is made possible by
      the use of medication through different routes. The most commonly used agent is misoprostol,
      a synthetic prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) analog that is frequently administered in off-label use
      in obstetrics and gynecology for medical abortion, labor induction, endometrial biopsy,
      dilatation and curettage, intrauterine device insertion, myomectomy, postpartum haemorrhage,
      and cervical ripening. In contrast, dinoprostone, a natural PGE2, is mostly used in
      obstetrics for cervical ripening and the stimulation of uterine contractions to induce labor.
