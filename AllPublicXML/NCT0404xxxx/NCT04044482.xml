    <description>The translated questionnaire was tested among affected patients. First of all the face and content validity were evaluated, namely how understandable is the translated questionnaire for patients with Hungarian native language. How many percent of the items were no answered. According to the shared guideline if more then 5 % of an item is not answered should be selected from the final version of the questionnaire - with the exception of the items based on sexual life(3 items). The research team noticed that face and content validity were adequate.</description>
