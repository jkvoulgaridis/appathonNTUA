  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Phonak Hearing Devices pass through different development and study phases. At an early
      stage, feasibiltiy studies are conducted to investigate new algorithms, features and
      functions in an isolated manner. If the benefit is proven, their performance is then
      investigated regarding interpendency between all available algorithms, features and functions
      running in parallel in a hearing aid (pivotal/pre-validation studies) and, resulting from the
      pre-validation studies, they get optimized. Prior to product launch, the Phonak Hearing
      Systems get reviewed by a final quality control in terms of clinical trials. This is a
      pre-validation study, investigating improved algorithms, features, functions and wearing
      comfort. This will be a clinical investigation which will be conducted mono centric at Sonova
      AG Headquarters based in St채fa (Switzerland).

      This study will prove the overall performance and system context of the functionality in the
      mobile application in combination with hearing devices under real life conditions with
      experienced hearing aid users. The enduser should be able to adjust their hearing aid
      settings by App.

      The app allows the user to change e.g. the loudness of the hearing aids and to create hearing
      scenarios by themselves. The users also shall be able to accept a conferecene call, which
      they will receive from the investigator via App.

      This will be a clinical investigation which will be conducted mono centric at Sonova AG
      Headquarters based in St채fa (Switzerland).
