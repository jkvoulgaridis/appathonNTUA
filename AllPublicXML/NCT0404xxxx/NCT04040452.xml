  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study will be a prospective, randomized, double blind, placebo controlled trial
      to compare the use of a continuous infusion versus intermittent ketorolac on postoperative
      patients in the pediatric cardiovascular ICU. We intend to determine if the continuous
      infusion leads to a decreased utilization of opiates when compared to intermittent ketorolac.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The mainstay of postoperative pain control in the CVICU remains opiate-based therapy.
      Reliance on this class of medications can be detrimental, contributing to complications
      including hemodynamic instability, dependency, and withdrawal which can ultimately lead to
      longer hospital admissions, as well as long term and persistent neurodevelopmental effects.
      In addition, the opioid crisis has driven practitioners to aim for methods to reduce opioid
      exposure and post-operative narcotic prescriptions in pediatric and adult patients alike.
      There is a growing body of evidence in the adult literature showing promising results with
      the use of a continuous infusion of ketorolac in postoperative patients, including in a
      pediatric population. What the current literature has failed to show is whether a continuous
      infusion of ketorolac post operatively decreases the use of opiate mediations in a pediatric
      population compared to intermittent bolus injections, which is the current standard of care.
      Given the sensitivity and fragility inherent in those patients with CHD, working to reduce
      deleterious effects from excessive and prolonged opiate exposure is imperative. This study
      aims to examine whether the use of a continuous infusion of ketorolac can reduce the amount
      of opiates needed to treat postoperative pain control in the pediatric CVICU population, in
      comparison to patients who receive intermittent ketorolac within the first 96 hours
      post-operatively.

    <description>Description: Patients randomized for the treatment arm of the study group will receive a continuous infusion of ketorolac plus an intermittent dose of placebo (plasmalyte). To eliminate excess exposure and the associated side effects, all patients enrolled in the study will not be given any additional NSAIDs (except aspirin, which is standard of care in many post-operative cardiac surgery patients) during the study period.
Dosage and Route of Administration:
Continuous ketorolac 0.08mg/kg/hr, with a maximum of 5mg/hr for patients weighing greater than or equal to 60kg, administered intravenously by nursing staff. Study drug will infuse continuously for 48 hours.
Intermittent Plasmalyte 0.033mL/kg (max 2mL) infusion every 6 hours for 48 hours.</description>

    <description>Description: Patients randomized to the standard of care arm of the study will receive a generically marked syringe of Plasmalyte to be infused at the same rate as the treatment medication, and will only receive intermittent dosing of ketorolac (current standard of care). As in the treatment group, no additional NSAIDs (except aspirin) are to be given during the 48 hour study period.
Dosage and Route of Administration
Continuous Plasmalyte infusion to match the aforementioned ketorolac dosing
Intermittent ketorolac 0.5mg/kg IV infusion every 6 hours (max 30mg per dose)</description>
