    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of a mindfulness meditation mobile
      application on sleep in individuals reporting sleep disturbances.

      The investigator's guiding hypothesis is that the combined elements of a consumer-based
      mobile meditation app, Calm (e.g., daily mindfulness meditation, sleep stories and behavioral
      components), will be feasible, accepted and associated with sustained improvement in sleep
      among individuals who self-identify as having sleep disturbances. Calm provides daily,
      10-minute, guided meditations grounded in mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) and
      Vipassana meditation. Uniquely, Calm also offers &quot;Sleep Stories&quot;, developed using techniques
      from Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and Relaxation Technique.

      This is a randomized control feasibility study with an intervention and waitlist control.

      Aim 1: Examine the feasibility of using a consumer-based mindful meditation app for &gt;10
      mins/day over eight weeks for 100 adults who self-identify as sleep disturbed.

      Aim 2: Explore the preliminary effects of Calm on sleep disturbance and emotional symptoms
      associated with sleep disturbance (i.e. stress, anxiety, depressive symptoms) as compared to
      those in a wait-list control group.

      Recruitment: Participants will be recruited nationally via Internet-based strategies
      including social media (e.g. Facebook, Twitter, Instagram), social networking sites and email
      listservs. Recruitment flyers will be posted on social media websites. ResearchMatch.org will
      be also be utilized as a recruitment tool for this protocol.

      Eligibility: Inclusion criteria are: (1) self-identify as sleep disturbed (i.e., score &gt;10 on
      the Insomnia Severity Index), (2) &gt;18 years of age, (3) English speaking, (4) willing to
      download the Calm app to their smartphone, and (5) have not practiced meditation more than 60
      minutes a month in the past six months (6) willing to be randomized. Participants will report
      use of medication for sleep at baseline, mid-intervention and post-intervention and not
      excluded for medication.

      Enrollment: Interested participants will complete a brief (5-10 minute) eligibility screener
      via Qualtrics. Participants will not be made know of sponsor name before randomization
      assignment to avoid disclosing the app that they will be using. Eligible participants will be
      asked to sign an electronic informed consent prior to the start of the intervention. After
      informed consents have been completed, participants (N=100) will be identified. Once eligible
      participants have been identified, they will be emailed instructions. Ineligible participants
      will be notified by email.

      Tracking: Intervention participants (n=50) usage will be continuously tracked throughout the
      intervention by Calm.

      Post-intervention: Post-intervention questionnaire will be emailed to intervention and
      control participants via a link from Qualtrics. All participants will have access to Calm
      after the 8-week study period, but will not be asked to meditate.

    <measure>Preliminary effects of the mindfulness meditation app on sleep disturbance, as assessed by changes in participants' pre- and post-intervention scores on the Cognitive and Somatic Arousal subscales of the Pre-Sleep Arousal Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>The Pre-Sleep Arousal Scale will be completed at immediately before (i.e., baseline) and immediately after the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The Pre-Sleep Arousal Scale is a 16-item self-report questionnaire that measures arousal before sleep. Items describe symptoms of cognitive and somatic arousal. Using a five-point scale (1, not at all; 2, slightly: 3, moderately; 4, a lot; 5, extremely), participants rate extent to which they generally experience each symptom as they attempt to fall asleep. The Pre-Sleep Arousal Scale is comprised of two eight-item subscales, which assess Cognitive Somatic arousal. Subscale scores are determined by summing ratings from the included items. Possible scores on each subscale range from 8 to 40, with higher scores indicating greater pre-sleep arousal.</description>

    <measure>Preliminary effects of the mindfulness meditation app on sleep fatigue, as assessed by changes in participants' pre- and post-intervention scores on the Fatigue Severity Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>The Fatigue Severity Scale will be completed at immediately before (i.e., baseline) and immediately after the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The Fatigue Severity Scale is a nine-item self-report measure of fatigue and the extent to which fatigue interferes with daily living. Respondents rate the extent to which they agree with statements about their experience with fatigue during the past week. Items are scored on a seven-point scale ranging from 1 to 7 (1=strongly disagree, 7=strongly agree). Total scores range from 1 to 7, reflecting the mean rating of the items. Higher scores indicate greater fatigue.</description>

    <time_frame>The Epworth Sleepiness Scale will be completed at immediately before (i.e., baseline) and immediately after the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The Epworth Sleepiness Scale is an eight-item measure of daytime sleepiness. Respondents use a four-point scale to rate the likeliness that they would doze off or fall asleep in eight situations involving activities with low levels of stimulation, relative immobility, and relaxation, based on their usual way of life in recent times. Item ratings range from 0 to 3 (0=would never doze, 3=high chance of dozing). Items are summed to calculate a total score, ranging from 0 to 24, with higher scores indicating greater sleepiness.</description>
