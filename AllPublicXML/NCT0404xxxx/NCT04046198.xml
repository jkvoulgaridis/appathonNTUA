      Objective: This study was conducted to determine the effect of the Professional Values
      Training Program developed in line with Professional Values Model on the perception of
      professional values and job satisfaction of pediatric nurses.

      Method: The study is non-randomized experimental study that measures with pre-test and
      post-test which includes intervention and control groups. This study was conducted between
      December 2018 and May 2019. The sample of the study consisted of 40 intervention and 40
      control group pediatric nurses. The intervention group group was involved in 12-week-training
      program which based on the Professional Values Model. Data were collected by using the
      Individual Identification Form, the Nurses' Professional Values Scale (NPVS-R) and the
      Healthcare Environment Survey (HES).

      This study was conducted in non-randomized experimental design with pretest and posttest
      including intervention and control groups to determine the effect of the Professional Values
      Educational Program developed in accordance with Professional Values Model to test a
      theoretical model on professional value perception, job satisfaction levels and parental care
      satisfaction of pediatric nurses.

      Pediatric nursing is a field that takes children and families at central point of care and is
      responsible for providing health care from the neonatal period to the end of adolescence.
      Pediatric nurses' awareness of professional values is an important issue that should be
      addressed for development of nursing practices, quality nursing care, professional identity
      acquisition, high job satisfaction and minimization of leave of employment. In the studies,
      it is reported that the development of professional values is an important factor that
      increases the satisfaction of individuals receiving care and the job satisfaction of nurses.

      Ethics committee approval and written permission were obtained from the hospitals before the
      study was conducted. Written consent was obtained from all participating nursesIn the study.
      Personal Information Form, Nursing Professional Values Scale (NPVS-R) and Healthcare
      Environment Survey (HES) were used as data collection tools. These data collection tools were
      used in the pre-test and post-test.

      Nurses working at Akdeniz University Hospital became the intervention group. The nurses who
      accepted to participate in the study were divided into groups of 5-15 people. Pre-test was
      applied to nurses who accepted the research. Nurses were given four group trainings. A
      booklet on the subject prepared by the researchers was given. Three interim interviews were
      conducted in the subsequent 12-week. Six separate posters were posted in the clinics. Weekly
      reminder messages were sent via WhatsApp. At the end of the third month, post-test data were
      collected from the nurses.

      The nurses working in the University of Health Sciences Antalya Training and Research
      Hospital constituted the control group. Pre-test was applied to nurses who accepted the
      research. Post test applied 3 months later. A booklet on the subject prepared by the
      researchers was given after the post test. Group training was conducted to nurses.

      The post test data was collected in May 2019.

    <description>The Nurses' Professional Values Scale was developed by Weis &amp; Schank in 2000. Validity and reliability Geçkil et al. (2012) did in Turkey. The scale has a total of 26 items. Each item is scored from 1 to 5. The lowest score that can be obtained from the total scale is 26 and the highest score is 130. The higher the total score, the more important the professional values of nurses. The pre-test and post-test data of the intervention group and control group will be analyzed. The 3-months education program was applied only to the intervention group. Therefore, there is no success criteria in the control group. The statistically significant increase in the mean score of professional values in posttest measurement in the intervention group is the success criterion of the study. Significance level is set at p&lt;0.05 in analyzes.</description>

    <measure>Healthcare Environment Survey (HES)</measure>
    <time_frame>Three months</time_frame>
    <description>The Health Environment Survey was developed in 2001 to assess the job satisfaction of nurses. It was revised in 2015 (Nelson et al., 2015). Gözüm, Nelson, Yıldırım &amp; Kavla, (2017) adapted the scale into the Turkish culture and found the scale as valid and reliable. The scale has a total of 61 items. Each item is scored from 1 to 7. By adding the points and dividing them by the number of items, the scale score averages are obtained. Neutral point average of 3.5. The higher the average score, the higher the job satisfaction. The survey measures 11 dimensions of nurse job satisfaction. At the end of the 3-months education program, it was expected that job satisfaction scores would increase significantly in the intervention group. The statistically significant increase in the mean score of job satisfaction in posttest measurement in the intervention group is the success criterion of the study. Significance level is set at p&lt;0.05 in analyzes.</description>
