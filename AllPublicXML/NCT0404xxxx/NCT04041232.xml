  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Some patients with achromatopsia, an inherited disorder characterized by partial or complete
      loss of color vision, carry mutations in ATF6. ATF6 is a gene that is responsible for coding
      a protein that acts in response to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. When the ATF6 protein
      is mutated, retinal function decreases, contributing to color blindness. The study aims to
      investigate whether an already FDA-approved drug, glycerol phenylbutyrate (PBA), can improve
      retinal function inpatients with achromatopsia caused by ATF6 mutations. Patients will be
      instructed to take three doses of PBA per day at equally divided time intervals and rounded
      up to the nearest 0.5 mL. The total dose of PBA will be 4.5 to 11.2 mL/m2/day (5 to 12.4
      g/m2/day) and will not exceed 17.5 mL/day (19 g/day). Their condition will be monitored over
      the course of a minimum of 3 clinic visits that will consist of a number of retinal function
      tests, fundus examinations, and imaging procedures. Findings from the study could elucidate
      the potential for PBA to serve as a treatment for patients with ATF6-mediated a chromatopsia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ATF6 has been described as an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-regulated transmembrane
      protein that activates the transcription of molecular chaperones in response to ER stress.
      Patients harboring mutations in ATF6 present with decreased retinal function and are
      diagnosed with achromatopsia. The investigator's research group has previously demonstrated
      that administration of glycerol phenylbutyrate (PBA), a fatty acid compound that facilitates
      protein folding, can lead to enhanced retinal function in mice that are homozygous for the
      ATF6 mutation. This study will investigate the effects of PBA administration in two patients
      who carry ATF6-/- mutations and a diagnosis of achromatopsia. Enrolled subjects will undergo
      a minimum of 3 clinic visits that consist of a complete ophthalmic examination
      (best-corrected visual acuity, intraocular pressure, anterior segment examination, slit lamp
      and binocular fundus examination), a visual functioning questionnaire, color vision tests,
      contrast sensitivity tests, retinal imaging (optical coherence tomography, short wavelength
      autofluorescence and near-infrared autofluorescence), a macular sensitivity test (Nidek
      microperimetry) and full-field electroretinogram (ffERG). A blood draw will be performed at
      each visit to test for any indications of adverse effects from drug use. Subjects will be
      instructed to take 3 doses of PBA per day, totaling to a dose of 4.5 to 11.2 mL/m2/day (5 to
      12.4 g/m2/day).

    <description>Patients will be monitored at the baseline visit, followed by a second and third visit that will be 1 and 3 months after the initial visit. Patients will complete a standard visual functioning questionnaire and undergo a complete ophthalmic evaluation at each visit. Other visual assessments will consist of color vision testing, contrast sensitivity, retinal imaging, and macular sensitivity testing using microperimetry. Full-field electroretinogram will also be performed at the baseline visit and after 1 and 3 months of PBA use. If improvement in retinal function is observed, an additional ophthalmic evaluation will be conducted after 6 months of PBA use. A blood draw will be performed at each visit to test for any indications of adverse effects from drug use.</description>

    <description>Glycerol phenylbutyrate (PBA) is a triglyceride that consists of three molecules of phenylbutrate linked to a glycerol backbone. It is a nitrogen-binding agent that has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of urea cycle disorders. Oral supplementation of PBA demonstrated no severe side effects, and are found to be therapeutically effective in reducing ER stress. Patients will be instructed to take three doses of PBA per day at equally divided time intervals and rounded up to the nearest 0.5 mL. The total dose of PBA will be 4.5 to 11.2 mL/m2/day (5 to 12.4 g/m2/day) and will not exceed 17.5 mL/day (19 g/day).</description>
