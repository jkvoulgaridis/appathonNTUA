  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevention of catheter-related complications is nowadays an important topic of research.
      Flushing the catheters is considered an important clinical procedure in preventing
      malfunction and several complications such as phlebitis or infection. Considering the latest
      guidelines of the Infusion Nurses Society, the flushing involves a pre and post-drug
      administration, requiring different syringes (with associated overall increased times of
      preparation/administration of intravenous medication by nurses, also increasing the need for
      manipulation of the venous catheter).

      A multi-centre, two-arm randomised controlled trial with partially blinded outcome
      assessment, of 146 adult patients. After eligibility analysis and informed consent,
      participants will receive usual intravenous administration of drugs with subsequent flushing
      procedures, with the double-chamber syringe (arm A) or with the classical syringes (arm B).
      The outcomes assessment will be performed on a daily basis by the unblind research team, with
      the same procedures in both groups. Some main outcomes, such as phlebitis and infiltration,
      will also be evaluated by nurses from a blind research team and registered once a day.

    <intervention_model_description>A multi-centre, two-arm randomised controlled trial with partially blinded outcome assessment, of 146 adult patients. After eligibility analysis and informed consent, participants will receive usual intravenous administration of drugs with subsequent flushing procedures, with the double-chamber syringe (arm A) or with the classical syringes (arm B).

    <masking>None (Open Label)</masking>
    <masking_description>Patients and clinical staff will not be entirely blind after group allocation due to the nature of the interventions. Despite this, participants will not be directly informed of their group allocation in terms of usual care or intervention, and the nurses in the clinical staff will only be informed about the broad purposes of the research [41] - the study of a new double-chamber syringe for intravenous administration and flushing. In contrast, research nurses from the team outside the orthopaedic department will be blinded when rating some of the main outcomes such as phlebitis and infiltration.</masking_description>
  </study_design_info>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Catheter-related complications: phlebitis</measure>
    <time_frame>This outcome will be assessed during the patient's hospital stay (through study completion, an average of 9 months) and 48 hours to 72 hours after catheter removal.</time_frame>
    <description>Phlebitis (the irritation or inflammation to the vein wall, associated with warmth, tenderness, erythema or palpable cord) is the most frequent PIVC-related complication, which may have mechanical, chemical, or bacterial causes</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Catheter-related complications: infiltration</measure>
    <time_frame>This outcome will be assessed during the patient's hospital stay (through study completion, an average of 9 months).</time_frame>
    <description>Moreover, the extravasation or infiltration of fluids may be responsible for local oedema due to the pervasion of intravenous fluid into the interstitial compartment, causing inflammation of the tissue around the catheter site.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Catheter-related complications: occlusion</measure>
    <time_frame>This outcome will be assessed during the patient's hospital stay (through study completion, an average of 9 months).</time_frame>
    <description>Occlusion is defined as any circumstance in which the Peripheral Intravenous Catheter (PIVC) does not enable to flush the catheter or infuse fluids/medications and it is a clinical sign of catheter malfunctioning</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Other catheter-related removal causes not related with the primary outcomes</measure>
    <time_frame>This outcome will be assessed during the patient's hospital stay (through study completion, an average of 9 months) and in 48 hours to 72 hours after catheter removal.</time_frame>
    <description>The secondary outcomes involve other reasons for catheter removal (e.g. accidental dislodgment), maintenance time of the catheter, number of syringes and catheters used during the intravenous treatment, catheterization attempts, nurses' perception about risk and safety, as well as the satisfaction of the participant.</description>
