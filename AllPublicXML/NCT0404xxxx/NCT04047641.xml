    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the side effects and how well cladribine, idarubicin, cytarabine,
      and quizartinib work in treating patients with acute myeloid leukemia or high-risk
      myelodysplastic syndrome that is newly diagnosed, has come back (relapsed), or does not
      respond to treatment (refractory). Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cladribine,
      idarubicin, and cytarabine, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either
      by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading.
      Quizartinib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for
      cell growth. Giving quizartinib with cladribine, idarubicin, and cytarabine may help to
      control acute myeloid leukemia or high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the efficacy (defined as event-free survival) of quizartinib (AC220) in
      combination with cladribine, idarubicin and cytarabine (ara-C) induction chemotherapy in
      newly diagnosed or relapsed/refractory patients with high-risk acute myeloid leukemia (AML)
      and high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS).

      II. To determine the safety of the combination.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the overall survival and disease-free survival of patients treated with this
      combination.

      II. To investigate correlations of response to this combination with a 81-gene panel of gene
      mutations both in patients with and without FLT3 mutations.

      III. To identify individual treatment-resistant cell populations and their signaling state
      that may relate to clinical outcomes using CyTOF (cytometry by time of flight) and single
      cell sequencing.

      OUTLINE:

      INDUCTION: Patients receive idarubicin intravenously (IV) over 1 hours on days 1-3,
      cladribine IV over 1-2 hours on days 1-5, cytarabine IV over 3 hours on days 1-5 (or days 1-3
      for patients over age 60), and quizartinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 6-19.
      Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 2 cycles in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      CONSOLIDATION: Patients who achieve complete response (CR) or CR with incomplete platelet
      recovery (CRp) after Induction receive idarubicin IV over 1 hours on days 1-2, cladribine IV
      over 1-2 hours on days 1-3, cytarabine IV over 3 hours on days 1-3, and quizartinib PO QD on
      days 4-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 5 cycles in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      MAINTENANCE: Patients who achieve CR or CR with incomplete bone marrow recovery (CRi)/CR with
      partial hematologic recovery (CRh) after Consolidation receive quizartinib PO QD on days
      1-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 12 cycles in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6-12 months.
