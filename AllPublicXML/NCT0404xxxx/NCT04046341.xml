  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Investigators will enroll up to 20 participants from 3 Children's Hospital of Philadelphia
      (CHOP) primary care locations. The primary objective is to determine the whether the Sleep
      Well! behavioral sleep intervention is feasible to be implemented in primary care offices and
      acceptable to families. The direction and magnitude of change in child sleep from
      pre-intervention to post-intervention will also be examined.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Behavioral sleep problems such as insomnia and insufficient sleep are common in toddlers and
      preschoolers and disproportionately impact lower socioeconomic status (SES) children. Despite
      a robust evidence base, behavioral sleep interventions are rarely tested with lower-SES
      children or in primary care, an accessible service delivery setting. The primary objective of
      this study is to determine the whether the Sleep Well! behavioral sleep intervention is
      feasible and acceptable to families. We will also examine the direction and magnitude of
      change in child sleep from pre-intervention to post-intervention. This is a preliminary open
      trial of the Sleep Well! program with pre-intervention and post-intervention
      assessments.Caregiver-child dyads (child ages 1-5 years with a sleep problem) will be
      recruited from CHOP urban primary care sites.

      Sleep Well! is a brief, behavioral sleep intervention for toddlers and preschoolers who have
      a caregiver-reported sleep problem or who are not getting enough sleep. The intervention
      includes evidence-based behavioral sleep approaches and strategies to engage and empower
      families. The primary outcomes for this open trial are feasibility (number of caregivers
      recruited, engaged, and retained in intervention; participant intervention attendance rate)
      and caregiver acceptability, assessed via a questionnaire and qualitative post-intervention
      interview. Secondary outcomes are the direction and magnitude in any pre- to
      post-intervention change in child sleep.

The BCSQ is appropriate for children ages 1.5-5 years and has shown good reliability and moderate correspondence with actigraphic recordings of child-sleep. Caregivers will also have the option to have their child wear an actigraph to obtain objective estimates of sleep onset, sleep offset, and sleep duration.</description>

    <description>The intervention comprehensively addresses poor sleep health behaviors (e.g., use of electronics at bedtime; inconsistent and variable sleep schedules; lack of a bedtime routine) as well as insomnia (difficulty falling and staying asleep; the need for caregiver presence at bedtime) and insufficient sleep in toddlers and preschoolers. Interventionists will use strategies to engage with and empower families, such as motivational interviewing and collaborative problem-solving. Session content will be reinforced via phone calls from interventionists. Families will receive intervention session appointment reminders and information about intervention content (e.g., reminders to follow a bedtime routine) via text message.</description>
