  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study evaluating the value of defragmentation of sinus rhythmic low voltage areas
      in addition to isolation of pulmonary veins in the removal of recurrent atrial fibrillation.
      The invasive procedure will be performed according to the procedures chosen by the
      rhythmologist and will in no way be modified by the patient's enrollment in the study.
      Similarly, the frequency of consultations, date and nature of the additional examinations
      will be defined by the physician, with the purpose of monitoring the patient.

    <textblock>
      Radiofrequency ablation has become standard practice in the approach strategy for the
      symptomatic treatment of atrial fibrillation. The interest of substrate ablation, completing
      the isolation of the pulmonary veins is controversial. The usual technique for the ablation
      of recurrent atrial fibrillation is primarily a disconnection of the pulmonary veins, which
      can be accomplished by isolating the veins one by one or two by two. The isolation of the
      pulmonary veins is followed most often by a defragmentation of the atrium (ablation of the
      substrate). The defragmentation is guided by a map of fragmented potentials, made through a
      topography catheter, to locate the most abnormal areas that are the target of ablation. This
      strategy requires extensive ablation of the left atrium, with a long procedure time and
      repeated many radiofrequency shots. On the one hand there is a risk of complication related
      to the duration of intervention, but also in the longer term of occurrence of flutter scar.
      In addition to pulmonary vein isolation, the goal is to identify patients with sinus rhythm
      atrial arrhythmogenic substrate. Once the sinus rhythm has been restored by electrical
      cardioversion or spontaneously, a voltage map is carried out to identify the most abnormal
      (low voltage) areas, and intra-atrial fragmented potentials are identified, either
      spontaneously or spontaneously by the extra-stimulus method. Ablation of these abnormal areas
      may lead to better long-term results, limiting prolonged radiofrequency shots and
      complications associated with longer procedure times.

        The patients included in this protocol will be recruited by the centers that practice the
        procedure of ablation of persistent atrial fibrillation, by transcutaneous vein and
        trans-septal catheterization. Participation in this prospective observational study has
        been proposed to all centers practicing this procedure in France, regardless of the
        technique used. Inclusion in the study will be systematically offered to each patient who
        will benefit from this technique.
