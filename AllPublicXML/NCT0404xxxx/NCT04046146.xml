  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lymphatic transport will be examined using Near InfraRed Indocyanine Green fluorescence
      imaging (NIR-ICG) and magnetic resonance lymphography (MRL) of the upper extremities. The
      purpose of the study is to establish if NIR-ICG is a valid clinical outcome for quantifying
      lymphatic vessel drainage.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lymphedema from various etiologies (i.e. infection, cancer, surgery, and rheumatoid
      arthritis) remains a major health concern. Efforts to develop effective treatments for this
      condition have been limited by the absence of quantitative outcome measures for lymphatic
      function. Published articles have supported the fact that human lymphatic contractions can be
      readily visualized after intradermal administration of micrograms of Indocyanine Green using
      laser-induced fluorescence. We recently demonstrated the feasibility of NIR imaging to
      quantify lymphatic drainage in the hands, wrists and forearms of healthy volunteers following
      intradermal web space ICG injection into the hand . To establish this emerging technology as
      a valid clinical outcome measure, however, we must address two major questions that confound
      interpretation of the imaging results: 1) are the ICG filled vessels lymphatic vessels and/or
      small veins?; and 2) does NIR-ICG imaging following web space injection fully capture
      lymphatic flow from the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints that are most commonly involved in
      RA? To answer these questions, healthy patients will be recruited to have intradermal and
      intra-articular injections of ICG and gadolinium followed by an imaging sessions (NIR or
      magnetic resonance imaging) to measure lymphatic contraction rates and flow.

    <description>We may ask healthy subjects to return for up to four injection sessions for the study. The first injection session will consist of intradermal injection of ICG into the webspaces of the hand as done in our previous studies followed by NIR camera imaging. The second session will consist of intradermal gadolinium injection and intravenous (IV) iron contrast agent followed by MRI imaging approximately 1 week after the first session. The third session will occur at minimum eight weeks later and entail intra-articular ICG injection in order to evaluate drainage via the lymphatics. The MCP joints will be identified in the non-dominant hand and injected with ICG. Approximately one week later, the fourth session will compromise of intra-articular gadolinium injection and IV iron contrast to confirm lymphatic drainage. The MCP joints of the non-dominant hand will again be identified and injected with gadolinium.</description>
