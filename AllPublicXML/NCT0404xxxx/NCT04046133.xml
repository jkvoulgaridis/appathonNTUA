  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The CORINTH trial is for patients with more advanced (stage 3 and 4) anal cancer. The numbers
      of patients with anal cancer is increasing and only 65% patients with this later stage anal
      cancer have not had a recurrence 3 years after treatment. Anal cancer responds well to
      chemo-radiation (CRT) and this would be the treatment used for standard clinical care. The
      chemotherapy in CORINTH will be the same as standard of care (Mitomycin and 5FU or
      capecitabine) and the radiotherapy (RT) will be delivered using a technique where the dose
      intensity of RT can be modulated for different areas of the tumor (Intensity Modulated RT -
      IMRT). Translational samples (tissue blocks and blood) will be collected at baseline with
      further blood and tissue samples during and after treatment.

      Pembrolizumab, a relatively new drug, is a monoclonal antibody that enhances the body's
      immune response to cancer cells by acting on a receptor on the surface of T-cells called
      Programmed Death -1 (PD-1). The CORINTH study aims to see whether pembrolizumab, can be added
      safely to standard CRT. We will explore how safe the combination is and how well tolerated it
      is for patients with stage 3 and 4 anal cancer. If it is tolerable more patients will be
      treated to see if there is a similar or better clinical response.

      The trial is designed in 3 groups of patients. All patients will receive eight infusions of
      pembrolizumab at three weekly intervals. Each infusion lasts approximately 1 hour. The first
      group will not get pembrolizumab until they have already had 4 weeks of CRT (Day 29). As long
      as this is not found to cause too many extra side effects, the next group will have infusions
      at the beginning of the third week of CRT. The final group (cohort 3) will start their
      pembrolizumab with the first day of CRT i.e. Day 1.

      Initially each group will have 6 patients. Provided each group of patients finds the
      treatment tolerable and it is safe, more patients will be recruited into the group that
      receives the pembrolizumab earliest during their CRT. This will add further credence to the
      safety and tolerability of the combination and may provide a signal of how effective this
      treatment might be in improving outcomes for patients with more advanced anal cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CORINTH is a multi center trial with a single arm. Patients will be recruited into 3
      successive cohorts followed by an expansion of the final cohort. For each cohort the first
      dose of Pembrolizumab will be given at an earlier time point during the chemo-radiation
      (CRT).

      Pemrolizumab will be given as an IV infusion every 21 days, and a total of 8 infusions per
      patient at 200mg per infusion. The first dose of Pemrolizumab will be given at the following
      times:

      COHORT 1: beginning at Week 5 day 1 of CRT schedule COHORT 2: beginning at Week 3 day 1 of
      CRT schedule COHORT 3: beginning at Week 1 day 1 of CRT schedule** Cohort 2 will be dependent
      on a Safety Review Committee (SRC) recommendation. If the SRC are concerned about toxicity in
      Cohort 1 but not sufficiently to stop the study, they are able to recommend that Cohort 2 can
      change to commence pembrolizumab at week 4. If the SRC are concerned about toxicity in Cohort
      2 but not sufficiently to stop the study, they are able to recommend that Cohort 3 can change
      to commence pembrolizumab at week 2.

      Potential participants will be under the care of a consultant who specializes in the
      treatment of anal cancer and the patient will have been identified as requiring CRT treatment
      for their anal cancer. They will be assessed for eligibility before being consented and
      allocated to the current cohort. # Patients will be monitored for Adverse Events which will
      be assessed according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) 4.03.
      Treatment guidelines are given for any immune related or infusion related events. Adverse
      Event review will take place weekly during CRT and at every Pembrolizumab visit as well as
      key time during follow up.

      Patient reported outcomes will be assessed using the European Organisation for Research and
      Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) tool during CRT, pembrolizumab treatment and follow up. Patients
      will be followed up for 12 months.

             that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the subject's
             participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of
             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.

         15. Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with
             cooperation with the requirements of the trial.

             [qualitative] is detected).

         20. Has received a live vaccine within 30 days of planned start of study therapy. (Note:
             Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally inactivated flu vaccines and
             are allowed; however intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g., Flu-Mist®) are live
             attenuated vaccines, and are not allowed.)
