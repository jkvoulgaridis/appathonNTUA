  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and immunotherapeutic activity of
      cemiplimab in participants with hepatitis B virus (HBV) on suppressive antiviral therapy.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study consists of up to three cemiplimab dose cohorts (n=10 participants each). The
      cohorts will open sequentially, based on the safety of the previous cohort. Cohort 1 will
      open first to examine the lowest dose. When Cohort 1 participants have completed study week
      18 visit and there are no safety concerns, Cohort 2 will open for enrollment. A similar
      assessment will be conducted with Cohort 2 to make a decision on opening Cohort 3. In each
      cohort, participants enter the study 6 weeks prior to initiation of treatment. The 6-week
      lead-in period is followed by a 6-week treatment period where two infusions of cemiplimab are
      administered 6 weeks apart, at study weeks 6 and 12.

      The total study duration per participant is 90 weeks, including 78 weeks of follow-up after
      the treatment period. Study visit schedule includes visits at entry, and weeks 6, 7, 8, 10,
      12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 22, 24, 30, 36, 54, 72 and 90. Evaluations include: a medical and
      medication history; assessment of HBV antiviral therapy adherence; physical exam; blood,
      urine, and fecal collection; rectal swab; liver biopsy and fine needle aspiration; and
      optional leukapheresis.
