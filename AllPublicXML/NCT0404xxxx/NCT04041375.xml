  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with diabetes are often challenged by the routine of managing their diabetes, and
      may experience both stress and medical problems. Diabetes-related medical problems and stress
      often happen together and affect peoples' ability to live a full, happy and healthy life.
      Because of this, programs that help with medical problems and stress by teaching ways to
      better manage diabetes and stress may improve the lives of those with diabetes.

      Many excellent programs are available in the VA and in the community that help persons with
      diabetes better manage their medical problems and stress, but often times Veterans have
      trouble finding these programs.

      The purpose of the study is to see if a telephone-based coaching program improves the
      physical and emotional health of Veterans with diabetes more than use of a directory of
      community and VA resources and no coaching. The Veterans who receive the directory of
      community and VA resources will be given this at the beginning of the study and will access
      resources as they see fit. Those in the coaching program will be coached by a Veteran with
      knowledge of diabetes, mental health and community resources who will help them connect to
      care in the VA and/or community depending on their preference. Examples of resources
      available in the VA and community include mental health care and programs to help with diet,
      exercise and learning about how to better manage diabetes.

      Veterans who are interested in participating and pass screening will be enrolled in the study
      for about 6 months. Each enrolled Veteran will have a 50% chance of being enrolled in the
      coaching group and a 50% chance of being enrolled in the directory group (like the flip of a
      coin). Both groups will be asked to complete several questionnaires about their health and
      well-being by telephone. This will occur at the beginning of the study and three and six
      months later. The questionnaires will take about an hour to complete each time.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes-related distress, the negative emotional impact of living with diabetes (DM), is a
      powerful predictor of psychosocial functioning, treatment adherence, and glycemic control.
      Practice guidelines and consensus statements call for innovative approaches to address
      DM-related distress. Despite availability of self-management and psychosocial interventions
      to reduce DM related distress, these interventions are underutilized due to constraints in
      time, finances, motivation, and resource-awareness. Interventions that leverage traditional
      medical care and community-based health promotion programs (e.g., DM self-management
      education (DSME) programs) may enhance the ability of Veterans with DM to engage with a broad
      and accessible range of resources. Ensuring that Veterans with DM receive adequate self-care
      support requires interventions that (1) attend to both medical care and diabetes-related
      distress and (2) improve Veterans' access and engagement with DSME and traditional
      medical/mental care. Integrating VA and community health services and DSME resources is
      innovative and affords great opportunities to enhance Veteran outcomes and build VA community
      partnerships. Engagement of Veterans and community organizations in developing and delivering
      care responds to the 2016 HSR&amp;D high-priority domain of Health Care Systems Change and aligns
      with the 2017 VA Under Secretary's priorities of Greater Choice (offering community and VA
      resources), Efficiency (community and VA coordination), and Timeliness (telephone delivery).

      This community-VA partnership and three-month Veteran peer coaching intervention (iNSPiRED)
      aims to enhance psychological well-being and diabetes self-management behavior in Veterans
      with DM by facilitating access to and use of healthcare and health promotion resources. The
      intervention focuses on reducing cognitive and practical barriers to use of services by
      engaging Veteran peers as coaches and navigators, and by encouraging engagement in health
      promotion and healthcare services in the VA and the greater community. A secondary goal,
      integral to the main goal, is to strengthen and integrate VHA partnerships with
      community-based organizations and Veteran Support Organizations (VSO's).

      This is a single-blind, parallel group randomized trial of a 3-month peer navigation
      intervention for Veterans with DM and elevated levels of DM-related distress. The
      investigators will recruit Veterans with DM-related distress through existing help-seeking
      channels within and outside of the VA in partnership with community agencies, VSO's, and the
      Houston VAMC. Eligible Veterans will be assigned at random to the iNSPiRED intervention (peer
      navigation and coaching) versus usual care (written resource materials and encouragement to
      continue follow-up with healthcare providers). Consistent with the focus on the overall
      emotional impact of DM, the PRIMARY OUTCOME is DM-related distress (DM Distress Scale). In
      previous studies the DDS has shown strong relationships with psychological symptoms,
      self-management behaviors, and objective measures of glycemic control. SECONDARY OUTCOMES
      include anxiety symptoms (Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale), depression symptoms (Patient
      Health Questionnaire-8), DM self-management behaviors (DM Self-Management Scale), and
      self-reported use and new use of VA or community resources. In addition to participant-level
      outcomes, the investigators will also assess STAKEHOLDER OUTCOMES through a mixed methods
      process evaluation. The objective will be to measure the impact of stakeholder engagement
      activities on development and sustainability of VA-community partnerships, trust and
      communication, and capacity building. Assessment of primary and secondary endpoints will
      occur at baseline, post-intervention, and at 6 months.

      If this project meets intended goals, the investigators will partner with VHA Office of
      Community Engagement and VHA Specialty Care to implement the intervention for DM and other
      chronic diseases.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Diabetes Distress Screening Scale (DDS17)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The content of the DDS17 was developed with the input of people with DM and clinicians with expertise in DM. Items are grouped into 4 subscales: Emotional Burden (&quot;Feeling angry, scared and/or depressed when I think about living with diabetes&quot;), Physician-related Distress (&quot;Feeling that my doctor doesn't take my concerns seriously enough&quot;), Regimen-related Distress (&quot;Not feeling confident in my day-to-day ability to manage diabetes&quot;), and Interpersonal Distress (&quot;Feeling that friends or family don't give me the emotional support that I would like&quot;). Items are rated on a Likert scale indicating the extent to which each factor is distressing, from 1 (no problem) to 6 (a serious problem). The instrument is scored by computing the average value across items. Minimum score 17. Maximum score 102. Higher scores indicate worse distress.</description>
