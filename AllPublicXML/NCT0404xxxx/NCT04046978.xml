      MOSAIC is a single-blind experimental medicine study to determine the extent to which
      different prime-boost combinations of model immunogens based on HIV-1 envelope proteins
      influence the diversity of B and T cell responses.

      One of the most effective arms of the human immune system is the ability of very low
      concentrations of antibody proteins to bind to viruses, bacteria and toxins and &quot;neutralise&quot;
      their activity or ability to infect. In contrast to cellular immunity, which may cause tissue
      destruction and pathology, antibody-mediated immunity can be very passive, while completely
      preventing infection. How antibodies bind their targets varies enormously, ranging from
      unhelpful &quot;blocking&quot; antibodies or narrowly focussed neutralising antibodies, to highly
      protective &quot;broadly neutralising&quot; antibodies (bNAbs) that can neutralise a wide range of
      strains of the same pathogen. Such bNAbs are especially sought after in virus infections such
      as HIV, influenza and others where the virus mutates to evade immune responses that are too
      narrow or focussed. Antibodies arise when an &quot;immunogen&quot; (an immunogen is anything that
      induces an immune response, typically a foreign protein) is taken up by the immune system and
      shown to white blood cells - T and B cells - by specialised immune cells. In some cases the T
      and B cells bind the immunogens to receptors on their surface, triggering an immune response
      in which T cells &quot;help&quot; B cells to manufacture specific antibodies. The events around how the
      protein is processed into manageable pieces, shown to the T and B cells, and the pattern of
      chemical signals produced by the immune cells is highly complex, but eventually determines
      how broad the antibody response will be (its breadth). For infections like HIV and influenza,
      decades of research and clinical vaccine trials have had limited or no success. To take HIV
      as an example, we have an almost complete lack of understanding of how immunogens interact
      with the naive human B cell receptor (BCR) repertoire and the pathways required to induce
      bNAbs during an infection or after an immunisation. Animal models have failed as the na√Øve,
      germline encoded, B cell antibody receptor repertoires of non-human species are sufficiently
      different from those of humans to render design and selection of vaccine based on non-human
      species problematic. Additionally, bNAbs isolated from HIV-1-infected individuals have
      structural features that occur rarely or not at all in other mammals, such as unusually long
      loop-binding regions (CDRH3 loops) required to penetrate past glycans on the surface of the
      envelope spike that shield key neutralising epitopes (Mascola JR 2013). There is therefore a
      critical need to better understand, in human experimental medicine models of immune
      challenge, how immunogens and B/T cells interact in the development of protective bNAb
      anti-viral responses.

      Our approach to resolving this impasse is to challenge the human immune system with
      rationally-designed model immunogens to determine the structural and other characteristics
      required to drive human B cell antibody responses towards neutralisation breadth. We have
      selected HIV as an experimental model as there is a reasonable understanding about the
      specificity and function of anti-HIV bNAbs, as well as an urgent need to identify novel
      immunisation approaches following decades of failed or poorly successful trials. There is
      also a huge database of safety using HIV proteins as immunogens, and the technological
      expertise to design and manufacture HIV viral proteins. Assays for HIV neutralising activity
      are also well established in our laboratories. Although focussed on HIV, our findings will be
      applicable to other viral infections.

      The model immunogens we propose to use in these experimental medicine studies are unlikely to
      be suitable as vaccines, and any clinical development would require iterative cycles of
      design refinement and development based on immunological insights gleaned from these
      experimental investigations. Therefore, the focus is on in-depth characterisation of the
      elicited immune response to rationally-designed model immunogens that may inform the design
      process of actual vaccines. This experimental medicine approach is only now possible due to
      unprecedented progress in our abilities to study the human immune system and to obtain
      complete information on immune responses to vaccination, since performing research on the
      human immune system is now almost as easy as it has been in mice. The main focus of this
      study will be to determine which of the design strategies is able to prime human germline
      (naive) B cells and drive antibody responses towards induction of neutralising antibody
      breadth.

      Our range of model immunogens will be based on the envelope (Env) glycoprotein of HIV-1,
      which is the only target of neutralising antibodies, and therefore the only virally-encoded
      immunogen relevant for induction of such antibodies by immunisation. To ensure
      reproducibility of results and the highest level of volunteer safety, all immunogens will be
      manufactured under cGMP, using techniques applied to vaccine immunogens.

      Env has extensive amino acid variation, structural and conformational instability, and
      immunodominance of hypervariable regions (Kwong PD, 2011; Sattentau QJ, 2013). We will design
      soluble immunogens that closely mimic the native viral trimer in situ, but that incorporate
      design strategies that may alter the intrinsic viral immune evasion mechanisms (Sanders RW,
      2013). Env is made up of three identical complexes (trimers) each of which contains two
      molecules, gp120 and gp41 that can be modified to make a soluble molecule called gp140, upon
      which our immunogens are based. We have developed model consensus gp140 Env trimers
      (consensus of all global strains) designed to prime B cell responses to common epitopes
      represented in all HIV-1 subtypes. We have utilised two design strategies to stabilise these
      in a native-like conformation: ConM SOSIP and ConS UFO. The ConM SOSIP trimer includes novel
      mutations that include the incorporation of a disulphide linkage between the gp120 and gp41
      ectodomain (making up gp140) which prevents their disassociation into monomer subunits.

      The ConS UFO includes a short flexible amino-acid linker to tether the gp120 and gp41
      subunits together as an alternative strategy to prevent dissociation of the Env trimer. We
      wish to test both designs to determine the effect on B cell repertoire.

      A critical adjunct to our consensus-based model design is to use a cocktail of three mosaic
      gp140 Env trimers designed to overcome the immunodominance of hypervariable regions of Env
      and to determine whether they will focus antibody responses towards conserved neutralisation
      epitopes. While designed using computer algorithms, these mosaics represent authentic Env
      structures that are fully functional and native in their conformation. Our novel designs aim
      to eliminate unwanted immunodominant antibody responses and focus B cells towards highly
      conserved supersites of vulnerability on Env, with particular emphasis on quaternary bNAb
      epitopes (Julien, JP, 2013; Kong L, 2013; Lyumkis D, 2013). Like the ConM SOSIP and ConS UFO
      trimers described above, the mosaic trimers have disulphide linkage which prevents
      disassociation of gp120 and gp41 into monomer subunits.

      In the MOSAIC study groups, we will explore the use of the three mosaic immunogens used
      sequentially (in a series of different orders), or as a cocktail, to focus B cell responses
      towards conserved areas of Env. To amplify these responses we intend to give a final boosting
      immunization with both consensus immunogens (ConM and ConS).

      The extent to which these different strategies may induce neutralising breadth, and the
      identification of the mechanisms and drivers involved, can only be determined empirically
      through human immunogen challenge studies.
