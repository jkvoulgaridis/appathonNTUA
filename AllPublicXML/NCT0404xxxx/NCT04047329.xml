  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study examined the risk factors and the influence of the type of anesthetic used during
      transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) on subsequent incidence of myocardial
      infarction (MI).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study utilized a population-based, nationwide dataset to evaluate the risk factors of MI
      for patients with benign prostate hypertrophy (BPH) who received TURP. Besides, The study
      also compared the different effects of general anesthesia (GA) and neuraxial anesthesia (NA)
      on the incidence of MI within 6 and 12 months after TURP.
