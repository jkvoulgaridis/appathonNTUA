  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In developed countries cancer has become the second leading cause of death after
      cardiovascular disease. The lung is a particularly exposed organ since broncho-pulmonary
      cancers rank second in terms of incidence, and the first rank in terms of mortality of all
      cancers listed in like reported in United States.

      Lung resection surgery is currently the recommended curative treatment for the early stages
      of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Despite this preferred indication, some patients can
      not be eligible for surgery because of their cardiovascular or respiratory comorbidities or
      their impaired functional capacity.

      Thus, the evaluation of aerobic capacity through cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) of
      patients estimated at risk of postoperative complication is now recommended to estimate the
      level of predictive risk associated. The American Thoracic Society and the European
      Respiratory Socitety agree on thresholds of &lt;10 and&gt; 20 ml/kg/min of maximum oxygen uptake
      (VO2peak) respectively determining a high or low postoperative risk, between these two
      thresholds risk is considered moderate.

      Aerobic capacity is traditionally expressed in terms of maximum oxygen uptake (VO2max or
      VO2peak) evaluated during an incremental CPET. In patients with significant respiratory
      impairment, these tests are often limited by ventilation and sub-maximally on the metabolic
      or cardiac parameters. However, the analysis of the VO2 kinetic during a constant-intensity
      test of moderate intensity is also a relevant way of measuring aerobic conditioning. Indeed,
      the time constant (τ) of phase II of VO2 kinetics (VO2τ) is a marker that closely reflects
      the adjustment of oxidative metabolism in skeletal muscle. Analysis of the kinetic parameters
      of the cardio-respiratory response to exercise has been shown to be reproducible and
      training-sensitive in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The value
      of VO2τ was also reported to be strongly correlated with markers of severity and prognosis in
      COPD patients. Previous work has shown that exercise training can improve the speed of the
      VO2 kinetic response in COPD patients as well as in healthy subjects.

      To date, no study to our knowledge has evaluated the kinetics of the cardiorespiratory
      response during moderate intensity constant-load test in patients with NSCLC. In this
      context, this work aims to evaluate the applicability of this measure as well as its
      evolution during a preoperative exercise training program in patients with NSCLC.

    <description>Each prehabilitation session will last approximately 90 minutes and will include:
Endurance training at the ventilatory threshold, determined according to the initial CPET. The first session will last for 15 to 20 minutes then increase by 5 minutes each session to reach 45 minutes in total (including a 5-minute warm-up and 5 minutes of active recovery). The intensity will then increase by 5 or 10 W, as could be tolerated;
Peripheral muscle strengthening at 60% to 70% of the 1-repetition maximum of 3 main components (quadriceps press, whole-leg extension, and upper limb pull down). Three sets of 12 movements will carry out for each exercise and the load will increase weekly as tolerated;
Inspiratory muscle training using a threshold calibrated to at least 30% of the MIP. Patients will be encouraged to carry out 15 minutes of independent training daily and to increase the resistance regularly.
Education to bronchial drainage techniques as well as directed coughing.</description>
