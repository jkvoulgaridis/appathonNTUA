      This study evaluates efficacy and safety of virtual reality (VR)-based cognitive training
      program in amnestic mild cognitive impairment.

    <textblock>
      This study is a single-blind, randomized, controlled, two-period crossover trial. The
      intervention is done twice a week for 6 weeks. There are two arms. During the first period,
      participants were randomized to receive either VR-based cognitive training or usual care.
      After a 2-week washout period, the groups were crossed over to receive the alternative
      treatment for 6 weeks.
