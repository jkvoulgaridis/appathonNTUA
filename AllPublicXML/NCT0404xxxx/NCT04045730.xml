      This is an open-label single arm phase 2 study for patients with metastatic pancreatic ductal
      adenocarcinoma who have not received any prior systemic therapies.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To determine the efficacy of gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel in combination with PVHA and
      pembrolizumab as measured by progression free survival (PFS).

      Hypothesis: The combination of gemcitabine, nab-paclitaxel, PVHA and pembrolizumab will
      improve PFS compared to the historical control for chemotherapy.

      3.2 Secondary Objectives &amp; Hypotheses

        1. Objective: To estimate median overall survival (OS)

        2. Objective: To determine the overall response rate (ORR) by Response Evaluation Criteria
           in Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.1).

        3. Objective: To determine the toxicity and tolerability of gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel
           with PVHA and pembrolizumab.

      Hypothesis: The combination of gemcitabine, nab-paclitaxel, PVHA, and pembrolizumab will be
      safe and improve OS and ORR compared to the historical control for chemotherapy.

      3.3 Exploratory Objective

        1. Objective: To evaluate pre-treatment and on-treatment PD-L1 and hyaluronan (HA) status
           and correlate with PFS, ORR, and OS.

        2. Objective: To measure the stromal alterations and stromal degradation of hyaluronan and
           correlate with clinical benefit.

        3. Objective: To quantify the pre-treatment and on-treatment change in immune effector
           cells and correlate with clinical benefit.

        4. Objective: To cryopreserve additional tumor tissue for future analysis, including but
           not limited to DNA and RNA sequencing.

        5. Objective: To create organoid cultures from core biopsy specimens for future studies.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male/female participants who are at least 18 years of age on the day of signing
             informed consent with an untreated metastatic histologically confirmed diagnosis of

          -  Male participants:

        A male participant must agree to use a contraception as detailed in Appendix 3 of this
        protocol during the treatment period and for at least 120 days after the last dose of study
        treatment and refrain from donating sperm during this period.

          -  Female participants:

        A female participant is eligible to participate if she is not pregnant not breastfeeding,
        and at least one of the following conditions applies: Not a woman of childbearing potential
        (WOCBP) as defined in Appendix 3

        A WOCBP who agrees to follow the contraceptive guidance in during the treatment period and
        for at least 120 days after the last dose of study treatment.

          -  The participant (or legally acceptable representative if applicable) provides written
             informed consent for the trial. Patients or their legally authorized representative
             must be informed of the investigational nature of this study.

          -  Measurable disease on computed tomography (CT) scan and/or MRI per RECIST 1.1
             criteria. Lesions situated in a previously irradiated area are considered measurable
             if progression has been demonstrated in such lesions.

          -  Willing to undergo a pre-treatment core or excisional biopsy of a tumor lesion not
             previously irradiated, except for patients with 15 FFPE unstained slides of tumor
             tissue where a pre-treatment biopsy is optional. If 15 FFPE unstained slides are
             unavailable a pre-treatment biopsy is only mandatory if it can be obtained via a
             non-significant risk procedure. Significant risk procedures include (but are not
             limited to) biopsies of the brain, lung / mediastinum, pancreas, or endoscopic
             procedures extending beyond the esophagus, stomach, or bowel. Any biopsy via
             significant risk procedure is optional. For patients who pursue an optional biopsy
             when a non-significant risk biopsy is possible the optional biopsy will serve as the
             pre-treatment tissue sample. Biopsy requirements are further outlined in section
             7.1.2.7.

          -  Willing to undergo an on-treatment core or excisional tumor biopsy at week 8 (for the
             first 20 evaluable patients). Biopsy risk requirements for on-treatment biopsies are
             the same as the pre-treatment biopsy and outlined above and in section 7.1.2.7.

          -  Has an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 to 1.
             Evaluation of ECOG is to be performed within 7 days prior to day 1 of treatment. .

          -  Has a life expectancy of ≥ 20 weeks.
