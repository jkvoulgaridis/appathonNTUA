  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although the survival of children with sickle cell disease (SCD) has dramatically improved
      over the last decades in the US and Europe, mortality remains high in adults. Moreover, many
      children and most adults develop a chronic debilitating condition due to organ damage.
      Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is currently the unique curative
      approach; it allows the cure of more than 95% of children transplanted from a matched related
      donor (MRD) after a myeloablative conditioning regimen.To date, few studies have addressed
      the role of HSCT in SCD adults, due to the risk of graft versus host disease (GVHD) and to
      the toxicity expected in older patients with a higher risk of organ damage. The development
      of safe, non-myeloablative conditioning regimens that allow stable mixed chimerism and avoid
      GVHD appears as an attractive option for HSCT to cure adults with severe SCD. The
      investigators design a prospective multicenter trial targeting patients over 15 years with
      severe SCD, and compare non-myeloablative transplant (when a matched related donor (MRD) is
      identified) versus no HSCT (for patients lacking MRD). The main objective is to assess the
      benefit of HSCT on the 2-year event free survival compared to standard care. The primary
      endpoint is the 2-year event free survival.

    <time_frame>at 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of life evaluated using MOS SF36 questionnaire (Medical Outcomes Study - 36-Item Short Form Health Survey). SF-36 is a set of generic, coherent, and easily administered quality-of-life measures. These measures rely upon patient self-reporting. Items are grouped into three categories: functional status, well-being, overall health assessment. In two dimensions, the answer is binary (yes / no) and in the other 6 in ordinal quality (3 to 6 possible answers). For each dimension, the scores for the different items are coded and then summed and transformed linearly on a scale ranging from 0 to 100. A physical composite score and a mental composite score can be calculated according to an established algorithm</description>

    <measure>Depression and Anxiety status</measure>

    <description>Depression and anxiety will be assessed using Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) questionnaire. The HAD scale is a self-assessment scale for detecting states of depression and anxiety in the setting of an hospital medical outpatient clinic.
HADS is a self-administered scale of 14 items which assessed levels of depression and anxiety, divided into 2 subscales of 7 items (Anxiety or HADS-A, Depression or HADS-D). Each item is scored on a scale of 0 to 3. A score is generated for each of the two sub-scales (sum of the 7 items, ranging from 0 to 21). Limit scores, for each of the scores, distinguish: non-cases or asymptomatic ones (score ≤ 7); probable or borderline cases (score 8-10); clearly or clinically symptomatic cases (score ≥ 11).</description>
