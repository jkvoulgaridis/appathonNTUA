      Primary Objectives:

        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of isatuximab administered subcutaneously (SC)
           versus intravenously (IV)

        -  To evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of SC and IV isatuximab

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To estimate absolute bioavailability of SC and IV isatuximab

        -  To measure receptor occupancy (RO) after isatuximab SC versus IV administration

        -  To assess efficacy of isatuximab after SC and IV administration

        -  To assess patient expectations prior to and patient experience and satisfaction after SC
           administration

        -  To evaluate potential immunogenicity of SC or IV isatuximab

      Total study duration is variable depending on treatment and follow-up periods, including 21
      days of screening, and treatment period until disease progression, unacceptable adverse
      reaction or other reason for discontinuation. End of treatment will be 30 days after last
      administration of investigational medicinal product, or approximately 14 months after first
      study treatment administration.
