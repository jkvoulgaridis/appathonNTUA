  <brief_summary>

      This research study is studying the safety, tolerability, and tumor activity of the study
      drug known as rogaratinib as a possible treatment for bladder cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety
      and effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the drug works in treating a
      specific disease. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the drug is being studied. The U.S. Food and
      Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved rogaratinib as a treatment for any disease.

      In this research study, the investigators are studying rogaratinib in bladder cancer that has
      not responded to BCG and overexpresses a protein called FGFR1 or 3.

        -  Mutations in FGFR help bladder cancer grow. In metastatic cancers that express FGFR 1 or
           3, rogaratinib and other inhibitors of FGFR have shown to be an effective treatment

        -  Rogaratinib is an oral drug that inhibits FGFR

        -  To date, no therapy has been shown to be effective in controlling bladder cancer after
           BCG does not work.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female patients ≥ 18 years of age (at least age of legal maturity)

          -  Have a histologically-confirmed diagnosis of high risk non-muscle-invasive (T1, High
             Grade Ta and/or CIS) transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder. Subjects with tumors
             of mixed transitional/non-transitional cell histology are not allowed.

          -  In subjects with Ta and T1, have undergone complete TURBT as characterized by:

               -  Attainment of a visually complete resection

               -  Residual CIS not amenable to complete transurethral resection is acceptable

               -  The most recent cystoscopy / TURBT must have been performed within 8 weeks prior
                  to the first dose of trial treatment

          -  Have been treated with adequate BCG therapy and have developed NMIBC that is
             unresponsive to BCG therapy. Adequate BCG therapy must include: An induction course
             with at least 5 instillations of BCG (adequate induction); and at least 7
             instillations of BCG within 9 months of the first instillation of adequate induction
             therapy. BCG unresponsive high risk NMIBC is defined as: Stage progression at 3 months
             (±4 weeks) despite adequate induction therapy (e.g., Ta to T1, or CIS to T1; note:
             adequate induction therapy only, defined above, is required in this case); or
             Persistent high risk NMIBC at 6 months (±4 weeks) after adequate BCG therapy or
             Recurrent high risk NMIBC within 9 months of the last BCG instillation despite
             adequate BCG therapy.

          -  Have elected not to undergo, or are considered ineligible for radical cystectomy, as
             determined by the treating surgeon. Reasons for ineligibility or refusal of radical
             cystectomy should be discussed with the subject as part of the informed consent
             process and should be captured on the appropriate case report form. Ineligibility
             factors for radical cystectomy may include, but are not limited to:

               -  Cardiovascular disease (e.g. recent acute coronary syndrome, arrhythmia, heart
                  failure)

               -  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease that would preclude a safe surgical
                  procedure, as determined by the treating surgeon

               -  Poor performance status (e.g. ECOG &gt;2)

               -  Prior major abdominal and pelvic surgery, that would preclude a safe surgical
                  procedure, as determined by the treating surgeon

          -  High FGFR 1/3 mRNA expression levels (RNAscope score of 3+ or 4+; measurement is part
             of the protocol) in archival or fresh tumor biopsy specimen

          -  Existence of archival or fresh tumor biopsy specimen for FGFR1/3 mRNA expression
             testing. Patients who don't have archival tissue specimens meeting eligibility
             requirements may undergo a biopsy. Acceptable samples include core needle biopsies for
             deep tumor tissue (minimum three cores) or excisional, incisional, punch, or forceps
             biopsies for cutaneous, subcutaneous, or mucosal lesions.

          -  Ability to understand and signing of the written patient information/informed consent
             form (PI/ICF) for FGFR testing

          -  Ability to understand and signing of the written PI/ICF for study treatment
             eligibility. Signed informed consent form must be available before any study-specific
             procedure for the respective study parts may begin.(PI/ICF for study treatment
             eligibility must be offered only after positive results in FGFR testing study received
             by site.)

        Note: at the investigator's discretion, an estimated creatinine clearance result &lt;60
        mL/min/1.73m² may be verified by measurement of creatinine clearance based on 24-hour urine
        collection or using EDTA, inulin, GFR scan. INR ≤ 1.5 x ULN and PTT or activated PTT (aPTT)
        ≤ 1.5 x ULN. Patients being treated with anticoagulant, e.g. warfarin or heparin, will be

             days before the first treatment). Negative results must be available before the first

             sexually active. This applies for the time period between signing of the informed
             consent form and until at least 5 months after the last study drug administration. The
             definition of adequate contraception will be based on the judgment of the investigator
             and on local requirements. Acceptable methods of contraception include, but are not
             limited to, (i) condoms (male or female) with or without a spermicidal agent; (ii)
             diaphragm or cervical cap with spermicide; (iii) intra-uterine device; (iv)
             hormone-based contraception.

          -  Substance abuse, medical, psychological or social conditions that may interfere with
             the patient's participation in the study or evaluation of the study results.

          -  Arterial or venous thrombotic events or embolic events such as cerebrovascular
             accident (including transient ischemic attacks), deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary

               -  Concomitant use of strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 and strong inducers of CYP3A4 are
                  not permitted for 2 weeks prior to start of study treatment or during the study.

               -  Concomitant use of moderate and weak CYP3A4 inducers should be avoided as
                  clinically significant decrease in plasma concentrations of rogaratinib cannot be
                  ruled out.

               -  Concomitant use of herbal preparations containing CYP3A4 inducers (e.g. St John's

               -  Grapefruit and grapefruit juice (CYP3A4 inhibitor) consumption is not permitted
                  during the study.

                  antacids, phosphate-containing laxatives oral/rectal, potassium phosphate)

               -  Patients may not receive other investigational treatment or other approved
                  anti-tumor therapy while on this protocol (excluding anti-VEGF therapy for
                  ophthalmologic disease).

          -  Concomitant therapies that should be avoided:

               -  Narrow therapeutic index drugs that are CYP3A4, P-gp, and BCRP substrates (e.g.
                  alfentanil, cyclosporine, dihydroergotamine, ergotamine, fentanyl, pimozide,
                  quinidine, sirolimus, and tacrolimus) should be avoided, because drug
                  interactions caused by irreversible inhibition of CYP3A4, P-gp, and BCRP by
                  rogaratinib cannot be ruled out.

               -  Fluconazole is considered a moderate to strong inhibitor of CYP2C9 and should be
                  avoided, if possible.

               -  No results are available from human interaction studies between rogaratinib and
                  other chemotherapies. No data are available to evaluate the interaction between
                  rogaratinib and radiation. Therefore, when administering these agents after study
                  drug has been withdrawn, it should be taken into consideration that rogaratinib
                  plasma concentrations may be detectable for a few days (depending on half-life)
                  and the physiologic consequences that could interact with chemotherapy and
                  radiotherapy may last even longer following discontinuation of rogaratinib.
