    <textblock>
      This prospective observational study will be assessing whether it is practical and feasible
      to use a stroke screening tool (the modified NHISS, mNIHSS) in an adult surgical population.
      Perioperative stroke is an uncommon but devastating complication of surgery and previous
      research suggests that stroke symptoms may be missed in this population. This stroke
      screening tool has been used extensively in non-surgical patients but has not be used in
      non-cardiac surgical patients. Surgical patients have additional factors that may affect
      their ability to complete this assessment such as pain medications and sedatives, pain, and
      use of epidurals and nerve blocks. This study will involve a total of five testing sessions.
      The first will occur at the time of consent to screen for cognitive impairment via the
      Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), as part of our exclusion criteria. Then over the course
      of four subsequent visits, participants will be assessed on the mNIHSS to track for any
      changes before and after their procedure, as well as evaluate the real-life usability of the
      mNIHSS as a potential tool to screen for stroke in the surgical population.

      Purpose &amp; Justification: Perioperative stroke is a potentially devastating complication that
      is currently poorly characterized with limited clinical tools available to detect and prevent
      its occurrence. To date only two stroke assessment scales have been applied to the
      perioperative setting, though none have been tested in non-cardiac, non-neurologic surgeries.
      One of those assessments, the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), is lengthy
      and may be impractical in the surgical setting. This is further complicated by several
      factors potentially existing in surgical patients that may alter the assessment, such as pain
      and drowsiness from medications. However, there is a modified simpler version of the NIHSS
      (mNIHSS) that has been shown to have improved reliability than the full version and reduced
      time requirement, thus making it preferable for perioperative stroke screening. To overcome
      the current gaps in knowledge and screening for risk of perioperative stroke, this
      prospective observational study will be assessing the feasibility of applying the mNIHSS in
      the surgical setting.

      Primary Objective: To determine the change in mNIHSS score from baseline to immediately after
      surgery in the absence of diagnosed stroke in patients after surgery.

      Secondary Objectives:

        1. To determine the components of the mNIHSS most likely to change following surgery;

        2. To determine the feasibility of administering the mNIHSS in surgical patients (e.g.
           acceptability, resources, length of time to complete, completeness).

        3. To determine the relationship between baseline MoCA score and ability to complete the
           mNIHSS screening after surgery

      Research design: This is a prospective observational study involving five testing sessions. A
      cognitive assessment (MoCA) will be conducted at the time of consent to screen for any
      cognitive impairment. There will be 4 additional visits during which the mNIHSS will be
      administered to surgical patients pre and post-operatively.

      Statistical Analysis:

      Sample Size Calculation There is no specific data available on the application of the mNIHSS
      in our study population. We estimate that we will require a sample size of 21 patients,
      assuming a mean difference of 2 (standard deviation 3) points between pre- and
      post-operatively, an alpha error of 0.05 and power of 80%. Anticipating a 20% drop out rate,
      we will recruit 25 patients.

      Statistical Analysis We will describe the patient population using mean (SD), median (IQR)
      and percentage as appropriate. The application of the mNIHSS will be described using percent
      completed for each question, and the time taken to complete the test at each time point
      (mean, SD).

      The change in mNIHSS on postoperative days 0, 1 and 2 will be compared to baseline using a
      Wilcoxon Signed Ranks test for matched pairs.

      All tests will be two-sided with a p-value less than 0.05 considered statistically
      significant. All statistical analysis will be done using STATA 12.1 (StataCorp, Texas, USA).

    <description>The modified National Institutes for Health Stroke Scale (mNIHSS) is a modified version of the NIHSS used widely in the clinical assessment of stroke patients. The The mNIHSS contains 11 items with a possible range of scores from 0 (best) to 31 (worse). Each of the 11 items provides in a subscore ranging from 0 (normal) to 2-4 points, and the total score is a sum of all subscores.</description>

        Patients will be recruited from the Vancouver General Hospital Anesthesia Consult Clinic
        (ACC) or the ward. We will include older adult patients (65 years or older) presenting for
        non-cardiac non-neurologic surgery under general anesthesia at Vancouver General Hospital
        with a minimum two-night stay in hospital.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        We will include older adult patients (65 years or older) presenting for non-cardiac
        non-neurologic surgery under general anesthesia at Vancouver General Hospital with a
        minimum two-night stay in hospital.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        We will exclude patients undergoing procedures involving the major vasculature of the head
        and neck, as well as patients who are predicted to require postoperative ventilation or
        planned tracheostomy. Patients who are not able to read or speak English will be excluded,
        as well as patients with significant hearing or visual impairment that would make
        assessment unreliable. In order to complete the mNIHSS accurately, we will exclude patients
        with significant cognitive impairment suggestive of dementia (MoCA score 17 or less) or a
        diagnosis of dementia.
