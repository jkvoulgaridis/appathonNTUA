      OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of different time intervals activations on the
      non-surgical maxillary expansion in adults. Methods: This study will include two groups, 10
      adult patients each (mean age 18 - 30) with maxillary transverse deficiency. In the first
      group, the expansion is going to be activated every other day. In the second group,
      activation will occur every four days. After, the results are going to be compared by
      measuring the transverse dimension, the buccal cortical bone formation, and the upper
      premolar and molar labial inclination. Dentoalveolar changes will be evaluated using CBCT
      images before and after expansion, digital model measurements, and buccal inclination of the
      first upper molars.
