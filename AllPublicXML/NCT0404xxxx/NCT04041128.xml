  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Study involves surgery for cytoreduction or laparoscopy to determine if you are a candidate
      for tumor debulking or a tissue biopsy. Following this surgery you will receive chemotherapy.
      This study will administer 7 days of treatment with a targeted therapy called Lynparza.
      Lynparza and/or other PARP inhibitors have been FDA approved for the treatment of ovarian and
      breast cancer. Tissue biopsy will be done before a 7 day course of Lynparza in order to
      correlate molecular changes to response to treatment. Participation in this trial will
      require an additional tumor biopsy which will occur either before or after treatment of
      Lynparza.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All patients must have cytology/ biopsy proven diagnosis of a mullerian carcinoma,
             high clinical index of suspicion for ovarian cancer OR triple negative, BRCA mutated
             breast cancer.

          -  Patients may not have received prior treatment for breast or ovarian cancer.

          -  All patients must be of at least 18 years of age.

          -  ECOG Performance status must be 0,1 or 2.

          -  Patients must not have received a prior PARP inhibitor

          -  Adequate organ and marrow function as defined below:

          -  absolute neutrophil count &gt;/= 1500/mcL

          -  Platelets &gt; /= 100,000 /mcl

          -  Hemoglobin &gt;/= 8 g/dl

          -  Total bilirubin &lt;/= 1.5 x the institutional ULN

          -  AST, ALT &lt;/= 3 x the institutional ULN

          -  Creatinine &lt;/= the institutional ULN

          -  Women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception
             (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry, for
             the duration of study participation, and for 90 days following completion of therapy.
             Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this
             study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.

          -  A female of child-bearing potential is any woman (regardless of sexual orientation,
             having undergone a tubal ligation, or remaining celibate by choice) who meets the
             following criteria:

               -  Has not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy; or

               -  Has not been naturally postmenopausal for at least 12 consecutive months (i.e.,
                  has had menses at any time in the preceding 12 consecutive months).

          -  Patients must be able to swallow and retain oral medications.

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

             study treatment. Subjects must have recovered from prior treatment-related to
             toxicities to grade 1 or baseline (excluding alopecia and clinically stable toxicities
             requiring ongoing medical management, such as hypothyroidism from prior immune
             checkpoint inhibitor treatment).

          -  Subjects may not be receiving any other investigational agents for the treatment of
             the cancer under study.

          -  Brain metastases

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to Lynparza or other agents used in study.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that, in the opinion of the
             investigator, would limit compliance with study requirements.

          -  Subjects must not be pregnant or nursing due to the potential for congenital
             abnormalities and the potential of this regimen to harm nursing infants.
