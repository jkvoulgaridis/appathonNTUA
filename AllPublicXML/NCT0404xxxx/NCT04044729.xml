      The aim of this trial is to examine the neurochemical mechanisms associated with Cannabidiol
      (CBD) versus placebo for chronic non-cancer pain. Participants will include individuals with
      chronic pain, who will be randomized into one of two intervention conditions: low THC/high
      CBD or placebo. In addition to receiving CBD or placebo, participants also will complete
      symptom assessments of chronic pain data (intensity, quality, interference/disability)
      throughout the study. These measures will be gathered prior to and following the fifth doses
      (dosing will occur once per day for five days) of CBD or placebo. A secondary objective will
      be to examine the association between clinical and inflammatory markers.

    <time_frame>5 Days</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will undergo MRS scanning to assess neurochemical shifts from the baseline visit (day 1) to the visit five (day 5) in order to determine whether CBD, or Placebo will result in changes to neurochemical ratios in select brain regions. Neurotransmitter levels such as BABA and N-Acetylaspartate will be collected and compared pre and post study drug administration.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain Improvement</measure>
    <time_frame>7 Days</time_frame>
    <description>Using baseline assessment measures gathered at visit 0 (Screening), assessments collected at visits 1-5 and follow-up will be used to determine whether the administration of CBD or placebo will improve pain relief in individuals with chronic pain. We will measure pain intensity with a visual analog scale from (0-10) with 10 being the worst pain imaginable. We will also measure Objective pain thresholds with a pressure algometer. This is a device that applies pressure to the participants finger until they say stop. The pressure range is 0-50 foot pounds of force.</description>
