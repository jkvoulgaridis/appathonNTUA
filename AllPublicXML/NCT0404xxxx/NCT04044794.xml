  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many adults with obesity continue to gain weight even though they do not want to. This
      project will test the effects of a primary care intervention in which people with obesity
      receive an electronic scale and recommendations to weigh themselves daily. This will help us
      understand whether daily self-weighing might be a way to prevent continued weight gain.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age 19-65 years

          -  Body mass index (BMI) 30 - 50 kg/m2

          -  Receives care at one of the participating primary care clinics

          -  Resides in one location at least 5 days each week

          -  Possesses a smartphone with data plan

          -  Wi-Fi or Bluetooth internet connection in home

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnancy or anticipating pregnancy during study duration. This is a weight loss study
             and weight gain/loss due to pregnancy and/or delivery would confound study results.
             Additionally, weight loss is not recommended for pregnant women.

          -  Unwilling or unable to do any of the following: give informed consent, accept random
             assignment, attend five measurement assessments

          -  Likely to relocate and no longer be seen at UAB primary care in the next 2 years

          -  Weight loss ≥5% of body weight in past 6 months (other than postpartum)

          -  Weight &gt;180 kg (396lbs) due to the limitation of the scale being used.

          -  Current participation in another weight loss study

          -  Bariatric surgery or revision in the past two years

          -  Prescription weight loss medications within the past 6 months

          -  Another household member already participating in the study

          -  Potential participants living farther than 50 miles driving distance from UAB will be
             excluded from the study. It is expected that those living farther away will be more
             difficult to retain as study participants.

    <ipd_description>The PI will ensure all publications that result from project-related data will comply with the NIH public access policy and develop a system by which study data may be shared with other investigators within the scientific community. With UAB IRB permission, PI may develop a de-identified database, codebook, and mechanism by which data can be shared with qualified individuals/organizations. PI will keep a record of all individuals/res. teams who request/receive a copy of the data. Interested investigators will be asked to complete a request form stating specific aims of the analyses, analytic plan, available resources, proposed timeline, and goals. PI and team will review these requests to determine whether proposed analyses constitute significant exploration of the data, team has resources to complete request, and data will be adequately protected and managed. If any issues are problematic, PI and team will attempt to negotiate a fair resolution with investigators and NIH staff.</ipd_description>
