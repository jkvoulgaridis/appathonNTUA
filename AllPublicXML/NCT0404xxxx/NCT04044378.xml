  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Results of previous study showed high objective response but short-term activity of
      anti-angiogenesis tyrosine kinase inhibitors in advanced osteosarcoma. Given the recent
      success of immunotherapies, combinations of antiangiogenics with immune checkpoint blockers
      have become an attractive strategy. The investigators had completed an prospective phase 2
      trial of the combination of apatinib and camrelizumab on advanced osteosarcoma and showed
      prolonged progression-free survival for this combination. Famitinib is a novel tyrosine
      kinase inhibitor targeting VEGFR-2, -3 and FGFR-1, -2, -3, -4 with high affinity, which
      showed broad antitumor activity against a variety of xenograft models.

      A Study to Compare the Efficacy and Safety of Levatinib with or without Ifosfamide and
      Etoposide in Children, Adolescents and Young Adults With Relapsed and Refractory Osteosarcoma
      showed promising median PFS of 11.3 months. Thus we also try to investigate the combination
      efficacy of TKIs with chemotherapy in advanced osteosarcoma.

      This study aims to investigate the recommended phase 2 dose for pediatric use of famitinib in
      combination with camrelizumab and trys to explore the efficacy and safety for single drug
      famitinib, famitinib and camrelizumab and famitinib and ifosfamide in patients with
      inoperable high-grade osteosarcoma progressing after chemotherapy.

    <description>In the dose-defining phase I portion, camrelizumab was given at a fixed dose of 200mg Q2W, while the de-escalated 3+3 design was used to detect the recommended dose of famitinib from an initial level of 15mg orally taken daily. Recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) was defined as the highest dose at which no more than 30% patients experience a DLT in the first two courses.
In the phase II portion, famitinib will be orally taken daily with RP2D together with camrelizumab intravenous infusion at a dose of 200 mg over 30 minutes, once every two weeks (Q2W), 4 weeks (28 days) as one treatment cycle.</description>
