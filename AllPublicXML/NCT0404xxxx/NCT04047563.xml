    <textblock>
      In the present prospective, multicentric, randomized, double-blind, parallel,
      saline-controlled phase II clinical study; the investigators plan to evaluate the efficacy of
      sovateltide (IRL-1620 or PMZ-1620) therapy along with standard supportive care in patients of
      acute ischemic stroke.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The peptide Sovateltide (IRL-1620) is a highly selective ETB receptor agonist. There are
      hidden stem cells in the brain, which becomes active following injury to the brain.
      Intravenous administration of PMZ-1620 (sovateltide) augments the activity of neuronal
      progenitor cells in the brain to repair the damage by formation of new mature neurons and
      blood vessels. In addition, PMZ-1620 has anti-apoptotic activity and also increases cerebral
      blood flow when administered following ischemia. It was discovered that in rat model of
      ischemic stroke, sovateltide, significantly improved survival, reduces neurological and motor
      function deficit while effectively decreasing infarct volume, edema and oxidative stress. The
      convincing results of preclinical efficacy studies of Sovateltide in ischemic stroke and its
      safety affirmation from phase I and phase II clinical studies encouraged us to investigate
      its efficacy in human patients of ischemic stroke. In the present prospective, multicentric,
      randomized, double-blind, parallel, saline-controlled phase II clinical study; the
      investigators plan to evaluate the efficacy of Sovateltide therapy along with standard
      supportive care in patients of acute ischemic stroke.

             hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, epidural hemorrhage, acute or chronic subdural
             hematoma on the baseline CT or MRI scan.

             prevent completion of the study protocol, impair the assessment of outcome, or in
             which PMZ-1620 therapy would be contraindicated or might cause harm to the patient.
