  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, a prospective, randomized and controlled clinical study would be carried out
      to establish Ultrasound Integrated Precision Diagnosis Technology with elastography as the
      core technology to evaluate renal injury and repair comprehensively and accurately, and to
      improve the clinical diagnosis chance of renal injury (or renal fibrosis).

      Combined with the dynamic changes of biomarkers (inflammatory factors, cytokines secreted by
      immune cells, etc.) after kidney injury, the research on the prognosis of kidney disease with
      ultrasound elastography technology as the core would be explored, which aims to provide a
      scientific basis for the application of Ultrasound Integrated Precision Diagnosis Technology.
