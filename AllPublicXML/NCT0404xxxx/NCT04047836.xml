  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the effects of electronic cigarette e-liquid nicotine content in a
      randomized, crossover clinical and behavioral pharmacology study of experienced adult
      e-cigarette users (N=36). The specific aim is to determine the impact of nicotine content of
      e-liquid on nicotine pharmacology, systemic exposure to toxic volatile organic compounds, and
      short-term cardiovascular effects.

      This is a within-subjects, crossover design of advanced electronic cigarette users in which
      we will examine nicotine pharmacokinetics, subjective effects, daily nicotine intake and
      nicotine titration, short-term cardiovascular effects, and toxicant exposure when
      participants are using low vs. high nicotine e-liquids.

      Hypothesis 1: E-cigarette users will titrate their intake of nicotine such that they will
      inhale fewer aerosol toxicants and suffer less harm to health when using higher vs. lower
      nicotine content e-liquids.

      Hypothesis 2: Compared to low nicotine, high nicotine e-liquid use will have similar
      cardiovascular effects throughout the day (due to compensatory behavioral changes), with
      similar effects on heart rate, blood pressure, and catecholamine release.

      Hypothesis 3: Exposure to volatile organic compounds (VOCs) will be lower when vaping high
      nicotine e-liquids compared to low nicotine e-liquids.
