  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP's) in connective tissue components are associated with
      increased risk of pelvic organ prolapse (POP). The investigators expect to find a difference
      in SNP's frequency between women who had Obstetric anal sphincter injuries (OASIS) and in the
      healthy population. The fact that pelvic organ prolapse (POP) and OASIS occurs in the same
      anatomic region and the well-known association between few SNP's and the risk for POP,
      suggests for a common pathophysiology.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The perineum consists of skin, muscles and connective tissue. A connective tissue disorder
      related to POP has been reported in biochemical and molecular studies. OASIS are considered a
      severe complication of vaginal delivery that may lead to a great deal of morbidity. Familial
      history is known as a risk factor for OASIS. Currently, there is no established genetic link
      between connective tissue components and OASIS. Therefore, the investigators assume that
      studying the genetic predisposition factors of women who experience OASIS, might generate a
      stronger tool to predict severe occurrence of vaginal laceration. It may also help to consult
      women before vaginal delivery about the risk of OASIS.

      The aim of this study is to find an association between genetic variation and increased risk
      for OASIS.
