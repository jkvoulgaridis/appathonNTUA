  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized trial of vaginal microbiome transplant vs. saline placebo to restore a
      Lactobacillus dominant vaginal microbial community in women with recurrent bacterial
      vaginosis.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate
      the safety of vaginal microbiota transplant (VMT) in women with recurrent bacterial vaginosis
      (BV), and to assess the ability of antibiotic treatment plus vaginal microbiota transplant to
      establish a Lactobacillus-dominant vaginal community as compared to antibiotic treatment
      alone. The underlying hypothesis is that the VMT will lead to less inflammation and higher
      prevalence of vaginal Lactobacillus compared to antibiotics alone. The transplant material
      will be vaginal fluid collected from healthy donors using a disposable menstrual cup. Donors
      undergo extensive testing for possible infections to ensure the safety of the donated
      material.

      Study Visits and Procedures: In addition to the pre-screening eligibility phone call and
      screening visit, there will be two treatment study visits and six post-VMT follow up visits
      at weeks 3, 5, 7, 11, 15, and 27. The baseline visit will occur within 45 days of the
      screening visit.

      Phone Screen: A brief phone discussion to explain approach and alternatives (see details
      below in &quot;Technical Methods&quot;). A set of short screening questions will be asked to identify
      women with clear exclusion criteria for participation.

      Visit 1, Screening Visit: At the screening visit, after written informed consent is obtained,
      the information from the pre-screening questionnaire will be reviewed with the subject and
      updated as necessary. Blood and vaginal specimens will be collected. The VMT process will be
      explained in detail and subjects will have the opportunity to inspect an example applicator
      if interested. Subjects will be counseled not to have vaginal intercourse or insert anything
      into their vagina from the 72 hours prior to the first transplant dose until 72 hours after
      the second transplant dose.
