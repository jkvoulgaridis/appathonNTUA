  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alterations in sleep and the sleep / wake cycle, which are particularly common in Alzheimer's
      disease patients, could represent an early biomarker for cognitive decline and onset of
      dementia . Moreover, these disturbances in activity rhythms and sleep patterns represent
      modifiable factors and therefore potential targets for the prevention of certain
      neurodegenerative disorders.

      The main objective of this study will be to test the hypothesis that elderly people without
      major cognitive impairment who have circadian rhythm disorders of the sleep / wake cycle have
      structural and / or functional abnormalities in the central nervous system and more
      specifically of the hippocampal function which could represent a risk factor for the
      occurrence of cognitive impairment. Indeed, although many studies in both humans and animals
      suggest the existence of links between sleep alterations and age-related cognitive
      impairment, the causality of these observations is still not clear.

      This description of the anatomical and functional substratum of sleep / wake cycle
      alterations occurring in an elderly population will be based on joint analysis of multimodal
      brain imaging (MRI) and neuropsychology actimetry data. The SoRyMA-AMImage 3 protocol will
      correspond to the 2nd actimetry measurement point and the 3rd MRI measurement point of a
      larger population-based cohort AMImage.

      This project will collect data from the sleep / wake cycle (actimetry) from a sample of 100
      patients included in AMI / AMImage 2 and relate them to brain imaging data (MRI). The main
      objective of the protocol is the evaluation of the link between changes in sleep and cycle
      parameters during aging and hippocampal functioning (through fMRI and neuropsychological
      score of hippocampal dependant tasks). The actimetry variables measured at the two follow-up
      (4 years apart) will make it possible to measure the degradation of the sleep and cycle
      parameters (through the reduction of sleep duration, sleep time, increase in sleep
      fragmentation and decrease in the relative amplitude of the rhythm).

      This framework will provide access to a very large amount of data that can be
      cross-referenced with actimetry data; the longitudinal character of this data collected over
      a decade will also make it possible to work on the evolution of the actimetry parameters and
      its relationship with the cognitive and clinical evolution of the subjects. Thus, these data
      will make it possible to study the prognostic value of the analyzed actimetry parameters in
      association with very complete clinical and neuropsychological data.

    <measure>Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>The TAS-20 is a self-report scale that is comprised of 20 items.
The TAS-20 has 3 subscales:
Difficulty Describing Feelings subscale is used to measure difficulty describing emotions. 5 items.
Difficulty Identifying Feeling subscale is used to measure difficulty identifying emotions. 7 items.
Externally-Oriented Thinking subscale is used to measure the tendency of individuals to focus their attention externally. 8 items.
Items are rated using a 5-point Likert scale whereby 1 = strongly disagree and 5 = strongly agree.
The total alexithymia score is the sum of responses to all 20 items, while the score for each subscale factor is the sum of the responses to that subscale. The TAS-20 uses cutoff scoring: equal to or less than 51 = non-alexithymia, equal to or greater than 61 = alexithymia. Scores of 52 to 60 = possible alexithymia.</description>

    <description>The PANAS Scale or Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) is a self-report questionnaire. The test comprises 20 terms, with ten focusing on a positive emotion and the other ten focusing on a negative emotion. The final score of the PANAS Scale / Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) test is the sum of the 10 terms on the positive scale and the sum of the 10 terms on the negative scale. The value assigned is positive for answers on the positive scale and negative for answers on the negative scale.</description>

Respondents answer each item on a 7-point Likert-type scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree). The scoring takes the average of all the scores.</description>
