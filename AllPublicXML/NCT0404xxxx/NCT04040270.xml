  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A harmonious family relationship has significant effects on the psychological well-being and
      development of children. Good communication between parents and children is a crucial element
      for family health, happiness and harmony. However, communication within Hong Kong families is
      vastly inadequate partly due to our busy urban lifestyle.

      The 3Hs Family Drama Project I was to promote health, happiness, harmony (3Hs), healthy
      eating and physical activity in primary school students. Students watched interactive live
      drama in schools and were given DVD and worksheets. Students were encouraged to watch the DVD
      with other family members at home. This study was to evaluate the effectiveness of
      interactive live drama, DVD and worksheet.

      3Hs Family Drama Project was an intervention to enhance the 3Hs through increasing
      interaction and communication between parents and children. Healthy eating and physical
      activity were also promoted. The drama project staged 100 drama performances in primary
      schools during the 2012-13 school year. The main targets were Primary 4 to 6 (P4-6) students
      and their families. Group A students would watch the live drama in school and were encouraged
      to watch the DVD and finish worksheets with their parents, while group B students would be
      given a DVD and worksheets and were encouraged to watch the DVD and finish the worksheets
      with their parents.

      The goals of the study were to evaluate the effectiveness of the project to enhance health,
      happiness, harmony (3Hs), healthy eating and physical activity and participants' satisfaction
      levels towards the drama project.

      Quantitative assessments were used to evaluate the effectiveness and the satisfaction of the
      project. Questionnaire was distributed to assess the immediate and short-term effects.
