  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is evaluating the effects of a standard diet to a low carbohydrate diet in obese
      women after having a baby. The purpose of the study is to determine if a low carbohydrate
      diet is associated with improvement in insulin sensitivity in postpartum women.
