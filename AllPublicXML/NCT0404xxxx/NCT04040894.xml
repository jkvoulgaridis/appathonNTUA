        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Written informed consent.

          2. Male or female patient at least 18 years old.

          3. Clinical diagnosis active TED with a CAS ≥ 4 (on the 7-item scale).

          4. Moderate-to-severe active TED (not sight-threatening but has an appreciable impact on
             daily life), usually associated with one or more of the following: lid retraction ≥ 2
             mm, moderate or severe soft tissue involvement, exophthalmos ≥ 3 mm above normal for
             race and gender, and/or inconstant or constant diplopia.

          5. Onset of Active TED symptoms (as determined by patient records) within approximately
             12 months prior to eligibility review.

          6. Patients must be euthyroid with the baseline disease under control or have mild hypo-
             or hyperthyroidism (defined as free thyroxine [FT4] and free triiodothyronine [FT3]
             levels &lt; 50% above or below the normal limits) at Eligibility review. Every effort
             should be made to correct the mild hypo- or hyperthyroidism promptly and to maintain
             the euthyroid state for the full duration of participation.

          7. Does not require immediate surgical ophthalmological intervention.

          8. Diabetic patients must have well-controlled stable disease (defined as HbA1c &lt; 9.0%).

          9. Women of childbearing potential (including those with an onset of menopause &lt;2 years,
             non-therapy-induced amenorrhea for &lt;12 months, or not surgically sterile [absence of
             ovaries and/or uterus]) must have a negative serum pregnancy test within 3 weeks prior
             to the first infusion and negative urine pregnancy tests at all protocol-specified
             timepoints (i.e., prior to each infusion); patients who are sexually active with a
             non-vasectomized male partner must agree to use 2 reliable forms of contraception
             during the expanded access program, one of which is recommended to be hormonal, such
             as an oral contraceptive. Hormonal contraception must be started at least one full
             cycle prior to the first infusion and continue for 180 days after the last dose of
             investigational drug. Highly effective contraceptive methods (with a failure rate less
             than 1% per year), when used consistently and correctly, includes implants,
             injectables, combined oral contraceptives, some intrauterine devices (IUDs), sexual
             abstinence or vasectomized partner.

         10. Male patients must be surgically sterile or, if sexually active with a female partner
             of childbearing potential, must agree to use a barrier contraceptive method from the
             first infusion through 180 days after the last dose of investigational drug.

         11. Patient is willing and able to comply with the prescribed treatment protocol and
             evaluations for the duration of their participation.

        Exclusion Criteria:

             first infusion of teprotumumab or tocilizumab (Actemra® or Roactemra®) within 6 months
             prior to the first infusion of teprotumumab. Use of any other non-steroid
             immunosuppressive agent within 3 months prior to the first infusion of teprotumumab.

          2. Use of an investigational agent for any condition within 60 days prior to the first
             infusion or anticipated use during the course of the protocol.

          3. Pregnant or lactating women.

          4. Biopsy-proven or clinically suspected IBD (e.g., diarrhea with or without blood or
             rectal bleeding associated with abdominal pain or cramping/colic, urgency, tenesmus,
             or incontinence for more than 4 weeks without a confirmed alternative diagnosis OR
             endoscopic or radiologic evidence of enteritis/colitis without a confirmed alternative
             diagnosis).

          5. Known hypersensitivity to any of the components of teprotumumab or prior
             hypersensitivity reactions to mAbs.

          6. Any other condition that, in the opinion of the Sponsor, would preclude inclusion in
             the expanded access program.

          7. Previous enrollment in this study or participation in a prior teprotumumab clinical
             study.
