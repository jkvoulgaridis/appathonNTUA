  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Head Start Family and Child Experiences Survey (FACES) has been a major source of
      information on Head Start programs and the children and families these programs serve since
      1997, but has historically not included Region XI (programs that serve federally recognized
      American Indian and Alaska Native tribes). AI/AN FACES 2019 builds on AI/AN FACES 2015
      (NCT03842111), which was the first national study of Region XI Head Start children and
      families, to continue to collect information on key Head Start program performance measures.

      The Head Start Family and Child Experiences Survey (FACES) has been a major source of
      information on Head Start programs and the children and families the programs serve since
      1997, but has historically not included Region XI (programs that serve federally recognized
      American Indian and Alaska Native tribes). AI/AN FACES 2019 builds on AI/AN FACES 2015, which
      was the first national study of Region XI Head Start children and families, to continue to
      collect information on key Head Start program performance measures.

      The design and execution of AI/AN FACES has been informed by close collaboration with members
      of the AI/AN FACES Workgroup which includes Region XI Head Start program directors,
      researchers with experience working with AI/AN communities, Mathematica Policy Research study
      staff, and federal officials from the Office of Head Start, Region XI, and the Office of
      Planning, Research and Evaluation.

      Building on FACES as the foundation, members of the AI/AN FACES Workgroup have shared
      insights and information on the kinds of information needed about children and families
      served by Region XI AI/AN Head Start programs. Members also provided input on recruitment
      practices and study methods that are responsive to the unique cultural and self-governing
      contexts of tribal Head Start programs.

      AI/AN FACES 2019 provides the mechanism for collecting data on a nationally representative
      probability sample in Region XI to learn what progress Head Start has made toward meeting
      program performance goals and provide valid and reliable information to federal, local, and
      tribal stakeholders. AI/AN FACES 2019 focuses on children and families to describe the school
      readiness skills, family characteristics, and Head Start experiences of these children, with
      a focus on Native culture and language. The investigators will collect information on
      programs and classrooms to provide context for children's experiences. Data collection with
      Region XI children, families, classrooms, and programs will take place in the Fall of 2019
      and the Spring of 2020.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The Region XI AI/AN Head Start programs participating in AI/AN FACES were a
             probability sample selected from among 146 study-eligible programs on the 2016-2017
             Head Start Program Information Report (PIR). To be eligible for the study, a program
             had to be providing services directly to children ages 3 to 5, and not be in imminent
             danger of losing its grantee status. Probability samples of centers were selected
             within each program, classrooms within each center, and children within each
             classroom. Teachers associated with selected classrooms were included in the study
             with certainty, as were parents associated with selected children.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Head Start programs in Regions I through X and Migrant and Seasonal Head Start (Region
             XII) were not eligible for AI/AN FACES. Other ACF studies (FACES-NCT03971435 and
             MSHS-NCT03116243) focus on those programs.
