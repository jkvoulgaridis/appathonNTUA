  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose for the study consists in the assessment of the role of Neurotidine® (citicoline
      oral solution) on the dopaminergic pathway and particularly its potential implications on
      psychophysical performance and quality of life. Other objectives are the assessment of the
      tolerability and safety of Neurotidine®.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Primary open angle glaucoma is a chronic progressive neurodegenerative disease and the only
      proven effective therapy involves reduction of intraocular pressure (IOP). Although treatment
      effect is quite large, a significant proportion of patients show disease progression with
      apparently controlled IOP. Given the similarities with other neurodegenerative diseases -
      particularly in the mechanisms of cell death -neuroprotective treatments have been tried also
      in glaucoma. Interesting results from experimental studies and weak evidence from human
      glaucoma trials have been published in recent years. Citicoline is one of the promising
      molecules with a putative neuroprotective action and has been tried on patients with a number
      of neurodegenerative diseases with encouraging results. Pilot studies on glaucomatous
      patients showed a possible effect of citicoline in reducing progression of visual field
      changes, though these findings need to be confirmed by larger randomized clinical trials.

      The aim of this randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled, cross-over study is to test
      whether the intake of Neurotidine® (citicoline free acid in oral solution) can be associated
      with an improvement of quality of life in patients with glaucoma.

    <time_frame>At 6 months compared to baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Primary outcome is based on the global score of the VFQ-25 questionnaire. Specifically, the VFQ-25 consists of a base set of 25 vision targeted questions. The global score derives from the summary of the scores deriving from each question. The total score has a minimum value &quot;0&quot; considered as the worst visual functionality, and the maximum value &quot;100&quot; considered as the better visual functionality.</description>

    <description>The safety and tolerability of Neurotidine® will be detected on the basis of possible adverse events. In particular, they will be documented in the CRF. Possible adverse events will be communicated directly by the patient and/or detected by the Investigator during the medical examination.</description>

    <description>Each patient will be given the bottles for the first 3-month treatment period by the hospital pharmacist and will be asked to return them at the end of the period (3 months). Then the patients will be given the other bottles for the next phase of the study (3 months): these will contain placebo if the patient received Neurotidine® in the first phase of the study and vice versa. Again, the patients will be asked to return after 3 months with the study bottles and will be given the last set of bottles for the final phase of the study (3 months).

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patients must meet all the following criteria to be eligible for the study:

          -  Signed written informed consent.

          -  Age ≥ 18 years.

          -  Patients with bilateral open-angle glaucoma (OAG). PEX and pigmentary glaucoma will be
             included.

          -  Controlled IOP

          -  Patients with moderate damage in the better eye, with mean deviation from normal value
             (MD) ranging from -6 to -12 dB in the 6 months prior to enrollment. At the screening
             assessment, MD must range from -5 to -13 dB.

        Glaucoma definition will be based on visual field (VF) damage (24-2, SITA standard
        strategy) corresponding to glaucomatous changes at the optic nerve head. Values of IOP will
        not be an inclusion criterion, though a &quot;controlled IOP&quot; based on the clinician's judgement
        will be required.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Patients must meet none of the following criteria to be eligible for the study:

          -  Single-eyed patients (visual acuity &lt;0.1 in one eye).

          -  Patients without the psychophysical requirements to adequately participate and
             complete the trial.

          -  Patients with chronic angle-closure glaucoma (CACG) or other types of glaucoma.

          -  Patients with other ocular comorbidities interfering with the correct assessment of
             the glaucomatous damage to the VF.

          -  Patients who have undergone surgery within 6 months.

          -  Patients taking other potential neuroprotectors, including topical, competing with
             Neurotidine®.

          -  Patients with Parkinson's disease, dementia or a diagnosis of stroke in the last 6
             months.
