    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind clinical investigation to compare the
      effectiveness of intra-articular polyacrylamide hydrogel (PAAG-OA) and a hyaluronic acid,
      Synvisc-One to induce symptomatic benefit in subjects with knee osteoarthritis.

In either pain (WOMAC pain subscale) or function (WOMAC function subscale), a high improvement in the subscale, where high improvement in a subscale is achieved if there is both a &gt; 50% improvement from Baseline and an absolute change from Baseline of &gt; 20 normalised units (0-100 scale) OR
Improvement in at least two (2) of the following three (3):
Improvement in pain (WOMAC pain subscale) defined as &gt; 20% improvement from Baseline and an absolute change from Baseline of &gt; 10 (0-100 scale)
Improvement in function (WOMAC function subscale) defined as &gt; 20% improvement from Baseline and an absolute change from Baseline of &gt; 10 (0-100 scale)
