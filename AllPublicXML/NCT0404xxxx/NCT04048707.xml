  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) is a disease in which patients with cirrhosis (end stage liver
      failure) develop secondary kidney injury and failure. The current treatment available in the
      United States is a combination of octreotide and midodrine, which are meant to decrease the
      release of those hormones and raise the blood pressure, respectively, which would increase
      blood flow to the kidneys. Angiotensin 2 (Ang2) is a new vasopressor drug that was approved
      by the FDA in December 2017 for patients with low blood pressure and has been shown to have
      similar effects to octreotide and midodrine.

      This study will investigate whether Ang2 reverses HRS among patients admitted to the
      intensive care unit (ICU) at Ronald Reagan Medical Center. Our study population will be
      patients with HRS who are already or will be admitted to the ICU. HRS will be defined by new
      internationally accepted guidelines published by the International Club of Ascites. All
      patients who are consented will undergo an Ang2 response trial, where low-dose Ang2 will be
      administered for 4 hours to see how the patients respond. This will help us characterize the
      nature of the patients' kidney failure for later analysis. Patients will then be randomized
      into the control group or the study group. Patients in the control group will receive
      octreotide (a subcutaneous injection) and midodrine (an oral drug). Patients in the study
      group will continue receiving intravenous infusion of Ang2. Patients in both groups will also
      receive albumin, a protein found commonly in human blood. Treatment will continue in both
      groups for four days, until complete reversal of HRS, dialysis, or death.

      Our primary outcome will be rate of reversal of HRS, defined as improvement in kidney
      function.

    <description>Partial or complete reversal of HRS. Serum creatinine will be measured daily and compared against the patient's baseline creatinine.
Partial reversal is defined defined as improvement of at least one AKI stage as defined by International Club of Ascites Acute Kidney Injury (ICA-AKI) criteria Complete defined as improvement of serum creatinine to within 0.3 mg/dl of baseline value).
ICA-AKI criteria:
Stage 1: increase in sCr ≥0.3 mg/dl (26.5 μmol/L) or an increase in sCr ≥1.5-fold to 2-fold from baseline
Stage 2: increase in sCr &gt;2-fold to 3-fold from baseline
Stage 3: increase of sCr &gt;3-fold from baseline or sCr ≥4.0 mg/dl (353.6 μmol/L) with an acute increase ≥0.3 mg/dl (26.5 μmol/L) or initiation of renal replacement therapy Angeli P et al. J Hepatology 2015:62(968-974)</description>
