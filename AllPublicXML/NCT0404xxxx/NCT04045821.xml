  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the response of the endometrial lining after subcutaneous administration of the
      medication AMD3100. This medication mobilizes stem cells and will be used in a population of
      infertile women with a thin endometrium who are undergoing frozen-thawed embryo transfer. The
      investigators will assess associations between response to stem cell mobilization and
      pregnancy outcomes.

      This study seeks to help each participant build a better endometrial lining which is suitable
      to implantation and maintenance of a healthy pregnancy. While animal models demonstrating the
      effectiveness of stem cell recruitment on improved endometrial thickness and pregnancy
      outcomes are plentiful, human studies are lacking. The use of stem cells from the peripheral
      circulation in humans could potentially allow for enhanced endometrial proliferation. The
      objective of this study is to perform a prospective randomized, controlled trial to evaluate
      the response of the endometrial lining after subcutaneous administration of AMD3100
      (plerixafor). AMD3100 is an immunostimulant used to mobilize hematopoietic stem cells in the
      bloodstream. This intervention will be studied in a population of infertile women with a thin
      endometrium who have failed previous embryo transfer cycles and are undergoing a
      frozen-thawed embryo transfer. This study seeks to evaluate both the endometrial response to
      stem cell mobilization via AMD3100 as well as pregnancy outcomes.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients planning to undergo a frozen-thawed embryo transfer cycle using a single
             euploid blastocyst.

          2. Patients who have previously undergone at least 2 unsuccessful frozen-thawed embryo
             transfer cycles, defined as failure to achieve a clinical pregnancy (visualization of
             intrauterine gestational sac on ultrasound) or a cancelled embryo transfer cycle due
             to inadequate endometrial thickness.

             thickness) during at least one prior unsuccessful embryo transfer cycle.

             thin endometrial lining must have occurred after January 1, 2017.
