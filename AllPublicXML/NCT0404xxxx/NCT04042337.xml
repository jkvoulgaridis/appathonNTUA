  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is an urgent need for improved access to effective autism treatments. With advances in
      technology, distance learning models have particular promise for families who cannot access
      evidence-based parent training locally or may be on long wait-lists for behavioral
      treatments. Pivotal Response Treatment (PRT) is an established treatment for autism spectrum
      disorder (ASD); however, a telehealth PRT model has not yet been evaluated in a controlled
      trial. This study will examine the effects of training parents in PRT via secure video
      conferencing and investigate 1) whether parents can learn via telehealth to deliver PRT in
      the home setting (PRT-T) and 2) whether their children will show greater improvement in
      functional communication skills compared to children in a waitlist control group.
      Participants will include 40 children age 2 to 5 years with ASD and significant language
      delay. Eligible children will be randomly assigned to either PRT-T (N=20) or waiting list
      (N=20). Weekly 60-minute parent training sessions will be delivered for 12 weeks via secure
      video conferencing software by a PRT-trained study therapist. The effects of PRT-T on parent
      fidelity of PRT implementation, child communication deficits including frequency of
      functional verbal utterances, and parent-report of communication skills on standardized
      questionnaires will be evaluated. This research will provide a foundation for wider
      dissemination of technology-based solutions to improve access to ASD treatment.

        Inclusion Criteria: Participants will include children ages a) 2:0 to 5:11 years, b)
        diagnosed with ASD (based on history, review of available medical records including
        diagnostic testing, e.g., ADOS) or suspicion of ASD diagnosis and confirmed with Autism
        Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R; completed by phone), c) with significant adaptive
        communication deficits (i.e., either a Vineland-3 Communication subscale 2SD below average
        for 2 and 3 year olds and 3 SD below for 4 and 5 year olds or a Vineland-3 Expressive
        V-scale Score 2 SD below average for 2 and 3 year olds, or 3 SD below for 4 and 5 year old,
        and at least moderate severity on the CGI-S language subscale), d) able to vocalize with
        communicative intent during home video observation, e) stable treatment for at least 2
        weeks prior to baseline (e.g., ABA, special education) with no more than 60 minutes per
        week 1:1 speech therapy and no anticipated changes during study participation, and f) an
        English-speaking parent able to consistently participate in study procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria.

        a) children who have a primary language other than English, b) parent or child diagnosed
        with severe psychiatric disorder or unstable medical problem, c) child participating in &gt;15
        hours per week of 1:1 ABA treatment at home, and d) parents without computer/internet
        access, e) unstable medical condition such as severe seizures, or f) Severe behavioral
        difficulties (e.g., self-injury or aggression that could present a safety risk to the child
        or family members during implementation of the intervention), g) previous adequate trial of
        pivotal response treatment.
