    <textblock>
      the main purpose of the present study was threefold: (1) to describe the thermographic
      response after radiation; (2) to investigate whether there was a significant temperature
      change over time and among the different radiation-dermatitis score; and (3) to test if
      temperature change could be used to predict the development of radiation-induced skin injury
      in the incipient stage.

    <textblock>
      Radiation skin injury (RSI) is a frequent adverse reaction reported encountered by patients
      undergoing radiotherapy, occurring in about 87%-95% of irradiated patients and is
      characterized by swelling, redness, pigmentation, ulceration, fibrosis, pain, warmth, burning
      and itching of the skin. RSI has an effect on the level of discomfort experienced and the
      quality of life of patients, and may require interfering with radiation schedule and complex
      surgical reconstruction especially when combined with molecular targeted therapy. However,
      evaluation of RSI is not straightforward. There is no standard instrument for objective
      clinical evaluation of the severity of radiation skin injury.

      Previous studies have shown that radiation leads to the development of cutaneous vasculature
      and generation of an inflammatory response, which will increased skin temperature. The skin
      temperature change due to laser or thermal injury has been measured in many studies with
      temperature and time as predictors of skin damage.

      The most frequent method of skin temperature measurement has been the Infrared thermography.
      Consequently, the changes in the difference of skin temperature (DST) may be used as an
      objective, quantitative, and functional surrogate measure to determine and predict RSI.

    <description>Measurements were taken during radiation and additionally two weeks after radiotherapy weekly. Temperature change was measured by thermal infrared imager (FLIR) for 4 test areas within the supraclavicular radiation field and on an opposite non-irradiated area, which was outlined using a specific software package (FLIR Systems 6.3.17227.1001).</description>

        Female patients with a pathologically proven breast cancer receiving three dimensional
        conformal radiated therapy followed by modified radical mastectomy were eligible for the
        study. Other inclusion criteria included: age ≥18 years, ECOG PS≤1, normal organ function,
        no prior radiotherapy, and no concurrent chemotherapy.

        Exclusion criteria were as follows: rash or unhealed wound in the radiation field,
        pregnancy or lactation, and the presence of connective tissue disorder. All the enrolled
