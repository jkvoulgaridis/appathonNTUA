      This study will evaluate the performance of the VIDAS® Interferon Gamma (IFN-γ) Release Assay
      (TB-IGRA) assay, which is intended for use as an aid in the diagnosis of tuberculosis
      infection. This study is designed to assess (1) the sensitivity of this assay, (2) its
      percent agreement with other diagnostic tests, (3) its measurement precision , and (4) any
      potential interference of the presence of other non-tuberculosis mycobacterial bacterial
      infections with this assay.

    <textblock>
      Tuberculosis (TB) infection is one of the top 10 causes of death in the world and the leading
      cause of death due to a single infectious agent. Millions of people are infected with TB each
      year which can pose significant economic and health care burdens on the global population.

      TB can infected the lungs (pulmonary TB) or other organs such as the brain, and kidneys
      (extra-pulmonary TB). When a person with pulmonary TB coughs or sneezes, water droplets
      containing M. tuberculosis are expelled into the air. Persons can become infected with TB
      when they inhale air containing these water droplets, however, not everyone infected with
      Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) becomes ill. Therefore two TB-related conditions exist:
      latent TB infection (LTBI) and TB disease.

      People with latent TB infection are not ill and do not present TB symptoms or have TB
      disease. The only sign of TB infection is a positive reaction to the tuberculin skin test or
      TB blood tests such as IGRA tests. People with latent TB infection are not contagious and
      cannot spread TB infection to others.

      Identification and treatment of LTBI can substantially reduce the risk of developing active
      disease. However, there is no diagnostic gold standard for LTBI. Two types of test are
      currently available for the identification of LTBI: the tuberculin skin test (TST) and the TB
      Interferon Gamma (IFN-γ) Release Assay (TB-IGRA). Evidence suggests that both TST and TB-IGRA
      are acceptable but not perfect because they detect indirect markers of Mtb exposure and
      indicate a cellular immune response to M. tuberculosis. TB-IGRAs have a number of advantages
      compared to TST which promote their progressive adoption in the clinical practice and in
      guidelines.
