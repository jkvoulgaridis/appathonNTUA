  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inhaled hydrogen gas (H2) has been shown to have significant protective effects on ischemic
      organs. Clinical trials abroad have shown promise that treatment of patients suffering from
      stroke, cardiac arrest, or heart attacks may benefit from inhaling hydrogen gas during the
      early recovery period.

      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and tolerability of inhaled hydrogen gas
      at the dose exposures required for a clinical efficacy study in healthy adult volunteers.

      Study design. Eight (8) healthy adult volunteers will be recruited from the greater Boston
      area for this study. Consenting participants will be admitted to the hospital and will
      undergo a series of screens (questionnaires, examination, tests) to ensure suitability to
      participate. Eligible and consenting participants will then undergo exposure to 2.4% H2 in
      medical air via high flow nasal cannula for either 24 (n=2), 48 (n=2) or 72 (n=4) hours.
      Patients will be screened for adverse effects as follows: vital signs every8 hours, nursing
      assessment of symptoms (codified based on the National Cancer Institute's Common Terminology
      Criteria for Adverse Events, CTCAE) every 8 hours, bedside spirometry daily, mini-mental
      state exam daily, physician physical exam daily, and serum testing (blood count, chemistry,
      liver and coagulation profile, venous blood gas) following exposure period.
