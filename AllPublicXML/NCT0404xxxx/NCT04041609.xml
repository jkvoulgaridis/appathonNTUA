      This is a Phase II, Randomized, Blinded, Sham Procedure-Controlled, Parallel-Group Trial to
      Evaluate the Efficacy, Safety and Tolerability of LYR-210 in Adult Subjects with Chronic
      Sinusitis.

      LYR-210 is a combination product comprised of a drug depot, which contains the
      anti-inflammatory medication mometasone furoate (MF) pre-loaded in a single use applicator.
      LYR-210 is intended to be placed bilaterally into the sino-nasal passages by an
      otolaryngologist. Once in place, each LYR-210 drug depot is designed to gradually deliver
      sustained topical doses of MF to the inflamed mucosal sinus tissue over 24 weeks.

    <measure>Change from Baseline (CFBL) in Chronic Sinusitis symptom scores at week 4</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>Participants score their CS symptoms on a 4-point scale as follows: 0 = absent symptoms (no sign/symptom evident), 1 = mild symptoms (sign/symptom present but minimal awareness; easily tolerated), 2 = moderate symptoms (definite awareness of sign/symptom that is bothersome but tolerable), 3 = severe symptoms (sign/symptom that is hard to tolerate; causes interference with activities of daily living and/or sleeping). The scores are summed and averaged over the proceeding 7 days; higher scores indicate higher severity of symptoms of CS.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To evaluate the effect of LYR-210 in improving CS disease-specific quality of life as per 22-item sino-nasal outcome test (SNOT-22) questionnaire for up to 24 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Participants score the severity of their symptoms and social/emotional consequences of CS on a 6-point scale: 0 = no problem, 1 = very mild problem, 2 = mild or slight problem, 3 = moderate problem, 4 = severe problem, 5 = problem as bad as it can be. The scores are summed in the range of 0-110; higher scores indicate higher severity of symptoms or social/emotional consequences of CS.</description>

    <measure>CFBL in imaging score at week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Each sinus is assigned a score based on the percentage of opacification as follows: 0 = 0%, 1 = 1% to 25%, 2 = 26% to 50%, 3 = 51% to 75%, 4 = 76 % to 99%, 5 = 100% or completely occluded. The ostiomeatal complex (OMC) is given a score of 0 to 2 as follows: 0 = completely patent, 1 = partially occluded, 2 = completely occluded. Each sinus pair has a bilateral score in the range of 0 to 10, and the OMC pair in the range of 0 to 4, and the total sum of all sinuses and OMCs in the range of 0-54. Higher scores indicate higher severity of sinus opacification.</description>
