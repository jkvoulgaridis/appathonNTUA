  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      20-40% of patients with NSCLC will develop brain metastases at some point during their course
      of disease. Osimertinib has demonstrated intracranial activity in EFGR mutated NSCLC with
      leptomeningeal disease in the phase 1 BLOOM study. Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is one of
      the standard local treatment for patients with limited number of brain metastases. Currently,
      it is unclear whether adding SRS to Osimertinib will result in superior intracranial disease
      control in patients with EGFR mutated NSCLC with brain metastases diagnosed de novo or
      developed while on first line EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) such as Erlotinib and
      Gefinitib.

      The aim of this study is to compare the effects of Osimertinib alone versus SRS plus
      Osimertinib on intra-cranial disease control in EGFR mutated NSCLC with brain metastases
      diagnosed or developed while on first line EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors.

                    -  Definite but small brain metastases not for SRS treatment due to size, as
                       per physician discretion, are included in the total

                    -  Equivocal small lesions are not included in the total
