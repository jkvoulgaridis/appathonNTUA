    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1/2, open-label study of AGEN1884 in combination with AGEN2034 in subjects
      with locally advanced, recurrent and/or metastatic solid tumors including cervical cancer.
      AGEN2034 is a novel, fully human monoclonal immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) antibody, designed to
      block program cell death-1 (PD-1). AGEN1884 is a novel, fully human monoclonal immunoglobulin
      G1 (IgG1) antibody, designed to block cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4).

    <textblock>
      The trial consists of 2 phases:

        -  Phase 1: Dose escalation

        -  Phase 2: Expansion in advanced cervical cancer

      Phase 1: Dose Escalation:

      The enrollment to the Phase 1 portion of the study is completed. The trial will consist of a
      3+3 dose escalation that will evaluate different combination dose levels (CDL) of AGEN1884
      and AGEN2034 in subjects with locally advanced, recurrent and/or metastatic solid tumors.

      Subjects may be enrolled to the following CDL cohorts:

        -  CDL1 - AGEN1884 1 mg/kg every 6 weeks + AGEN2034 1 mg/kg every 2 weeks (starting CDL)

        -  CDL2 - AGEN1884 1 mg/kg every 6 weeks + AGEN2034 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks (maximum planned
           CDL)

        -  CDL−1 - AGEN1884 0.3 mg/kg every 6 weeks + AGEN2034 1 mg/kg every 2 weeks (potential
           de-escalation CDL)

      Combination Dose Level 1 (CDL1) will be the first to be tested. Dose escalation will continue
      until the maximum planned CDL (CDL2) is shown to be safe or the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)
      is reached. The MTD is defined as the CDL below which ≥ 33% of subjects develop dose-limiting
      toxicities (DLT). The decision to escalate to the next cohort will be made by a Safety
      Monitoring Committee (SMC), based on safety assessments after all subjects of a cohort
      reached the end of the DLT observation period of 21 days. Should ≥2 DLTs be observed in CDL1,
      the SMC may open enrollment to CDL-1. The SMC will also select the CDL for Phase 2.

      Each subject will receive the combination treatment for a maximum of 24 months or until
      confirmed disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or any criterion for withdrawal from
      the trial or the investigational medicinal products (IMPs) occur. Subjects who do not
      complete the DLT observation period of 21 days after the first dose, for reasons other than a
      DLT will be replaced. Additional subjects will be backfilled, concurrently with the 3+3 dose
      escalation schema at the lower cleared CDL, to ensure that each cohort enrolls at least 10
      subjects. These additional subjects at each dose level will have the purpose of generating
      additional safety, PK, and receptor occupancy (RO) data, and will not undergo formal DLT
      observation.

      The SMC selected CDL2 (AGEN1884 1 mg/kg every 6 weeks + AGEN2034 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks) as
      the Recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D).

      Phase 2: Expansion in Select Tumors

      To further characterize safety and efficacy, the following expansion cohort will be enrolled:

      Advanced cervical cancer In Phase 2, the RP2D of AGEN2034 and AGEN1884 will be administered
      for a maximum of 2 years or until confirmed progression, unacceptable toxicity, or any
      criterion for stopping the study drugs or withdrawal from the trial occurs.

      For the Phase 2 portion of the trial, an Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) will be
      established to evaluate safety and efficacy and an IERC will be established to adjudicate
      tumor response.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        To be eligible for participation in this trial the subject must:

          1. Voluntarily agree to participate by giving written informed consent. (Participation in
             pharmacogenomics testing is optional.)

          2. Be ≥18 years of age.

          3. Diagnosis:

               1. Phase 1: Male or female having a histologically or cytologically confirmed
                  diagnosis of a locally advanced, recurrent, and/or metastatic solid tumor for
                  which no standard therapy is available or standard therapy has failed.

               2. Phase 2:

             I. Female having (1) a histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of squamous
             cell carcinoma, adenosquamous carcinoma, or adenocarcinoma of the cervix, and (2)
             locally advanced, recurrent, and/or metastatic disease at the time of enrollment.
             Histologic confirmation of the original primary tumor is required via pathology
             report.

             Note: The following cervical tumors are not eligible: minimal deviation/adenoma
             malignum, gastric type adenocarcinoma, clear cell carcinoma, and mesonephric
             carcinoma.

             II. Has cervical cancer and has relapsed after a platinum-based treatment (first line)
             regimen for locally advanced, recurrent, and/or metastatic disease; Note: Subjects who
             only received platinum-based chemotherapy concurrently with primary radiation (e.g.,
             weekly cisplatin) or adjuvant chemotherapy following completion of radiation therapy
             (e.g., paclitaxel and carboplatin for ≤ 4 cycles) and progressed within 6 months after
             treatment completion will be eligible as this systemic therapy will be considered
             first line.

          4. Measurable Disease

               1. Phase 1: Have objective evidence of disease; the presence of measurable disease
                  is not required.

               2. Phase 2: Have measurable disease on imaging based on RECIST version 1.1. Note:
                  Subjects must have at least one &quot;target lesion&quot; to be used to assess response, as
                  defined by RECIST version 1.1. Tumors within a previously irradiated field will
                  be designated as &quot;non-target&quot; lesions unless progression is documented, or a
                  biopsy is obtained to confirm persistence at least 90 days following completion
                  of radiation therapy.

             Note: Measurable disease by RECIST 1.1 must be confirmed by independent central
             radiologic review prior to first dose. Subjects without centrally confirmed measurable
             disease at baseline will not be eligible for this trial.

          5. Have a life expectancy of at least 3 months and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group
             (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1.

          6. Have adequate organ function as indicated by the following laboratory values:

               1. Adequate hematological function defined by absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1.5
                  x 109/L, platelet count ≥ 100 x 109/L, and hemoglobin

                  ≥ 8 g/dL (without transfusions within 1 week of first dose).

               2. Adequate hepatic function based on a total bilirubin level &lt; 1.5 x the
                  institutional upper limit of normal (IULN), aspartate aminotransferase (AST)
                  level ≤ 2.5 x IULN, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level ≤ 2.5 x IULN, and
                  alkaline phosphatase ≤ 2.5 IULN.

               3. Adequate renal function defined as creatinine ≤ 1.5 x IULN OR calculated
                  creatinine clearance ≥ 50 mL/min for subjects with creatinine levels &gt; 1.5 x IULN
                  (if no local guideline is available, creatinine clearance should be calculated
                  using the Cockcroft-Gault Method).

               4. Adequate coagulation defined by international normalized ratio (INR) or
                  prothrombin time ≤ 1.5 x IULN (unless the subject is receiving anticoagulant
                  therapy); and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) ≤ 1.5 x IULN (unless
                  the subject is receiving anticoagulant therapy)

          7. Other than the cancer for which the subject is enrolled, have no history of prior
             malignancy, with the exception of basal cell carcinoma of the skin, superficial
             bladder cancer, squamous-cell carcinoma of the skin, or has undergone potentially
             curative therapy with no evidence of that disease recurrence for 5 years since
             initiation of that therapy.

             Note: In Phase 2, the history and time requirement for no evidence of disease for 5
             years does not apply to the cancer for which the subject is enrolled in the trial.

          8. In Phase 2, subjects must provide a sufficient and adequate formalin fixed paraffin
             embedded (FFPE) tumor tissue sample preferably from the most recent biopsy of a tumor
             lesion, collected either at the time of or after the diagnosis of locally advanced,
             recurrent, and/or metastatic disease has been made AND from a site not previously
             irradiated. If no tumor tissue is available, a fresh biopsy will be required.

             Note: Tissue from needle or excisional biopsy or from resection is required.

          9. Female subjects must have a negative serum pregnancy test at screening (within 72
             hours of first dose of study drug) if of childbearing potential or be of non-
             childbearing potential. Non-childbearing potential is defined as (by other than
             medical reasons):

               1. ≥45 years of age and has not had menses for greater than 1 year,

               2. Amenorrheic for ≥ 2 years without a hysterectomy and oophorectomy and a
                  follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) value in the postmenopausal range upon
                  pretrial (screening) evaluation,

               3. Whose status is post hysterectomy, oophorectomy, or tubal ligation.

         10. If of childbearing potential, female subjects must be willing to use 2 highly
             effective contraceptive measures (defined in the informed consent form [ICF])
             throughout the study, starting with the screening visit through 120 days after the
             last dose of study drug.

             Note: Abstinence is acceptable if this is the established and preferred contraception
             for the subject.

         11. Male subjects with a female partner(s) of childbearing potential must agree to use 2
             highly effective contraceptive measures (defined in the ICF) throughout the trial
             starting with the screening visit through 120 days after the last dose of study drug
             is received. Males with pregnant partners must agree to use a condom; no additional
             method of contraception is required for the pregnant partner.

             Note: Abstinence is acceptable if this is the established and preferred contraception
             for the subject.

         12. Is willing and able to comply with the requirements of the protocol.

        Exclusion Criteria

        The subject must be excluded from participating in the trial if the subject:

          1. Is currently participating and receiving trial therapy or has participated in a study
             of an investigational agent and received study therapy or used an investigational
             device within 4 weeks of the first dose of treatment.

          2. Has an inadequate washout period prior to first dose of study drug defined as:

                  within 6 months of completing chemotherapy concurrent with primary radiation or
                  adjuvant chemotherapy after radiation will only be considered as having 1 prior
                  systemic regimen for the purpose of this criterion.

             Note: In Phase 1, prior treatment with a CTLA-4 antibody is permissible for subjects

             and/or a premedication for intravenous (IV) contrast allergies/reactions is allowed).
             Subjects who are receiving daily corticosteroid replacement therapy are an exception
             to this rule. Examples of permitted therapy are daily prednisone at doses of 5 to 7.5
             mg or equivalent hydrocortisone dose, and steroid therapy administered by topical,
             intraocular, intranasal, and/or inhalation routes.

          8. Has a central nervous system (CNS) tumor, metastasis(es), and/or carcinomatous
             meningitis identified either on the baseline brain imaging obtained during the
             screening period OR identified prior to consent.

             Note: Subjects with history of brain metastases that have been treated may participate
             provided they show evidence of stable supra-tentorial lesions at screening (based on 2
             sets of brain images performed ≥ 4 weeks apart, and obtained after the brain
             metastases treatment). In addition, any neurologic symptoms that developed either as a
             result of the brain metastases or their treatment must have resolved or be minimal and
             be expected as sequelae from treated lesions. For individuals who received steroids as
             part of brain metastases treatment, steroids must be discontinued ≥ 7 days prior to
             first dose of study drug.

          9. Has active or history of autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment
             within 2 years of the start of study treatment (i.e. with use of disease modifying
             agents, corticosteroids, or immunosuppressive drugs). Replacement therapy (i.e.,
             thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or
             pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a form of immunosuppressive systemic
             treatment.

             Note: Subjects with diabetes type 1, vitiligo, psoriasis, hypo-, or hyperthyroid
             disease not requiring immunosuppressive treatment are eligible.

         10. Has had an allogeneic tissue/solid organ transplant.

         11. Has or had interstitial lung disease (ILD) OR has had a history of pneumonitis that
             has required oral or IV corticosteroids.

         12. Has an active infection requiring IV systemic therapy.

         13. Has known history of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) (HIV 1/2 antibodies).

         14. Has known active Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, or tuberculosis. Active Hepatitis B is
             defined as a known positive HBsAg result. Active Hepatitis C is defined by a known
             positive Hep C Ab result and known quantitative HCV RNA results greater than the lower
             limits of detection of the assay.

         15. Has clinically significant (i.e., active) cardiovascular disease: cerebral vascular
             accident/stroke or myocardial infarction within 6 months of enrollment, unstable
             angina, congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association class ≥II), or serious
             uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia requiring medication.

         16. Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality
             that might confound the results of the study, interfere with the subject's
             participation for the full duration of the study, or is not in the best interest of
             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.

         17. Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with
             cooperation with the requirements of the trial.

         18. Is, at the time of signing informed consent, a regular user (including &quot;recreational
             use&quot;) of any illicit drugs or had a recent history (within the last year) of substance
             abuse (including alcohol).

         19. Is legally incapacitated or has limited legal capacity.

         20. Is pregnant or breastfeeding or expecting to conceive or father children within the
             projected duration of the trial, starting with the screening visit through 120 days
             after the last dose of AGEN2034 and/or AGEN1884.
