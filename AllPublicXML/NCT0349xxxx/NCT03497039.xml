  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the exposure of diclofenac in the plasma and in the
      knee joint following topical administration of DDEA gel 4 gram (g) applied twice daily for 7
      days.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be performed in Participants diagnosed with OA of the knee who are scheduled
      for arthroplasty of the knee as a treatment for their OA.

      Approximately fifty (50) male and female OA participants, who, at the time of screening, are
      â‰¥50 years old, will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio: two thirds will receive DDEA gel treatment
      and one third placebo gel.After providing informed consent to participate in the study the
      participants will need to forego any non-steroidal anti inflammatory drug (NSAID) or
      cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 treatment for at least 7 days prior to starting study treatment (Visit
      2) to allow wash-out of existing therapy and thus avoiding confounding the effect of the
      study treatments.

      There will be 4 study center visits as follows:

      Visit 1 Screening visit: Day -7 (Window: Day-10 to Day-7) Visit 2 Baseline (randomization)
      visit: Morning of Day 1 Visit 3 Hospital admittance through to surgery and post-surgery:
      Evening of Day 7 through Day 8 (Surgery may be delayed by up to 7 days) Visit 4 Final visit:
      Day 8 to Day 10 (Between recovery and discharge)

      The Participants will be provided paracetamol as rescue medication, to be used up to a total
      daily dose of 4 gram (g). Rescue medication will be available from the Screening Visit (Day
      -7) through to end of Day 7. Should the need arise for additional pain relief, the
      investigators will be allowed to prescribe codeine or tramadol. Postoperative analgesia will
      be handled according to the surgical center's pain management procedures.

             use a highly effective method of contraception throughout the study and for at least
             21 days after the last dose of assigned treatment. Female participants who are not of
             childbearing potential must meet following requirements: Female participants who are
             of childbearing potential and are sexually active and at risk for pregnancy must agree
             to use a highly effective method of contraception consistently and correctly for the
             duration of the active study period (onwards from screening) and for at least 21 days

             participant the need to use highly effective contraception consistently and correctly
             according to the schedule of activities and document such conversation in the
             participant's chart. In addition, the investigator or his or her designee will
             instruct the participant to call immediately if the selected contraception method is
             discontinued or if pregnancy is known or suspected in the participant.

        Highly effective methods of contraception are those that, alone or in combination, result
        in a failure rate of less than 1% per year when used consistently and correctly (i.e.,
        perfect use) and include the following: 1) Established use of oral, inserted, injected,
        transdermal, or implanted hormonal methods of contraception is allowed provided the
        participant plans to remain on the same treatment throughout the entire study and has been
        using that hormonal contraceptive for an adequate period of time to ensure effectiveness as
        deemed appropriate by the investigator, 2) Correctly placed copper-containing intrauterine
        device (IUD), 3) Male condom or female condom used with a spermicide (i.e., foam, gel,
        film, cream, or suppository), 4) Male sterilization with absence of sperm in the
        post-vasectomy ejaculate, 5) Bilateral tubal ligation / bilateral salpingectomy or
        bilateral tubal occlusive procedure (provided that occlusion has been confirmed in
        accordance with the device's label), 6)Female who meets the criteria for non-childbearing
        potential as described below. Female participants of non-childbearing potential must meet
        at least one of the following criteria: a) Achieved postmenopausal status, defined as
        follows: cessation of regular menses for at least 12 consecutive months with no alternative
        pathological or physiological cause; status may be confirmed by a serum
        follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) level confirming the post-menopausal state, b) Have
        undergone a documented hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy, c) Have medically
        confirmed ovarian failure.

        All other female participants (including females with tubal ligations) will be considered
        to be of childbearing potential e) Screen Failures: Screen failures are defined as
        participants who consent to participate in the clinical study but are not subsequently
        randomized. In order to ensure transparent reporting of screen failure participants, a
        minimal set of screen failure information will include screening number, date of screening,
        demography (gender, year of birth, age), screen failure details (e.g., withdrawal of
        consent), eligibility criteria, and any serious adverse events. Screening failures will be
        replaced in the recruitment schedule until the required number of participants are
        randomized. Individuals who do not meet the criteria for participation in this study
        (screen failure) may not be re-screened, f) Sponsor's Qualified Medical Personnel: The
        contact information for the sponsor's appropriately qualified medical personnel for the
        study is documented in the study contact list located in the supporting study
        documentation. The contact number can be used by investigational staff if they are seeking
        advice on medical questions or problems; however, it should be used only in the event that
        the established communication pathways between the investigational site and the study team
        are not available. It is therefore intended to augment, but not replace, the established
        communication pathways between the investigational site and the study team for advice on
        medical questions or problems that may arise during the study. The contact number is not
        intended for use by the participant directly, and if a participant calls that number, he or
        she will be directed back to the investigational site. To facilitate access to
        appropriately qualified medical personnel on study-related medical questions or problems,
        participants are provided with a contact card. The contact card contains, at a minimum,
        protocol identifiers, participant study numbers, contact information for the
        investigational site, and contact details in the event that the investigational site staff
        cannot be reached to provide advice on a medical question or problem identified from the
        participant's healthcare professional other than the investigator.

          -  Use of prescription or nonprescription drugs (unless deemed necessary by
             investigator), NSAIDs, COX-2 inhibitors and dietary supplements within 7 days or 5
             half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of study treatment and during
             the study. Specifically if, during the washout period or the treatment period, the
             participant is unwilling to avoid the use of any topical or systemic analgesic or
             anti-inflammatory treatments other than the study medication, the rescue medication,
             and if needed codeine or tramadol.

          -  Use of one or more of the following treatments prior to the screening visit or between
             screening and baseline visit: a) any topical NSAID treatment between screening and
             baseline visit, b) any intra-articular or peri-articular procedures or injections in
             either knee within the previous 3 months, c) any systemic treatment with
             corticosteroids within the previous 6 weeks (topical treatments with corticosteroids
             not related to either knee are permitted up to screening visit), d) any
             chondroprotectant or disease-modifying OA drugs, such as glucosamine or chondroitin
             sulfate, unless dose was stable over the previous month and will be maintained
             throughout the study, e) any systemic anti-inflammatory or analgesic drugs at
             screening if 5 times their elimination halftime exceeds 7 days (i.e., if half-life &gt;
             33.6 hrs), f) anticoagulants such as warfarin or heparin in the preceding week or
             antiaggregants within the previous month other than aspirin at stable low doses
             started at least one month before randomization and kept at a constant dose throughout
             the study or anticoagulant therapy for surgery, g) any other investigational drugs
             within the previous month or 5 half lives preceding the first dose of investigational
             product (whichever is longer).

          -  A positive urine drug screen during Screening (Day -7).

          -  Any condition possibly affecting drug absorption (e.g., gastrectomy).

          -  History of regular alcohol consumption exceeding 14 drinks/week (1 drink = 5 ounces
             (150 mL) of wine or 12 ounces (360 mL) of beer or 1.5 ounces (45 mL) of hard liquor)
             within 6 months of Screening.

        <title>Diclofenac Concentration in Treated Knee Synovial Tissue After 7 Days Topical Application of Study Treatment to the Knee (12 Hours After Last Administration of Study Treatment)</title>
        <description>Synovial tissue was collected during surgery (participant's scheduled arthroplasty of the target knee on which study treatment was applied). Samples were analyzed for diclofenac levels using a validated bio analytical method in compliance with the applicable standard operating procedures of the bioanalytical laboratory. Synovial tissue diclofenac concentration was summarized by treatment group. Number of participants with diclofenac concentration values that were below the limit of quantification (LOQ) were replaced by 0 for placebo group. The geometric mean was calculated with a two-sided 95% confidence interval assuming data on the logarithmic scale were normally distributed.</description>

        <title>Diclofenac Concentration in Treated Knee Synovial Fluid After 7 Days Topical Application of Study Treatment to the Knee (12 Hours After Last Administration of Study Treatment)</title>
        <description>Synovial fluid was collected during surgery (participant's scheduled arthroplasty of the target knee on which study treatment was applied). Samples were analyzed for diclofenac levels using a validated bio analytical method in compliance with the applicable standard operating procedures of the bioanalytical laboratory. Synovial fluid diclofenac concentration was summarized by treatment group. Number of participants with diclofenac concentration values that were below the LOQ were replaced by 0 for placebo group. The geometric mean was calculated with a two-sided 95% confidence interval assuming data on the logarithmic scale were normally distributed.</description>
