  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II single-arm, single-site, open label clinical trial with r/r HL patients,
      aimed to determine whether a RadVax approach using low-dose RT added to nivolumab can improve
      response among patients who do not achieve a CR to nivolumab alone. The long-term goal is to
      develop an effective regimen for r/r HL patients.

    <textblock>
      Nivolumab 3 mg/kg will be administered on day 1 (pre-response assessment week 0) and on day 1
      and continued per standard of care and institutional practices. At the week 1 biomarker
      collection, research FDG PET/CT will be performed to assess for FDG &quot;flare.&quot; At week 8-12,
      PET/CT will be performed for the first response assessment. If a complete anatomic response
      is seen, nivolumab monotherapy will be continued on day 1 and continued per standard of care
      and institutional practices.

      By contrast, if at week 8 less than a complete anatomic response is seen, radiotherapy to 4
      Gy x 2 fractions will be administered (post-response assessment week 0). The patient will be
      evaluated by a radiation oncologist while on treatment, and toxicities will be recorded.
      Nivolumab will be continued on day 1 and continued per standard of care and institutional
      practices.

      In either scenario, a second response assessment will be conducted ~8-12 weeks after the
      first response assessment. In either scenario, nivolumab monotherapy will be continued at the
      discretion of the treating medical oncologist.

      If there is less than CR post-RT and there is an additional untreated non-target lesion that
      can be followed, radiotherapy can again be administered when disease progresses to a
      previously untreated lesion, after which the patient will continue on the post-RT follow-up
      algorithm.

    <description>Subjects will receive initial treatment with the immunomodulatory agent, nivolumab, followed by low-dose (4 Gy x 2) involved-site radiotherapy in subjects with less than an anatomic CR after the first restaging scan. Patients with anatomic CR will continue nivolumab alone without radiotherapy. Eligible patients will have r/r disease with at least 2 sites of measurable disease, and must be eligible for treatment with nivolumab.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Pathologically confirmed Hodgkin lymphoma for whom nivolumab is clinically indicated.

          -  Relapsed/refractory disease.

          -  ≥2 sites of measurable disease, at least one outside of intended RT fields.

          -  Age ≥ 18 years.

          -  ECOG performance status of 0-2.

          -  Standard laboratory criteria for hematologic, and biochemical, and urinary indices
             within a range that, in the opinion of the physician, clinically supports enrollment
             of the subject on the trial.

          -  Patients of reproductive potential must agree to use an effective contraceptive method
             during participation in this trial.

          -  Ability to provide written informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with contraindications to immune checkpoint therapy, as follows:

          -  Interstitial lung disease that is symptomatic or may interfere with the detection and
             management of suspected drug-related pulmonary toxicity.

          -  Prior organ allograft or allogeneic bone marrow transplantation.

          -  Subjects with contraindications to immune checkpoint therapy, as follows:

          -  Interstitial lung disease that is symptomatic or may interfere with the detection and
             management of suspected drug-related pulmonary toxicity.

          -  Prior organ allograft or allogeneic bone marrow transplantation.

             atopic dermatitis, or endocrinopathies manageable by hormone replacement; other
             autoimmune conditions may be allowable at the discretion of the principal
             investigator.

          -  Systemic steroids at physiologic doses (equivalent to dose of oral prednisone 10 mg)
             are permitted. Steroids as anti-emetics for chemotherapy are strongly discouraged
