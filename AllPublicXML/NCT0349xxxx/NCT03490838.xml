    <textblock>
      This Phase 1/2 study is intended to investigate the safety, tolerability, and radiation
      dosimetry of 177Lu-PSMA-R2 and further assess preliminary efficacy data in patients with
      metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). The Phase 1 portion of the study
      will determine the recommended dose of 177Lu-PSMA-R2 for radio-ligand therapy (RLT) of mCRPC,
      and the Phase 2 portion will expand into approximately 60 patients documenting the
      preliminary activity (anti-tumor response) of repeated treatments administered, continuing
      safety assessments and collecting QoL data.
