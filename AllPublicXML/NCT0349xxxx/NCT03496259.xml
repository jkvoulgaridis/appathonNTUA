  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Open abdominal and pelvic surgery or thoracotomy (open chest surgery) is frequently performed
      for tumor excision in children. Post-operative pain management regimens are often at the
      discretions of the attending surgeon and may include opiods, patient administered analgesia
      (PCA), epidural catheters, subcutaneous analgesia catheters or NSAIDS to control incisional
      pain. Currently, both epidural or subcutaneous analgesia catheters (On-Q pumps) are commonly
      used for children undergoing these operations, at the discretion of the surgeon. There are no
      studies comparing these regimens in children. The purpose of this study is to compare
      postoperative pain control of the two strategies.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study design is a randomized, controlled trial to compare the effectiveness of on-q pump
      subcutaneous incisional analgesia to epidural analgesia for postoperative pain relief in
      children undergoing open abdominal, thoracic, or pelvic operations for oncologic purposes.
      The patient and treating team will be blinded to the pain control device. The primary outcome
      is additional narcotic usage for 3 post-operative days, and secondary outcomes are pain
      scores for 3 post-operative days, post-surgical day of ambulation, time to regular diet,
      infectious complications (UTI, wound infection or pneumonia), and hospital length of stay.
      Outcomes from both groups will be directly compared in order to determine whether one
      strategy provides more effective pain control with less complications than the other, or
      whether they are equivalent.
