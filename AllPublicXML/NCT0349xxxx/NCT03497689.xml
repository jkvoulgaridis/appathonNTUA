  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label study to evaluate the dose of Orenitram® (treprostinil)
      Extended Release Tablets achieved at 16 weeks after a short-term course of Remodulin®
      (treprostinil) Injection in subjects with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will be initiated on subcutaneous (SC) or intravenous (IV) treprostinil and titrated
      to a dose that improves the symptoms of PAH while minimizing excessive pharmacologic effects.
      After achieving a minimum SC/IV treprostinil dose of 20 ng/kg/min, subjects may begin a
      transition to oral treprostinil at the Transition Visit, which can occur at the Week 2, 4, or
      8 study visit. After the Transition Visit, oral treprostinil titration will continue through
      Week 16 to reach the maximum tolerated dose.
