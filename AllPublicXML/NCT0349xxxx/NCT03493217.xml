  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The phase I/II clinical study is to investigate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of
      ICP-022 in R/R CLL/SLL patients.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Part I: Safety evaluation -2 regimens of ICP-022 (High and low dose QD) are designed for
      safety assessment. The recommended dose of phase II clinical study will be determined
      according to the Part I results.

      Part II: Dose expansion -Anti-tumor effects of ICP-022 in Chinese patients with R/R CLL/SLL
      will be evaluated in approximately 80 subjects. The recommended Phase 2 dose will be used in
      the Part II.
