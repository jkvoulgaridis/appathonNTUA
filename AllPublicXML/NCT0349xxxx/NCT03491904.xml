  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to demonstrate that the auto-injector(AI) is suitable to be used to
      administer fasinumab at home by patients or their caregivers, as measured by collecting 12
      weeks of actual-use data on the technical performance of the device.

      The secondary objectives of the study are:

        -  To evaluate the successful injection of fasinumab by patients or their caregivers using
           the AI in an unsupervised setting

        -  To evaluate patient/caregiver satisfaction with the AI for fasinumab injection in an
           unsupervised setting

        -  To evaluate exposure in serum for fasinumab administered by patients or their caregivers
           using an AI in an unsupervised setting, or fasinumab administered by study staff using a
           PFS that has been used in the phase 3 program

        -  To characterize the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of fasinumab administered
           by patients or their caregivers using an AI in an unsupervised setting, or fasinumab
           administered by study staff using a PFS that has been used in the phase 3 program
