  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well pembrolizumab works in treating patients with B-cell
      non-Hodgkin lymphoproliferative diseases that have not been treated. Immunotherapy with
      monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the
      cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats
      every 3 weeks for up to 18 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days and then up to 5
      years.
