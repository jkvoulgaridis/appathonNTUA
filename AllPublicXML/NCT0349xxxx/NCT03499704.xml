    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the pioglitazone plus alogliptin plus metformin is
      non-inferior to dapagliflozin plus alogliptin plus metformin on glycosylated haemoglobin
      (HbA1c) change from baseline at Week 52.

    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is Alogliptin Benzoate and Pioglitazone Hydrochloride
      FDC. This study will assess the efficacy of pioglitazone or dapagliflozin in participants
      with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

      The study will enroll approximately 232 participants. Participants will be randomly assigned
      (by chance, like flipping a coin) to one of the two treatment groups.

        -  Pioglitazone 15 mg + Alogliptin 25 mg + Metformin &gt;=500 mg

        -  Dapagliflozin 10 mg + Alogliptin 25 mg + Metformin &gt;=500 mg

      Based on investigators opinion at Week 12, if participant has HbA1c &gt;=7.5%, dose of
      pioglitazone can be titrated up to 30 mg.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in Republic of Korea. The overall time to
      participate in this study is 55 weeks. Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic,
      and will be contacted by telephone 14 days after their last dose of drug for a follow-up
      assessment.

             randomization. Strong Cytochrome P450 2C8 (CYP2C8) inhibitors (example, gemfibrozil,

             the opinion of the Investigator or Sponsor require treatment contraindicated during

             enzyme (ACE) -inhibitors and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are to be
