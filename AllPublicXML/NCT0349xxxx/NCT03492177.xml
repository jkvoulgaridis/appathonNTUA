  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Selexipag is available for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) in adults
      in various countries. The efficacy of selexipag to delay disease progression was shown in a
      previous pivotal study conducted in 1156 adult patients with PAH. Given the similarities in
      the functional changes of PAH in children and adults, it is expected that children suffering
      from PAH could benefit from treatment with selexipag. The aim of the present study is to
      confirm the doses of selexipag to be used in pediatric patients with PAH older than 2 years.
      To fulfill this aim, blood levels of selexipag (pharmacokinetic assessments) as well as the
      safety, and tolerability of selexipag in children with PAH will be assessed.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The selection of the starting dose for pediatric patients is based on the pharmacokinetic
      (PK) extrapolation from adults, taking into account the children body weight category, in
      order to lead to an exposure similar to that in adult PAH patients at a starting dose of 200
      microgram (μg). As in adults, selexipag will be up-titrated to the individual maximum
      tolerated dose (iMTD) during the first 12 weeks.

      Approximately 55 subjects will be enrolled in 3 different age cohorts to obtain at least 40
      subjects with evaluable PK profiles: Cohort 1: ≥ 12 to &lt; 18 years of age, Cohort 2: ≥ 6 to &lt;
      12 years of age, Cohort 3: ≥ 2 to &lt; 6 years of age. In each age cohort the starting dose will
      depend on the body weight. Enrollment will start with both Cohort 1 and Cohort 2. After
      completion of PK assessments in at least 15 subjects from Cohort 1 at Week 12, a first
      interim analysis will be conducted to establish the dose-exposure relationship using a
      population PK model.

      Results of this model-based analysis will be used to confirm or adjust the selexipag doses
      initially selected. Enrollment of Cohort 3 (children ≥ 2 to &lt; 6 years of age) will start once
      the appropriate doses have been confirmed in a second interim analysis of PK data from
      Cohorts 1 and 2, and if there is no safety concern based on review by an Independent Data
      Monitoring Committee (IDMC).

    <description>The first dose of selexipag (Uptravi) will be administered in the evening of Day 1 and will be based on the body weight. Thereafter selexipag will be administered twice daily (morning and evening). Selexipag will be up-titrated during the first 12 weeks, with weekly increments equal to the starting dose until the subjects reach their individual maximum tolerated dose (iMTD) or until a maximum dose corresponding to their baseline weight category is achieved (which will be 8-fold of the corresponding starting dose). Up-titration is followed by a stable maintenance treatment period from Week 12 to Week 16, at the maximum tolerated dose. Thereafter, subjects will be treated with selexipag as long as the treatment is beneficial to the subject, as per investigator's decision</description>
