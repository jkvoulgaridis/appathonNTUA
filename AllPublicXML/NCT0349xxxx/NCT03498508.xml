  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Theoretical knowledge of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is the foundation of being able
      to perform CPR in a cardiac arrest situation. The knowledge and skills received in training
      is easily lost and after one year the level is equal to pretraining. International studies
      regarding knowledge of CPR among healthcare professionals, mostly nurses, show poor results.
      The knowledge of CPR among Swedish healthcare professionals is poorly studied.

      The aim of this study was to describe the theoretical knowledge of CPR and self-assessed
      abilities of performing CPR among healthcare professionals working in four hospitals in
      Sweden.

      A questionnaire will be handed out containing a knowledge test of nine questions at a basic
      level. The questionnaire also contains Likert-scales that measures four self-assessed CPR
      abilities of the respondents (the ability to take leadership, give compressions, to ventilate
      and to defibrillate).

    <description>Four self-assessed CPR-skills among 3044 respondents measured on a Likert scale of 1-7 will be measured and described. The skills are the ability to take leadership, give chest compressions, to ventilate and to defibrillate. The dependent variable consisting of a factor score of self-assessed abilities will be analyzed with independent variables such as profession, years in profession, workplace and time since last CPR-training.</description>
