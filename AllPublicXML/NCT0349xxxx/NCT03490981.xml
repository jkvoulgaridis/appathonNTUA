  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To address the gap in treatment options for Veterans with chronic pain in primary care, the
      investigators have developed an abbreviated version of cognitive behavioral therapy, Brief
      Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Chronic Pain (Brief CBT-CP), specifically for use in
      integrated care settings. The first objective of the proposed study is to conduct a pilot
      randomized controlled trial of Brief CBT-CP compared to primary care treatment as usual to
      assess feasibility (i.e., recruitment and retention of participants, appropriateness of
      measures, and assessment of fidelity of service delivery). This trial will also preliminarily
      assess treatment effectiveness by examining changes in pain-related physical interference,
      psychological distress, pain intensity, and other related outcomes. Thirty eligible
      participants will be randomized into either Brief CBT-CP and primary care treatment as usual
      or primary care treatment as usual only. Eligible Veterans will include those with chronic
      musculoskeletal pain and pain-related functional impairment identified from primary care.
      Participants assigned to Brief CBT-CP will receive six weekly sessions of treatment in
      30-minute appointments. This intervention will include education and goal setting, activities
      and pacing, relaxation skills, cognitive coping, and relapse prevention. Assessments will
      include validated self-report measures that will take place at pre-treatment (baseline),
      post-treatment, and at 12-week follow-up. The second objective of this study will be to
      explore patient and provider perceptions of Brief CBT-CP to identify potential modifications
      that will improve its quality and overall feasibility of delivery in future work.
      Participants will include up to 12 staff members as well as up to 12 patients who were
      randomized to Brief CBT-CP. Participants will be interviewed by telephone about key
      components of the treatment. Participants will comment on the protocol and study procedures
      in terms of acceptability (the perception that a treatment is agreeable or that its specific
      components are satisfactory), appropriateness (the perceived fit or compatibility of the
      intervention for a given provider or consumer), and feasibility (the extent to which a new
      treatment can be successfully carried out or is suitable for everyday use). This intervention
      has been designed specifically for integrated care providers and therefore has clear
      implications for translation to clinical practice and for improving pain care quality by
      providing an evidence-based protocol. The potential direct benefit to Veterans includes
      offering a safe, accessible, non-pharmacological treatment for chronic pain early in the
      trajectory of VA care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We will recruit 30 Veterans from the primary care clinics located at the Buffalo VAMC in
      Buffalo, NY. Thirty eligible participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio into either (1)
      Brief CBT-CP plus TAU or (2) TAU only. We will engage in recruitment during the second
      quarter of Year 1 through the end of the first quarter of Year 2. We aim to recruit and
      enroll 7-8 participants per quarter during that time frame. Post-treatment follow-up will be
      conducted at eight weeks and at 12 weeks. Two recruitment methods will be used. Veterans with
      chronic musculoskeletal pain who self-report functional impairment will be referred by their
      PACT, in response to a recruitment flyer posted in primary care, or by contacting the PI or
      study staff directly after hearing of the study by word of mouth or other sources. This
      approach will be supplemented by a case-finding procedure in which study staff review
      electronic medical record data to identify potential patients, who will be subsequently
      contacted by letter and screened by telephone. Following telephone screening, potentially
      eligible participants will complete a baseline assessment to assess pain and related
      characteristics as well as remaining exclusion criteria. Those passing baseline measures will
      be randomized to (1) Brief CBT-CP plus TAU or (2) TAU only. Assignment to Brief CBT-CP will
      be stratified based on degree of pain interference.

      Brief CBT-CP is a manualized protocol that includes six, 30-minute sessions over the course
      of 6 weeks. Brief CBT-CP session outlines and patient handouts are included in the appendix.
      Session one focuses on foundational pain education and the development of treatment goals.
      Session two emphasizes balanced engagement in physical activity and pleasurable events.
      Session three emphasizes skills training for easily implemented relaxation techniques.
      Sessions four and five focus on recognizing and modifying unhelpful thoughts that negatively
      impact pain. Session six focuses on relapse prevention and independent implementation of
      CBT-CP skills following treatment. Brief CBT-CP will be delivered by a masters-level
      interventionist either at the Buffalo VA Medical Center or by telephone depending on the
      preference of the participant.

      Participants assigned to TAU only will receive standard medical care from their primary care
      provider including pain medications, brief advice (e.g., use of relative rest, application of
      heat or ice, other self-care strategies), or referral to pain-related adjunctive
      interventions (e.g., physical therapy), as indicated. Participants in TAU only will not
      receive behavioral intervention from the primary care clinic behavioral health provider.

      We will conduct brief interviews with up to 24 purposefully selected participants (i.e., 12
      VA providers and 12 patients). The VA provider group will include 6 primary care providers
      and 6 behavioral health providers I providers who staff VA primary care clinics. Interview
      items are based on implementation constructs relevant for early stage intervention
      development: acceptability (or agreeableness and satisfaction with treatment components),
      appropriateness (or perceived fit/compatibility of the intervention), and feasibility (or
      whether the intervention is suitable for use.) Up to 12 patients who were randomized to Brief
      CBT-CP will be asked to complete a 30-minute interviews (i.e., telephone or face-to-face,
      depending on participant preference) following their 12-week assessment (as described in the
      consent procedures prior to the trial). We will include participants who completed all study
      procedures but will also attempt to include those who discontinued Brief CBT-CP.
