  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      Immunotherapy drugs help the body to fight cancer. Scientists think that combining some of
      these drugs will make them work better than when used alone. This may be true for many types
      of cancer, including castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC).

      Objective:

      To test if the combination of the drugs BN-brachyury, M7824, ALT-803, and Epacadostat is safe
      and shrinks tumors.

      Eligibility:

      People ages 18 and older with CRPC or another metastatic cancer

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with:

        -  Medical history

        -  Physical exam

        -  CT or MRI scans

        -  Possible bone imaging

        -  Blood, urine, and heart tests

        -  Possible tumor biopsy

      Participants will be treated with a 2-, 3- or 4-drug combinations of the following study
      drugs in 2-week cycles:

        -  Participants will receive M7824 by IV once every 2 weeks.

        -  Participants will receive ALT-803 by injection once every 2 weeks. They will record any
           skin changes at the injection site in a diary.

        -  Participants will receive BN-brachyury as 4 injections to different limbs. They will get
           the first 3 doses 2 weeks apart. Then they will get doses every 4 weeks for 6 months,
           then every 3 months for 2 years, then every 6 months.

        -  Participants will take Epacadostat orally every 12 hours. They will keep a pill diary.

      Participants will have physical exams and blood and urine tests at the start of each cycle.
      They may have scans every 12 weeks.

      Participants will continue treatment until their disease gets worse or they cannot tolerate
      the side effects.

      Participants will have a follow-up visit 4-5 weeks after they stop treatment. They will have
      a physical exam and blood tests. They may be asked to return for scans every 3 months.

      Background:

        -  PD-1/PD-L1 signaling appears to be a major inhibitor of activated T cell anti-tumor
           immune responses. The rapid, deep and durable responses seen in various malignancies
           with PD-1/PD-L1 targeted agents demonstrate that blockade of this axis is key to
           facilitating immune responses within the tumor microenvironment (TME).

        -  Prostate cancer is poorly recognized by T cells. Lack of an immune response is one
           explanation for the lower response rates (&lt;15%) observed with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapies
           for prostate cancer.

        -  Increasing response rates will likely require therapeutic nullification of multiple
           immune deficits by combining immunotherapies that generate tumor-specific T cells
           (vaccine), dampen the inhibitory milieu of the TME, and enhance T and NK cell activity
           within the TME.

        -  A quick efficacy seeking trial, utilizing sequential arms offers a means to identify
           signals of activity for combinations of immunotherapy, added sequentially, in castration
           resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) patients.

        -  BN-Brachyury is a novel recombinant vector-based therapeutic cancer vaccine designed to
           induce an enhanced immune response against brachyury, which is overexpressed in many
           solid tumor types, including prostate adenocarcinoma. BN-Brachyury collectively refers
           to the priming doses (MVA-BN-Brachyury) and the boost doses (FPV-Brachyury) of the
           vaccine platform.

        -  M7824 is a bifunctional fusion protein consisting of an anti-programmed death ligand 1
           (PD-L1) antibody and the extracellular domain of transforming growth factor beta (TGF-
           beta) receptor type 2, a TGF-beta trap. M7824 can also mediate antibody-dependent
           cellular cytotoxicity in vitro.

        -  ALT-803 is an IL-15/IL-15R alpha superagonist complex that can enhance NK cell mediated
           ADCC and T-cell cytotoxicity.

        -  Synergistic anti-tumor effects have been observed in vitro when combining M7824 and
           ALT-803, and in vivo when combining these agents with tumor vaccine in animal models.

        -  IDO1 is overexpressed in many solid tumors and can contribute to immune escape by tumor
           cells. INCB024360 (Epacadostat) is an IDO1 inhibitor under investigation in combination
           with different immunotherapies in treatment of various malignancies.

        -  In treating of CRPC, we hypothesize that these agents and their effects will be
           complementary. Tumor-specific T cells generated by vaccine may become more functional in
           a TME following treatment with M7824 and Epacadostat. ALT-803 can further enhance the
           activity of antigen-specific T cells as well as NK cells.

      Objective:

      -To determine if there is clinical benefit to any of a set of 3 possible treatments for
      patients with CRPC:

        -  BN-Brachyury + M7824

        -  BN-Brachyury + M7824 + ALT-803

        -  BN-Brachyury + M7824 + ALT-803 + Epacadostat

      Eligibility:

        -  Adults with histologically proven CRPC, or metastatic solid tumor of any type for which
           there is no standard treatment or standard treatment has failed.

        -  Adequate organ function as defined by liver, kidney, and hematologic laboratory testing.

        -  Patients with acquired immune defects, active systemic autoimmune disease, history of
           organ transplant, history of chronic infections, or history of active inflammatory bowel
           disease are excluded.

      Design:

      Open label Phase I/II trial with following randomization during the expansion.

      Phase I: Cohort 1, Arm 1.1

      - Up to 18 patients with any solid tumor will be enrolled in dose escalation Cohort 1 for
      treatment in Arm 1.1 (flat dose of M7824 + different dose levels of ALT-803).

      Phase IIA: expansion with sequential enrollment into Cohort 2A, Arms 2.1A, 2.2BA. and 2.3 AC

        -  Concurrently with the enrollment to Arm 1.1, 13 patients with CRPC will start enrollment
           in Cohort 2A for treatment in Arm 2.1A (M7824 + BN-Brachyury).

        -  When safe dosing of ALT-803 is identified during Phase I, 13 patients have enrolled in
           arm 2.1A and the first 6 patients, treated in Arm 2.1A, have met safety requirements, 13
           patients with CRPC will start enrollment in Cohort 2A for treatment in Arm 2.2A (M7824 +
           BN-Brachyury + ALT-803).

        -  When 13 patients have enrolled in Arm 2.2A and the first 6 patients, treated in Arm
           2.2A,have met safety requirements, 13 patients with CRPC will start enrollment in Cohort
           2A for treatment in Arm 2.3A (M7824 + BN-Brachyury + ALT-803 + Epacadostat).

      Phase IIB: expansion with randomized enrollment into Cohorts 2D and 2R, Arms 2.1B, 2.2B. and
      2.3B

        -  Each Arm in Cohorts 2D and 2R: 2.1B, 2.2B and 2.3B will be open for additional
           enrollment (25 evaluable patients total) when the initial 13 patients have accrued,
           safety requirements are meet and a positive signal (defined as Objective Response by
           RECIST 1.1 or sustained PSA decrease &gt;= 30% sustained for &gt; 21 days) in &gt;= 2 patients is
           shown.

        -  If only one arm is open for additional enrollment, patients will be directly assigned to
           this arm. If 2 arms are open for additional enrollment, patients will be randomized
           between these 2 open arms. If 3 arms are open for additional enrollment, patients will
           be randomized among these 3 open arms.

      If there are &gt;= 6 of 25 patients with a positive signal of activity in any expansion arm,
      that arm will be considered of interest for future studies.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed any solid tumor (Cohort 1) or
        castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC, Cohorts 2A, 2D and 2R). No prior treatment
        other than testosterone lowering therapy for CRPC is required.

        For the Cohort 1, eligible patients must have a histologically, cytologically or

        there is no curative standard therapy or standard therapy has failed.

        Castrate testosterone level (less than 50ng/dl or 1.7nmol /L). (Patients with a malignancy
        other than prostate cancer are excluded from this criterion).

        Radiological confirmation of metastatic disease, or

        Progressive disease at study entry defined as one or more of the following criteria
        occurring in the setting of castrate levels of testosterone:

        --Radiographic progression defined as any new or enlarging bone lesions or growing lymph
        node disease, consistent with prostate cancer

        OR

        --PSA progression defined by sequence of rising values separated by greater than 1 week

        (2 separate increasing values over a minimum of 1 ng/ml (PCWG3 PSA eligibility criteria).
        If patients had been on flutamide, PSA progression is documented 4 weeks or more after
        withdrawal. For patients on bicalutamide or nilutamide disease progression is documented 6
        or more weeks after withdrawal. The requirement for a 4-6 week withdrawal period following
        discontinuation of flutamide, nilutamide or bicalutamide only applies to patients who have
        been on these drugs for at least the prior 6 months. For all other patients they must stop
        bicalutamide, nilutamide or flutamide the day prior to enrollment.

        Asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic form prostate cancer; no use of regularly scheduled
        opiate analgesics for prostate cancer-related pain. (Patients with a malignancy other than
        prostate cancer are excluded from this criterion).

        Gilbert s, less than or equal to 3.0 mg/dL

          -  AST (AGOT)/ALT (AGPT) less than or equal to 2.5X upper limit of normal. For subjects
             with liver involvement in their tumor, AST less than or equal to 3.5. (SqrRoot) ULN,
             ALT less than or equal to 3.5 (SqrRoot) ULN, and bilirubin less than or equal to 3.0
             is acceptable

          -  Creatinine within 1.5X upper limit of normal institutional limits

        The effects of BN-Brachyury, M7824, ALT-803, and Epacadostat on the developing human fetus
        are unknown. For this reason, men and women must agree to use adequate contraception
        (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry, during the
        study and maintain such contraception until 4 months following the last dose of any study
        agent. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner
        is participating in this study, she should inform her partner s treating physician
        immediately.

        Ability of subject to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent
        document.

        Patients with successfully treated HCV are eligible if HCV viral load is undetectable.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Patients who are immunocompromised as follows:

          -  Human immunodeficiency virus positivity due to the potential for decreased tolerance,
             and potential to be at risk for severe side effects with immunotherapies. These
             concerns are relevant to all drugs, as drug-drug interactions among antiretrovirals
             and immunotherapies are yet uncharacterized.

          -  Chronic administration (defined as daily or every other day for continued use greater
             than 14 days) of systemic corticosteroids or other immune suppressive drugs, within 28
             days before treatment on study. Nasal, or inhaled steroid, topical steroid creams and
             eye drops for small body areas are allowed.

          -  Patients who have undergone allogeneic peripheral stem cell transplantation, or solid
             organ transplantation requiring immunosuppression

               -  Active autoimmune disease, except patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus,
                  vitiligo, psoriasis, hypo- or hyperthyroid disease not requiring current
                  immunosuppression, or with other endocrine disorders on replacement hormones or
                  are not excluded if the condition is well controlled.

        Prostate cancer patients with a history of brain/leptomeningeal metastasis, since these
        patients have a very poor prognosis and immunotherapy may take time to lead to beneficial
        clinical effects. Patients with brain or CNS metastases enrolling to arm 1.1 are eligible
        if they are status post definitive radiotherapy or surgery, and are asymptomatic

        History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
        composition to study agents to be used in the cohort the subject will be enrolled into.

        Known allergy to eggs, egg products, aminoglycoside antibiotics (for example, gentamicin or
        tobramycin).

        Any condition which, in the opinion of the investigator, would prevent full participation
        in this trial (including the long-term follow-up), or would interfere with the evaluation
        of the trial endpoints.

        Patients with prior investigational drug, chemotherapy, immunotherapy or any prior
        radiotherapy (except for palliative bone directed therapy) within the past 28 days prior to
        enrollment, except if the investigator has assessed that all residual treatment-related
        toxicities have resolved or are minimal and feel the patient is otherwise suitable for
        enrollment.

        Uncontrolled intercurrent acute or chronic illness including, but not limited to, ongoing
        or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure (&gt;New York Heart Association
        Class I), hepatic disease, unstable angina pectoris, serious cardiac arrhythmia, requiring
        medication, uncontrolled hypertension (SBP&gt;170/ DBP&gt;105) or psychiatric illness/social
        situations within 12 months that would limit compliance with study requirements.

        Use of herbal products that may decrease PSA levels (e.g. saw palmetto)

        Patients who have had cytotoxic chemotherapy for metastatic castration-resistant prostate
        cancer within the past year. (Patients who have had docetaxel for metastatic castration
        sensitive per CHAARTED data may enroll as long as they did not have progressive disease
        while on docetaxel and are 3 months removed from treatment, with all treatment related
        toxicities resolving to at least grade 1.)

        Patients who have undergone major surgery within 4 weeks of enrollment. A biopsy will not
        preclude a patient from starting study.

        Patients with a history of hepatitis B (HBV) are excluded due to potential risk for viral
        reactivation and resulting liver injury in persons with latent HBV

        For Patients enrolling in Arm 2.3A and for patients who may be randomized to Arm 2.3B, the
        following additional exclusion critiera will apply:

          -  Subjects receiving Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs) or a drug which has
             significant MAOI activity (meperidine, linezolid, methylene blue) within the 21 days
             before initiation of study therapy are excluded.

          -  Since epacadostat s metabolism may be altered by drugs that inhibit UDP-
             glucuronosyltransferase UGT1A9 (see Appendix D), Patients receiving such drugs within
             21 days of initiation of study therapy are excluded.

          -  Subjects receiving coumarin-based anticoagulants (eg. Coumadin) are excluded.

          -  Subjects having any history of Serotonin Syndrome (SS) after receiving serotonergic
             drugs are excluded.

             --Patients with a QTc interval &gt; 480 milliseconds (B or F) at the screening are
             excluded. In the event that a single QTc (B or F) is &gt; 480 milliseconds, the subject
             may enroll if the average QTc for the 3 ECGs is &lt; 480 milliseconds (for both the QTcB
             and QTcF). For subjects with an intraventricular conduction delay (QRS interval &gt; 120
             milliseconds), the JTc interval may be used in place of the QTc. The JTc must be &lt; 340
             milliseconds if JTc is used in place of the QTc. QTc prolongation due to pacemaker may
             enroll if the JTc is normal.

          -  Subjects with left bundle branch block are excluded.

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because investigational agents used in
             this study (BN-Brachyury, M7824, ALT-803, and/or Epacadostat) could have teratogenic
             or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse
             events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with these
             investigational agen s, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated
             with either of them.
