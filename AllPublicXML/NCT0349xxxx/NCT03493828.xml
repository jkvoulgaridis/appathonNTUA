  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      TAP Block was done using 2 different concentrations of bupivacaine (0.5% and 0.25%) and
      placebo and the post operative sedation was measured in each arm and compared together.

    <description>Following completion of the Cesarean delivery, the abdomen was aseptically prepped with ChloraPrep®. A Sonosite ultrasound machine (S-nerve) with a 14-8 MHz linear probe was used to visualize the lateral abdominal wall muscles and transversus abdominis plane. A 2 or 4 inch stimuplex (Braun) needle was advanced under ultrasound guidance to the transversus abdominis plane. After negative aspiration, 15 ml of Bupivacaine 0.5% was incrementally injected on each side. The spread of solution within the transversus abdominis plane was visualized with the ultrasound.</description>
