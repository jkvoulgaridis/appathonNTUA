  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gambling craving is involved in the development, maintenance and relapse of gambling
      disorder. Yet, it lacks research regarding evidence-based interventions available to mitigate
      craving in patients displaying gambling disorder. The elaborated intrusion theory of desire
      (EIT) is a cognitive model of craving which offers important avenues for the development of
      psychological interventions, as it clearly describes the processes at play in craving
      experiences (e.g., mental imageries, working memory). Recent research evidenced that the
      elaborated intrusion theory is relevant to account for gambling craving experiences.
      According to this model, craving (and desire) is the result of an elaboration process where
      &quot;desires thoughts&quot; (mental images and thoughts), induced by internal (e.g., frustration)
      and/or external (e.g., advertisement) triggers, require attentional and cognitive resources.
      The principle of interference-based techniques is to move the resources allocated to the
      elaboration of intrusive desire thoughts to a competing task (e.g., clay modelling,
      competitive mental imagery, Tetris) in order to monopolize the resources underlying craving,
      thus preventing its elaboration and reducing its vividness and overwhelming nature. Several
      studies have shown the efficacy of such techniques to reduce substance-related craving. Yet,
      data obtained on clinical samples remain scarce.

      Preliminary data have been obtained prior to this application. In order to investigate the
      relevance of interference-based techniques, an experimental study was conducted in community
      gamblers. In two conditions (19 gamblers per condition), gambling craving was first induced
      via a short mental imagery session and a computer-generated gambling simulation task. Then,
      the experimental group was asked to perform an interference task consisting of creating a
      vivid mental image of a bunch of keys. The control group completed a task in which they had
      to pop and count bubble wrap. The analyses revealed that induced craving decreases
      significantly in both groups. However, participants that are considered problem gamblers
      showed a greater decrease of their craving in the experimental condition. This previous
      &quot;proof of principle&quot; study supports that interference-based techniques are potentially
      promising interventions to reduce craving in problem gambling. It also warrants further
      research as no data is available in clinical population.

      The current project consists in a pilot study aiming to test the efficacy of
      interference-based techniques in a sample of gambling disorder patients. The investigators
      decided to adopt a multiple single case design, as this methodology is ideal in the sense
      that it helps to understand the whole process of an interference-based intervention among a
      small number (10) of outpatients with a gambling disorder, without control group. Ecological
      Momentary Assessment will be used to allow intervention no naturally occuring craving. In
      addition to be easily implementable in a clinical design, this design will provide sufficient
      evidences before possibly, in a second time, further validation of these techniques using a
      randomized-control trial.

    <description>The principle of interference-based techniques is to move the resources allocated to the elaboration of intrusive desire thoughts to a competing task (e.g., clay modelling, competitive mental imagery, Tetris) in order to monopolize the resources underlying craving, thus preventing its elaboration and reducing its vividness and overwhelming nature. Several studies (Andrade, Pears, May, &amp; Kavanagh, 2012; May, Andrade, Panabokke, &amp; Kavanagh, 2010; Skorka-Brown, Andrade, Whalley, &amp; May, 2015) have shown the efficacy of such techniques to reduce substance-related craving. Yet, data obtained on clinical samples remain scarce.
Due to the flexibility of the single case design towards each participant, the list of interference-based techniques that will be used in this study cannot be exhaustive. However, the following will be proposed to participants: Tetris (smartphone version), manipulation of a bunch of keys, manipulation of a fidget, mental imagery, reading and memorizing a text.</description>
