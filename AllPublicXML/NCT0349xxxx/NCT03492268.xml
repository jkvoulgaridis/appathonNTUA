      This trial aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of BCMA-CART in treating patients with
      relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      BCMA(B-Cell maturation antigen) is a tumor antigen of multiple myeloma . Using a genetic
      engineering strategy to assemble an anti-BCMA CAR(chimeric antigen receptor) in autologous T
      cells will help these CART cells to recognize and kill BCMA-expressing MM tumor cells. This
      trial aims to evaluate the safety and anti-tumor efficacy of autologous BCMA-CART in treating
      relapsed or treatment refractory multiple myeloma.
