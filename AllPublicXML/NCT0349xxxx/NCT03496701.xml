  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to determine if habitual or adapted wearers of stenfilcon A sphere
      contact lenses can be refit into test lenses and be successful after one week of daily wear.

      This study is a 80-subjects, prospective, multi-center, open label, bilateral, daily wear,
      one week dispensing study comparing performance of wearers of stenfilcon A sphere contact

          -  Is willing and anticipated to follow instructions and maintain the appointment
             schedule

          -  Habitually wears soft spherical contact lenses with a power between -1.00D to -6.00D
             (inclusive) for a minimum 5 days per week, 10 hours per day and anticipates no
             difficulty wearing contact lenses for 7 days per week, 10 hours per day.

          -  Habitually wears or is able to be adequately refit into MyDay Sphere lenses

          -  Demonstrates an acceptable fit with the study lenses

          -  Is correctable to a distance visual acuity of 0.20 logMAR (approximately 20/30) or
             better (in each eye) with the study contact lenses

          -  Uses digital devices, (e.g. computer, tablet, smart phone, iPad), for more than 4
             hours a day, 5 days a week.

          -  Manifest cylindrical spectacle refraction does not exceed -0.75DC in either eye

          -  Has clear corneas and no active ocular disease

          -  Has a contact lens refraction that fits within the available parameters of the study
             lenses.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        A person will be excluded from the study if he/she:

             may affect the study measures.

          -  Presents with slit lamp findings or clinically significant anterior segment
             abnormalities that would contraindicate contact lens wear such as:

          -  Has aphakia, keratoconus or a highly irregular cornea.

          -  Has presbyopia or has dependence on spectacles for near work over the contact lenses.

          -  Has undergone refractive surgery.

          -  Is pregnant, lactating or planning a pregnancy (by verbal communication) at the time
             of enrollment

          -  Has participated in any other type of eye related clinical or research study within
             the last 7 days

          -  Is habitually using rewetting/ lubricating eye drops (more than once per day)
