  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single institution, prospective observational clinical trial for women with
      mammographically identified calcifications that may represent ductal carcinoma in situ
      (DCIS).

      The purpose of this study is to determine whether quantitative, multiparametric breast MRI
      performed prior to surgical resection can biologically characterize this common pre-invasive
      malignancy, ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), which typically presents in asymptomatic women
      as suspicious calcifications on mammography.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will assess whether MRI signatures can determine which calcifications
      identified prior to surgical resection actually harbor DCIS, and whether these imaging
      features correlate with pathologic markers of proliferation (Ki-67) and inflammation (cox-2)
      within DCIS lesions.

      The investigators will also explore whether quantitative MRI features in the peri-tumoral
      region correlate with prognostic microenvironment markers of inflammation (TNFÎ±) and
      angiogenesis (VEGF). Finally, investigators will assess whether a multivariate model using
      these markers can accurately predict risk of recurrence based on a multi-gene assay (Oncotype
      DX DCIS score).

        Women aged 18 or older with suspicious mammographic caclifications or biopsy-proven DCIS
        with residual calcifications present on mammogram after biopsy. Study participants will
        undergo an experimental 3 Tesla breast MRI prior to surgical resection, including both DWI
        and DCE techniques. Only participants who are diagnosed with pure DCIS on both core needle
        biopsy and surgical resection will remain on study. Tissue from all DCIS lesions will also
        be sent for outside multi-gene assay testing (Oncotype DX DCIS score, Genomic Health,
        Redwood City, CA).
