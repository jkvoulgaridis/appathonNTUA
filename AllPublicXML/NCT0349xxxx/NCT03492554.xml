      The purpose of the study is to confirm the software's ability to create a Lead-1
      electrocardiogram (ECG) that is clinically equivalent to a reference device. Also, to confirm
      a rhythm classification algorithm and its ability to detect and classify heart rhythms into
      two categories (Sinus Rhythm or Atrial Fibrillation) using a single Lead ECG.
