    <textblock>
      This trial studies how well cycling works in preventing colorectal cancer in participants
      with Lynch syndrome. Exercise such as cycling may reduce colorectal cancer risk in
      participants with Lynch syndrome.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the feasibility of a 12-month exercise cycling intervention among Lynch syndrome
      (LS) patients.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the effect size of exercise on circulating biomarkers as well as regulation of
      genomic, transcriptomic, and immunologic biomarkers in normal intestinal mucosa of LS
      patients.

      OUTLINE: Participants are assigned to 1 of 2 groups.

      GROUP I: Starting on day 15, participants wear FITBIT and complete cycling classes over 45
      minutes 3 times a week for a total of 12 classes a month for up to 1 year.

      GROUP II: Starting on day 15, participants receive information about exercise guidelines and
      wear FITBIT to track heart rate and activities for up to 1 year.

      After completion of study interventions, participants are followed up at 30 days.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants must have Lynch syndrome defined as meeting any of the following: (1)
             Mutation-positive Lynch syndrome: carriers or obligate carriers (by pedigree) of a
             pathogenic mutation in one of the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) mismatch repair (MMR)
             genes (i.e. MLH1, MSH2/EPCAM, MSH6, or PMS2) or (2) Mutation-negative Lynch syndrome:
             patients with a personal history of a non-sporadic MMR deficient premalignant lesion
             (i.e. polyp) or a non sporadic MMR deficient malignant tumor (where non-sporadic MMR
             deficient is defined by: microsatellite instability high by either
             immunohistochemistry or microsatellite instability (MSI) testing or both, but no
             evidence of MLH1 promoter methylation in cases with loss of both MLH1 and PMS2, and/or
             no evidence of BRAF mutation in cases with loss of both MLH1 and PMS2) but germline
             MMR genetic testing showed either a variant of unknown significance or mutation
             negative result or had declined germline MMR genetic testing.

          -  Participants must not have evidence of active/recurrent malignant disease for a
             minimum of 6 months.

          -  Participants must be at least 6 months from any prior cancer-directed treatment (such
             as surgical resection, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, hormonal therapy or radiation).

          -  Participants must have endoscopically accessible distal colon and/or rectal mucosa
             (i.e. participants must have at least part of the descending/sigmoid colon and/or
             rectum intact).

          -  Participants must consent to two standard of care lower gastro-intestinal GI endoscopy
             (flexible sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy) with biopsies that will be 12 months (+/-21
             days) apart.

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.

          -  Must have normal cardiopulmonary exercise test prior to exercise participation.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Individuals who are status post total proctocolectomy (i.e. removal of all colon and
             rectum).

          -  Individuals with history of myocardial infarction, stroke, coronary-artery bypass
             draft, invasive coronary revascularization, arrhythmia requiring treatment such as
             atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, pulmonary
             embolism, or deep venous thrombosis.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, uncontrolled hypertension, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable
             angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that
             would limit compliance with study requirements.

          -  Individuals with a history of diabetes, hypertension, or have smoked cigarettes in the
             last 12 months.

          -  Individuals who are unable to participate in cycling due to musculoskeletal
             limitations.

          -  Individuals who are unable to identify cycling classes in their community for
             exercise.
