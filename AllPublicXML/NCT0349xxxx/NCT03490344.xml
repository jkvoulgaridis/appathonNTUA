    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the safety of short course Daratumumab in combination
      with lenalidomide and to find out what effects, if any, short course Daratumumab in
      combination with lenalidomide has on people and their risk of multiple myeloma. The study is
      also designed to test the amount of remaining myeloma cells in your body after treatment with
      daratumumab which is known as minimal residual disease (MRD).

          -  Additionally, patients who were previously MRD negative after induction therapy
             with/without consolidative HDT/ASCT and have turned MRD positive (by flow cytometry)
             based on bone marrow done at screening and do not have any evidence of progressive
             disease are eligible

             cervix carcinoma) except if the patient has been free of symptoms and without active
             therapy during at least 5 years

          -  Active hepatitis B or C infection

          -  Subject is:

               -  seropositive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
