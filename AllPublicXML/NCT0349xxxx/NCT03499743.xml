  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many oral analgesic drugs such as the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) are used to
      relieve pain from gynaecological procedures and dysmenorrhea. Hyoscine-N-butyl bromide, an
      antispasmodic drug is commonly used for relief of smooth muscle spasms and can be used to
      alleviate genito-urinary spasm. Some studies reported hyoscine couldn't relieve pain in minor
      gynaecological procedures. So the efficacy of Hyoscine-N-butyl bromide use is still
      controversial, and no previous studies investigated its effectiveness for pain relief in IUD
      insertion procedure.

      The study objective is to compare the effectiveness and side effects of oral Celecoxib 200mg
      versus oral hyoscine butyl bromide 10 mg in reducing pain associated with IUD insertion. the
      study is an attempt to find the most effective drug with the least possible side effects to
      be used before IUD insertion.

    <time_frame>during IUD insertion</time_frame>
    <description>the visual analog scale (VAS ) pain score reported by participants during IUD insertion.Pain scores will be measured using a visual analogue scale (VAS) consisting of a 10 cm horizontal straight line on which 0 cm corresponds to no pain and 10 cm to the worst pain. VAS is rated as 0 for no pain, 1-3 for mild pain, 4-6 for average pain, and 7-9 for severe pain and 10 for extremely severe pain an individual can experience.A research assistant standing beside the woman will hold the VAS sheet for the participant to select the point that corresponds to the level of pain she will experience.</description>
