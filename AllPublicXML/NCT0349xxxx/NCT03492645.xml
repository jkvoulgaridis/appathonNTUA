  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the proposed project is to design and assess the acceptability and usability of a
      mobile technology and telephone-facilitated treatment to improve treatment engagement in
      adult smokers with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Smokers with PTSD face high rates of
      treatment failure and require tailored strategies that address both PTSD symptoms and smoking
      urges. McFall and Saxon designed a protocol combining office-based therapy plus
      evidence-based pharmacotherapies for smoking cessation that doubled quit rates in veteran
      smokers with PTSD. However, high rates of attrition limited efficacy. The investigators aim
      to enhance scalability and engagement in the McFall/ Saxon protocol by (1) adapting the
      treatment to be delivered over the video or telephone and (2) leveraging innovations in
      technology by incorporating a mobile application targeting PTSD and smoking and a mobile
      carbon monoxide (CO) monitor into the protocol. The investigators propose a mixed methods
      study in which the investigators will adapt the office-based treatment into a technology and
      telephone-facilitated intervention and conduct a pilot RCT of the modified intervention with
      20 veterans with PTSD. At the outset of the study, the study team will modify the original
      treatment manual in order for it to be delivered via video or telephone. The investigators
      will then conduct a pilot RCT in which 20 veterans with PTSD will be randomized to receive
      the modified protocol (intervention condition; n=10) or the original office-based protocol
      (control condition, n=10). Main outcomes are quantitative and qualitative data about the
      acceptability of the intervention and its individual components, and treatment retention at
      Week 8. Secondary outcomes are 7-day bioverified point-prevalence cigarette abstinence, PTSD
      symptoms, and levels of nicotine dependence at follow-up. Results will inform a larger RCT to
      examine efficacy of the intervention in promoting quit attempts in smokers with PTSD.

    <measure>System Usability Scale (SUS) for iCO monitor and Stay Quit Coach (SQC) App</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The SUS is a brief, reliable and valid instrument to measure perceptions of usability of technology devices. Items are rated on a scale from 0-5. An SUS total score is calculated by summing item ratings, and then multiplied the sum by 2.5. The maximum score on the SUS is 100, with higher scores reflecting greater usability. We will administer the SUS to the intervention condition only. Mean usability score will be reported.</description>

    <measure>Acceptability questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>Participants (in the intervention condition only) will complete a questionnaire developed by our team to rate the intervention protocol from 1-10 in terms of perceived helpfulness, understandability, and likelihood of use. The mean score (i.e., average of item ratings) will be reported for the participants in the intervention condition. Higher scores represent greater acceptability.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Client Satisfaction Questionnaire-8</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The CSQ-8 is an eight-item instrument designed to measure satisfaction with an clinical intervention. Items are rated on a scale from 1-4 and summed to for an CSQ-8 total score. Scores range from 8-32, with higher scores indicating greater satisfaction. We will administer the CSQ-8 to the intervention condition only. Mean satisfaction score will be reported.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>PTSD Checklist (PCL-5)</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 0 &amp; 8</time_frame>
    <description>The PCL-5 is a 20-item self-report measure that assesses the severity of the twenty DSM-V symptoms of PTSD. Items are rated on a 1-5 scale and summed to compute a total score, with higher scores representing greater severity of PTSD symptoms. This outcome variable will be reported as the difference in PCL-5 total score between the experimental treatment condition and the control condition.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of cigarettes smoked</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 0 &amp; 8</time_frame>
    <description>Self-reported use of cigarettes will be assessed with TLFB (past 30 days), which uses a calendar with specific anchor dates to identify the quantity and frequency of use. This outcome variable will be reported as the difference in cigarette use between the experimental treatment condition and the control condition.</description>

    <measure>Fagerstrom Test of Nicotine Dependence (FTND) scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 0 &amp; 8</time_frame>
    <description>The FTND is a validated, 6-item self-report instrument that evaluates the intensity of physical addiction to nicotine. Three items are rated yes/no (0/1), and the other three items are rated on a scale from 0-3. Items are summed to yield a total score of 0-10, with higher scores reflecting greater nicotine dependence. This outcome variable will be reported as the difference in FTND total score between the experimental treatment condition and the control condition.</description>

    <description>8 video or telephone counseling sessions targeting PTSD symptoms related to smoking lapse. The first of these sessions will last approximately 45-60 minutes, and the remaining 7 sessions will last 20-30 minutes.
Use of the Stay Quit Coach (SQC) app between sessions. SQC is a public domain, no-cost mobile app designed by our co-investigators at the National Center for PTSD to complement the IC protocol with evidence-based tools to support smoking cessation, such as motivational messaging and coping tools for managing PTSD symptoms associated with smoking lapse.
Use of the Covita Bedfont iCO Smokerlyzer, a mobile carbon monoxide (CO) monitor, compatible with iOS and Android smartphones, that provides CO readings to the user at any time in order to self-monitor progress in quitting. The Covita iCO mobile app is used with the iCO Smoerlyzer to display CO readings.</description>
