  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is an open-label, single-arm, Phase I/II multi-center study to investigate the PK,
      activity and safety of ruxolitinib added to the patient's immunosuppressive regimen in
      infants, children, and adolescents ages ≥28 days to &lt;18 years old with either grade II-IV
      aGvHD or grade II-IV SR-aGvHD. This trial will utilize age groups: Group 1 includes patients
      ≥12y to &lt;18y, Group 2 includes patients ≥6y to &lt;12y, Group 3 includes patients ≥2y to &lt;6y,
      and Group 4 includes patients ≥28days to &lt;2y.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female patients age ≥28 days and &lt;18 years at the time of informed consent.

          -  Patients who have undergone alloSCT from any donor source (matched unrelated donor,
             sibling, haplo-identical) using bone marrow, peripheral blood stem cells, or cord
             blood. Recipients of myeloablative or reduced intensity conditioning are eligible.

          -  Patients with a clinically confirmed diagnosis of grades II-IV aGvHD within 48 hours
             prior to study treatment start. Patients may have either: Treatment-naïve aGvHD
             (criteria per Harris et al. 2016) OR Steroid refractory aGvHD as per institutional
             criteria, and the patient is currently receiving systemic corticosteroids.

          -  Evident myeloid engraftment with ANC &gt; 1,000/µl and platelet count &gt;20,000/µl. (Use of
             growth factor supplementation and transfusion support is allowed.)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Has received the following systemic therapy for aGvHD: a) Treatment-naïve aGvHD
             patients have received any prior systemic treatment of aGvHD except for a maximum 72h
             of prior systemic corticosteroid therapy of methylprednisolone or equivalent after the
             onset of acute GvHD. Patients are allowed to have received prior GvHD prophylaxis
             which is not counted as systemic treatment (as long as the prophylaxis was started
             prior to the diagnosis of aGvHD); OR b) SR-aGvHD patients have received two or more
             prior systemic treatments for aGvHD in addition to corticosteroids

          -  Clinical presentation resembling de novo chronic GvHD or GvHD overlap syndrome with
             both acute and chronic GvHD features (as defined by Jagasia et al 2015).

          -  Failed prior alloSCT within the past 6 months.

          -  Presence of relapsed primary malignancy, or who have been treated for relapse after
             the alloSCT was performed, or who may require rapid immune suppression withdrawal of
             immune suppression as pre-emergent treatment of early malignancy relapse.

          -  Acute GvHD occurring after non-scheduled donor leukocyte infusion (DLI) administered
             for pre-emptive treatment of malignancy recurrence. Note: Patients who have received a
             scheduled DLI as part of their transplant procedure and not for management of
             malignancy relapse are eligible.

          -  Any corticosteroid therapy for indications other than aGvHD at doses &gt; 1 mg/kg/day
             methylprednisolone (or equivalent prednisone dose 1.25 mg/kg/day) within 7 days of
             Screening. Routine corticosteroids administered during conditioning or cell infusion
             is allowed.

          -  Patients who received JAK inhibitor therapy for any indication after initiation of
             current alloSCT conditioning.

        Other protocol-defined Inclusion/Exclusion may apply.
