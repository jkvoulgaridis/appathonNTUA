    <textblock>
      This research is being done to evaluate the role of a regular skin care regimen comprising of
      a mild soap and moisturizer in improving dry skin and overall skin health. In this study, the
      investigators hope to learn the importance of regular skin care regimen in improving dry skin
      and overall skin health.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dry skin is a common phenomenon and can dramatically decrease a person's quality of life as
      well as contribute to a wide variety of skin diseases. Skin care products hydrate the skin
      and breaks the dry skin cycle. While there is extensive evidence of benefits of using mild
      cleansers and moisturizers, much of the previous studies are limited to the effects of single
      cleanser or moisturizer.

      In this study, the investigators are going to enroll up to 100 people over the age of 18 with
      dry, itchy skin and they will be split into 2 groups. Participants will be randomly assigned
      to skin care regimen group (approximately 75% of total enrolled) and control group
      (approximately 25% of total enrolled). All evaluation include clinical assessments, subject
      questionnaires and photography will be conducted similarly in both groups.

      Analysis will include paired and unpaired t-tests with two-tailed p-values. Values obtained
      at baseline, in middle of the study and after completing the study will be compared. The
      difference of measure values will be compared between application group and control group.

      The moisturizing lotion and wash are generally very well tolerated.Rarely, they can induce a
      burning sensation, dryness, skin irritation, erythema, stinging, sensitization, and
      dermatitis. Risk events, problems, and deviations will be reported by the PI directly to the
      Institutional Review Boards.

      The investigators hope to learn the importance of regular skin care regimen in improving dry
      skin and overall skin health.

    <measure>Change in Total Clinical Score (TCS) Between the Final Visit and Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluated by blinded investigator, consists of three section; erythema (0=no erythema; 4=fiery red with oedema), scaling(0=no scaling; 3=severe scaling), and fissures scored 0-3 (0=no fissure; 3=wide cracks with hemorrhage) yield total between 0 and 10. The evaluation will be done for four sites: both lower legs and both forearms.Total Body Score (TCS) is the sum of three symptoms, i.e., erythema (0 = no erythema, 1 = slight erythema, 2 = moderate uniform redness, 3 = intense redness, 4 = fiery red with edema), scaling (0 = no scaling, 1 = fine scaling, 2 = moderate scaling, 3 = severe scaling with large flakes), and fissure (0 = no crack/fissure, 1 = fine cracks, 2 = single or multiple broader fissures, 3 = wide cracks with hemorrhage or exudation). Thus, the TCS could range from 0 to 10, with the higher scores representing more severe condition.</description>

    <measure>Change in Visual Dryness 5-point Severity Score for Total Body Score Between the Final Visit and the Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Visual Dryness Severity (VDS) was evaluated by blinded investigator, scored on a 5-point scale (0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe, 4 = very severe, yield total between 0 and 4. The evaluation will be done for four sites: both lower legs and both forearms. Total body score is the sum of the four sites, ranging from 0 to 16 with the higher scores representing more severe dryness.</description>

    <measure>Change in Frequency of Itchy-specific Quality-of-life (ItchyQoL) Score Between the Final Visit and Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Self-reported itchy related quality of life questions. Total 22 items and each item is scored as frequency. Frequency items are scored on scale of 1-5 (1 = never, 2 = rarely, 3 = sometimes, 4 = often, 5 = all the time) by four measures : Symptom with score range (6-30), Function with score range (7-35), Emotion with score range(9-45) and Overall with score range(22-110). The higher score represents more severe condition.</description>

        <title>Change in Total Clinical Score (TCS) Between the Final Visit and Baseline</title>
        <description>Evaluated by blinded investigator, consists of three section; erythema (0=no erythema; 4=fiery red with oedema), scaling(0=no scaling; 3=severe scaling), and fissures scored 0-3 (0=no fissure; 3=wide cracks with hemorrhage) yield total between 0 and 10. The evaluation will be done for four sites: both lower legs and both forearms.Total Body Score (TCS) is the sum of three symptoms, i.e., erythema (0 = no erythema, 1 = slight erythema, 2 = moderate uniform redness, 3 = intense redness, 4 = fiery red with edema), scaling (0 = no scaling, 1 = fine scaling, 2 = moderate scaling, 3 = severe scaling with large flakes), and fissure (0 = no crack/fissure, 1 = fine cracks, 2 = single or multiple broader fissures, 3 = wide cracks with hemorrhage or exudation). Thus, the TCS could range from 0 to 10, with the higher scores representing more severe condition.</description>
