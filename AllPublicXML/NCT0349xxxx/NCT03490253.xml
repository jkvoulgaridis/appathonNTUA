  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main aim of the &quot;Diabetes and Mental Health Adaptive Notification Tracking and
      Evaluation&quot; trial (DIAMANTE) is to test a smartphone intervention that generates adaptive
      messaging, learning from daily patient data to personalize the timing and type of
      text-messages. We will compare the adaptive content to 1. a static messaging intervention
      with health management and educational messages and 2. a control condition that receives a
      weekly mood message. The primary outcomes for this aim will be improvements in physical
      activity at 6-month follow-up defined by daily step counts.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We utilized user-centered design (UCD) methods to iteratively develop the DIAMANTE content
      and text messaging system through three iterative phases of UCD with ten patients each (total
      n=30). The first phase consisted of 1.5-hour individual semi-structured interviews. Findings
      from phase 1 were used to inform content and information delivery decisions of the final
      intervention, including selecting the thematic message categories and the design. In the
      second phase, patients tested out an early prototype of the mobile application through
      usability testing. Patients tested the final DIAMANTE intervention including thematic message
      content and the application in the third, final UCD phase, in order to address any
      user-related issues prior to launching the randomized control trial.

      In the DIAMANTE Randomized Controlled Trial, we aim to examine the effect of a smartphone app
      that uses reinforcement learning to predict the most effective messages for increasing
      physical activity. We will recruit 276 low-income minority patients with depression and
      diabetes within he San Francisco Health Network. We will compare this intervention to static
      messages with health management content, and a control group that only receives a weekly mood
      message.

    <intervention_model_description>This study is a randomized, controlled, one-center superiority trial with three-arm groups and a primary endpoint of increase in daily steps during a 6 month intervention by a smartphone app. Randomization will be performed as block randomization with a 1:1:1 allocation. Patients will be automatically randomized into groups trough our secure server during onboarding of the app. Patients need to be informed of the nature and frequency of the messages they will be receiving and discuss this with investigators during the course of the study. Therefore, investigators and patients will not be blinded. We used the SPIRIT checklist when writing our report.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Our primary outcome, change in daily step counts, will be passively collected by a mobile phone application during the time that patients remain in the intervention.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Hemoglobin A1c</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>We will derive HbA1c, the average plasma glucose over the previous eight to 12 weeks, recommended as a means to diagnose diabetes (20), from patients' electronic health records (EHR). We will use the most recent, available measurement from a maximum of 12 months before participating in the study. After 6 months, we will again assess the most recent HbA1c (pulling from patients EHR), ensuring that at least 3 months elapsed between baseline and follow-up HbA1c levels.</description>

    <description>We will send patients a total of seven messages per week (one per day) at 10.00 am. For the physical health management messages we use messages from established topics in the Diabetes Prevention Program(23) content with the emphasis on physical activity and stress management. The final message, on the seventh day will ask patients to rate their mood on a scale from 1 to 9. Physical activity (step-count/day) will be passively monitored via the app on their smartphone.</description>

    <description>Patients in the adaptive messaging arm will receive the daily messages of the static arm, and additionally receive daily messages within different categories of feedback and motivational messages that are chosen using a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm. Physical activity (step-count/day) will be actively monitored via the app on their smartphone.</description>

    <description>Control patients will only install the app on their phone and will not receive any feedback messages. They will receive one message a week, on a fixed day, asking them to assess their mood in the previous week on a scale of 1 to 9. The message will be sent daily at 10:00 am. Non-responders will receive reminders to submit their mood self-assessments in two hour intervals.</description>
