    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to analyze patterns in individuals with hnRNP genetic variants,
      including their neurological comorbidities, other medical problems and any treatment. The
      investigators will maintain an ongoing database of medical data that is otherwise being
      collected for routine medical care. The investigators will also collect data prospectively in
      the form of questionnaires, neuropsychological assessments, motor assessments, and
      electroencephalography to examine the landscape of deleterious variants in these genes.

      Neurodevelopmental disorders are a group of disorders in which the development of the central
      nervous system is disturbed. The genetic basis for many neurodevelopmental disorders has
      continued to expand and a recent gene called HNRNPH2 (Heterogeneous Nuclear Ribonucleoprotein
      H2, encoded by HNRNPH2) is one such gene that is associated with a common neurodevelopmental
      disorder characterized by developmental delay, intellectual disability, autism and autistic
      features, and tone abnormalities, among other multisystem problems.

      The investigators will expand the genetic cohort to include any individual with a variant in
      an hnRNP gene presenting with neurodevelopmental abnormalities. This is non-interventional
      study that examines both data previously used in clinical practice and prospective data
      collection in the form of questionnaires and assessments. The investigators will examine
      patterns of initial presentation, patterns in neurological evaluations; neurological testing
      including brain MRI and electroencephalography, and outcomes in individuals with a variant in
      any hnRNP gene.
