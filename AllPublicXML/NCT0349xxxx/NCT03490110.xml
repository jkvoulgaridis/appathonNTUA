      Some of the most common, persistent, and disabling consequences of traumatic brain injury
      affect an individual's ability to achieve personal goals. Interventions that strengthen
      abilities such as being able to concentrate, remember, stay calm and overcome challenges,
      could have far reaching benefits for Veterans. One challenge in rehabilitation is that
      response to training can be highly variable, and a better understanding of the neural bases
      for this variability could inform care. This pilot project will test the clinical behavioral
      effects of a cognitive skill training intervention and explore to what extent changes in
      markers of the brain's electrical activity (using the non-invasive technique of
      electroencephalograms, EEG) can explain differences in responses to skill training.

      Detailed Description: Traumatic brain injuries (TBI) can impair cognitive functioning long
      after the initial trauma. Some of the most common, persistent, and disabling consequences of
      traumatic brain injury are deficits in higher order cognitive functions that direct more
      basic processes based on an individual's goals. Symptoms such as distractibility and
      difficulty holding goal-relevant information in memory can affect achievement of personal and
      professional goals. These cognitive problems can be exacerbated by post-traumatic stress
      (PTS) symptoms, commonly observed in the Veteran population. Interventions that strengthen
      goal-directed regulation of cognitive-emotion states could have far reaching benefits for
      Veterans.

      One challenge in rehabilitation is that response to training can be highly variable, and a
      better understanding of the neural bases for this variability could inform patient care.
      Investigators have developed a system for training neurocognitive skills that can be used in
      rehabilitation neuroscience studies to elucidate the neural bases of improvements in
      cognitive functioning. The training system is designed to help patients improve goal-directed
      brain state regulation, and preliminary work has investigated brain network parameters that
      may predict response to training. Electroencephalography (EEG) potentially provides easily
      accessible markers for the neural bases of improvements with training.

      Objectives in this pilot study are to investigate the potential of EEG markers to: (1)
      explain differential responses to attention regulation training; and (2) predict responses to
      training.

    <measure>Composite Score of Attention and Executive Functioning From a Neurocognitive Test Battery</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 1, before intervention period (baseline)</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators created a composite score based upon standardized performance on the following neurocognitive measures of attention and executive functions: Wechsler Adult Intelligence Test - 4th Edition- letter number sequence; Auditory Consonant Trigrams - 9, 18, 36 second conditions; Digit Vigilance Test - Total Errors; Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System Color-Word Interference Trials 3 and 4 - Time and Total Errors; &amp; Trails B - Time. Performance on each measure was scored using populations norms, and these scores are then standardized (Z-scored) and averaged to create a composite outcome (the unit measure being Z-score).
A Z-score reflects the number of standard deviations a given score is away from the population mean: A Z-score of 0 is equal to the population mean, with positive and negative values reflecting performances above and below the population mean, respectively.</description>

    <measure>Network Modularity From EEG</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 8, after the intervention period</time_frame>
    <description>EEG will be collected during a focused rest condition. Network modularity will be estimated from a matrix of connections between electrodes based on phase coherence, a unit-less measure of correlation between phase angles of EEG signals in the theta (4-8 Hz) frequency range. The modularity metric reflects the strength of modular network organization by summing the difference between the fraction of within-module connections to the total fraction of connections across modules, thus ranging from 0 (random) to 1 (completely modular). Change in network modularity will be analyzed for this data as change from before to after the intervention period.</description>

        <title>Composite Score of Attention and Executive Functioning From a Neurocognitive Test Battery</title>
        <description>The investigators created a composite score based upon standardized performance on the following neurocognitive measures of attention and executive functions: Wechsler Adult Intelligence Test - 4th Edition- letter number sequence; Auditory Consonant Trigrams - 9, 18, 36 second conditions; Digit Vigilance Test - Total Errors; Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System Color-Word Interference Trials 3 and 4 - Time and Total Errors; &amp; Trails B - Time. Performance on each measure was scored using populations norms, and these scores are then standardized (Z-scored) and averaged to create a composite outcome (the unit measure being Z-score).
A Z-score reflects the number of standard deviations a given score is away from the population mean: A Z-score of 0 is equal to the population mean, with positive and negative values reflecting performances above and below the population mean, respectively.</description>

        <description>EEG will be collected during a focused rest condition. Network modularity will be estimated from a matrix of connections between electrodes based on phase coherence, a unit-less measure of correlation between phase angles of EEG signals in the theta (4-8 Hz) frequency range. The modularity metric reflects the strength of modular network organization by summing the difference between the fraction of within-module connections to the total fraction of connections across modules, thus ranging from 0 (random) to 1 (completely modular). Change in network modularity will be analyzed for this data as change from before to after the intervention period.</description>

          <title>State Regulation Skill Training</title>
          <description>This arm utilizes a training system designed to strengthen goal-directed cognitive-emotional state regulation skills. The emphasis is on practice and active application of skills across a range of challenge contexts. Digital scenarios provide experiential learning opportunities, allowing Veterans to apply skills to tackle challenges that are calibrated to maximize learning. Coaches guide learning for successful application of skills to challenges in personal life.
State regulation skill training: Participants complete seven supervised training sessions. Training sessions last 2 hours, and participants are requested to complete approximately 2.5 hours of additional skill practice over the course of each week outside of session (total ~4.5 hours per week).</description>
