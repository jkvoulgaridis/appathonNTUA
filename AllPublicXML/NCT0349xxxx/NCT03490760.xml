    <textblock>
      This is a single-institution phase II trial of Durvalumab combined with Radiation Therapy
      (RT) for metastatic pancreatic cancer patients who have progressed through first-line
      chemotherapy. Pancreatic cancer patients who have received second-line or greater
      chemotherapy in the metastatic setting are not eligible. Target accrual is 39 patients.
      Durvalumab 1500 mg (or 20 mg/m2 if &lt;30 kg) IV every 4 weeks will be started and continued
      during RT and afterwards until the patient experiences either unacceptable toxicity or
      disease progression, whichever comes first. Patients must have at least three
      radiographically measurable pancreatic cancer lesions in different organs that have not
      previously received RT, two of which will receive RT. Eligible lesions include either the
      primary pancreatic tumor in unresected patients or distant metastatic lesions. Three
      fractions of 8 Gy each will be prescribed to one lesion during Week 3. Three fractions of 8
      Gy each will be prescribed to the second lesion during Week 5.

      This is a single-arm trial with continuous monitoring of acute non-hematologic toxicity with
      the primary endpoint of progression free survival. Efficacy will be evaluated by time to
      progression or death, whichever comes first, and compared to historical control of
      chemotherapy alone as reported in the literature.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Biopsy-proven metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma with progression through standard
             first-line chemotherapy. Chemotherapy given as part of prior chemoradiation does not
             count as a line of therapy. Chemotherapy given as part of prior chemoradiation in the
             setting of non-metastatic pancreatic cancer does not count as a line of therapy.

          -  At least 3 radiographically distinct pancreatic cancer lesions that are measurable by
             RECIST 1.1 criteria, including 2 that are eligible for RT.

          -  Lesions that will receive RT are separated by ≥3 cm and none &gt;7 cm in greatest
             dimension.

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1.

          -  Life expectancy of ≥12 weeks.

          -  Adequate liver and kidney function.

          -  Adequate blood cell count.

          -  Female subjects must either be of non-reproductive potential or must have a negative
             serum pregnancy test upon study entry.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Involvement in the planning and/or conduct of the study

          -  Previous enrollment in the present study.

          -  Any previous treatment with a programmed cell death 1 or programmed cell death ligand
             1 inhibitor including Durvalumab.

          -  Prior RT to any lesion that would receive RT on this protocol.

          -  Prior RT that could lead to an unacceptably high risk of clinically significant normal
             tissue injury due to high cumulative normal tissue dose as determined by the
             investigator.

          -  Subjects who have received more than 1 line of chemotherapy in the metastatic setting.

          -  History of another primary malignancy except for: 1) malignancy treated with curative

             dose of Durvalumab, with the exceptions of intranasal and inhaled corticosteroids or
             systemic corticosteroids at physiological doses, which are not to exceed 10 mg/day of
             prednisone, or an equivalent corticosteroid.

          -  Any unresolved toxicity (&gt; grade 2, Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events
             version 4.03) from previous anti-cancer therapy. Subjects with irreversible toxicity
             that is not reasonably expected to be exacerbated by the investigational product may
             be included (e.g., hearing loss, peripherally neuropathy).

          -  Any prior Grade ≥ 3 immune-related adverse event (irAE) while receiving any previous
             immunotherapy agent, or any unresolved immune-related adverse event (irAE) &gt;Grade 1.

          -  Active or prior documented autoimmune disease within the past 2 years NOTE: Subjects
             with vitiligo, Graves' disease, or psoriasis not requiring systemic treatment (within
             the past 2 years) are not excluded.

          -  Active or prior documented inflammatory bowel disease (e.g., Crohn's disease,
