    <description>An adverse drug reaction (ADR) was any untoward medical occurrence attributed to ANAEMETRO Intravenous infusion in a participant who received ANAEMETRO Intravenous infusion. A serious ADR was an ADR resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. Relatedness to ANAEMETRO Intravenous infusion was assessed by the physician.</description>

    <measure>Clinical Response Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Maximum 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical response of ANAEMETRO Intravenous infusion was evaluated comprehensively at the completion of the observation period, being assessed as &quot;effective,&quot; &quot;not effective,&quot; or &quot;indeterminate&quot; by the physician based on clinical symptoms.
Clinical response rate, which was defined as the percentage of participants evaluated as &quot;effective&quot; over the total number of assessable effectiveness analysis population, was presented along with the corresponding 2-sided 95% CI.</description>

    <description>Clinical response of ANAEMETRO Intravenous infusion was evaluated comprehensively at the completion of the observation period, being assessed as &quot;effective,&quot; &quot;not effective,&quot; or &quot;indeterminate&quot; by the physician based on clinical symptoms.
Clinical response rate, which was defined as the percentage of participants evaluated as &quot;effective&quot; over the total number of assessable effectiveness analysis population, was presented along with the corresponding 2-sided 95% CI.
Participants assessed as &quot;effective&quot; by the following target diseases were counted to assess whether they contribute to the clinical response: anaerobic infection, infectious enterocolitis, amebic dysentery, and the infection with both infectious enterocolitis and amebic dysentery.</description>
