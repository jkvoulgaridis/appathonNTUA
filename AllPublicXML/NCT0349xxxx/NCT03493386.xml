  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is two-way crossover study to compare pharmacokinetic (PK) of daprodustat 2 milligram
      (mg) versus 4 mg tablets and food effect on the PK of daprodustat following single oral doses
      in healthy Japanese male subjects. This study will be conducted in two parts. Part 1 is the
      bioequivalence part in which subjects will receive single dose of 2 tablets of 2 mg
      daprodustat and single dose of 1 tablet of 4 mg daprodustat in crossover manner. Part 2 is
      Food effect part. In this part, subjects will receive single dose of 4 mg daprodustat tablet
      in fasting and fed state in a crossover manner. There will 5-day wash-out period between each
      intervention period. There will be approximately 52 subjects in Part 1 and 12 subjects in
      Part 2. The study will last for 6 weeks.

    <description>Urinary pH measurement is a routine part of urinalysis. Urine pH is an acid-base measurement. pH is measured on a numeric scale ranging from 0 to 14; values on the scale refer to the degree of alkalinity or acidity. A pH of 7 is neutral. A pH less than 7 is acidic, and a pH greater than 7 is basic. Normal urine has a slightly acid pH (5.0 - 6.0). Urine samples were collected for the measurement of urine pH by method up to 24 hours in Part 1.Day-1 (one day before the Pre-Dose) was considered as Baseline.

    <description>Urinary specific gravity measurement is a routine part of urinalysis. Urine specific gravity is a measure of the concentration of solutes in the urine and provides information on the kidney's ability to concentrate urine.

    <measure>Part 2: Change From Baseline in Urinalysis Parameter; Potential of Hydrogen (pH)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day -1), 24 hours (post-dose)</time_frame>
    <description>Urinary pH measurement is a routine part of urinalysis. Urine pH is an acid-base measurement. pH is measured on a numeric scale ranging from 0 to 14; values on the scale refer to the degree of alkalinity or acidity. A pH of 7 is neutral. A pH less than 7 is acidic, and a pH greater than 7 is basic. Normal urine has a slightly acid pH (5.0 - 6.0). Urine samples were collected for the measurement of urine pH by method up to 24 hours in Part 2. Day-1 (one day before the Pre-Dose) was considered as Baseline. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting Baseline value from the Post-Dose visit value.</description>

    <measure>Part 2: Change From Baseline in Urinalysis Parameter; Specific Gravity</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day -1), 24 hours (post-dose)</time_frame>
    <description>Urinary specific gravity measurement is a routine part of urinalysis. Urine specific gravity is a measure of the concentration of solutes in the urine and provides information on the kidney's ability to concentrate urine. The concentration of the excreted molecules determines the urine's specific gravity. Urine samples were collected for the measurement of urine specific gravity by dipstick method up to 24 hours in Part 2. Day-1 was considered as Baseline. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting Baseline value from the Post-Dose visit value.</description>

        <title>Part 1: Change From Baseline in Urinalysis Parameter; Potential of Hydrogen (pH)</title>
        <description>Urinary pH measurement is a routine part of urinalysis. Urine pH is an acid-base measurement. pH is measured on a numeric scale ranging from 0 to 14; values on the scale refer to the degree of alkalinity or acidity. A pH of 7 is neutral. A pH less than 7 is acidic, and a pH greater than 7 is basic. Normal urine has a slightly acid pH (5.0 - 6.0). Urine samples were collected for the measurement of urine pH by method up to 24 hours in Part 1.Day-1 (one day before the Pre-Dose) was considered as Baseline. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting Baseline value from the Post-Dose visit value.</description>

        <description>Urinary specific gravity measurement is a routine part of urinalysis. Urine specific gravity is a measure of the concentration of solutes in the urine and provides information on the kidney's ability to concentrate urine. The concentration of the excreted molecules determines the urine's specific gravity. Urine samples were collected for the measurement of urine specific gravity by dipstick method up to 24 hours in Part 1. Day-1 was considered as Baseline. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting Baseline value from the Post-Dose visit value.</description>

        <title>Part 2: Change From Baseline in Urinalysis Parameter; Potential of Hydrogen (pH)</title>
        <description>Urinary pH measurement is a routine part of urinalysis. Urine pH is an acid-base measurement. pH is measured on a numeric scale ranging from 0 to 14; values on the scale refer to the degree of alkalinity or acidity. A pH of 7 is neutral. A pH less than 7 is acidic, and a pH greater than 7 is basic. Normal urine has a slightly acid pH (5.0 - 6.0). Urine samples were collected for the measurement of urine pH by method up to 24 hours in Part 2. Day-1 (one day before the Pre-Dose) was considered as Baseline. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting Baseline value from the Post-Dose visit value.</description>

        <description>Urinary specific gravity measurement is a routine part of urinalysis. Urine specific gravity is a measure of the concentration of solutes in the urine and provides information on the kidney's ability to concentrate urine. The concentration of the excreted molecules determines the urine's specific gravity. Urine samples were collected for the measurement of urine specific gravity by dipstick method up to 24 hours in Part 2. Day-1 was considered as Baseline. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting Baseline value from the Post-Dose visit value.</description>
