  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety of switching
      treatment-resistant depression (TRD) subjects from a prior antidepressant treatment (to which
      they have not responded) to either intranasal esketamine plus a new oral antidepressant or
      switching to a new oral antidepressant plus intranasal placebo.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind (neither the researchers nor the subjects know what
      treatment the subject is receiving), active-controlled, multicenter study (more than 1 study
      site) in subjects with TRD to assess the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of flexible doses
      of intranasal esketamine plus a newly initiated oral antidepressant compared with a newly
      initiated oral antidepressant (active comparator) plus intranasal placebo. The study will
      consist of 3 phases: Screening/Prospective Observational Phase (4-7 weeks), Double-blind
      Induction Phase (4-weeks), Follow-up Phase (24-weeks). Subjects who rollover into a long-term
      maintenance study will not participate in the Follow-up Phase. The antidepressant treatment,
      as well as any other ongoing medications being taken for depression at screening (including
      adjunctive/ augmentation therapies), will continue unchanged, at the same dosage, from the
      start of Week 1 through the end of Week 4 of the screening/prospective observational phase.
      Subjects' safety will be monitored throughout the study.

        <title>Change From Baseline in Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) Total Score up to Day 28 in the Double-blind Induction Phase- Mixed-Effects Model Using Repeated Measures (MMRM) Analysis</title>
        <description>MADRS is clinician-rated scale designed to measure depression severity, and to detect changes due to antidepressant treatment. Scale consists of 10 items (apparent sadness, reported sadness, inner tension, sleep, appetite, concentration, lassitude, interest level, pessimistic thoughts, and suicidal thoughts), each of which is scored from 0 (item is not present or is normal) to 6 (severe or continuous presence of symptoms), summed for a total possible score of 0 to 60. Higher scores represent more severe condition.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline up to Day 28 of Double-blind Induction Phase</time_frame>
        <population>Full analysis set (FAS) defined as all randomized participants who received at least 1 dose of intranasal study medication, 1 dose of oral antidepressant (AD) medication during double-blind induction phase (D-BIP). Here 'N' (overall number of participants analyzed) signifies number of participants who were evaluable for this outcome measure.</population>

        <description>The SDS is a participant-reported outcome measure and 5 item questionnaire used for assessment of functional impairment and associated disability. First three items assess disruption of 1 work/school, 2 social life, 3 family life/home responsibilities using a 0(no impairment)-10 (most severe impairment). Score for first 3 items are summed to create total score of 0-30 where higher score indicates greater impairment and a negative change in score indicates improvement. It also has one item on days lost from school or work and one item on days when under productive.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Patient Health Questionnaire - 9-Item Depression Module (PHQ-9) Total Score up to Endpoint (Double-blind Induction Phase [Day 28])- ANCOVA Analysis</title>
          <description>PHQ-9 is 9-item, self-report scale assessing depressive symptoms. Each item is rated on 4-point scale (0=Not at all, 1=Several Days, 2=More than half days, 3=Nearly every day). Scale scores each of 9 symptom domains of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Major Depressive Disorder criteria and it has been used both as screening tool and measure of response to treatment for depression. The participant's item responses are summed to provide a total score (range of 0 to 27) with higher scores indicating greater severity of depressive symptoms. Severity of PHQ-9 categorized as follows: None-minimal (0-4), Mild (5-9), Moderate (10-14), Moderately Severe (15-19), Severe (20-27). The last post baseline observation during the phase was carried forward as &quot;End Point&quot; for that phase.</description>

          <description>Remission defined as SDS total score &lt;= 6 and individual item scores each &lt;= 2. SDS is a participant reported outcome measure and is a 5-item questionnaire which has been widely used and accepted for assessment of functional impairment and associated disability. The first three items assess disruption of (1) work/school, (2) social life, and (3) family life/home responsibilities using a 0-10 rating scale. The score for the first three items were summed to create a total score of 0-30 where a higher score indicates greater impairment. It also has one item on days lost from school or work and one item on days when under productive.</description>

        <description>EQ-5D-5L consists of EQ-5D-5L descriptive system and EQ visual analogue scale (EQ VAS). EQ-5D-5L descriptive system comprises of 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each has 5 levels of perceived problems (1-no problem, 2-slight problems, 3-moderate problems, 4-severe problems, 5-extreme problems). Participant selects answer for each of 5 dimensions considering response that best matches his/her health &quot;today&quot;. Responses were used to generate a Health Status Index (HSI). Health Status Index range is -0.148 - 0.949, is anchored at 0 (dead) and 1 (full health). EQ VAS self-rating records the respondent's own assessment of his/her overall health status at time of completion, on a scale of 0 (worst health you can imagine) to 100 (best health you can imagine). Sum score ranges from 0 to 100 where, sum score = (sum of the scores from the 5 dimensions minus 5) *5. Higher score indicates worst health state.</description>
