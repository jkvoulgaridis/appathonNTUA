    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and tolerability of intravenous
      administration of a tetravalent RNA-lipoplex cancer vaccine targeting four tumor-associated
      antigens in patients with advanced melanoma.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      -  The Lipo-MERIT vaccine consists of the four naked ribonucleic acid (RNA)-drug products
           (DPs) RBL001.1, RBL002.2, RBL003.1, and RBL004.1 that are optimised to induce
           antigen-specific CD8+ and CD4+ T cell responses against four selected malignant
           melanoma-associated antigens respectively.

        -  In this study, naked RNA DPs will be formulated with liposomes to form RNA-lipoplexes
           (RNA(LIP)) that (i) protect RNA from degradation in the serum, (ii) enable in vivo
           targeting of systemic antigen-presenting cells (APC), and therefore (iii) constitute a
           novel vaccine formulation that supports intravenous administration.

        -  The Lipo-MERIT vaccine is expected to lead to several effects contributing to its
           immunological (therapeutic) effect. First, the RNA-lipoplexes home to APCs in lymphoid
           organs after intravenous injection, where they are rapidly taken up by professional
           APCs. Incorporated RNA is translocated to the cytoplasm leading to its translation by
           the host ribosome complex into four Antigen encoding proteins which are processed and
           presented on both HLA-class I as well as HLA-class II molecules. Consecutively,
           antigen-specific CD8+ and CD4+ T cell responses will be triggered by HLA-peptide
           complexes on the surface of antigen-presenting cells.

        -  In addition, the Lipo-MERIT vaccine is expected to transiently activate APCs (change of
           surface marker expression and cytokine secretion) via signalling of TLRs, subsequently
           leading to the transient induction of inflammatory cytokines (such as IFN-α and IP-10)
           supporting the induction of tumour-antigen specific T cell responses.
