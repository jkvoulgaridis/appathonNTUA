      This is a proof of concept, open label protocol to evaluate the effect of losartan on
      cigarette smoke-induced lung injury in smokers, ex-smokers with and without chronic
      obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), giving 50 mg and subsequently 100 mg losartan for 4
      weeks

      Aim: To test that inhibition of T-cell growth factor (TGF-ß) with losartan in ex-smokers with
      COPD and active and passive smokers without COPD will lead to an increase chloride
      conductance through calcium-activated chloride channel (CACC), as measured by nasal potential
      difference (NPD).

      Study design: The Investigators will assess the consequences of active and passive smoking
      and the treatment with losartan on CaCC-mediated chloride conductance in human beings using
      NPD measurements.

      NPD is a direct measure of ion transport. It measures CaCC-mediated Cl- secretion and thus
      serves as an indirect measure of voltage-dependent potassium (BK) channels function. In
      addition, improvement of NPD measured ion transport was indirectly linked to lung function
      improvements and clearance in trials with cystic fibrosis patients. Therefore, NPD lends
      itself as a good surrogate for Mucociliary clearance (MCC), in a proof of concept clinical
      trial.

      The investigators will also measure TGF-ß levels in nasal secretions and cells to correlate
      these with the level of CaCC-mediated Cl- conductance.

      Investigator's preliminary data show that TGF-ß1 and cigarette smoke exposure decrease BK
      activity and cause airway surface liquid (ASL) volume depletion and losartan partially
      rescues BK channel function leading to increased ASL volume and ciliary beat frequency (CBF)
      in airway epithelial cells exposed to smoke.

      Therefore the investigators propose that smoke exposure, via TGF-ß1 production, leads to
      apical BK channel dysfunction to cause ASL volume depletion and mucociliary dysfunction in
      smokers and ex-smokers with COPD. Clinically used Angiotensin II Receptor Blockers (ARBs) are
      known to inhibit TGF-ß signaling and present a &quot;low-hanging-fruit&quot; approach (medication
      already in clinical use) for intervention in COPD. In a murine model, losartan has previously
      been shown to attenuate cigarette smoke-induced lung injury and to rescue lung architecture.

      The long-term goal of this study is evaluate the effect of currently available and clinically
      useful TGF-ß1 signaling inhibitors (ARBs) on mucociliary function in individuals with
      smoke-associated airway diseases, such as chronic bronchitis and COPD.

      To test that hypothesis, subjects with COPD will be given four weeks of 50 mg of losartan
      daily and consequently an additional four weeks of 100 mg of losartan (divided in two doses
      of 50 mg twice daily).
