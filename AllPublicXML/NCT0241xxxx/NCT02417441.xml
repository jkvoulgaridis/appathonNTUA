    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study was to explore the added value of adjunctive use of Early Embryo
      Viability Assessment (Eeva) with morphological grading in identifying optimal embryos for
      transfer.

      This study is a Phase IV, open label, prospective, randomized, exploratory, multicenter
      study. Subjects were randomized in 2:1 ratio to two treatment groups: in the experimental
      group, embryos were assessed for embryo transfer (ET) with Eeva and morphological grading,
      while in the control group embryos were assessed with morphological grading only.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Implantation Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Gestational Weeks 5 to 8</time_frame>
    <description>Implantation rate was calculated by dividing the number of intrauterine gestational sacs by the number of embryos transferred multiplied by 100.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical Pregnancy Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Gestational Weeks 5 to 8</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical pregnancy was confirmed by the presence of a gestational sac with heartbeat as assessed by ultrasonography. Clinical pregnancy rate was measured as the number of clinical pregnancies divided by number of embryo transfer (ET) cycles multiplied by 100.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Subjects With Ongoing Pregnancy Status</measure>
    <time_frame>Gestational Weeks 10 to 12</time_frame>
    <description>Ongoing pregnancy was defined as having a positive fetal heart beat (FHB) as assessed by ultrasonography at gestational week 10-12. Number of subjects with ongoing pregnancy status has been reported, where &quot;Yes&quot; indicates participants with positive ongoing pregnancy status and &quot;No&quot; indicates participants with negative ongoing pregnancy status .</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Multiple Pregnancy Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Gestational Weeks 5 to 8</time_frame>
    <description>Multiple pregnancy rate was defined as a clinical pregnancy with greater than equals to (&gt;=) 2 fetal sacs as assessed by ultrasonography. Multiple Pregnancies rate was measured by number of multiple pregnancies divided by number of embryo transfer cycles multiplied by 100.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Utilization Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 3 or Day 5/6 of embryo culture</time_frame>
    <description>Utilization rate was defined as the sum of number of transferred and frozen embryos divided by number of normally fertilized oocytes multiplied by 100.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Spontaneous Miscarriage Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Gestational Weeks 10 to 12</time_frame>
    <description>Spontaneous miscarriage rate was measured by the number of spontaneous miscarriages as communicated during medical appointment or by telephone contact divided by number of clinical pregnancies multiplied by 100.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Eeva Conformity in Early Embryo Viability Assessment + Morphological Grading Group for Day 3 Embryo Transfer (ET)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 3 of embryo culture</time_frame>
    <description>Eeva Conformity was reported as the number of subjects who were compliant to use Eeva in embryo assessment in the &quot;Early Embryo Viability Assessment + morphological grading&quot; group. Eeva-compliance subgroup refers to subjects whose embryos were assessed by embryologists following the recommendation of Eeva system and the instructions for use (IFU) of Eeva. Subgroup analysis revealed a high incidence of Eeva noncompliance in the experimental group, which compromised the quality of this study. Only &quot;Early Embryo Viability Assessment + Morphological Grading&quot; reporting arm was applicable for this outcome measure.</description>

        <description>Eeva Conformity was reported as the number of subjects who were compliant to use Eeva in embryo assessment in the &quot;Early Embryo Viability Assessment + morphological grading&quot; group. Eeva-compliance subgroup refers to subjects whose embryos were assessed by embryologists following the recommendation of Eeva system and the instructions for use (IFU) of Eeva. Subgroup analysis revealed a high incidence of Eeva noncompliance in the experimental group, which compromised the quality of this study.
