  <brief_summary>

      Background:

      - Computed Tomography (CT) is a scan that makes detailed pictures of the body. It uses
      radiation to do that. In 2011, about 85.3 million CT scans were done in the United States.
      But there is growing concern about the health effects of radiation. There are new and
      different ways to make CT pictures that use less radiation. Researchers want to learn whether
      these new methods create images that are similar to images from a traditional CT.

      Objective:

      - To learn if new CT imaging methods with less radiation make images that are similar to
      traditional ways.

      Eligibility:

      - Adults 18 years of age and older who are scheduled for a CT of the chest, abdomen and
      pelvis with contrast.

      Design:

        -  Researchers will review participants medical records to see if they can be in this
           study.

        -  Participants may have blood drawn from an arm vein by a needle stick. The blood will be
           used to make sure they can be in this study and that it is safe for them to have
           contrast.

        -  During the participants CT scan appointment, one extra scan will be done using low
           radiation methods.

        -  During a CT scan, the participant lies on a table. A large x-ray machine takes pictures
           of the body.

    <textblock>
      Computed Tomography uses ionizing radiation to make pictures of the body. Different methods
      of creating CT pictures have been developed that allow reductions in the amount of radiation.
      The purpose of this research study is to learn whether these new imaging methods using less
      radiation to create images are similar to the traditional and current method.
