  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety of switching
      treatment-resistant depression (TRD) participants from a prior antidepressant treatment (to
      which they have not responded) to either intranasal esketamine plus a new oral antidepressant
      or switching to a new oral antidepressant plus intranasal placebo.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind (neither the researchers nor the participants know what
      treatment the participant is receiving), active-controlled, multicenter study (more than 1
      study site) in participants with TRD to assess the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of
      fixed doses of intranasal esketamine plus a newly initiated oral antidepressant compared with
      a newly initiated oral antidepressant (active comparator) plus intranasal placebo. The study
      will consist of 3 phases: Screening/Prospective Observational Phase (4-7 weeks), Double-blind
      Induction Phase (4-weeks), Follow-up Phase (24-weeks). Participants who rollover into a
      long-term maintenance study will not participate in the Follow-up Phase. At the start of the
      screening/prospective observational phase, the participant must have had documented
      non-response to at least 1 antidepressant treatment (based on Massachusetts General Hospital
      - Antidepressant Treatment Response Questionnair [MGH-ATRQ]) in the current episode of
      depression, and participant is taking a different oral antidepressant treatment on the
      MGH-ATRQ for at least the previous 2 weeks at or above the minimum therapeutic dose. This
      antidepressant treatment, as well as any other ongoing medications being taken for depression
      at screening (including adjunctive/ augmentation therapies), will continue from the start of
      Week 1 through the end of Week 4 of the screening/prospective observational phase.
      Participants will be randomly assigned to receive Intranasal esketamine (56 milligrams [mg]),
      Intranasal esketamine (84 mg), or Intranasal placebo. In addition, each participant will be
      assigned to receive 1 of 4 oral antidepressant medications from 2 different classes of
      antidepressant treatments, a Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor (SSRI) (escitalopram or
      sertraline) or a Serotonin and Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitor (SNRI) (duloxetine or
      venlafaxine extended release [XR]), initiated on Day 1 and continued through the double-blind
      induction phase. Participants will be primarily evaluated for improvement in depressive
      symptoms as assessed by change in Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total
      score at Week 4. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.

        <description>MADRS is clinician-rated scale designed to measure depression severity, and to detect changes due to antidepressant treatment. Scale consists of 10 items (apparent sadness, reported sadness, inner tension, sleep, appetite, concentration, lassitude, interest level, pessimistic thoughts, and suicidal thoughts), each of which is scored from 0 (item is not present or is normal) to 6 (severe or continuous presence of symptoms), summed for a total possible score of 0 to 60. Higher scores represent more severe condition.</description>

        <description>A participant was defined as having a clinical response if there was at least 50% improvement (decrease) from baseline in the MADRS total score with onset by Day 2 and Day 8 that was maintained to Day 28. Participants were allowed one excursion (non-response) on Days 8, 15 or 22, however score must show at least 25% improvement. Participants who did not meet these criteria or discontinued during the study before Day 28 were considered as non-responders and were assigned the value of 0 (that is no). MADRS is clinician-rated scale that consists of 10 items (apparent sadness, reported sadness, inner tension, sleep, appetite, concentration, lassitude, interest level, pessimistic thoughts, and suicidal thoughts), each of which is scored from 0 (item is not present or is normal) to 6 (severe or continuous presence of symptoms), for total possible score of 0 to 60.

          <title>Percentage of Participants With Onset of Clinical Response by Day 2 and Day 8</title>
          <description>A participant was defined as having a clinical response if there was at least 50% improvement (decrease) from baseline in the MADRS total score with onset by Day 2 and Day 8 that was maintained to Day 28. Participants were allowed one excursion (non-response) on Days 8, 15 or 22, however score must show at least 25% improvement. Participants who did not meet these criteria or discontinued during the study before Day 28 were considered as non-responders and were assigned the value of 0 (that is no). MADRS is clinician-rated scale that consists of 10 items (apparent sadness, reported sadness, inner tension, sleep, appetite, concentration, lassitude, interest level, pessimistic thoughts, and suicidal thoughts), each of which is scored from 0 (item is not present or is normal) to 6 (severe or continuous presence of symptoms), for total possible score of 0 to 60. Higher scores represent more severe condition.</description>

          <title>Percentage of Participants Who Achieved at Least 50% Reduction From Baseline in MADRS Total Score at the Endpoint (Double-blind Induction Phase [Day 28]) (LOCF Data)</title>
          <description>A participant was defined as a responder (yes=1 and no=0) at a given time point if the percent reduction from baseline in MADRS total score is at least 50 percent (%). The percentage of participants who achieved at least 50% reduction from baseline were reported. MADRS is clinician-rated scale designed to measure depression severity, and to detect changes due to antidepressant treatment. Scale consists of 10 items (apparent sadness, reported sadness, inner tension, sleep, appetite, concentration, lassitude, interest level, pessimistic thoughts, and suicidal thoughts), each of which is scored from 0 (item is not present or is normal) to 6 (severe or continuous presence of symptoms), summed for a total possible score of 0 to 60. Higher scores represent more severe condition. Missing data was imputed using LOCF method and the last post baseline observation during the double-blind induction phase was carried forward as &quot;End Point&quot; for that phase.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 Item (GAD-7) Total Score up to Endpoint (Double-blind Induction Phase [Day 28])</title>
        <description>GAD-7 is a brief and validated 7-item self-reported assessment of overall anxiety. Participants responded to each item using a 4 point scale with response categories of 0=not at all, 1=several days, 2=more than half the days, and 3=nearly every day. Item responses are summed to yield a total score with a range of 0 to 21, where higher scores indicate more anxiety. The recall period is 2 weeks. The severity of the GAD-7 is categorized as follows: None (0-4), Mild (5-9), Moderate (10-14) and Severe (15-21). Missing data was imputed using LOCF method and the last post baseline observation during the double-blind induction phase was carried forward as &quot;End Point&quot; for that phase.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in EuroQol-5 Dimension-5 Level (EQ-5D-5L) up to End of Double-blind Induction Phase (Day 28): Sum Score</title>
        <description>EQ-5D-5L measures health outcome self-completed by respondents. It consists of EQ-5D-5L descriptive system and EQ visual analogue scale (EQ-VAS). The descriptive system comprises of 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression. Each has 5 levels (1-no problem, 2-slight problems, 3-moderate problems, 4-severe problems, 5-extreme problems). The responses are used to generate Health Status Index (HSI). HSI range is -0.148 to 0.949, is anchored at 0 (dead) and 1 (full health). EQ-VAS self-rating records the respondent's own assessment of his/her overall health status at time of completion, on scale of 0 (the worst health you can imagine) to 100 (the best health you can imagine). Sum score ranges from 0 to 100 where, sum score = (sum of the scores from the 5 dimensions minus 5) *5. Higher score indicates worst health state.</description>
