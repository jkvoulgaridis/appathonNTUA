    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate whether montelukast can reduce the
      severity of gastrointestinal (GI) events, measured by the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating
      Scale (GSRS), after oral administration of dimethyl fumarate (DMF) in participants with
      relapsing forms of Multiple Sclerosis (MS). The secondary objectives of this study are as
      follows: To evaluate whether montelukast after oral administration of DMF in participants
      with relapsing forms of MS decreases discontinuations due to GI events and reduces the number
      of participants taking symptomatic therapies for GI events; To investigate the effect of
      montelukast on the incidence of flushing events after oral administration of 240 mg DMF in
      participants with relapsing forms of MS.

    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 0), Day 10 (10 days after Day 0)</time_frame>
    <description>The GSRS is a weekly recall scale that was modified for daily recall. The 15-question GSRS is summarized with a 7-point Likert scale: no discomfort at all=0; minor discomfort=1; mild discomfort=2; moderate discomfort=3; moderately severe discomfort=4; severe discomfort=5 and very severe discomfort=6. The overall GSRS score is a mean score that ranges from 0 (no symptoms) to 6 (the worst possible symptoms). Worsening in severity was defined as a positive average change from baseline (Day 0) to Day 10 in the GSRS score. Day 0: the day before a participant started randomized treatment (if the GI threshold was reached 1 day previously) or the first day of randomized treatment if the threshold was reached that day. If the threshold was reached &gt;1 day previously, then Day 0 was the last day when the threshold was reached, prior to the first dose. Average change is the sum of changes from baseline in GSRS score over the first 10 days divided by the total of days with a GSRS score.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Who Discontinued DMF Therapy Due to GI-Related Adverse Events (AEs) From Day 0 to Week 10</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0 to Week 10</time_frame>
    <description>An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and that did not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE could therefore have been any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not related to the medicinal product. Participants used an electronic diary to record GI-related events. GI-related AEs included diarrhea, nausea, upper abdominal pain, abdominal pain, and dyspepsia.</description>

An AE could therefore have been any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not related to the medicinal product. Flushing-related AEs included flushing and hot flush. Only events with an onset date on or after the date of first DMF dose (up to 27 days before Day 0) are presented. This includes events present before and subsequently worsened after the first dose of DMF.</description>

      <recruitment_details>Participants were recruited from 50 sites in the United States.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Participants were screened over 2 weeks. Those who met â¥1 of the following criteria were considered screen failures: a score of â¥5 on 1 question for 1 day on the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS), â¥4 or â¥3 on 1 question for 2 or 3 consecutive days, respectively; and eDiary compliance of &lt;75% over 14 days prior to randomization.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With a Worsening in Severity of Gastrointestinal (GI) Adverse Events (AEs) on the GSRS From Day 0 to Day 10</title>
        <description>The GSRS is a weekly recall scale that was modified for daily recall. The 15-question GSRS is summarized with a 7-point Likert scale: no discomfort at all=0; minor discomfort=1; mild discomfort=2; moderate discomfort=3; moderately severe discomfort=4; severe discomfort=5 and very severe discomfort=6. The overall GSRS score is a mean score that ranges from 0 (no symptoms) to 6 (the worst possible symptoms). Worsening in severity was defined as a positive average change from baseline (Day 0) to Day 10 in the GSRS score. Day 0: the day before a participant started randomized treatment (if the GI threshold was reached 1 day previously) or the first day of randomized treatment if the threshold was reached that day. If the threshold was reached &gt;1 day previously, then Day 0 was the last day when the threshold was reached, prior to the first dose. Average change is the sum of changes from baseline in GSRS score over the first 10 days divided by the total of days with a GSRS score.</description>

        <title>Average Change From Baseline in GSRS Overall Score at Day 1 to Week 10</title>
        <description>The GSRS is a weekly recall scale that was modified for daily recall. The 15-question GSRS is summarized with a 7-point Likert scale: no discomfort at all=0; minor discomfort=1; mild discomfort=2; moderate discomfort=3; moderately severe discomfort=4; severe discomfort=5 and very severe discomfort=6. The overall GSRS score is a mean score that ranges from 0 (no symptoms) to 6 (the worst possible symptoms). This endpoint reports the average change from baseline (Day 0) between Day 1 and Week 10. Day 0: the day before a participant started randomized treatment (if the GI threshold was reached 1 day previously) or the first day of randomized treatment if the threshold was reached that day. If the threshold was reached &gt;1 day previously, then Day 0 was the last day when the threshold was reached, prior to the first dose. A negative change from baseline indicates that symptoms decreased.</description>

Day 0: the day before a participant started randomized treatment (if the GI threshold was reached 1 day previously) or the first day of randomized treatment if the threshold was reached that day. If the threshold was reached &gt;1 day previously, then Day 0 was the last day when the threshold was reached, prior to the first dose. A negative change from baseline indicates that symptoms decreased.</description>

          <description>The GSRS is a weekly recall scale that was modified for daily recall. The 15-question GSRS is summarized with a 7-point Likert scale: no discomfort at all=0; minor discomfort=1; mild discomfort=2; moderate discomfort=3; moderately severe discomfort=4; severe discomfort=5 and very severe discomfort=6. The overall GSRS score is a mean score that ranges from 0 (no symptoms) to 6 (the worst possible symptoms). This endpoint reports the average change from baseline (Day 0) between Day 1 and the specified time point. Day 0: the day before a participant started randomized treatment (if the GI threshold was reached 1 day previously) or the first day of randomized treatment if the threshold was reached that day. If the threshold was reached &gt;1 day previously, then Day 0 was the last day when the threshold was reached, prior to the first dose.

        <description>The GSRS is a weekly recall scale that was modified for daily recall. The 15-question GSRS is summarized with a 7-point Likert scale: no discomfort at all=0; minor discomfort=1; mild discomfort=2; moderate discomfort=3; moderately severe discomfort=4; severe discomfort=5 and very severe discomfort=6. The overall GSRS score is a mean score that ranges from 0 (no symptoms) to 6 (the worst possible symptoms). This endpoint reports the average change from baseline (Day 0) at Day 1 to Day 3. Day 0: the day before a participant started randomized treatment (if the GI threshold was reached 1 day previously) or the first day of randomized treatment if the threshold was reached that day. If the threshold was reached &gt;1 day previously, then Day 0 is the last day when the threshold was reached, prior to the first dose. A negative change from baseline indicates that symptoms decreased.</description>
