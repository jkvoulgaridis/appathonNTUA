        Inclusion Criteria:

        Not applicable since no subjects will be actively enrolled in this study; only the sera
        samples of the subjects who were a part of previously conducted primary trials will be used
        for testing. However, the archived serum samples of only those subjects who satisfy the
        following criteria will be included in this study:

          -  Subjects who received two doses of influenza vaccine 21 days apart and were included
             in the ATP cohort for immunogenicity and Persistence cohort (depending on the study)
             in the primary studies listed.

          -  Subjects who had agreed that their blood samples could be used for further research
             while giving informed consent for any of the primary studies listed.

          -  Subjects who have sufficient residual sample volume (i.e., ≥0.5 mL) of serum at all
             time points.

          -  Subjects with vaccine homologous neutralizing antibody result available at Day 0 and
             at 21 (25 samples available per group in Study H9N2-001)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Not applicable since no subjects will be actively enrolled in this study; only the
             serum samples of the subjects who were a part of previously conducted trials will be
             used for testing.

        <description>With respect to samples from HA Group 1-related studies (i.e., with H1N1, H5N1,and H9N2 pandemic, and quadrivalent inactivated seasonal, influenza vaccines, analysis was performed for measuring levels of anti-H1 stalk antibody by ELISA for all subjects in each study cohort, aggregate variables were calculated with 95% CI for each treatment group within each study cohort. Seronegative subjects = concentration &lt; 66 EU/mL for anti-H1 stalk ELISA prior to vaccination. Seropositive subjects = concentration ≥ 66 EU/mL for anti-H1 stalk ELISA prior to vaccination. 4-fold increase defined as: For initially seronegative subjects, antibody concentration ≥ 132 EU/mL at post-vaccination.

          <description>With respect to samples from HA Group 1-related studies (i.e., with H1N1, H5N1,and H9N2 pandemic, and quadrivalent inactivated seasonal, influenza vaccines, analysis was performed for measuring levels of anti-H2 antibody by ELISA for the subjects who received an AS vaccine in each study cohort and for the subjects in the FLU D-QIV-015 study cohort, aggregate variables were calculated with 95% CI for each treatment group within each study cohort. seronegative subjects = concentration &lt; 50 EU/mL for anti-H2 HA (full length) antibody prior to vaccination. seropositive subjects = concentration ≥ 50 EU/mL for anti-H2 HA (full length) antibody prior to vaccination. 4-fold increase defined as: For initially seronegative subjects, antibody concentration ≥ 100 EU/mL at post-vaccination; For initially seropositive subjects, antibody concentration at post-vaccination ≥ 4-fold the pre-vaccination antibody concentration. The ≥4-fold increases were only calculated relative to baseline.</description>

          <description>With respect to samples from HA Group 1-related studies (i.e., with H1N1, H5N1,and H9N2 pandemic, and quadrivalent inactivated seasonal, influenza vaccines, analysis was performed for measuring levels of RG reassortant virus (H5N8) antibody by MN for all subjects who received an AS vaccine in each study cohort, aggregate variables were calculated with 95% CI for each treatment group within each study cohort. seronegative subjects = titer &lt; 10 1/DIL for RG reassortant virus (H5N8) MN prior to vaccination. seropositive subjects = titer ≥ 10 1/DIL for RG reassortant virus (H5N8) MN prior to vaccination. 4-fold increase defined as: For initially seronegative subjects, antibody titer ≥ 20 1/DIL at post-vaccination; For initially seropositive subjects, antibody titer at post-vaccination ≥ 4-fold the pre-vaccination antibody titer. The ≥4-fold increases were only calculated relative to baseline.</description>

        <description>With respect to samples from the HA Group 1-related studies (i.e., with H1N1, H5N1,and H9N2 pandemic, and IIV4 seasonal, influenza vaccines), analysis was performed for measuring levels of anti-H1 stalk antibody by ELISA for all the subjects in the adult CCPan H5N1-001, the Q-Pan H1N1-019 and the Q-Pan H9N2-001 study cohorts. Percentage of subjects with at least 4-fold increase to anti-H1 stalk ELISA was calculated with 95% CI at each specified time point. seronegative subjects = concentration &lt; 66 EU/mL for anti-H1 stalk ELISA prior to vaccination. seropositive subjects = concentration ≥ 66 EU/mL for anti-H1 stalk ELISA prior to vaccination. 4-fold increase defined as: For initially seronegative subjects, antibody concentration ≥ 132 EU/mL at post-vaccination. For initially seropositive subjects, antibody concentration at post-vaccination ≥ 4-fold the pre-vaccination antibody concentration.</description>

        <description>With respect to samples from the HA Group 1-related studies (i.e., with H1N1, H5N1,and H9N2 pandemic, and IIV4 seasonal, influenza vaccines), analysis was performed for measuring levels of anti-H1 stalk antibody by ELISA for all the subjects in the adult CCPan H5N1-001, the Q-Pan H1N1-019 and the Q-Pan H9N2-001 study cohorts. Percentage of subjects with at least 4-fold increase to anti-H1 stalk ELISA was calculated with 95% CI at each specified time point. seronegative subjects = concentration &lt; 66 EU/mL for anti-H1 stalk ELISA prior to vaccination. seropositive subjects = concentration ≥ 66 EU/mL for anti-H1 stalk ELISA prior to vaccination. 4-fold increase defined as: For initially seronegative subjects, antibody concentration ≥ 132 EU/mL at post-vaccination. For initially seropositive subjects, antibody concentration at post-vaccination ≥ 4-fold the pre-vaccination antibody concentration.</description>
