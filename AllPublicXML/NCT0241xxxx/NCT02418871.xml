    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the clinical outcomes of investigational
      FluidVision® Accommodating Intraocular Lens (AIOL) designed to provide distance,
      intermediate, and near vision in patients undergoing cataract extraction and intraocular lens
      implantation using an improved injector system.

    <description>Accommodative amplitude is a measure of the ability of the eye to focus from a target that is at distance into a target that is near with good visual acuity. Objective accommodation (at the IOL plane) will be assessed using data generated by a photorefractor that analyzes the change in the refractive state of the eye.</description>

        Key Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Eligible for primary intraocular lens implantation for the correction of aphakia
             following cataract extraction;

          -  Best corrected distance visual acuity worse than 20/40 either with or without a glare
             source present (e.g. Brightness Acuity Tester);

          -  Predicted best corrected distance visual acuity of 20/30 or better after cataract
             removal and AIOL implantation as determined by potential acuity meter (PAM) or other
             potential vision tests or surgeon estimation on both eyes;

          -  Less than or equal to 1.0 diopter (D) of preoperative keratometric astigmatism;

          -  Willing and able to comply with schedule for follow-up visits for 36 months after
             surgery.

          -  Other protocol-defined inclusion criteria may apply.

        Key Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Taking medications that may affect accommodation;

          -  Systemic disease that could increase the operative risk or confound the outcome (e.g.
             autoimmune disease, diabetes);

          -  Taking systemic medications that may confound the outcome or increase the risk to the
             subject;

          -  Ocular conditions that may predispose for future complications;

          -  Previous intraocular or corneal surgery that might confound the outcome of the
             investigation or increase the risk to the subject;

          -  Pregnant, lactating during the course of the investigation, or with another condition
             associated with fluctuation of hormones that could lead to refractive changes;

          -  Diagnosed degenerative visual disorders (e.g. macular degeneration or other retinal
             disorders) that are predicted to cause future best corrected visual acuity loss worse
             than 20/40.

          -  Other protocol-defined exclusion criteria may apply.
