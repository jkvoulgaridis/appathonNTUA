  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Emergency Department has been the standard location where patients with Sickle Cell
      Disease (SCD) go to seek care for the treatment of acute painful events. Vaso- Occlusive
      Crisis (VOC) is the most common complication of SCD,

      The purpose of this study is to compare patient centered outcomes for patients being treated
      for an uncomplicated VOC in Infusion Centers (IC) and Emergency Departments (ED) in four
      locations around the United States.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Emergency Department care is marked by long delays, lack of efficacy, and conflict. A
      sub-specialty Infusion Center staffed by expert clinicians and delivering individualized care
      can improve care quality while reducing costs. The study will examine whether care provided
      in an Infusion Center (IC) is more patient centered and efficient than care provided in an
      Emergency Department (ED) for adults with Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) and uncomplicated
      Vaso-Occlusive Crisis (VOC).

      Sites will prospectively enroll patients in VOC seen in participating centers from either the
      EDs or the ICs. Specific data from the acute visits (e.g. Times of arrival, time to first
      dose of analgesic, etc) will be captured. This study will compare: pain management,
      disposition of subjects (home or admission) and patient experiences of care delivery in both
      settings. Subjects will complete surveys/questionnaires to asses subjects' experiences in the
      setting where care was provided.

      The four sites to participate in the study are Baltimore, Maryland (Johns Hopkins Hospital),
      Cleveland, Ohio (Cleveland Medical Center), Milwaukee, Wisconsin (Medical College of
      Wisconsin), and Baton Rouge, Louisiana (Our Lady of the Lake Hospital). A maximum of 500
      subjects will participate in the study. Participants will be enrolled for 18 months.

    <description>Time is recorded from the time the patient arrives for pain treatment at either the ED or IC until the time the patient is dosed with pain medication administered parenterally. Guideline recommendations are that patients receive non-oral pain medication within 60 minutes of arrival.</description>

    <measure>Patient Reported Satisfaction With Care Received</measure>
    <time_frame>within 72 hours of acute visit</time_frame>
    <description>Survey to capture patient satisfaction with the quality of care in either the ED or IC. Validated a new tool to assess satisfaction with care in the acute care setting. The new tool was developed based on existing tools that assessed several domains: adequacy of pain management, communication with providers, interpersonal aspects of care, provider competence, involvement of family/friends, and access to care. The final 15 item validated Patient Satisfaction with Pain Management in Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) (PSPS) scale was used to compare satisfaction of care comparing ED to IC acute visits. Overall mean satisfaction scores ranged from 0-7 with higher scores signifying greater satisfaction</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Reported Perception of Risk From Visit</measure>
    <time_frame>within 72 hours of acute visit</time_frame>
    <description>One question on the survey asked patients to rate the overall level of medical safety they felt during their visit to the ED or IC. Choices for responses: Excellent, Very Good, Good, Fair or Poor. Excellent and Very Good were determined as having greater feelings of overall safety while patients who chose Good, Fair or Poor were determined having lesser feelings of overall safety.</description>

        Adult subjects with SCD inclusive of genotypes homozygous and compound heterozygous sickle
        hemoglobin. In the United States, SCD primarily afflicts African-American and
        Hispanic-American populations. Patients will be enrolled prior to a vaso-occlusive crisis
        and data will be collected from patients' acute visit(s) at either the Emergency Department
        or at an Infusion center (4 participating sites).

        <description>Survey to capture patient satisfaction with the quality of care in either the ED or IC. Validated a new tool to assess satisfaction with care in the acute care setting. The new tool was developed based on existing tools that assessed several domains: adequacy of pain management, communication with providers, interpersonal aspects of care, provider competence, involvement of family/friends, and access to care. The final 15 item validated Patient Satisfaction with Pain Management in Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) (PSPS) scale was used to compare satisfaction of care comparing ED to IC acute visits. Overall mean satisfaction scores ranged from 0-7 with higher scores signifying greater satisfaction</description>

          <title>Patient Reported Satisfaction With Care Received</title>
          <description>Survey to capture patient satisfaction with the quality of care in either the ED or IC. Validated a new tool to assess satisfaction with care in the acute care setting. The new tool was developed based on existing tools that assessed several domains: adequacy of pain management, communication with providers, interpersonal aspects of care, provider competence, involvement of family/friends, and access to care. The final 15 item validated Patient Satisfaction with Pain Management in Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) (PSPS) scale was used to compare satisfaction of care comparing ED to IC acute visits. Overall mean satisfaction scores ranged from 0-7 with higher scores signifying greater satisfaction</description>
          <population>207 participants completed the satisfaction survey after their first visit during the study time period.</population>

        <title>Patient Reported Perception of Risk From Visit</title>
        <description>One question on the survey asked patients to rate the overall level of medical safety they felt during their visit to the ED or IC. Choices for responses: Excellent, Very Good, Good, Fair or Poor. Excellent and Very Good were determined as having greater feelings of overall safety while patients who chose Good, Fair or Poor were determined having lesser feelings of overall safety.</description>
