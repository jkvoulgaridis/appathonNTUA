  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if Apixaban is safer than a Vitamin K Antagonist
      given for 6 months in terms of bleeding in patients with an irregular heart beat (atrial
      fibrillation) and a recent heart attack or a recent procedure to open up a blood vessel in
      the heart. All patients would also be taking a class of medicines called P2Y12 inhibitors
      (such as clopidogrel/Plavix) and be treated for up to 6 months. The primary focus will be a
      comparison of the bleeding risk of Apixaban, with or without aspirin, versus a Vitamin K
      antagonist, such as warfarin, with or without aspirin.

      Patients will be recruited from either inpatient coronary care or general medical units, or
      recruited from outpatient cardiology offices.

        <title>The Composite Endpoints of Death and Ischemic Events (Stroke, Myocardial Infarction, Stent Thrombosis, Urgent Revascularization) With Aspirin Versus no Aspirin</title>
        <description>Time to first death or ischenic event during the 6-month treatment period with aspirin or placebo.
N is the number of participants treated with aspirin or placebo.
n is the number of participants treated with aspirin or placebo with death or ischemic events in each treatment group during the 6-month treatment period.
Event rates are calculated based on the number of participants with death or ischemic events divided by the sum of the number of days from the first dose of study drug to the event date or censoring date and expressed as percentage per year.</description>
        <time_frame>Approximately 6 months</time_frame>
        <population>Participants randomized to aspirin or placebo.
Assessment is only for the Acetylsalicylic acid film coated tablet or Placebo matching Acetylsalicylic acid film coated tablet interventions.</population>
