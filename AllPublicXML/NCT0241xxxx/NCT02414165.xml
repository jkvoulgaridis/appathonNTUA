  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, open-label phase 2/3 study of Toca 511 and Toca FC versus
      standard of care that comprises Investigator's choice of single agent chemotherapy (lomustine
      or temozolomide) or bevacizumab administered to subjects undergoing resection for first or
      second recurrence (including this recurrence) of GBM or AA. Subjects meeting all of the
      inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria will be randomized prior to surgery in a 1:1
      ratio to receive either Toca 511 and Toca FC (Experimental arm, Arm T) or control treatment
      with one option of standard of care (Arm SOC). Stratification will be done by IDH1 mutation
      status. A second stratification factor is based on the patient's Karnofsky Performance Score
      (KPS) (70-80 vs 90-100). Further, to account for potential differences in treatment choices
      for the control arm in regions, the trial will be stratified by geographical region during
      the randomization process.

    <description>Toca 511 consists of a purified retroviral replicating vector encoding a modified yeast cytosine deaminase (CD) gene. The CD gene converts the antifungal 5-flurocytosine (5FC) to the anticancer drug 5-FU in cells that have been infected by the Toca 511 vector.</description>
