  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to assess the efficacy of virtual rehabilitation through the Virtual
      Reality Rehabilitation System (VRRS) versus traditional rehabilitation improving the
      functional outcomes after primary Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Following ethics approval by the Ospedale San Raffaele, 84 adults aged between 45 and 80
      years old will be recruited for the study, excluding people with unstable serious disease
      (e.g., heart or lung disease), previous orthopedics pathologies on the same side (e.g., hip
      arthroprosthesis), pregnancy and intake of psychotropic drugs.

      Patients who consent to participate in this study will be randomized into two rehabilitation
      groups after TKA: experimental (virtual rehabilitation) and control (traditional
      rehabilitation). In the experimental arm, subjects will undergo a virtual rehabilitation
      training during the post-surgical rehabilitation period, in addition to passive knee range of
      motion device (kinetec) and functional activity (stairs). In the control arm, subjects with
      similar demographic characteristics to those of the experimental arm, will undergo the usual
      physiotherapy rehabilitation, in addition to passive knee range of motion device (kinetec)
      and functional activity (stairs). Both control and study interventions will be provided 60
      minute daily session.

      General status of patients will be undertaken for the following outcomes at the baseline and
      10 days after surgery (at discharge).

      The primary outcome will be the visual analogue scale (VAS); the secondary outcomes will be:
      the disability knee assessed by the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities (WOMAC), the
      health related quality of life assessed by the EuroQol (EQ-5D), the global perceived effect
      assessed by the GPE score, the functional Independent measure assessed by the FIM
      questionnaire, the drugs assumption, the isometric strength of quadriceps and hamstrings
      assessed by dynamometer, the range of motion (R.O.M.) and proprioception assessed by VRRS.

    <description>The WOMAC measures five items for pain (score range 0-500), two for stiffness (score range 0-200), and 17 for functional limitation (score range 0-1700) for a total score of 2400 (0= no disability, 2400= highest disability):
Pain (5 items): during walking, using stairs, in bed, sitting or lying, and standing
Stiffness (2 items): after first waking and later in the day
Physical Function (17 items): stair use, rising from sitting, standing, bending, walking, getting in / out of a car, shopping, putting on / taking off socks, rising from bed, lying in bed, getting in / out of bath, sitting, getting on / off toilet, heavy household duties, light household duties</description>

    <measure>Health Related Quality of Life: Euro Quality of Life Five Dimensions Questionnaire (EQ-5D)</measure>
    <time_frame>assessed and reported at 10 days</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D comprises the following 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression.The EQ-5D descriptive system is divided into five levels of perceived problems: LEVEL 1: indicating no problem; LEVEL 2:indicating some problems;LEVEL 3: indicating extreme problems. EQ-5D health states can be summarised using the 5-digit code (e.g., 11111, 12311).The answers given to ED-5D permit to find 243 5-digit codes defining the health states.The 5-digit code are linked to an unique index derived by applying a formula that attaches values (weights) to each of the levels in each dimension.Weights depend on the country (Italian Population-Based Values of EQ-5D HealthStates,Scalone 2013).The index has been calculated by deducting the appropriate weights from 1 which is the best health status as highest score (i.e. the corresponding 5-digit code is 11111) and -0.38 for the worst health status as minimum score (i.e., the corresponding 5-digit code is 33333).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Global Perceived Effect (GPE)</measure>
    <time_frame>assessed and reported at 10 days</time_frame>
    <description>The GPE scale asks the patient to rate, on a numerical scale, how much their condition has improved or deteriorated since some predefined time point. The GPE was administered at the end of the physiotherapy treatment to measure the effect of the intervention on patients' health status perception. This Likert scale had five response options (5 = Very much improved; 4 = Much improved, 3 = No change, 2 = Much worse, 1 = Very much worse).</description>

    <description>The FIM scale assesses physical and cognitive disability focusing on the level of disability indicating the burden of caring for them. The total score is 126 (18=highest disability, 126=no disability).</description>

        <description>The EQ-5D comprises the following 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression.The EQ-5D descriptive system is divided into five levels of perceived problems: LEVEL 1: indicating no problem; LEVEL 2:indicating some problems;LEVEL 3: indicating extreme problems. EQ-5D health states can be summarised using the 5-digit code (e.g., 11111, 12311).The answers given to ED-5D permit to find 243 5-digit codes defining the health states.The 5-digit code are linked to an unique index derived by applying a formula that attaches values (weights) to each of the levels in each dimension.Weights depend on the country (Italian Population-Based Values of EQ-5D HealthStates,Scalone 2013).The index has been calculated by deducting the appropriate weights from 1 which is the best health status as highest score (i.e. the corresponding 5-digit code is 11111) and -0.38 for the worst health status as minimum score (i.e., the corresponding 5-digit code is 33333).</description>
