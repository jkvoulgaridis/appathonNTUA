  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will look into how topical treatment with synthetic Vitamin D3, calcipotriene
      ointment, used as standard of care, works in patients with morphea. Skin biopsies of morphea
      lesions before and after treatment with topical calcipotriene 0.005% ointment will be
      analyzed for changes in RNA and protein. A skin biopsy of unaffected skin will also be
      obtained and used for a control. This is an initial study to look at the molecular effects of
      topical calcipotriene on human morphea-involved skin. This study will look at the differences
      between affected and unaffected skin. This study also will look at clinical outcomes in
      morphea patients and determine if there are any clinical predictors for improvement with the
      medication.
