  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fevers raise the concern for serious bacterial infections in pediatric oncology patients
      receiving chemotherapy. The gold standard for diagnosing bacteremia (bacterial infection of
      the blood) is a blood culture. However, bacterial growth may not occur for 48 hours or there
      can be a false negative result.

      Thus, the biomarker, procalcitonin, has been investigated for its predictive ability to
      identify bacteremia earlier than blood culture. We believe that procalcitonin can assist in
      differentiating bacteremia from non-bacteremia infections in febrile pediatric oncology
      patients. A reliable predictor of bacteremia infections in pediatric oncology patients should
      decrease hospitalizations for fever and unnecessary antibiotic treatment.

      In our study we will measure procalcitonin levels in pediatric oncology patients presenting
      with fever. We will measure procalcitonin at the time of admission which is part of our
      standard of care for febrile pediatric oncology admissions. For the purpose of our study, we
      will additionally measure procalcitonin levels at 12 hours and at 24 hours post admission. We
      will examine procalcitonin levels at these three timepoints to determine if elevated
      procalcitonin levels predict bacteremia in pediatric oncology patients with and without
      neutropenia.
