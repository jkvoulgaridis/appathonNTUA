    <measure>Part A: Number of Participants With Abemaciclib Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline through Cycle 1 (Up to 21 Days)</time_frame>
    <description>A DLT was defined as one of the following adverse events (AEs), occurring in Cycle 1 if considered to be definitely, probably, or possibly related to necitumumab and abemaciclib: Grade 3 or 4 nonhematologic toxicity according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 4.0 (NCI-CTCAE v4.0), except for nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or electrolyte disturbance. Grade 3 or 4 nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea that persists more than 2 days despite maximal supportive intervention. Grade 3 thrombocytopenia with bleeding requiring transfusion. Grade 4 thrombocytopenia with or without bleeding. Grade 4 neutropenia that persists more than 5 days.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression Free Survival (PFS) Rate at 3 Months (Percentage of Participants With PFS at 3 Months)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to measured progressive disease or death due to any cause (3 Months)</time_frame>
    <description>PFS is defined as the time from baseline until first observation of progressive disease(PD) defined by response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) v1.1 or death from any cause.PD was at least 20% increase in sum of diameters of target lesions with reference being smallest sum on study and an absolute increase of at least 5 millimeter (mm) or unequivocal progression of non-target lesions,or 1 or more new lesions.If participant does not have complete baseline disease assessment,PFS time censored at date of randomization, regardless of whether or not objectively determined disease progression or death observed for participant.If participant was not known to have died or have objective progression as of data inclusion cutoff date for analysis, the PFS time censored at last adequate tumor assessment date.The use of new anticancer therapy prior to occurrence of PD resulted in censoring at the date of last radiographic assessment prior to initiation of new therapy.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants Who Achieve Best Overall Tumor Response of Complete or Partial Response (Objective Response Rate [ORR])</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to measured progressive disease or start of new anti-cancer therapy (up to 21 months)</time_frame>
    <description>ORR was the percentage of participants achieving a best overall response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1. CR defined as the disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and no appearance of new lesions. PR defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameters (LD) of target lesions (taking as reference the baseline sum LD), no progression of nontarget lesions, and no appearance of new lesions. PD was at least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, with reference being the smallest sum on study and an absolute increase of at least 5 mm, or unequivocal progression of non-target lesions, or 1 or more new lesions. Confidence intervals are based on Clopper-Pearson method.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With a Best Overall Response of Complete Response (CR), Partial Response (PR), and Stable Disease (SD) (Disease Control Rate [DCR])</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to measured progressive disease or start of new anti-cancer therapy (up to 21 months)</time_frame>
    <description>Disease Control Rate (DCR) is defined as the percentage of participants achieving a best overall response of stable disease (SD), PR, or CR. DCR used the same denominator as defined in ORR. Among participants counted in the denominator, the numerator counted those with a confirmed best tumor response of SD, PR, or CR per RECIST v1.1. Confidence intervals are based on Clopper-Pearson method.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Survival</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to date of death from any cause (24 Months)</time_frame>
    <description>Overall survival (OS) is defined as the time from the date of study enrollment to the date of death from any cause. For each participant who is not known to have died as of the data -inclusion cutoff date for a particular analysis, OS was censored for that analysis at the last known alive date.</description>

      <pre_assignment_details>The study has 2 parts (Part A and Part B). Part A is a dose-escalation study to determine the recommended dose of abemaciclib in combination with necitumumab Part B (expansion cohort). Completers completed the 2 cycles, with required assessment, had progressive disease or died due to any cause, alive and on study at conclusion but off treatment.</pre_assignment_details>

        <description>ORR was the percentage of participants achieving a best overall response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1. CR defined as the disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and no appearance of new lesions. PR defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameters (LD) of target lesions (taking as reference the baseline sum LD), no progression of nontarget lesions, and no appearance of new lesions. PD was at least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, with reference being the smallest sum on study and an absolute increase of at least 5 mm, or unequivocal progression of non-target lesions, or 1 or more new lesions. Confidence intervals are based on Clopper-Pearson method.</description>

        <description>Disease Control Rate (DCR) is defined as the percentage of participants achieving a best overall response of stable disease (SD), PR, or CR. DCR used the same denominator as defined in ORR. Among participants counted in the denominator, the numerator counted those with a confirmed best tumor response of SD, PR, or CR per RECIST v1.1. Confidence intervals are based on Clopper-Pearson method.</description>

          <title>Percentage of Participants With a Best Overall Response of Complete Response (CR), Partial Response (PR), and Stable Disease (SD) (Disease Control Rate [DCR])</title>
          <description>Disease Control Rate (DCR) is defined as the percentage of participants achieving a best overall response of stable disease (SD), PR, or CR. DCR used the same denominator as defined in ORR. Among participants counted in the denominator, the numerator counted those with a confirmed best tumor response of SD, PR, or CR per RECIST v1.1. Confidence intervals are based on Clopper-Pearson method.</description>
          <population>All enrolled participants who received at least one dose of study drug and had evaluable ORR data in cohorts 1, 2 and 3.Cohort 2 includes total number of participants in Part A and evaluable participants of Part B.</population>
