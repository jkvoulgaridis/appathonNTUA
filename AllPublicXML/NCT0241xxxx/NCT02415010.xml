    <textblock>
      The objective of this Post-Market Clinical Follow-up (PMCF) is to confirm the performance and
      safety of the Codman Enterprise® 2 when used in conjunction with endovascular coil
      embolization of ruptured or non-ruptured intracranial aneurysms.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject ≥ 18 years old.

          2. Subjects with non-ruptured or ruptured intracranial aneurysm that is referred for
             endovascular treatment.

          3. Parent vessel with a diameter of ≥ 2.0 mm and ≤ 4 mm.

          4. Subject understands the nature of the procedure and provides voluntary written
             informed consent in accordance with the requirements of this study protocol.

          5. Subject is willing to participate in the telephone follow-ups and to return to the
             investigational site for the post-procedure follow-up evaluations.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Angiogram demonstrating that the aneurysm is not appropriate for endovascular
             treatment (i.e.: severe intracranial vessel tortuosity, stenosis, intracranial
             vasospasm not responsive to medical therapy).

          2. Mycotic or traumatic aneurysm.

          3. Arteriovenous malformation (AVM) in the territory of the target aneurysm.

          4. Two or more aneurysms (&gt;2mm) in associated distribution.

          5. Hunt and Hess Scale (HHS) of IV or V at inclusion for subject with ruptured aneurysms.

          6. Life expectancy of less than 6 months as determined by the treating physician.

          7. A planned staged procedure (i.e. a procedure where entire treatment with the devices
             (e.g. coils/stents) is completed over separate sessions).

          8. Previous neuro-interventional or neuro-surgical procedure of any kind within 30 days
             prior to the study procedure.

          9. Intracranial mass (tumor, abscess, or other infection), or undergoing radiation
             therapy for carcinoma or sarcoma of the head or neck region.

         10. Unsuitable for the antithrombotic and/or anticoagulant therapies

         11. Serum creatinine level &gt; 2.5 mg/dl within 7 days prior to index procedure

         12. Known hypersensitivity or allergies to cobalt, nitinol metal, nickel, or sensitivity
             to contrast media,

         13. Evidence of an acute myocardial infarction (MI) within 30 days prior to the index
             procedure.

         14. Uncontrolled atrial fibrillation or known cardiac disorders likely to be associated
             with cardioembolic symptoms.

         15. Subject is pregnant
